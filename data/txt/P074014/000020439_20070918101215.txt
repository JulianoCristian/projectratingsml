1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income of US$160
for its population of 71 million people in 2005. Its poverty results from a number of structural
factors including geographical isolation, extreme vulnerability to weather shocks, health hazards
(HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB), lack of infrastructure, rapid population growth, and extreme
environmental degradation. These factors have combined to lock substantial parts of the
population in a poverty trap.

1.1.2    Ethiopia's population is predominantly rural (80%), and within this segment, over 87%
depend on subsistence agriculture. Rural incomes are low, highly variable, and subject to
climatic shocks. For instance, the severe drought of 2002-03, which put 14 million people at the
risk of starvation, is feared to have led to increased levels of food insecurity, as transitory victims
of drought liquidated their assets to survive.

Economic Growth, Poverty, and Human Development

During 2001-02 to 2004-05, there are many positive trends to be seen in terms of economic
growth, poverty reduction, human development, and in the financial and private sectors.

1.1.3    Overall Economic Growth and most Macroeconomic Indicators have shown positive
trends in recent years. Ethiopia has experienced average per capita GDP growth of 2.8% per
annum since new economic and administrative reforms began in 1992-93. This was in sharp
contrast to an average negative growth of 1% per annum during 1974-91 under the preceding
Derg regime. However, the growth was erratic during most of the reform period, with GDP
growth averaging 7% in the first five years, but averaging only 1% per year since. More recently,
after experiencing a contraction in growth from its worst drought in 20 years, and large declines
in the terms of trade for key commodities, particularly coffee, Ethiopia's real rate of growth rose
from -4.0 percent in 2002-03 to 9.6% in 2005-06, owing to a substantial recovery by the
agricultural sector which grew by 13.4% in 2004-05 and 11.2% in 2005-06. Most important
macroeconomic indicators have shown a positive trend between 2001-02 and 2005-06 as shown
below.

1.1.4   Poverty has decreased significantly in recent years. Compared to 1999-2000, poverty
head count, poverty gap, and poverty severity indices have declined substantially. The 2004-05
poverty head count index is lower than the index for 1999-2000 by 12% while the poverty gap
and severity indices are lower by 30% and 40%, respectively indicating a substantial decline in
poverty during the five-year period ending 2004-05.

1.1.5   Budget Shares allocated to Pro-Poor Spending have risen steadily. The shares of pro-
poor sectors in total government expenditures have risen significantly from 43 percent to 62%
between 2001-02 and 2005-06, with the relative emphasis remaining approximately the same
across education, health, roads, and water and sanitation, while that for agriculture and food
security rose slightly, mainly in response to the drought of 2002-03.

1.1.6    There is evidence of increasing private sector activity and improving financial sector
performance. Private investment as a share of GDP increased from 9% to 10.7% between 2001-
02 and 2002-03. All banks, including the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), disbursed 52%
more fresh loans reaching 9.4 billion Birr in 2004-05 compared to 6.2 billion Birr a year earlier -
reflecting continued strong economic growth. Nearly 86% of the fresh loans went to the private
sector. Also by 2004-05, the share of private banks in the total banking system deposits reached
25.3%, and accounted for 49% of new loan disbursements. Non-performing assets decreased
marginally by 0.7% in 2004-05, relative to the previous year.

1.1.7 Indicators for Health, Education, and Basic Services show significant positive trends.
Key indicators of household welfare and service delivery have risen rapidly in the past decade,
though not enough to be on track to for meeting the MDGs. Extreme stunting of children less
than 5 years of age has decreased from 44% to 31% from 1995 to 2000. Gross primary enrolment
nearly doubled from 33% in 1990-01 to 79.8% in 2004-05. Infant mortality rate declined from
113/1000 to 77/1000 between 2001-02 and 2004-05. The percentage of rural population within
1.5 km of a water source (and within 0.5 km for urban areas) increased from 23% to 35% (rural)
and 74% to 80% (urban) during 1990-01 to 2004-05. The total road network rose by about 17%
from 33,297 km in 2001-02 to 37,018 km in 2004-05. The overall HIV prevalence rate was 8.6%
in 2004-05 against a target of 10%.

Economic and Administrative Reforms.

Since the early 1990s, Ethiopia has seen three phases of economic and administrative reform
addressing, among others, public institutional governance; rural development and vulnerability,
investment climate and private sector development; and human development including education
and health. Co-ordinated progress in all these areas is needed for generating pro-poor growth.

1.1.8    Early 1990s ­ decisive movement towards a federal system. Ethiopia began a series of
economic and administrative reforms in the early 1990s, launching an ambitious structural and
state transformation. Reforms were launched in agriculture, PSD, and emphasis was placed on
primary education and health services in rural areas. The state also moved decisively towards a
federal system of ethnically based regional states (with zones, woredas ­ or districts ­ , and
kebeles as lower local governments) with responsibility for a broad range of political, social and
economic objectives. Further, GoE developed an inter-governmental fiscal system to meet both
its service delivery and local empowerment objectives and pursued a policy of "balanced regional
progress" through use of formula-driven block (or sectorally un-earmarked) transfers.

1.1.9    Late 1990s ­ increased political, fiscal, and administrative decentralization. In an
ambitious second phase of political reforms, GoE launched political, fiscal and administrative
decentralization of four of its most populous regions (Amhara, Oromia, SNNP and Tigray), to
bring decision-making closer to the people and to improve responsiveness of service delivery (e.g.
health and education).

1.1.10 Since 2003 (coinciding with SDPRP) -- Agricultural Development-Led
Industrialization (ADLI) together with emphasis on private sector development. Ethiopia's
third phase of state transformation coincided with the launch of the country's Sustainable
Development and Poverty Reduction Plan (SDPRP/PRSP: 2003), through which GoE promoted
ADLI, while acknowledging the need for explicit efforts at PSD. It was recognized that
agriculture requires technical progress, output diversification, and greater market interaction. The
goal was to go beyond subsistence farming to small-scale oriented market agriculture.

Structural/Sector Background

Public Sector Institutional Framework.

1.1.11 GoE's public sector reform programs aimed to re-order state-society relations. GoE
deepened its efforts to run a range of public sector reform programs to re-order state-society
relations in parallel including (i) a woreda (district level) decentralization program; (ii) municipal
reform efforts designed to restructure and empower urban centers; (iii) reformulated civil service
reforms focused increasingly on strengthening the public sector fiduciary framework and service
delivery results on the ground; (iv) nationwide initiatives to enhance connectivity and develop e-
government applications such as the woreda- and school-net projects; (v) efforts to strengthen
formal checks and balances and accountability mechanisms through reform of the justice system
including the courts, law-making and law enforcement institutions, and the legislative process;
(vi) reform of urban land legislations, and (vii) an ongoing tax systems reform program that
continues to align tax policy and administration at the federal and regional level with the demands
of Ethiopia's evolving macro-fiscal policies.

1.1.12 Since 2003, there was relatively greater emphasis on improving government
performance. Around the year 2003, GoE's public sector reform priorities shifted ­ from
stabilizing public management systems following rapid decentralization (such as the efforts
supported under PRSC I) to promoting performance across tiers of government. The changing
performance orientation in Ethiopia's capacity building efforts was relevant to three broad sets of
prevailing public management constraints on SDPRP goals: (i) the need for adequate fiscal
instruments and incentives to meet the investment and recurrent needs of decentralized service
delivery in municipalities and woredas; (ii) organizational performance barriers that weaken the
formal private sector investment climate, and (iii) the need to maintain the integrity of public
financial management systems and manage emerging fiduciary risks. In the third and final year of
the SDPRP cycle (2004), it was envisaged that the focus of public sector reform efforts would
increasingly focus on accountability and governance issues, while consolidating gains in
performance orientation.

Agriculture, Rural Development and Vulnerability.

1.1.13 Ethiopian agriculture remains low-input, low value and subsistence oriented.
Supporting 85% of Ethiopia's population, the agricultural sector represents just under 45% of
GDP. The aggregate figures mask large regional variations: people in some high potential areas
do better, while in the chronically food insecure regions, incomes are lower and more volatile as a
result of which up to 10% of Ethiopia's population needs annual income or food aid in order to
survive.

1.1.14 GoE's multi-pronged agricultural strategy encouraged expansion to new lands,
increased productivity, commercialization, and new markets for agriculture. GoE
developed a multi-pronged and balanced rural development strategy. It sought to encourage
exploration and expansion onto new lands while also focusing on raising the productivity of
existing farms (through continued focus on technology generation and transfer, soil and water
conservation, and the intensification and commercialization of smallholder agriculture). It called
for expanded production of food crops but also sought to promote commercial and export
oriented production. Diversification of livelihoods and exports via increased livestock production
was also part of the strategy. And it developed ambitious proposals for irrigation development but
also maintained a central and strategic focus on rain-fed farming, which would be the mainstay


                                              -16-

for the foreseeable future. Public sector investments in capacity building (applied training in
agriculture) for the rural population, agricultural research, and agricultural extension became
cornerstones of the GoE's strategy to increase productivity and profitability in the farm sector.
The rural sector (composed primarily of small private sector enterprises - e.g., farms and small
businesses) stood to benefit substantially from an improvement in the overall investment climate.
Also a priority was the development of institutions to enable the emergence of financial markets
and provide support for private sector investments in rural areas. Progress on land certification
and cadastral systems was slow. GOE revitalized a Food Security Program with several
components, including voluntary resettlement to new land, and the shift away from reliance on
annualized emergency appeals to a more stable, predictable and development-oriented safety net
program financed via cash.

Private Sector Development, Financial Sector, and Privatization

1.1.15 The outlook for PSD remained constrained due to continued dominance of the
public sector, restrictions on foreign investment, poor infrastructure, and low credit
availability for aspiring entrepreneurs. Ethiopia continues to be in transition from a system in
which the state was heavily involved in almost all production and distribution activities, and there
retains a heavy influence of the state and political parties in the market. Key sectors that greatly
influence the productivity of business -- wholesale and retail trade, banking, telecommunications
and transportation -- are closed to foreign investment or dominated by state firms. Firms,
especially small and micro enterprises, have limited access to adequate transport services,
information, education, and financial services, creating an inadequate base on which to build
economic empowerment. The capacity of firms themselves is limited by their relative youth and
lack of skills in comparison to firms in Ethiopia's competitors in the global marketplace. Where
entrepreneurship exists it is small in scale and often not innovative, as Ethiopian entrepreneurs
are hesitant to go into nontraditional areas of production, which they perceive as too risky,
typically investing instead in activities with low risks and low returns.

1.1.16 .... but some positive trends were also evident. There are several positive trends to be
noted in PSD. The investment climate has improved during the first two years of the SDPRP --
the Economic Freedom Index, published annually by the Heritage Foundation, noted in 2004 that
Ethiopia offered the second-most-improved business environment in the world. One sign of the
improvement is the sharp rise in investment licenses, partly due to the reduced cost and time
required to register a business. Private investment as a share of GDP increased from 9 to
10.7 percent between 2001-02 and 2002-03. New FDI increased from $105 million in 2001-02 to
189 million in 2002-03. Promising new sectors such as horticulture have registered strong growth.

1.1.17 The financial sector suffered from dominance by public sector banks, excess
liquidity and high level of non-performing assets, even as private banks made inroads. Lack
of access to financing remains a critical constraint to private sector development, and ultimately
to Ethiopia's economic growth and poverty alleviation. Beyond traditional loans, no specific
medium or long-term financing is available, as no leasing, long-term debt or equity markets exist
in the country. Rural financing instruments also remain limited -- although microfinance
institutions (MFIs) are growing fast (50 percent growth in lending volumes in 2003-04), the
volume of operations of these relatively new institutions is still quite low as a proportion of
financing needs. At the same time, there is significant excess liquidity in the banking system.
CBE has faced difficulties for some time and has a large amount of non-performing loans
(35 percent in 2004, down from 50 percent in 2003). Deposits in private banks as a share of total
deposits, and the share of credit extended by the private banks increased have improved in recent
years. Progress has been achieved on competition, and on improving the financial sustainability


                                               -17-

of the system. There are at present six small private banks competing with the State owned
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) and Construction
and Business Bank (CBB), the latter three institutions accounting for almost 80 percent of
deposits as of 2004.

Human Development

1.1.18 Despite progress in social sectors, efforts needed to be sharply scaled up if the gap
vis-à-vis MDGs is to be narrowed. Since the advent of the new regime in 1991, Ethiopia has
escalated its public spending in the social sectors and has seen significant progress in key social
indicators, especially in education. Yet, recent analysis indicates that progress needs to be sharply
accelerated if the MDGs are to be met. Issues constraining primary service delivery in education
and health are related to sectoral policies and also weaknesses in the cross-cutting areas of public
expenditure management systems.

1.1.19 In education, despite sharp growth in primary education enrolment, the quality of
education and school infrastructure lag behind. Despite impressive growth in gross primary
enrollment, Ethiopia's low primary completion rates point to a delivery system that is marked by
high wastage in the form of low school completion rates; over-crowding and lack of instructional
materials; insufficient numbers of qualified teachers, especially at the secondary level;
infrastructure inadequacies and high construction costs; and widely different enrollment and
dropout rates and quality of facilities between urban and rural areas. At $16,000 per classroom
block -- well above Sub-Saharan Africa norms -- more attention needs to be paid to school
locations and new, lower cost designs for facilities.

1.1.20 The health sector is characterized by low funding, unequal urban-rural coverage,
and scarcity of health workers.... The health sector in Ethiopia is characterized by low levels of
per capita public funding and low levels of population coverage. Inequities exist in terms of
outcomes and utilization rates between rural-urban areas, income levels, and regions. Although
utilization rates of health services vary based on income levels, absolute utilization rates are still
low across all income quintiles. There is a scarcity of trained health workers at various levels.
For instance, reducing the maternal mortality ratio will require an increase in the availability of
skilled health professionals who can perform clinical services, particularly skilled deliveries but
also basic emergency obstetrical care.

1.1.21 ... but marginal increases in expenditure can yield very significant results. Recent
analytical work via the Country Status Report for Health indicates that small marginal
expenditure increases on outreach, prevention, and behavior change programs can make a large
impact on reducing infant and child mortality rates.

1.1.22 To make headway on nutrition, institutional roles needed to be clarified. Until
recently there was no clear institutional framework for multi-sectoral coordination of nutrition
activities. While the FMOH notes that a purely health sector intervention will not be sufficient to
achieve better nutrition outcomes, the lack of clear institutional leadership for a framework to
address malnutrition has been seen by many as a binding constraint to making progress. Given
the very high child malnutrition levels in Ethiopia, FMOH's coordination of food availability,
child health services, and nutrition-related education services will play an important role.

1.1.23 HIV/AIDS increased rapidly in the 1990s, and presents a major challenge. The
prevalence of HIV/AIDS increased rapidly during the 1990s, and Ethiopia is currently classified
as a country with a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic. By the end of 2001, there were 2.1 million


                                              -18-

children and adults in Ethiopia living with HIV/AIDS. About 6.6 percent of the adult population
in 2001 was estimated to be affected by HIV/AIDS. Although Ethiopia constitutes only 1 percent
of the world's population, it contributes 7 percent of the world's HIV/AIDS cases, and in terms of
the number of infected persons, Ethiopia ranks fifth after South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and
Zimbabwe in SSA. It is also estimated that 1 million out of an estimated 3 million orphans in
Ethiopia are the result of AIDS-related adult deaths.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

From the above discussion, it is evident that Ethiopia faces multiple developmental challenges of
a large magnitude, with significant crosscutting features and linkages. To address these issues
in a systematic manner, GoE developed and began implementing a well-conceived and
comprehensive Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Plan (SDPRP) for the period
2001-2005. While SDPRP began to show positive results in its first two years of implementation,
GoE clearly lacked the resources for scaling up the effort to a higher level. The Bank and other
Donors were prepared to increase their assistance to the country, but GoE faced potential
limitations in being able to coordinate and absorb the assistance efficiently. Further, the SDPRP
strategy cut across several functional areas and sectors, and was not always adequately served
well by sector-specific projects. Also, the nature of interventions under SDPRP required the
assurance of medium to long-term involvement. All these factors provided the rationale for
concessional assistance through a programmatic credit instrument with joint budget support by
the Bank in concert with other donors.

1.1.24 Ethiopia needed to scale up its developmental efforts, and build on the initial
promise of SDPRP..... To make significant progress towards the MDGs, Ethiopia needed to
greatly scale up its efforts and commit greater resources to the task. For example, analytical work
carried out under the FY03-05 CAS showed that recurrent expenditures on education would need
to double in order for Ethiopia to meet the MDGs. While GoE's growth strategy (Agriculture
Development-led industrialization or ADLI) was expected to spark demand for industrial goods
and therefore drive the development of the manufacturing sector, this process would take time to
be realized, given that growth in agricultural output thus far had been due to an expansion of
cultivated area and not through productivity increases. The challenge of pro-poor growth also
include the effective delivery of public services, and fostering PSD. Continued gains in
strengthening governance reform and institutional capacity building efforts were important in and
of themselves, but also in order to make progress on the broader development agenda. In its first
two years of implementation, SDPRP showed tangible progress on all fronts, but much more
needed to be done.

1.1.25 .....but lacked the resources for the task. Progress in the first two years of SDPRP had
helped increase absorptive capacity, but neither producers nor consumers had achieved the gains
needed to sustain longer run growth, boost demand for industry, and spur structural
transformation of the economy. Therefore, there was little room for raising resources internally
such as through taxation. At the same time, Ethiopia's debt and debt service indicators remained
particularly sensitive to the terms of new borrowing and export shocks, and therefore, the country
needed to rely on grant financing with prudent new borrowing on highly concessional terms. In
this context, the PRSC series was expected to play a central role in deepening the policy dialogue
around the SDPRP, harmonizing additional external support to lower transaction costs, and
channeling it to the local level where services need to be expanded most. The principle of scaling
up of assistance to Ethiopia has been supported by the Bank's Board, the MDG Task Force, the
OECD's MDG meeting, in discussions between the Bank and the EU and DFID, and by the G-8
(in the context of famine prevention).


                                              -19-

1.1.26 GoE displayed strong ownership and commitment to SDPRP. The SDPRP was
prepared and owned strongly by GoE. GoE was pro-active in working with the Bank and donors
to produce a focused and actionable program matrix with largely measurable performance
indicators, based on the much larger SDPRP agenda. In 2003, an IEG (formerly OED) evaluation
of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process in Ethiopia1 found strong government
ownership, broad alignment of the Bank and donor program with the SDPRP, and progress in key
areas of the program.

1.1.27 The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY03-05 endorsed a programmatic
approach in assistance to Ethiopia. The FY03-05 CAS proposed a measured shift away from
traditional project-based lending toward a PRSC series, to address policy reforms and finance
essential investments and services across various themes, while retaining investment projects as
an important part of the portfolio. The programmatic approach of the PRSC series would provide
predictable support to GoE at the macro level by supporting its medium term reform program,
while ensuring earmarked financing for primary service delivery across education, health, water,
etc through the decentralized fiscal decision-making structure down to the woreda level,
empowering woredas, and reinforcing their ability to make appropriate choices.

1.1.28 Joint Budget Support along with Donors was expected to improve coordination and
utilization of aid. PERs and evaluations of Sector Development Programs have documented the
relatively weak utilization rates of capital budgets financed through project aid, while capital
budget utilization rates under the public budget were higher. This feature is largely thought to be
driven by government capacity constraints in managing multiple donor financing and reporting
rules characterizing project aid. PRSC and donor Joint Budget Support (JBS) instruments address
this constraint by harmonizing around, utilizing, and enhancing the Government's own fiscal and
financial management systems. Given the large fiscal needs in terms of both recurrent and capital
financing at local levels, the PRSC/JBS would enable flexibility in addressing both types of
resource needs in a balanced way. Finally, the PRSC/JBS focuses on alignment with the
Government's planning and financing cycles, as well as promoting a common policy agenda
across multiple development partners. This was expected to help translate the harmonization
agenda into simplified procedures and reduce transactions costs for GoE. .

1.1.29 Progress made under PRSC I set the basis for PRSC II.... The progress made by GoE
under PRSC I in implementing the policy and institutional reform agenda (discussed in detail
under sections 2.1 and 3.2), justified the continuation of Bank support to the SDPRP through
PRSC II using the JBS mechanism. JBS operations played a key catalytic role in consolidating
and operationalizing a harmonized approach to policy dialogue and public financing. Evidence to
this effect includes the following. First, as input into the annual dialogue and decision-making
process on PRSC/JBS, a common framework for monitoring public expenditure issues was
agreed via a Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) and a review of public financial management
systems through an Annual Fiduciary Assessment (AFA). Second, since the approval of PRSC I
in mid-February 2004, Government and PRSC/JBS partners have made further clarifications on
the alignment of the JBS/PRSC cycles to the SDPRP/Ethiopian budget cycles. Sector review
mechanisms in education and health have also been re-aligned to ensure better feedback loops
with the newly introduced financial calendar. Third, the first cycle of PRSC/JBS preparation

realized the potential for reduced transactions costs for Government of external resource
mobilization.

1.1.30 .... And similarly, progress made under PRSC II set the stage for PRSC III
preparation and appraisal. Similar to the situation prior to PRSC II, the progress made by GoE
under PRSC II in implementing the policy and institutional reform agenda (discussed in detail
under sections 2.1 and 3.2) justified the continuation of support to the SDPRP through PRSC III.
Extensive preparatory work for PRSC III was carried out by the Bank together with Donors and
GoE. By then, budget support for Ethiopia had matured over the PRSC I and II period. GoE
acknowledged the need for deepening policy engagement in the context of scaling up, and agreed
to a number of measures to achieve this. GoE stated that in the spirit of genuine partnership, they
were committed to exchange information (budget, plans, policies) in a timely manner, and
similarly, partners would indicate the status of their aid commitments and provide technical input
in a timely way. GOE would review with partners the SDPRP indicators as input for the SDPRP
II (later PASDEP) matrix, to improve the ability of all to assess performance on an agreed, and
more objective basis. It was further agreed that the JBS discussions and associated sector reviews
or assessments would be undertaken year-round and used by both sides as opportunities to
exchange information and achieve better development outcomes. The PRSC operation was
suspended after PRSC II, for reasons explained in the next paragraph. However, by the time this
decision was taken, and in the following period, considerable progress was made on many fronts
in the matrix of actions that had been prepared in anticipation of PRSC III. This progress is show
for various policy areas in Annex 7.

1.1.31 Due to unexpected adverse developments in political governance, the Bank and
donors agreed to suspend PRSC operations after PRSC II.... but after subsequent review,
followed up with the Protection of Basic Services project to maintain continuity. While
Ethiopia's performance on growth and human development has been strong in recent years,
political tensions that arose in the wake of 2005 elections underlined significant risks to the
development process. These adverse developments caused the Bank and Donors to suspend
support for the PRSC program, and temporarily slowed the momentum towards the program's
medium-term objectives. However, after reviewing the situation (e.g. through the Development
Assistance Group meeting in Paris in March, 2006) and noting GoE's ongoing commitment to the
developmental agenda, and the imperative to continue support for the ultimate beneficiaries, the
Bank and Donors resumed support for service delivery through the Protection of Basic Services
(PBS) project (P074015). The PBS builds on many of the instruments and approaches developed
under JBS, the JBAR and donor harmonization, to name the key building blocks.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

Original PDOs

The PRSC series was planned as a series of one tranche operations over three years to align the
policy agenda supported by the Bank with national policy priorities in SDPRP/PRSP. The series
covered a wide range of cross-cutting and sectoral reform issues to help achieve simultaneous
progress in multiple areas towards the SDPRP goals/MDGs. The development objectives of each
PRSC were linked within a rolling programmatic series that jointly aimed to consolidate progress
in implementation of the SDPRP's multi-faceted reform program; support progress on the
harmonization and financing alignment agendas; and develop the policy matrix to update and
extend the rolling three-year planning framework to include the outer year.



                                              -21-

1.2.1    Specifically, the development objectives for PRSC I and II were:

PRSC I: To support the implementation of the SDPRP by:
    · strengthening the focus on planning and budgeting processes including through the
         provision of a framework within which interested multi-sectoral program and budget
         supporter donors can participate;
    · stabilizing the public sector during a period of rapid transformation in order to maintain
         pro-poor expenditures;
    · and improving the investment climate (including for the rural sector)

PRSC II: To support improvements in:
    · the investment climate
    · governance and service delivery; and
    · vulnerability;

Indicators

1.2.2    The above PDOs were organized into four "thematic areas" and reflected in a program
action matrix, whose structure was common to both PRSC I and II:

     I. Public expenditure and institutional performance;
    II. Rural development and vulnerability;
   III. Private and financial sector development; and
   IV. Human development

1.2.3    There were a number of actions to be carried out under each thematic area (described in
detail in Section 2.1 on Program Performance) contributing to higher level goals that are listed
below for each theme. The outcome indicators corresponding to the thematic goals are listed
in section F ("Results Framework Analysis") for each theme are indicated in separate tables
under section 3.2.

                   Theme                                               Goals

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

1.3.1   There were no sharp swings in the broad coverage of PDOs between PRSC I and II.
None of the PDO or key indicators were revised for PRSC I or PRSC II. However, the scope and
timing of a few of the supporting actions for PRSC II were modified on the basis of basis of
progress under PRSC I, without materially affecting the overall program. These changes are
considered to be well within the bounds of "flexibility for the bank to take into account
exogenous developments, the actual pace of implementation of the policy program, the lessons
arising from implementation on the ground, and any possible improvements on the original policy
program."2


1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

1.4.1   As mentioned in section 6.2, the policy actions and indicators in the program matrix are
organized into four "thematic areas". Actions across the themes were expected to reinforce each
other to achieve overall developmental results. The "bolded" or prior actions for various policy
areas for PRSC I and PRSC II are summarized below for each theme:

1.6 Other significant changes

Changes in Design and Scope

1.6.1    There were no significant changes in the design and scope of the program, as agreed to
before credit effectiveness. However, the original trigger contemplated for PRSC I under Theme
III (PSD) was postponed to a prior action for PRSC II. This was a pragmatic response to a
situation where there was no clear momentum established in PSD at the time of PRSC I
effectiveness. This was also in line with the thinking that expected prior actions for a subsequent
operation in a programmatic series need not be identical to the triggers; they can be adapted to
changing circumstances, or modified for better clarity, specificity, or measurability. As
concluded in an OPCS study3, such flexibility allows the Bank to take into account the actual
pace of implementation of the policy program, the lessons arising from implementation on the
ground, and any possible improvements on the original policy program.

Linking Scale of Credit to Performance

1.6.2    The Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) of two operations -- the Ethiopia
Emergency Recovery Credit and the Ethiopia Structural Adjustment Credit -- pointed out that an
appropriate balance needs to be struck -- especially in the framework of a PRSC -- between
rewarding the implementation of good policies, signaling the need for better progress, and
meeting urgent budgetary financing needs. This lesson was internalized through a flexible
approach to finalizing the amount of funds in this PRSC series, asnd carried out in the following
manner: The Bank announces a range for the size of the PRSC tranche when the Government
budget is finalized (in the case of PRSC I, US$120 to US$l50 million), which the Bank commits to
disburse around the second quarter of the EFY if the overall performance under the PRSC is
judged to be satisfactory. The exact amount is determined based on performance. This approach
allowed Bank disbursements to be more predictable in terms of timing, while at the same time
providing incentives for good performance. Applying this principle, PRSC I provided a US$120
million IDA grant versus a potential amount of US$l50 million, due to lack of progress relative to
initial expectations in respect of PSD and privatization, and rural growth.

1.6.3    PRSC II also adopted the principle of linking the size of the credit to performance. It was
the assessment of the Bank's staff that overall performance under the PRSC II program was
satisfactory, especially on governance and decentralization, social services, reducing vulnerability,
and in some areas related to private sector and rural growth (such as actions on privatization,
urban land, and rural credit). However, actions to foster rural growth were not as fast as expected,
and the telecom action plan (which PRSC I had envisaged as a bolded action for this operation,
but ultimately dropped) was considered inadequate because it did not contain an adequate
financing plan or policy moves to help sustain its very ambitious goals. In view of this
assessment, the PRSC II amount proposed was US$130 million instead of the originally planned
US$ 150 million.




3On an average, 60% of original triggers are fulfilled and converted to prior actions of the follow-on
operations. A smaller share of triggers are partially fulfilled or modified and then converted into prior
actions; 27% in the case of IBRD loans and 12 percent in the case of IDA loans. However, 22% of triggers
in IDA loans are not converted to prior actions. (World Bank. 2005. Review of World Bank Conditionality.

Program Schedule and Funding Allocation: Suspension of PRSC operations after the Second
Tranche.

1.6.4          While Ethiopia's performance on growth and human development has been
generally strong in recent years -- including the years following the commencement of the PRSC
program -- political tensions that arose in the wake of 2005 elections underlined significant risks
to the development process. Official results from the first openly contested elections in the
country's history held on May 15, 2005, showed a victory for the ruling party, but also large gains
for the opposition, especially in the capital of Addis Ababa. Observers noted numerous electoral
irregularities, while the opposition claimed victory. Large demonstrations in June and November
of 2005 resulted in loss of life and mass arrests of demonstrators, journalists and opposition
leaders. In view of the social unrest and deterioration in political governance, the Bank and
donors suspended direct and general budget support and no further PRSC operations were
approved. Given that no further PRSC operation was sent to the board for 24 months after PRSC
II became effective, the PRSC series was considered to have lapsed on December 1, 2006, as per
current guidelines.

                       US$130 million

Program performance under each theme and policy area is summarized in terms of the Policy
Matrix below. Practically all the "bolded" or prior actions were fully achieved. Of the non-
bolded actions, the vast majority were fully or mostly achieved, with delay in some cases.

While the reform program under the PRSC/JBS series was expected to make steady and
demonstrable progress each year on all important fronts, the state and structural transformation
agenda that Ethiopia has embarked upon was expected to require several years to fully unfold.
It may also be noted that all these actions were part of a sequence of actions that were planned to
yield results over the originally planned four-tranche PRSC program, and beyond. Hence, it is to
be expected that progress might be uneven across different policy areas, for which sufficient
flexibility was provided in the PRSC as originally envisaged.

    2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

    A number of factors affected project implementation positively, while some affected it negatively.
    Among the positive factors were the early and continuous engagement of the project team with
    the borrower; time and effort invested in the preparation and appraisal process; the pro-active
    response from the borrower and resulting synergies; and co-operation from Donors. Among the
    negative factors were the adverse developments in political governance that resulted in the Bank
    and Donors deciding to suspend operations for the PRSC program after the second tranche;
    insufficient commitment on part of the borrower for liberalizing the telecom sector, and to some
    extent in respect of commercializing agriculture and developing rural markets; and some delay in
    completing some ESW products (e.g. CEM. Poverty Assessment) that could have better informed
    the project design and implementation process.

    Factors affecting project implementation positively

    2.2.1    The major factors affecting project implementation positively are highlighted below.
    Many of these factors are dealt with in more detail under in Section 3.1 ("Relevance and
    Design").

  i.    Early and continuous engagement with the borrower by a multi-disciplinary Bank
        project team including a large complement from the Country Office. The project team
        included experts from different thematic groups, engaged early with their government
        counterparts and kept up a steady pace of interaction. The high involvement of country office
        staff allowed close interaction with counterpart officials and allowed prompt follow-up of
        issues and M&E.

 ii.    Time and effort invested in project design and appraisal. The project team invested a
        large amount of time and effort (the project was more than an year in the making) in
        synthesizing the rationale and content of the project. This included intense interaction with
        GoE and other stakeholders, drawing lessons from previous projects; conducting
        workshops/discussions; and bringing in valuable international experience. (see Section 3.1
        under "Relevance")

iii.    Pro-active response and commitment from the borrower. The borrower was pro-active
        throughout the preparation and design process, and also rose to the challenge of producing an
        actionable matrix of actions with outcome indicators, from the much larger set of issues
        raised in the SDPRP. (see Section 3.1 under "Relevance")

iv.     Donor Co-operation. Donor cooperation with the Bank and GoE, and the substantial time
        and effort invested in the process of harmonizing aid efforts and developing the JBS and
        related M&E mechanisms, contributed to greater focus on the PDOs, and increased
        efficiency and impact through lowering transaction costs and better alignment with GoE's
        financial calendar. (see Section 3.1 under "Design")

 v.     Strong Analytical underpinnings. The PRSC program drew upon a rich array of
        AAA/EWS product that provided the factual and analytical basis for project design. (see
        Section 3.1 under "Design")




                                                  -38-

Factors affecting project outcomes negatively

1. Adverse developments in political governance. Adverse developments in political
    governance following the 2005 elections caused the Bank and Donors to suspend support for
    the PRSC program, and temporarily slowed the momentum towards the program's medium-
    term objectives. However, after a re-assessment of the circumstances (e.g. DAG meeting in
    Paris in March, 2006: see Section 2.4), the Bank and Donors resumed support for service
    delivery through the PBS project, opening the door for renewed engagement in selected
    thematic areas addressed by the PRSC.

2. Insufficient progress in some areas such as telecommunication reform,
    commercialization of agriculture and developing rural markets. There was not much
    movement forward on telecommunication reform, in terms of the Bank's understanding of
    GoE's commitment in its Letter of Development Policy. Also, efforts at commercialization
    of agriculture in terms of marketing of inputs and produce, and consolidating rural land
    tenure could have shown better results.

3. Timing of some AAA/ESW products. Some important AAA/ESW products, such as the
    CEM and Poverty Assessment were completed later than planned. To that extent, the design
    and implementation of PRSC may have benefited less than expected.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The policy-based nature of PRSC/JBS support necessitated a results framework that assessed
progress towards SDPRP goals over the medium-term on the one hand, and annually
monitorable policy actions and output indicators on the other. There are multiple dimensions to
the results framework on which progress has been achieved to different extents: (i) strengthening
of the M&E system throughout GoE through an M&E action plan; (ii) an accountability
framework for service delivery, including "opening up the matrix" to sub-national tiers and a
reward structure for the PRSC/JBS. Also, The World Bank and other JBS partners have worked
closely on various mechanisms for M&E including the Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR),
Annual Fiduciary Assessments (AFAs), Annual Performance Reviews (APR)s of SDPRP (now
PASDEP), and Sector reviews. IGR was a key analytical instrument for supporting the state
transformation process and M&E for the overall public sector reform program. Also, a
beginning has been made by NGOs for monitoring the quality of public service delivery. The
progress made under each of these complementary M&E efforts is discussed below:

2.3.1   M&E Action Plan mainstreamed M&E in MOFED and individual sectors. GoE
began to strengthen its capacity for M&E, based on a "Strengthening SDPRP Monitoring and
Evaluation Action Plan" presented to donors and civil society in a May 2004 workshop. Elements
of the plan included hiring and training staff in the relevant MOFED units, increasing
participatory aspects of monitoring and evaluation (initially through a Participatory Poverty
Assessment), creating an Integrated Management Information System (MIS) at the Welfare
Monitoring Unit in MOFED, strengthening statistical capacity in the Central Statistical Authority
(CSA) including establishment of a Socio-Economic Database, strengthening the results
framework of the SDPRP, and improving reporting on SDPRP indicators in APRs. The Bank
(through an Institutional Development Fund Grant) and other donors -- including the United
Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, UNDP, and the EU -- committed resources to support the plan.
Efforts were made to upgrade the M&E systems in individual sectors. Support for improving
M&E is one of the supporting actions under the program action matrix (action 1.9 of the program


                                              -39-

matrix; Section 2.1) which, among others, sought to strengthen the capacity of the Central
Statistical Authority (CSA) for M&E.

2.3.2    Accountability framework for service delivery: Development of a bottom-up
information feedback mechanism is underway. The bulk of primary service delivery is at the
sub-national, and even sub-regional level by woredas and municipalities, with a primary
accountability framework via the inter-governmental structure which has specific functions
assigned to each tier. Work has begun under the Civil Society Capacity Building operation for
building accountability and information feedback loops at the local service provider community
levels to improve primary service delivery for education and health.

2.3.3    Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) serves the need to track budget allocations in
the context of programmatic budget support. The Joint Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) is a
key element of the ongoing planning and budget cycle. This is the instrument that replaced the
series of Public Expenditure Reviews that had traditionally been undertaken by the Bank which,
together with the proposed AFAs (see next para), assumed larger importance in the context of the
shift in development assistance to programmatic budget support. The JBAR's primary objective is
to review budget allocations -- at the sectoral, sub-sectoral, regional and local levels -- in terms of
the links to national growth, poverty and human development outcomes as laid out in the SDPRP;
and improve information and predictability on expected resource flows; give decision-makers a
better sense of where money is going, and how it is being spent; and to better inform macro-level
discussions. A first round of the JBAR discussions took place in May 2004, focusing on the
MEFF and Federal level draft budget for FY 2004-05. The second and much more detailed round
of the JBAR discussions took place during the September 2004 Appraisal of the PRSC/JBS.

2.3.4    Annual Fiduciary Assessments (AFAs) help standardize reviews of expenditure
management systems in the decentralized woreda context. Fiduciary review processes were
adapted to the new environment of woreda decentralization and the shift to programmatic/ budget
support in an increasingly harmonized environment. AFAs are intended to consolidate and
replace the varied reviews of expenditure management systems in Ethiopia, including the aspects
of the PER related to institutional and inter-governmental fiscal design issues, as well as the
Country Financial Accountability Assessments (CFAAs) and Country Procurement Assessment
Reports (CPARs). The AFAs are key inputs into the Joint Budget Support decision cycle and
serve as the vehicle for due diligence on financial accountability and procurement procedures.
The first such review was due to be completed by end-2004. This work is still in progress.

2.3.5    Annual Progress Reports (APRs) for SDPRP/PRSP: First APR released in 2003;
second is under preparation. The first Annual Progress Report (APR) of the SDPRP was
released in 2003, based on which budget support was released. The WB-IMF Joint Staff
Assessment (JSA) of the APR recommended that the next APR should include more details on:
measures to accelerate private sector and financial development, progress with rural development;
food security; population policy and land reforms; efforts to rationalize the gaps between SDPRP
program costs and likely available financing; costs of new initiatives such as resettlement and
safety nets; decentralization strategy especially addressing the adequacy of block grants to sub-
national levels of government relative to service delivery needs. Finally, JSA noted the need for a
stronger M&E system. An Interim APR provided in September 2004 included the following:
update on the macroeconomic framework; presentation of trends in public expenditures ­
backward and forward looking -- at a level of disaggregation consistent with and based on tables
prepared for the JBAR; update on the poverty and human development indicators drawn from the
PA and other recently available studies. GoE undertook to complete the second APR, which
would include findings of AFA, studies conducted by GoE (e.g. macroeconomic growth


                                              -40-

scenarios), recent analytical work from partners (e.g. country status reports for education and
health by WB), and MDG needs assessment studies. MDG and APR analysis was taken into
account in the in preparation of SDPRP II (PASDEP).

2.3.6   Sector reviews are semi-annual mechanisms to help align sector needs with the
budget cycle. The existing semi-annual sector review mechanisms (e.g. in health, education,
PSCAP, Roads) were continued to improve their efforts to better align with the budget support
cycle. This helps assess performance with respect to the sectoral indicators and actions for each
round of PRSC/JBS. Efforts are ongoing to explore ways in which to further streamline and
deepen the relationship between the sector development groups and budget support.

2.3.7   NGO involvement in M&E has made a significant start. The newly formed Poverty
Action Network (PAN) -- with support from UNDP -- has brought together a range of civil
society representatives to assess the quality of public service delivery and discuss how CSOs and
NGOs can work with the Government to progress towards the MDGs, and has conducted a
Citizen's Report Card exercise where approximately 2000 households were interviewed to solicit
their perceptions of effectiveness of services in primary education and primary health.4

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

After assistance to the PRSC program was suspended due to unforeseen developments in political
governance, the Bank and Donors moved quickly to prevent likely severe consequences for the
poor and the possibility of roll-back of hard-won results in education, health, and nutrition
through PRSC I and II, by approving the Protection of Basic Services (PBS) project (May 2006;
Total (Bank and Donors): US$528m).

2.4.1   A DAG Review Meeting held in March, 2006, reviewed the situation following
suspension of the PRSC prorgam. Following the suspension of support to the PRSC program
in 2005 (see Section 1.6), the members of the Development Assistance Group (DAG) met in Paris
in March 2006 to identify a set of shared principles to guide donor engagement in Ethiopia,
particularly in regard to governance. All DAG partners indicated their wish to remain engaged in
a long-term development partnership to support progress toward the MDGs. While the partners
agreed that PASDEP is central to achieving the MDGs and more rapid economic growth, partners
noted that their endorsement of PASDEP, and mobilization of sustained financial support, would
depend on Ethiopia's progress on governance.

2.4.2   Importance of adapting the mix of aid instruments to the evolving situation was
stressed.. DAG members noted that the dialogue with GoE on governance issues must be open,
and should reach out to a wide group of Ethiopian stakeholders including civil society and the
private sector in order to begin to rebuild trust. In terms of modalities for DAG members to
deepen support for governance, partners noted the need to adapt the mix of aid instruments to
enhance predictability while aligning with Government systems to support areas such as basic
services, public sector management and institutional capacity building, food security, and
infrastructure. The meeting noted the importance of moving ahead quickly with the Protection of
Basic Services (PBS) project in order to protect pro-poor service delivery and enhance
accountability.

2.4.3    Protection of Basic Services (PBS) Project was launched to maintain continuity of
the achievements in the PRSC program. In the light of likely severe consequences for the poor
and the possibility of roll-back of hard-won results in education, health, nutrition, etc., the Bank
and other development partners rapidly designed and made available support for the protection of
basic services in education, health, agriculture and water. The Protection of Basic Services (PBS)
project (May 2006; Total Amount: US$528 million: Bank: US$215m; DfID: US$297m; CIDA:
US$16m; Ireland: US$1m; Other multilaterals/bi-laterals (AfDB, EC, KfW, Netherlands):
US$4m) seeks to protect basic services provided at the sub-national levels, where most primary
and secondary services are financed and provided in Ethiopia's decentralized system, and ensure
that they are conducted in a fair, transparent and accountable manner. Thus, this project provides
the valuable continuity needed for the multi-pronged reform process and service delivery
improvement that was already set in motion by PRSC I and II. There is growing confidence
among development partners in PBS as a viable instrument to support basic service delivery.
Enjoying strong donor collaboration from the outset, the PBS now has a total of nine international
agencies working together, with different partners at different stages of overall financing approval
for the project.

2.4.4    Other recent projects/non-lending assistance or those in the pipeline including the
Nutrition SWAP also serve to provide continuity to one or more of the PDOs of the PRSC
program. These are described in Section 3.1 under "Design".

2.4.5    While endorsing the PBS, Donors also pointed out the need to resume
programmatic support, if only on a smaller scale to begin with. At a meeting requested by the
ICR preparation team, and attended by the representatives of DfID and SIDA (December 14,
2006), the donors pointed out that the PBS addresses service delivery and transparency, makes
the government more accountable to donors, is insulated from political shock, and improves the
flow of regional data. They also noted that the design of PBS benefited from DSA
(Decentralization Support Activity -- USAID) and EMCP. At the same time, the Donors felt that
alongside PBS, a new start can be made with a PRSC or similar instrument, perhaps on a smaller
scale than before to begin with.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Relevance

The relevance of the PRSC was anchored by (i) alignment with the Country Assistance Strategy
and (ii) strong analytical underpinning from diverse AAA/ESW.

3.1.1    The PRSC program was aligned with the CAS, which in turn drew upon the salient
themes of SDPRP. The last CAS (FY03-05) for Ethiopia was based on Ethiopia's SDPRP/PRSP.
It found the SDPRP/PRSP strategy to be sound and appropriate for addressing MDGs, and
growth and poverty reduction in general, while being backed by strong country-ownership and a
credible implementation process. The first two years of SDPRP, which preceded PRSC I,
witnessed tangible progress in improving absorptive capacity and notable improvements in the
policy framework, despite a severe drought and concerns about debt, and the border issue with
Eritrea. The FY03-05 CAS focused on three pillars of SDPRP: pro-poor growth (urban and
rural); institutional development and capacity building; and reducing vulnerability. Further, the

first two PRSC themes are drawn from the SDPRP's Enhanced Rapid Economic Growth theme,
the third is drawn from the Improved Human Development theme, and the fourth wasdrawn from
the Improved Public Sector Institutional Performance theme.

3.1.2          The CAS (FY03-05) noted favorable initial conditions for programmatic
assistance. CAS FY03-05 also noted favorable initial country conditions for using a
programmatic financing instrument such as the PRSC to implement the SDPRP strategy in
deepening the policy dialogue around the SDPRP, harmonizing the additional external support to
lower transactions costs, and channeling it to the local level where services need to be expanded
most. These conditions included a credible budget process; continuous efforts to improve the
predictability of resource flows to sub-national levels responsible for primary service delivery and
reducing reporting lags on actual expenditures; and acceptable fiduciary performance despite the
strains on the public financial management system arising from decentralization. Also,
strengthening public sector system and capacity as a strategic area for Bank support was clearly
underlined in several analytical reports5, as indicated in the next para.

3.1.3          Strong Analytical underpinnings: The design and content of the PRSC program
was validated by the findings emerging from a strong analytical program in Ethiopia aided by the
Bank and donors, covering several PERs, a CFAA, CPAR, Risk and Vulnerability Assessment,
poverty analyses, diagnostics in various sectors, etc. which identified the key development
constraints to the SDPRP strategy. A more comprehensive list of AAA/ESW that informed the
PRSC program is given below:

3.1.4   An MDG Needs Assessment and Strategy study addressed the policies necessary for, and
constraints in achieving the MDGs in Ethiopia, under plausible macroeconomic scenarios. The
IGR was a key analytical instrument to support the Government's state transformation process
with benchmarking surveys and a focus on M&E of the performance of the overall public sector
reform program. A Rural Development Review contributed to a better understanding of the
factors affecting agricultural productivity and the development of more effective agricultural

markets. The Bank completed an Investment Climate Assessment for Ethiopia. The Bank has also
completed a comprehensive analysis of determinants and policy trade-offs related to basic
education outcomes via analytical outputs that included the Education Country Status Report and
the Higher Education Study. However, some of the AAA/ESW products, such as the CEM and
PA could have better informed the PRSC preparation process had they been finalized earlier.

Design

The following aspects of PRSC design helped to improve coordination between the Bank, Donors
and GoE in working towards the various objectives under the four thematic areas; provide
resources in a timely manner; and to ensure that the results across thematic areas would be
mutually reinforcing:

    · Aligning the PRSP (SDPRP/PASDEP) implementation process with the Macro-Economic
        and Fiscal Framework (MEFF) planning process and the annual budget preparation
        process.
    · Developing donor harmonization arrangements in cooperation with the borrower and
        instituting Joint Budget Support (JBS) and the Joint Budget Assistance Review (JBAR)
    · Linkages with other projects and non-lending services to extend the impact and reach of
        the PRSC program
    · Enabling the borrower to develop better coordination mechanisms among different units
        of the government and to better appreciate the interlocking nature of the reform process

3.1.5   Aligning PRSC implementation with the Budget Cycle. An important feature of the
PRSC program was to gradually shift the timing of PRSC support over successive tranches in
order to be better aligned with the Government budget cycle by PRSC IV. To accomplish this,
the original plan was to have PRSC II would disburse around November-December 2004 (which
was accomplished); PRSC III around September 2005; and PRSC IV round July 2006. However,
during PRSC II appraisal, GoE indicated its preference to stabilize the timing of the PRSCs, and
budget support in general, as it stood for PRSC II. Its reasons were: a) in the interest of
predictability of resource flows within any given Ethiopian Fiscal Year (EFY), disbursements
would be desirable within the second quarter of the EFY since public sector cash flow
requirements tend to peak following the second quarter; and b) the current schedule was
consistent with allowing the APR's diagnostics and discussions on policy directions to occur at
the beginning of the annual Poverty Reduction Strategy, budgeting, and budget support cycles in
January rather than at the end of these cycles. MOFED also indicated that the precise alignment
of funds availability to the start of the fiscal year was less important than the predictability of the
financing even if the amounts were only indicative. The Bank and Donors concurred with this
approach.

3.1.6   The central role of Donor Harmonization and Joint Budget Support. In the context
of the overall harmonization agenda, substantial progress was made in aligning the Bank's
programmatic support delivered through the PRSC series with donors' budget support. At the
outset, members of the donor community had different areas of focus and approaches towards
policy issues. GoE had its own concerns about multiplicity of donor objectives and transaction
costs in dealing with them. The process of harmonizing donor objectives and budget support thus
entailed a lot of time and effort on part of the Bank team, and is a major achievement of the
PRSC program.




                                                 -44-

         First, a programmatic budget support group -- which previously existed informally -- was
         integrated within the overall partnership architecture of the Development Assistance
         Group (DAG)6 to liaise closely with DAG sector working groups. Second, PRSCs and
         donors' budget support operations were prepared through a common process with
         synchronized timetables and missions, and a common matrix of actions and indicators
         drawn from the SDPRP. This process included the World Bank, African Development
         Bank, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Finland, Germany, Ireland,
         Netherlands, and Sweden. The amount of programmatic budget support was $250 for
         PRSC I (Bank: $120m; Donors: $130m) and $347 million for PRSC II (Bank: $130m;
         Donors: US$217m).

         Second, the clearer definition of the "JBS group" as well as identification of the sub-set
         of the SDPRP policy matrix which constitutes the areas of focus for budget support
         purposes helped GoE and JBS donors alike in structuring the policy dialogue within a
         framework of mutual accountability. GoE also asked JBS partners to provide to MOFED
         early, specific and firm commitments of JBS resource flows to enable the Government to
         plan its budgets and service delivery on the basis of more predictable resource flows.

         Third, The JBS partners and GoE produced a draft Memorandum of Understanding
         (MOU) to codify lessons drawn from the first and second rounds of JBS and also serve as
         a code of conduct for donors and GoE. GoE pointed out the importance of donors making
         multi-annual commitments, the need for donors to align with the financial calendar, as
         well as the relation between the MOU and bilateral agreements between the development
         partner and GoE. On the latter point, GoE emphasized that the MOU might transform
         into a less useful document if bilateral agreements continue to specify additional
         processes and regulations in addition to what is stated in the MOU.

3.1.7    Linkages with existing Projects and Non-Lending Services greatly enhanced the
reach and impact of the PRSC program. The PRSC program was complemented by the Public
Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP), which provided funds for capacity-building; as well
as several other projects which helped extend the reach and impact of the PRSC program7, as
detailed below:




6The Development Assistance Group (DAG) ­ which is co-chaired by the World Bank and the UNDP -
met regularly with Government as the SDPRP was being prepared, with the result that a DAG Joint Partner
Review of the SDPRP was prepared in conjunction with the JSA. Also, as one of the three pilot countries
in the Initiative for Harmonization of donor Policies, Procedures and Practices, GoE reaffirmed its
commitment to the harmonization process in the context of the High Level Forum held in Rome in
February 2003, and agreed on a new partnership architecture which includes a harmonization task force and
a secretariat in MoFED.

7ICRs of two operations -- the Ethiopia Emergency Recovery Credit and the Ethiopia Structural
Adjustment Credit came up with the lesson that TA should accompany the adjustment program in Ethiopia
to ensure that institutions have the capacity to implement new policies and legal frameworks.

          PSCAP8 ($100m million; FY04), offered a model for harmonization through its sector-
          wide approach. Unlike the traditional sector development programs, PSCAP has been
          defined as a federal specific purpose program, which provides resources to regions in
          addition to their consolidated block grant or "subsidy". In addition, PSCAP resources --
          which are allocated on the basis of need -- are disbursed on the basis of performance and
          reallocated on a semi-annual basis to high performers. Finally, this particular SWAP is
          aligned with GoE's planning and budgeting cycle and is subject to a single monitoring
          and evaluation framework with harmonized reporting and review mechanisms. Several
          multilateral and bilateral donors have joined the Bank in pooling resources through
          PSCAP, and the approach is expected to be adopted by other programs including a
          proposed consolidate capital transfer that would also provide fiscal additionality to
          woredas and municipalities to meet their service delivery investment needs.

          The Pastoral Community Development Project ($30 million grant; FY03), aims to
          empower pastoral communities to better manage local development, improve
          infrastructure, increase and diversify incomes, increase access to public services, and
          reduce the risk from drought and other natural disasters. A Food Security Project (US$85
          million; FY02) supports household asset development in chronically food insecure areas.
          A consensus has now emerged among partners that the shift to a new system of safety
          nets warrants development financing in a SWAP-mode, to which the Bank is contributing
          via an APL for the Productive Safety Net program (FY05).

          PSD Capacity Building project ($24 million; FY05) addresses the important weaknesses
          in the human and institutional capacity of the private sector. The Information and
          Communications Technology-Assisted Development Project ($25 million; FY05)
          supports the GoE's plans to allow Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to resell ETC's
          bandwidth, and for private firms to provide rural telephone service.

          The Post-Secondary Education Credit ($40 million; FY05) is designed to improve quality
          and standards of non-agricultural technical and vocational training and improve the
          management and quality of instruction of universities. The Bank supported GoE in
          strengthening the analytical basis for policy-making and reforms through the Health
          Country Status Report. IDA continues to provide support through the Multisectoral
          HIV/AIDS project, and has worked with the GoE and municipalities to strengthen
          outreach efforts to youth. Work is also continuing to increase the mainstreaming of
          HIV/AIDS interventions across the Bank's portfolio of operations, and the roads and
          education sectors are best practices in this regard.

3.1.8     Intensive use of Inter-ministerial Working Groups greatly improved coordination,
and the coherence of the program. GoE has viewed the SDPRP as an important opportunity to
articulate and provide leadership to its longstanding development program to both internal and
external constituents. In order to reduce the many actions detailed in the SDPRP to a more
manageable number, GoE established four inter-ministerial working groups to develop matrices
for each of the four main themes contained in the SDPRP/PRSP. The quality and pace of inputs
from these groups varied. In some key cross-cutting areas, such as PSD and rural development,
GoE required considerable time to develop the strategies by themselves. At the time of the PRSC



8The Capacity Building for Decentralized Delivery Project (CBDSD, $26.2 million; FY03) preceded and
laid the foundation for the delivery of the Bank's flagship PSCAP project.




                                                  -46-

I appraisal mission, the SDPRP/PRSP matrix contained an unwieldy 449 indicators (40 outcomes,
289 outputs, and 120 actions). Through discussion with the Bank and other donors, GoE was
able to identify a subset of indicators for the PRSC and budget support purposes, reducing the
policy matrix to 127 indicators (31 outcomes, 58 outputs, and 38 inputs or reform measures). The
major criteria used in selecting the subset of budget support indicators were annual measurability,
attribution to government actions, and reflection of broader reform progress. The result was a
much more manageable policy matrix that identified key priority actions that are linked to
monitorable outcome indicators and that reflect strong government commitment and ownership.

An OPCS assessment9 notes that Ethiopia stands out as a good example of where the
government led an iterative process of identifying a subset of indicators from its own PRSP
policy matrix to establish a common framework for all budget support programs, including the
PRSC.

IMPLEMENTATION

Two aspects of implementation are discussed here ­ (i) Risks that were identified and mitigating
actions that were taken; and (ii) Actions for adhering to the Bank's Safeguard Policy.

Risks

3.1.9    Four major risks were identified and addressed to the extent possible: (i)
predictability of donor flows; (ii) fiduciary risks; (iii) slow implementation of PSD/financial
sector measures; and (iv) country political risk. Several risks were identified during
preparation of PRSC I and II, and measures were taken to mitigate their effect, based on the
understanding of the risk at that time. PRSC I identified four principal risks: predictability of
donor flows to the federal government and timely availability of funds at service delivery, for
which cabinet approval of the MEFF and the issuance of indicative planning figures to regions
were established as prior actions, strict adherence to the financial calendar was prescribed, and
one-off costs of decentralization were sought to be separately identified and financed so that no
undue demands were made on funds meant for service delivery; fiduciary risks -- particularly
with regard to the pace of preparation, consolidation and auditing of financial information, for
which a financial program incorporating recommendations from the CFAA was undertaken10,
with donor assistance for capacity building through PSCAP, and from WB through CBDSD;
slower than planned implementation of the PSD/financial sector development measures, which
was sought to be mitigated through TA and the PSD Capacity Building project to address
technical deficiencies in designing competition policy and telecom liberalization, while engaging
with GoE to ensure their ownership and commitment to the proposed actions; Country political
risk, mainly the potential risk for re-emergence of conflict with Eritrea, which was considered
less likely, given that three years had passed since hostilities ended, and defense spending has
dropped significantly.

3.1.10 Additional risks arose during implementation and were addressed: (i) enforcement of
resettlement guidelines; (ii) retaining skilled workers; (iii) congestion effects of multiple
programs; and (iv) insufficient civil society involvement. With the exception of the pace of
PSD/financial sector actions, the above risks proved reasonable, but additional risks arose as the
program progressed to PRSC II. These included weak enforcement of guidelines for
resettlement/access to the new land program, for which stronger safeguards, better information
flows to and among re-settlers, an early warning system against non-adherence to standards,
improving government capacity, and law enforcement consequences for those not adhering to
program guidelines were proposed; developing and retaining skilled workers, for which GoE
undertook to prepare a white paper on remuneration policy, and improve the quality of higher
education (with assistance through the Post-Secondary Education Project); congestion effects of
several programs involving local service cadres (e.g. health extension workers, teachers,
agriculture extension agents), which would be addressed through multiple efforts including the
joint budget dialogue, restructuring and performance management efforts under ongoing civil
service reform, and upgrading of skills through training efforts; absence of demand-side
pressures from civil society and citizens, for which the social assessment under PSCAP pointed
out the need to create space for non-partisan public discourse, and which is aided by the civil
society program, though its benefits were not expected to accrue for some time.

3.1.11 Adverse developments in political governance proved difficult to anticipate for both
the Bank and the Donors. While the border issue with Eritrea was considered a potential risk,
the gradual improvement in democratic governance in Ethiopia during recent years gave little
cause to anticipate the adverse developments in political governance that followed the May 2005
national elections. Neither the Bank nor the Donor community considered such events to be very
likely to occur. Eventually, a DAG meeting in Paris in March, 2006, identified a set of shared
principles to guide donor engagement in Ethiopia, particularly in regard to governance. All DAG
partners indicated their wish to remain engaged in a long-term development partnership to
support progress toward the MDGs, but noted that mobilization of sustained financial support,
would depend on Ethiopia's progress on governance.

Bank Safeguards

3.1.12 Required actions for PRSC's "B" category Environmental Assessment (EA) Rating
were fulfilled by the Country Environment Assessment (CEA). The project has been defined
as a Sectoral Adjustment Credit with a "B" rating for purposes of environmental assessment.
This rating requires an Environmental Assessment that analyzes and makes recommendations on
measures to strengthen the overall institutional framework as well as on the capacity building
needs of key environmental organizations within GoE. This requirement was met through the
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) which was launched in April 2003 by the Ethiopian
Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in close collaboration with the World Bank and DFID,
and completed prior to PRSC II. The CEA looked at Ethiopia's institutional capacity for
sustainable environmental management at the federal, regional, woreda, kebele and community
levels, based on a literature review; field research covering all regions, about 25 woredas, 15
kebeles, and several communities; and discussions with a broad range of stakeholders. The
CEA's recommendations focused on mainstreaming environment into development policies and
sector programs; establishing incentives and conditions for enhanced environmental governance
and accountability; and focusing on decentralized support for environmental management. At the
federal level, the CEA recommended that priority be given to implementation of new
environmental legislation to establish environmental capacity and units in key agencies under the
coordination of the EPA; enhancing the role of the recently re-established Environmental
Protection Council for strengthening policy co-ordination; and improving the environmental


                                               -48-

assessment framework. The recommendations also covered incentives and conditions for
enhanced environmental governance and accountability through improved environmental
information management (including the improvement of environmental data quality, use of
environmental indicators to support decision making, and public awareness building), and the
roles of public, private and non-governmental sectors. Finally, the recommendations focused on
decentralized support for environmental management by strengthening vertical links between the
various levels, and enhancing the capacity of woredas and kebeles for environmental
management.

3.1.13 GoE and the regions took actions to strengthen institutions and policies on the basis
oc CEA recommendations. In response to the CEA recommendations, GoE has made progress
in strengthening the institutional capacity for environmental management, including enactment of
an environmental proclamation and implementation guidelines and standards at the federal level
on environmental protection institutions, environmental impact assessment, and pollution control.
Two Regions, Oromiya and Amhara, have passed similar laws at the regional level. In addition,
all Regions have established institutions for environmental management.

3.1.14 Likely environmental effects of PRSC actions were addressed suitably, or suitable
arrangements were made, as applicable. Of the prior refors supported by PRSC I and II, eight
actions -- including passage of the Procurement Proclamation, financial calendar and performance
budgeting, reduction of the audits backlog, urban land reforms, school construction design
options, and the telecommunications, fiscal decentralization , and rural and micro-finance
strategies ­ none are expected to have any negative environmental impact. Further, there are no
existing environmental problems that are expected to be exacerbated by these reforms. Possible
environmental risks associated with the prior action on privatization supported by PRSC II were
sought to be addressed through a mitigation plan that included the categorization of public
enterprises slated for privatization based on the potential environmental impact of their transfer to
private ownership. The Bank, as part of the preparation of the proposed Private Sector
Development Capacity Building project, is assisting GoE in this process. The Productive Safety
Nets program, a prior action for PRSC II, includes a community `public works' component aimed
at developing communal infrastructure and assets in areas of chronic food shortage. The Program
is expected to serve around 262 woredas, in which public works will be conducted over a five-
year period. The public works activities may include, for example, hillside terracing, soil and
water conservation, land reclamation, improvement of roads or bridges, improved access to water,
or repair of health facilities. In the case of pastoralist areas, it is to be expected that projects may
include development of water points, rehabilitating pasture lands, building access roads, build
market sites, agro-forestry, or initiatives related to livestock. While it is acknowledged that many
of the public works will themselves be intended to rehabilitate the natural resource base, it is
equally important that such projects be well designed and executed to ensure that undesirable
environmental impacts are avoided or mitigated. CIDA and the World Bank have assisted the
Government in the production of a global Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) for the Program that sets out in simple terms guidelines for avoiding environmentally
problematic project designs or locations, and gives a list of measures to mitigate risks.

3.2.2    During the PRSC I and II period, macroeconomic indicators showed a significant upward
trend. Real GDP growth rose from a negative -3.8% in 2002-03 to 9.6% in 2005-06, though this
recovery owes much to a rebound in agricultural growth after a drought-hit year. Income poverty
fell significantly from 44% in the year 2000 to 40% in 2004-05. Almost all other outcome (and
some output) indicators showed improvements during the PRSC period, as discussed below.

3.2.3    It needs to be kept in mind that it is difficult to assess to what extent the outcome
indicators can be attributed to efforts undertaken under PRSC I and II. Along with the PRSC
program, other Bank projects covering several sectors and other donors' activities, apart from
GoE's increased efforts for development can be reasonably expected to have contributed to the
results. However, the outcomes are on the lines anticipated by the analytical framework of the
PRSC program. To that extent, the PRSC program is considered to have contributed to the
outcomes. Outcome indicators, to the extent that they are available, are summarized below in
terms of the main themes addressed by the PDOs. This is followed by a discussion of the policy
actions that underpinned the outcomes, for each PDO for PRSC I and II

Policy Actions/ Implementation underpinning the outcomes

3.2.5   A new financial calendar was adopted, a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MEFF) was approved; and a new Budget Information Software (BIS) was rolled out to most
federal units. A new chart of accounts was adopted, and backlogs in accounts and audits were
cleared upto 2003-04, after some delay. Enabling legislation to assign expenditure and
revenue responsibilities to municipalities was enacted in the 4 main regions and in Addis
Ababa. The Information and Communication Technologies Development Administration
(ICTDA) was established with multiple prospective areas of applications for government
administration, service delivery, private sector development and sectoral applications in health,
education etc., though the details of implementation were still to be worked out. GoE adopted a
new Procurement Law, and followed up with institutional changes and training.

Policy Actions/ Implementation underpinning outcomes

3.2.7   The PSCAP program was established as a performance-based specific purpose transfer to
regions, and efforts were made to explain its objectives and mechanisms to regional officials, for
better utilization of the facility. All federal institutions have adopted Results-Oriented
Performance Evaluation (ROPE). A new remuneration policy for federal and regional levels has
been adopted for all federal institutions and is being applied to regions in stages, though the
policy needs adjustment along the way. A Circular drafted by EPA in 2005 was issued to
regions confirming that access to federal specific purpose grant for food security will require
compliance with guidelines for mitigating social and environmental risk under the Access to New
Land Program. Mandatory federal proclamations were enacted for EIA, pollution control,
and public health, followed by regional environmental proclamations. A minimum package
of services including the health extension program and related roles for health posts and
health centers was adopted in August 2005, as part of a health services plan at all levels
including the woreda level. The Central Statistical Authority (CSA) has issued guidelines and
service standards for accessibility of statistical data, and several surveys and reports (Annual
Progress Report for 2003-04, PPA, and MDG Needs Assessment; progress on the WMS and
HICES etc. have been prepared or are in advanced stage of preparation). However, there are



                                                 -52-

concerns regarding the timeliness of the surveys, quality of analysis, and the speed with which
data is made available to end-users and the public. GoE has established a joint MOH and
HAPCO committee to facilitate piloting of an HIV/AIDS survey which is underway, and is
expected to generate a much more reliable HIV prevalence rate. In the education sector, an
unprecedented number of in-depth studies, including the Education Country Status Report
prepared by a World Bank-Ministry of Education team and subsequent development of the
related Education Policy Simulation Model by the team, have helped to consolidate information
about the education system. A baseline Textbook survey has been carried out as an input to
policy for textbook preparation. Two NLAs were completed and third is under finalization as of
end-2006, including the analysis of Grade 4 and 8 from the latest data, together with
recommendations based on the results. Primary school building design options with lower unit
costs and environmental analysis were completed and presented to regional governments.

PRSC I: Objective 3: Improving the investment climate (including for the rural sector).
(Moderately Satisfactory)

Policy Actions/ Implementation underpinning the outcomes

3.2.8    Overall Investment Climate: GoE initiated implementation of a policy to increase
domestic competition, based on The Trade Practices Proclamation which came into force in 2003
and established rules on anti-competitive practices such as price collusion, abuse of market
dominance, anti-dumping and consumer protection. A Competition Commission was established
but lacked private sector representatives, and the Competition Secretaria was not adequately or
exclusively staffed. Much progress was made in respect of criteria and process for registration,
for which fees was reduced to Birr 80 (against the targeted reduction from $425 to $65); and
processing time to one hour (against the targeted reduction of 44 days to 8 days).
A roadmap for accession to WTO -- from application to working party to protocol accession --
was prepared, partly on the basis of a WB-funded study that proposed institutional structural
options for dealing with WTO.

3.2.9    Financial sector: GoE commenced implementation of a plan for restructuring CBE, the
Development Bank of Ethiopia, and privatizing the Construction and Business Bank, though the
focus remained on improving CBE's performance.

3.2.10 Rural Investment Climate: Some progress was made towards the objective of reducing
the percentage of extension staff without responsibility for delivery of inputs and credit
administration to 70%, and reducing the share of annual fertilizer sales with regional
government guarantees to 100,000 metric tonnes. However, the extent of actual disengagement is
not clear, especially since cooperatives and other channels are not yet strong enough to take over
the functions. GoE maintained the level of fertilizer sales with guarantees at 200,000 on the
grounds that this quantity still represents a large proportion of the increased overall levels of
fertilizer consumption. Warehouse Receipts Law was passed in 2005. Institutional structure for
warehouse receipts was set up in major grain producing and consuming regions. The four major
regions (Amhara, Tigray, SNNP and Oromiya) have passed their own Rural Land
Proclamations and gone ahead with first-level land certifications. Other regions are in the
process of preparing drafts. In Amhara, nearly 1500 families in two communities have started
issuing second level or geo-referenced certificates, with attached maps. However, progress in this
regard was slower than expected, and greater commitment from GoE is needed in this regard.

PRSC II: Objective 1: To support improvements in the investment climate. (Moderately
Satisfactory)

3.2.11 GoE focused a significant part of its capacity building effort on the institutions servicing
the private sector, and has had notable successes in improving the time required to clear customs,
tax management, availability of land for business and industry in urban areas, and reducing the
cost and time required to register a business, apart from moving closer to WTO accession. .
However, there was little progress on liberalizing the Telecom sector, the Competition
Commission was still lacking members from the private sector, and the Commission Secretariat
was not still adequately resourced, with MOTI staff doubling for Secretariat duties. Despite
recent progress, in general, market-oriented agricultural inputs supply systems are far from being
in place and functioning in Ethiopia. However, the Bank's assessment is that the GoE's strategic
direction is indeed market-oriented, and that the pace of implementation performance can be
improved.

Policy Actions/ Implementation underpinning outcomes

3.2.12 Rural Investment Climate: While GoE claimed to have increased the percentage of
extension staff without responsibility for delivery of inputs and credit administration further to
planned 85% or even higher, the actual level of disengagement remained unclear. There was also
not much change with respect to reducing the share of annual fertilizer sales with regional
government guarantees, for the same reason as cited in the corresponding objective under PRSC
I. It is expected that growth in access to alternative credit sources from MFIs will enable a
smooth phase-out of the regional government credit guarantees for fertilizer. The available
evidence suggests that this growth has been positive and is not likely to be constraining the pace
of the phase out of the guarantee, although more development of MFI products to bear weather-
related risks is needed. A planned study on options for reforming the market structure for the
import and distribution (including the wholesale and retail) segments of the fertilizer marketing
system was completed in January 2006. It noted that private sector participation and competition
in import of fertilizers -- which is already dominated by a few larger fertilizer
importers/cooperatives -- was deterred by high capital and collateral requirements, low retailing
and distribution margins; and a decrease in the regional government guarantee for import of
fertilizers (though 60% of cooperatives' imports still used the guarantee). Preparations for
piloting the warehouse receipts system have been completed and the pilot is ready for
implementation and evaluation in the context of the coming harvest. In order to review Regional
Land Proclamations, identify best practices, and harmonize regional proclamations as
appropriate according to emerging best practices, a Federal Proclamation was issued for
improving harmonization and coordination among the 4 regional rural land proclamations.

3.2.13 There is agreement between GoE and its partners on the strategic options and the
associated package of institutional and policy reforms needed to increase the market orientation
of the economy. There is also broad agreement that the private sector needs cultivation, not just
liberalization. The key question is the pace of implementation. GoE prefers a paced and targeted
strategy that ensures a reputation of non-reversal once political decisions are made. Therefore, the
nature of the engagement in PSD in Ethiopia, while slow compared to experience in other similar
countries, does exhibit characteristics that point to its likelihood of being more sustainable and
generating a strong private sector response in this changed global environment. There has been a
large increase in the number of projects approved (90%) and the amount of capital invested
(107%) in the private sector between 2004-05 to 2005-06. However, there was very little progress
on the issue of liberalizing the Telecom sector. Positive results can be seen in the emergence of
new, export-oriented industries, notably horticulture, which is growing rapidly. Still, many


                                               -54-

constraints to private sector development remain Positive developments are evident in regard to
the market share of private banks and delivery of micro finance services in urban areas.
However, finance remains a major obstacle for growth, both in urban and rural sectors.. (General
Talk)

3.2.14 Overall Investment Climate: The Competition Commission was still lacking members
from the private sector, and the Commission Secretariat was not still adequately resourced, with
MOTI staff doubling for Secretariat duties. GoE focused a significant part of its capacity
building effort on the institutions servicing the private sector, and has had notable successes in
improving the time required to clear customs, tax management, availability of land for business
and industry in urban areas, and reducing the cost and time required to register a business. After
cabinet approval, the final Memorandum of Foreign Trade Regime (MoFTR) was submitted to
WTO Secretariat in December 2006, launching the accession process, for which a well-staffed
department has been created.

3.2.15 Privatization: The Privatization Action Plan began to be implemented, with the merger of
EPA and PESA in July 2004, to allow for a more efficient divestiture process, making use of
different modalities (asset sale, concessions, leasing, etc.). Responding to Bank concerns, GoE
changed the objective of privatization from obtaining highest value for assets to focusing on long
term value. This yielded better results, as compared to 9 companies in the previous year, 13
companies (against a target of 10 companies) were privatized during July 2005-June 2006,
including 5 public-private partnerships, covering cement, chemicals, textiles, tanneries, and
accounting for Birr193.3 million in assets.

3.2.16 Urban Land Reform: Addis Ababa City Administration issued a revised urban land
lease legislation in 2003, and developed guidelines and institutional arrangements that are being
implemented.. A draft compensation law and a prototype regional urban land lease regulation
have been prepared and GoE is pursuing the issuance of revised urban land lease regulations at
the regional level. The compensation law will ensure compensation to affected parties in the
event of acquisition of property by government; it is aimed at strengthening property rights and
constitutes a major step in the creation of a well-functioning land market. In respect of
illegal/informal settlements, directives were issues for regularization of illegal/informal
settlements in Addis Ababa. Municipal land agencies are registering and titling an increasing
number of land and buildings and have started regularization of units in informal settlements.

3.2.17 Telecom Policy: Little progress has been made in the liberalization of the telecom sector
as a result of actions under the PRSC program. GoE developed a strategy with ambitious goals
for the telecom sector in the form of a Letter of Communication Sector Policy (LCSP), which the
Bank considered inadequate given the lack of a financing plan including attracting larger
financing from the private sector. However, GoE's current strategy continues to be to maintain
ETC's state-owned monopoly over the telecommunications backbone, and to allow private sector
participation in downstream retail activity. The speed at which private sector participation in the
mobile service sector would occur will be determined by the speed at which regulatory capacity
can be brought up to the necessary standard. Meanwhile, GoE made a beginning has been made
in reducing the cost of SIM cards for cell phones.

3.2.18 Micro and rural finance strategy and action plan: GoE has issued a Rural and
Microfinance Strategy and developed an action plan to improve the operations of the sector and
encourage faster growth. Main features include strengthening the regulation and the supervision
of MFIs, improving the governance of MFIs, promoting the development of MFI's institutional
capacities, providing MFIs with effective loan recovery mechanisms similar to those currently


                                               -55-

available to banks, and encouraging MFIs to upgrade their accounting and management
information systems. The plan also studies and includes better risk sharing mechanisms in rural
financial instruments in the future.

3.2.19 Financial Sector: The results of GoE's financial sector strategy are expected to lead to
commercial banking being modernized and competition increased as measured by growth in the
market size of private banks and reduced non-performing loans; increased access to financial
services for small holders, entrepreneurs and traders, home-owners, and farmers; and
development of financial markets. IMF and Bank staff continue to encourage the Government to
allow the entry of foreign banks into the financial sector over time, initially by encouraging
international management contracts for domestic banks. GoE considers that priority should first
be given to strengthening the financial sector and enhancing supervisory capacity of the central
bank. More generally with respect to strengthening competition in the banking sector, GoE has
indicated that it will continue its efforts to enhance efficiency and competition, in order to prepare
the ground for the progressive integration of the Ethiopian financial sector into the global
financial market.

Policy Actions/ Implementation underpinning outcomes

3.2.21 Revised Financial Calendar: There has been considerable progress in defining and
implementing a new financial calendar to improve predictability and transparency of resource
flows. The planned revision to the financial calendar is on-going, but delayed so as to
incorporate the experience of at least 5 years of implementation of the new financial calendar;
take advantage of the ongoing performance budgeting exercise; develop better linkages with the
decentralized budget process. 21 budgetary units completed rollout of Budget Information
Systems (BIS) software.

3.2.22 Adoption of Chart of Accounts. Building on the progress under PRSC I, budget and
accounts reforms were rolled out as planned to federal institutions, Addis Ababa, and eight
regions, including Oromiya, SNPPR, Tigray, Oromia, Beneshangul and Dire-Dawa. This
improved the financial reporting capacity of government agencies and faster finalization of



                                                -56-

accounts. The pace of implementation varies from region to region, and is being assisted by
training and capacity building exercises.

3.2.23 Reducing Accounts and Audits Backlog: Overall, eight regions ­ Addis Ababa, Amhara,
Oromiya, Tigray, SNNP, DireDawa, Gambela and Benshangul have reduced their accounts
backlog to less than an year, though this happened later than planned. Backlog for audit of
federal accounts was cleared till 2004-05. though a few months later than planned.

3.2.24 Procurement: Following the enactment of the Procurement Law by Parliament in
January 2005, Procurement Department in MoFED was transformed into a separate Procurement
Supervisory Agency. Also, tender committees and procurement units have been created in all
federal ministries. In addition, GoE has organized a number of procurement workshops to train
members of the Procurement Committees and Units. A total staff of 390 from 108 federal public
bodies had been trained till end-2006.

3.2.25 Provision of funding for transitional costs related to civil works or infrastructure costs of
decentralization: In response to the concern for covering one-off logistical and infrastructure
(civil works) costs associated with woreda and municipal decentralization, PSCAP covers
equipment including generators and computers, etc., but not the civil works requirements of
newly empowered jurisdictions, for which the IGR has assessed needs for possible financing by
the Bank and its development partners. GoE is seeking to address these issues including
clarifying its policy stance through its Fiscal Decentralization Strategy Plan (1.6)

3.2.26 Fiscal Decentralization Strategy: GoE took the important step of approving a Fiscal
Decentralization Strategy (FDS) for municipalities and woreda levels in October 2004.
Overall, the FDS provides the first comprehensive and clear articulation of the objectives and
goals of fiscal decentralization, the fiscal instruments that the Government has employed over the
past few years to further these objectives, and some of the forward-looking challenges associated
with creating an accountable local government tier in urban and rural areas. The FDS also lays
out the target audience for the strategy, a balance between transfers and own revenue
mobilization, a forward looking agenda for capital funding, approach to addressing the
transitional costs of decentralization, and the links to medium-term planning and financia1
management. These aspects will help it to serve as a guide for federal, regional, and local finance
officials to make better choices in utilizing the existing and new fiscal instruments to further
SDPRP objectives of improved service delivery and empowerment. Also, Enabling legislation to
assign expenditure and revenue responsibilities to municipalities was enacted in 8 regions and
Addis Ababa.

3.2.27 Municipal Finance: Another important development was the preparation of prototype
municipal finance legislation, which inter alia defines various fiscal instruments -- specific
purpose transfers, block grants, and other mechanisms -- that are available to regions. It would be
equally important for prototype strategies (inclusive of the fiscal dimension of decentralization) to
be developed for woredas. Based on the progress described above, regions and their local
governments are now better placed than any other time during the past decade to meet the dual
SDPRP objectives of improved service delivery and enhanced local autonomy. While much more
in terms of fiscal innovation remains to be done, improved capacity of sub-national authorities ­
is helping them take full advantage of the expanded fiscal autonomy. The stage has been set for
other woredas, regions and local governments to make effective decisions regarding instrument
choice (for e.g., the design of various transfers) as well as their implementation (for e.g.,
monitoring of fiscal transfers).

3.2.28 Performance Management: All federal institutions have adopted Results-Oriented
Performance Evaluation (ROPE). A new remuneration policy for federal and regional levels has
been adopted for all federal institutions and being applied to regions in stages, though the policy
needs adjustment along the way.

3.2.29 Public Sector Performance and Service Delivery Improvement Program (PSIP) : was
initiated in Addis Ababa and major towns, and selected (Ministries, Agencies and Bureaus
(MABs) as a primary instrument for introducing performance management within civil service
institutions, and similar efforts are underway in the federal courts in order to improve the
efficiency of judicial and legal services. Initial efforts have focuses on the Customs Authority
and Federal Inland Revenue Authority in the Ministry of Inland Revenues, the Ethiopian
Investment Commission as well as the Trade and Licensing Department under the Ministry of
Trade and Industry, and the Treasury and Central Procurement Departments in the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Development, and the Registration and Land Management Departments in
Addis Ababa City Administration. The federal Supreme Court has completed a court
administration reform with an emphasis on reducing the processing time for caseload
management in courts.

3.2.30 Education: GoE is taking initiative in increasing the number and quality of teachers
through free training, and developing/implementing strategies for teaching multi-grade systems.
GoE has also undertaken a detailed supply-demand study of teacher production and medium term
impact on the wage bill. A program is also being implemented to revise and strengthen both pre-
and in-service teacher training. MOED has undertaken a second Learning Assessment at Grades 4
and 8 and the data is being analyzed. Federal design options and guidelines for primary school
construction with lower unit costs and community participation have been validated and adopted
by all Regions. The new construction designs will help primary schools reduce unit costs of
construction, and enable communities to build schools closer to villages, with greater
involvement of community members themselves.


3.2.31 Health: GoE is trying to build upon the Health-Labor market study and synchronize it
with the HRD Strategy. Given the findings regarding determinants of access to health services,
GoE has decided to institute a mobile, community-based "health extension worker" cadre of
female workers. The objectives of this new cadre is to increase the focus on prevention, improve
the functions of the Health Posts -- the lowest tier of the facility-based care system -- and expand
community-based outreach services. The introduction of the health extension program should to
some extent alleviate the staff shortage, particularly in rural areas. Other incentives, however, are
needed to attract and retain highly skilled health personnel. For example, SNNPR has been
providing additional allowances to staff working in remote areas and has also been crediting a
year o f service in these areas as two years of service. Implementation of the Health Extension
Package (HEP) including training of health extension workers was being carried out at 35 TVET
centers. The Health Extension package is being implemented at three levels: community, health
center; and district hospital. At community level, 2 health workers are assigned for every 5000
residents. Over 2000 health officers were undergoing training. The targets for health indicators
were exceeded for both basic immunization (DPT3) as well as for the contraceptive prevalence
rate, while progress was made in skilled attended deliveries. Alignment of HSDP III and SDPRP
II timeframes is on track, including in-year alignment between the annual cycle of health sector
reviews and the SDPRP APR.


3.2.32 Nutrition: For developing a nutrition strategy, the Food Security Coordination Bureau
within MOARD was appointed as lead agency to coordinate a multi-sectoral steering committee,


                                               -58-

tasked with developing a nutrition strategy. The Steering Committee initiated its organizational
meetings in late 2005.

3.2.33 HIV/AIDS: There are clear signs of increased efforts to address HIV/AIDS both in
curative and preventive terms. Antiretroviral (ARV) therapies are being introduced in the country
and are expected to rapidly expand to cover more AIDS cases with financing from the Global
Fund and PEPFAR. At present (2004) 16,400 people are on ART through public, private and
NGO facilities. This number was estimated to be 23,000 by June 2005 and to exceed the target of
30,000 by December 2005. Performance of the Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS program continues to
improve, and greater collaboration with NGOs and civil society is apparent but needs further
strengthening. Another sign of progress is the expansion in the number of Voluntary Counseling
and Testing (VCT) centers from less than 10 in 1999-00 to about 175 by 2004-05; this number is
expected to increase rapidly with the scale-up of ARV treatment. An important recent
development, moreover, is a marked shift from awareness creation to emphasis on Behavioral
Change Communication. Similarly much more emphasis is given to interventions that target the
youth.

3.2.34 Reproductive Health Strategy: Reproductive Health Strategy was finalized and approved
in 2006. In this regard, the Health Extension Program, which complements facility- based care
using a cadre of female extension workers, also serves as the major instrument or channel for
providing both MCH and FP/reproductive health services. There is much scope for replicating
good practices such as the Tigray RHE3 been collaborating with Mekele University and regional
hospitals for providing additional training to health officers so that they can perform some
surgical procedures in health centers.

3.2.35 National Action Plan on Gender: The National Action Plan for gender was prepared, and
progress was made on the Gender Budgeting Initiative and in a number of sectors (notably health,
through the extension worker scheme, and education, where gender disparities have diminished)
and in PSCAP. Greater progress is needed in strengthening the gender dimension of the M&E
system to produce gender data and analyses.

PRSC II: Objective 3: To support improvements in reducing vulnerability. (Satisfactory)


Policy Actions/ Implementation underpinning outcomes

3.2.36 Food Security Program: GoE has recently revitalized a Food Security Program with
several components, including voluntary resettlement to new land, and the shift away from
reliance on annualized emergency appeals to a more stable, predictable and development-oriented
safety net program financed via cash. A circular was issued to the regions by MoFED stating that
access to the Federal Food Security Grant would be contingent on achieving minimum standards
outlined in the risk mitigation guidelines. Revised guidelines incorporating environmental and
social risk mitigation measures have also been prepared with guidance from the Environmental
Protection Authority (EPA) on the basis of recommendations by a Bank Safeguard team in 2004.
In order to ensure better success of the program, dissemination and widespread application of
these revised guidelines needs to be prioritized, together with adequate awareness and capacity-
building measures undertaken at local implementation levels.

3.2.37 Resettlement Initiative: Regarding the resettlement initiative, after the initial phase of
2002-03, 2003-04 saw the continued implementation of the program in Amhara, Oromiya, Tigray
and SNNPR regions.. A recent World Bank mission concluded that the resettlement program is


                                              -59-

well designed, and with minor modifications can become consistent with World Bank acceptable
standards on resettlement. Implementation in many sites, however, shows departures from design
guidelines. In some sites this has led to crisis situations for resettled households.

3.2.38 Vulnerability: GoE moved with speed over 2004-2005 to reform the existing
emergency mechanism to respond to chronic household food insecurity towards establishing
a more productive and efficient safety net system. Towards this end, GoE issued a
parliamentary proclamation shifting the mandate for responding to chronic food insecurity from
the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) to the Food Security Program.
The focus of DPPC is now on the response to acute food insecurity (i.e., genuine emergencies) as
well as providing logistic support to the safety net under the FSP. Although resources have
started to flow from mid-February and public works have started in a number of woredas,
transfers have been slow in reaching beneficiaries. Information on implementation performance
as well as budgeted breakdowns of the Food Security Program budget line have now begun to be
reported systematically, particularly following a meeting of the Federal Food Security Steering
Committee in early 2004.

3.2.39 Productive Safety Net. GoE began implementing the Productive Safety Net in 262
chronically food insecure woredas from January 2005. The reform involves various aspects of the
current system for providing support to chronically food insecure households. Different agencies
have agreed to work in a harmonized approach within a common safety net framework led by the
GoE using coordinated resource channels-food and cash, Government and non-Government.
Measures are also being discussed to identify how to improve synergies between cash/food aid-
based safety nets and market development. There is no report on resettlement implementation
and on how the program was adapted to fit with existing resources and implementation capacity.
There is also no available evidence of adherence to the social and environmental risk mitigation
guidelines or of plans to implement the recommendations of the World Bank review of the
resettlement program. Food security program M&E system began to be implemented in
resettlement areas. DPCC early warning system and responsive mechanism expanded to
resettlement sites. Beneficiaries under the Food Security Program in 2005 numbered 4.8 million
beneficiaries in 6 regions and 192 woredas. In 2006, this number increased to 7.12m in 7 regions
and 234 woredas. Impact assessment of resettlement areas has been conducted in Amhara,
Tigray, Oromiya and SNNDP to confirm that steps have been taken to adhere to guidelines for
mitigating social and environmental risks. Training is being provided at regional level to evaluate
the functioning of the safety net and new land settlement. Sectoral guidelines on and procedural
guidelines have been completed and are under implementation. Social impact assessment
guidelines and resettlement guidelines were completed and distributed for seventeen sectors
including agriculture, industry, dams, mining, and roads. Additional procedural guidelines were
also produced to inform users on the controls and appeals process. Regional environmental
protection units have been established by MABs, prominent ones being those for Ministry of
Water Resources and Ethiopian Roads Authority. EPA organized high-level workshops for
members of civil society and the private sector for creating awareness on EIA.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall outcome for PRSC I, PRSC II, and the PRSC series as a whole is considered to be
Satisfactory due to:

   i.    positive trends in macroeconomic and sectoral outcome/output indicators for each
         theme;
  ii.    almost all prior or "bolded" actions being achieved (see Section 2.1); and


                                               -60-

 iii.    almost all the supporting or "non-bolded" actions being fully or mostly achieved, though
         with delay in some cases.

It is not possible to make a firm attribution of the outcomes to PRSC actions, especially due to
interaction with other Bank projects, Donor efforts, and GoE's own initiatives. However, PRSC
was the largest and most multi-faceted program in Ethiopia during that period, and it is not
unreasonable to expect that its effect would have been substantial.

The achievements of PRSC I and II should also be viewed in the context of the larger PRSC
program as originally planned: The development objectives of each PRSC were linked within a
rolling programmatic series that jointly aimed to consolidate progress in implementation of the
SDPRP's multi-faceted reform program; support progress on the harmonization and financing
alignment agendas; and develop the policy matrix to update and extend the rolling three-year
planning framework to include the outer year.

3.3.1    Most Theme-wise higher-level outcomes show a positive trend. Most higher level
indicators ­ to the extent available -- for each theme have shown a positive trend during the 2001-
02 to 2004-05 period.(as set out in Section F ("Results Framework Analysis") and as discussed in
Section 3.3 above).

3.3.2    Nearly all "bolded" or prior actions were achieved. Nearly all "bolded" prior actions,
which were the main thrust of the program, were completed in both PRSC I and PRSC II.
Relatively few actions were minimally achieved (PRSC II: Adoption of revised telecom policy
allowing partial liberalization of the communications sector and commencement of
implementation) or partly achieved (PRSC I: Percentage of extension staff without responsibility
for delivery of inputs and credit administration increase to 70% of share of annual fertilizer sales
with regional government guarantees reduced to 200,000 metric tonnes; Issuing Rural Land
Proclamations to enhance land tenure security).

3.3.3    Majority of "non-bolded" or supporting actions were fully or mostly achieved. The
majority of "non-bolded" or supporting actions were fully or mostly achieved, though with delay
in some cases (as discussed under individual actions in Section 2.1)

For the above reasons, the rating of the individual PRSC tranches and the PRSC series is
considered satisfactory.

Rating: PRSC I: Satisfactory; PRSC II: Satisfactory; PRSC Series: Satisfactory

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Risk to development outcomes is considered `negligible to low" because of the strength of project
design (cross-cutting and inter-locking themes and linkages with other projects for capacity
building and TA and complementary sectoral activities), continuing ownership and commitment
of the borrower, positive trends under all program themes, sound macroeconomic management,
and strong linkages with the follow-up PBS project and other projects. The outcomes from PRSC
I and II have been largely sustained despite suspension of PRSC operations after PRSC II, have
received further support from the follow-up PBS project and other complementary projects. The
gains from PRSC I and II are contingent on the extent to which problems of political governance
have the potential to adversely impact the development agenda.

4.1      Robust Project Design. Several elements of sustainability (or lower risk to development
outcome) were built into the project design. These included several mutually reinforcing actions
cutting across the four major themes -- especially those relating to public institutional governance
-- functional and fiscal decentralization ­ that complemented activities in the other themes. The
program was complemented by other projects for capacity building (PSCAP, Private Sector
Capacity-Building project, CBDSD etc.) as well as other projects in various sectors.

4.2      Borrower ownership and commitment: Continuing progress by GoE on PRSC III
agenda despite closure of PRSC operations presents a strong counterfactual. After the
PRSC program was suspended, the borrower continued to show commitment to the PRSC
developmental agenda, and was able to largely sustain the gains made under PRSC I and II and
even advancing on several fronts on the agenda that had been formulated for PRSC III. (as can be
seen from the updated matrix for PRSC III actions in Annex 7.

4.3      Positive Outcome trends. As discussed in greater detail in Section 3.2, overall higher-
level outcome indicators show positive trends under all four program themes. While this cannot
be attributed primarily to the PRSC ­ given that the last two years have gained from an
agricultural rebound due to favorable weather conditions, as well he outcomes of Bank and donor
financed projects as well as GoE's own initiatives -- there is nevertheless an almost consistently
upward trend for the past five years that augurs well for the near and medium term.

4.4      Sound Macroeconomic management: Despite the highly variable growth experienced
and the exogenous shocks, GoE has continued to maintain broad macroeconomic stability. The
IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) remained on track for all the quantitative
indicators and performance criteria under the PRGF for end-March, 2004, and the structural
performance criteria for end-June, 2004. More recent data on macroeconomic indicators (section
6.1) for 2000-01 to 2004-05 also underline prudent macroeconomic management by GoE. The
relatively sound macroeconomic climate improves the chances for sustaining the gains made on
various fronts through PRSC I and II.

4.5      Looking Forward. Even before the recent political developments in 2005, GoE, Bank,
and donors were placing a strong emphasis on interventions to help strengthen key areas of
economic governance -- such as building institutional capacity for decentralization, supporting
private sector growth, and improving transparency and accountability. But there is a broad


                                              -62-

consensus that the events following the May 2005 election require a deepened understanding of
how the political economy dynamics will shape the effectiveness of development interventions --
particularly in relation to how political governance translates into the economic sphere -- though
strengthened governance will be needed to restore the upward trend in fostering private sector
development, and addressing massive gaps in Ethiopia's infrastructure. While there has been
progress recently in these areas, especially in service delivery and in infrastructure, continued
gains are contingent on the extent to which problems of political governance have the potential to
adversely impact the development agenda. Strengthening governance reform and institutional
capacity building efforts are therefore not only important in and of themselves, but also in order
to make progress on the broader development agenda.

Considering all the above factors, on the balance, the risk to development outcomes is considered
to be "negligible to low".

Rating:PRSC I: Negligible to Low; PRSC II: Negligible to Low; PRSC Series: Negligible to
Low

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The Bank committed substantial time and effort to project formulation and preparation for PRSC
I and II by conducting a wide range of supporting ESW (see Section 3.1 under "Relevance"),
working closely with the donor community in (see Section 3.1 under "Design"), engaging
intensely with the borrower, bringing together multiple stakeholders through workshops, and
providing exposure to international experience in different subject areas through workshops. The
Bank's work with the Donors enabled it to leverage in excess of $1 for every $1 contributed by
the Bank.

5.1.1    The impact of the Bank's efforts was enhanced by the presence of a large complement of
country office staff that was part of the project team, and thus helped regular and intensive
interaction with government counterparts. By designing PRSC I and II firmly in the context of
previous and ongoing projects (see Section 3.1 under "Design"), the Bank was able to impart
coherence to project design and build in elements of sustainability.

5.1.2    The Bank was quite objective in its assessment of the commitment and capacity of the
borrower and matched these characteristics adequately with the scope and content of the project.
Thus, even though PRSC I and II covered a wide range of themes and several actions under each
theme, they were not overly complex to implement.

5.1.3    The Bank and Donors acted appropriately by reducing the originally agreed credit
amounts for PRSC I (reduced by US$30m to US$120 million) and PRSC II (reduced by US$20m
to US$130m), due to lack of sufficient progress in respect of specific program triggers,
particularly in respect of Telecom, fertilizer marketing, commercializing agriculture and
developing rural markets, thereby stressing the importance of making progress on all fronts to
maximize the benefits from the project.

Rating: PRSC I: Satisfactory; PRSC II: Satisfactory: PRSC Series: Satisfactory



                                               -63-

(b) Quality of Supervision

5.1.4    "Supervision " as the term applies to a development policy loan, was conducted through
various formal and informal mechanisms, and was characterized by a high degree of interaction
with GoE, driven by the continuity of themes from one PRSC tranche to the next. The
intervening time between PRSC I and II was about 10 months, and during this relatively short
period, there were several opportunities to track the progress of the government towards various
thematic goals, including the multi-agency PRSC II pre-appraisal mission (May 10-27, 2004) and
appraisal mission (Sept 21-Oct 4, 2004). Both these missions were well represented by WB staff
covering all major sectors/themes from HQ and the country office, as well as representatives of
participating Donors. Also, many of the Bank sector staff conducted their supervision trips
related to their own sector work, and kept track of outputs and outcomes under all thematic areas.
This intensive interaction appears to have been received well by all parties, and helped resolve
issues in a collegial manner. The interactions were supplemented and informed by ongoing
studies and reports relating to regular budget execution review, and other indicators covering PSD,
rural development and PSD issues.

Rating: PRSC I: Satisfactory; PRSC II: Satisfactory: PRSC Series: Satisfactory


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

5.1.5    While the Bank's performance is considered satisfactory at entry and during supervision,
the Bank joined the Donor community in suspending the provision of direct and general budget
support after the second PRSC tranche due to the environment of social unrest and deterioration
in governance that followed the general elections in Ethiopia in May 2005. This action was
appropriate under the circumstances, and was in keeping with the Bank's stand on the central role
of good governance in development. As discussed under Section 3.1 under "Risk", while the
Bank factored in the possibility of resumption of border hostilities with Eritrea, neither the Bank,
Donors, or the international community were able to foresee the developments that took place
following elections in 2005, considering that the political landscape in Ethiopia had seen steady
progress over many years.

5.1.6    Given that the PRSC operation had to be suspended, the Bank also displayed pragmatism
in continuing to engage the borrower and coordinating with donors, so that the momentum
generated by the PRSC series was not lost, and the flow of services to the ultimate beneficiaries
was not unduly disrupted, among others, through the Protection of Basic Services (PBS) Project.

Taking all the above factors into consideration, Bank performance is considered Satisfactory.

Rating: PRSC I: Satisfactory; PRSC II: Satisfactory: PRSC Series: Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

5.2.1    GoE (borrower/implementing agency) responded well to the challenging task of
preparing an actionable matrix of actions based on the much larger set of issues raised in the
SDPRP (see Section 2.1 under "Design"). This helped the borrower clarify the interrelationships
between different ministries and multiple developmental initiatives, and to set up coordinating


                                              -64-

mechanisms that improved greatly upon arrangements that existed before the PRSC process
began.

5.2.2   An OPCS assessment12 notes: "The borrower generally displayed strong ownership of the
actions to be performed under the PRSC, and demonstrated this broadly through the extent and
quality of implementation. GoE "has driven a country-owned process of identifying priority
areas for reform and then articulated sequenced measures with monitorable indicators in a policy
matrix linked to the PRSP, with individual donors supporting a subset of the government's policy
matrix. The approach, while perhaps not feasible in countries with greater capacity constraints,
nonetheless provides a noteworthy model of country ownership and commitment."

5.2.3   The OPCS assessment further notes that: "GoE has taken a more assertive role in leading
the process of deriving priority measures from their PRSP policy matrices. The role of the Bank
and other donors can be characterized more in the spirit of consultation, rather than a donor-led
negotiated process. In both cases, the result is a much more prioritized set of actions linked to the
PRSP, which all budget support donors use as a joint framework to draw disbursement triggers
and to assess performance. GoE created four inter-ministerial groups which entailed a substantial
amount of time and resources, and are an integral part of the PRSP, a fact that helps reinforce
accountability."

5.2.4   The borrower was pro-active throughout the process of project formulation and
preparation, through taking active part in discussions and workshops, and being open to learn
from international experience.

5.2.5   The borrower's efforts resulted in almost all prior actions being achieved, and the
majority of the supporting actions being fully or mostly achieved. However, for PRSC II, less
progress than expected was achieved in liberalizing the telecommunications sector, promoting
commercializing agriculture and developing rural markets. and in involving the private sector in
formulation and conduct of competition policy. At least to that extent, borrower performance
during PRSC II was less impressive than during PRSC I.

5.2.6   After the PRSC operation was suspended due to issues of political governance, the
borrower continued to show commitment to the PRSC developmental agenda, and was able to
largely sustain the gains made under PRSC I and II and even advanced on several fronts in the
agenda that had been formulated for PRSC III. (Annex 7)

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Same as section 5.2 (a)

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

5.2.7   Based on the above discussion, the overall borrower performance is considered
Satisfactory during PRSC I, Satisfactory during PRSC II, and Satisfactory for the PRSC series on
the whole.

6. Lessons Learned

The PRSC program was an ambitious undertaking, involving a complex analysis of cross-cutting
themes and issues; extensive background work and planning; a great deal of coordination
between the borrower, WB, Donors; maintaining linkages with other WB projects and other
activities; facing many sources of risk and uncertainty; and pioneering new initiatives in a
context of relatively poor capacity, despite good political commitment. Despite having made
progress on many policy fronts, and having yielded several positive outcomes and outputs, the
PRSC series had to be terminated after the second tranche instead of the four planned tranches.
As detailed below, the Ethiopia PRSC program experience holds several lessons not only for the
Bank's ongoing activities in the country, but also in the broader context where PRSCs or similar
instruments are employed.

1. The strength of the PRSC instrument in addressing a wide-range of cross-cutting themes
    can also be its greatest weakness if such a program needs to be prematurely terminated
    for any reason. That could leave a government suddenly deprived of pre-planned
    budget resources that could have an immediate adverse effect on the ultimate
    beneficiaries of the program. To avoid such a situation, an appropriate balance needs
    to be struck while folding other sector programs into a PRSC. Also, a more diverse mix
    of instruments should be considered. The Ethiopia PRSC program folded in major
    independent projects covering education, heath, rural development and vulnerability, which
    directly addressed the needs of the ultimate beneficiary, apart from other programs for
    improving the public institutional framework and improving the investment climate. When
    the program was abruptly terminated due to issues of political governance -- which were not
    anticipated at the time of program design -- GoE was left with a large gap in the budget for its
    service delivery plans, directly affecting the ultimate beneficiaries. In this case, the issue was
    resolved through designing a new investment project (PBS) to partly fill the void created by
    the discontinuation of the PRSC program, but without the leverage to press on with the policy
    changes initiated by the PRSC program. However, this situation could have been at least
    partly avoided -- while still sending the appropriate signal to GoE relating to political
    governance ­ if the Bank (and donor) assistance to different sectors had been delivered
    through a more diversified and balanced set of lending instruments, in a manner that
    preserved both policy and investment objectives. This point was underlined in the DAG
    meeting in Paris in March 2006, where partners noted the need to adapt a mix of aid
    instruments to enhance predictability while aligning with Government systems to support
    areas such as basic services, public sector management and institutional capacity building,
    food security, and infrastructure.

2. Government ownership is crucial for proper design, implementation and results.
    Though it may sound almost clichéd, it is impossible to over-emphasize the importance of
    government ownership of a program. In this case, GoE took strong ownership of the program
    right from the beginning in helping generate the program action matrix, creating inter-
    ministerial coordination mechanisms, benefiting from workshops and learning events that
    imparted lessons from international experience, and engaging the government machinery in
    carrying out actions planned under the program.

3. Quality time and effort put into project formulation and preparation can put a project
    on a sound footing and minimize the need for mid-course corrections. The Bank project
    team, the Donor community, and GoE put in a lot of time and effort into the various elements
    of program formulation, apart from aid harmonization and Donor coordination. The lesson
    that emerges from this experience is that there are no short-cuts in terms of time and effort to


                                              -66-

   ensure sound project design and to place the program on a sound footing, thus reducing the
   need for mid-course corrections in terms of the reform efforts.

4. Resources committed to ESW can strongly underpin project design and facilitate better
   implementation, especially where data on baseline conditions are inadequate to begin
   with. Ethiopia began the PRSC exercise with a low base of data and analytical output in
   various development areas. A large body of AAA/ESW was conducted over the years
   leading up to the PRSC program which helped develop a strong program design.

5. A project's scope and content should be matched well with the commitment and
   capacity displayed by the borrower. From the PRSC experience, it might appear that the
   program was too diverse and complex for the level of capacity that existed in Ethiopia.
   However, even though greater capacity would have been of help, the degree of commitment
   displayed by the borrower, willingness to learn, and the cooperative attitude in working with
   the Bank and Donor community more than made up for any initial disadvantage. Once a
   good mix of capacity and commitment was in place (e.g. through demonstrated performance
   on other projects; active participation in AAA/ESW) there was considerably less risk in
   attempting the PRSC.

6. The Bank should retain the option of reducing the quantum of a DPL prior to
   effectiveness, if performance falls considerably short of initially and mutually agreed
   levels. The Bank and Donor community's decision to reduce the quantum of grant/credit
   after the borrower did not follow through adequately on initially agreed triggers sent a potent
   signal to the borrower to deliver on mutually agreed goals.

7. Engaging the donor community, even in a situation characterized by mutual
   cooperation, needs considerable investment in time and effort. The Bank team had to
   invest a lot of time and effort in engaging the donors, apart from the time spent by the Bank,
   Donors and the GoE in coordinating with each other. However, such time and effort is well-
   spent, and has the potential to yield significant saving in transaction costs for all parties
   including the borrower and bank, while leveraging their collective strengths.

8. Where reform in vital area is slow, the Bank should continue to be engaged and serve as
   a facilitator. It is clear that private sector development will take time in Ethiopia. There
   needs to be a more open dialogue between GoE and the private sector around a clearly
   defined medium-term reform agenda. The Bank should support this with a strong and flexible
   partnership, wide range of analytical work, continued in-depth dialogue, and strong
   monitoring and supervision of reforms.

9. Acting in concert with donors ­ and in this instance ­ the provision of Joint Budget
   Support and Joint Budget Assistance Reviews ­ can greatly increase the Bank's ability
   to keep the borrower on track with respect to agreed actions. Once the Bank and Donors
   had entered into a coordinating mechanism with each other, it became easier for the group to
   speak with one voice to the government and be more effective in implementing the program.

10. Aligning joint budget support with the borrower's financial calendar can greatly
   decrease transaction costs, help advance planning, and increase the timeliness of
   resources transfers through the system to serve the ultimate beneficiaries.

11. The design and implementation of a DPL can greatly benefit from the synergies arising
    from other sectoral and investment projects. The PRSC built on the strengths of several


                                               -67-

    on-going projects at the time of its design including the CBDSD, and was complemented by
    its successor PSCP program for capacity building. Apart from these, several other
    investments reinforced PRSC program actions.

12. The Bank should display pragmatism with respect to the borrower, while minimizing
    disruption for the ultimate beneficiaries, in the face of negative developments in political
    governance. In the face of negative developments in political governance, the Bank should
    make sure that its response does not over-penalize the borrower's otherwise tangible
    commitment and progress to the mutually agreed development agenda, and even more
    importantly, does not deprive the ultimate beneficiaries of the expected flow of services. In
    the case of this program, the Bank and Donors followed up with a new project agenda that
    resumed essential aid, while not compromising on the issues that led to the disruption in the
    first place.

13. AAA/ESW products (e.g. PER, CEM, PA) should be synchronized well with the
    program design and implementation phases as appropriate. The design and conduct of
    complex efforts like the PRSC have much to gain from AAA/ESW findings. It would be well
    worth committing extra resources to such AAA/ESW to ensure that they are completed in
    time to be used as inputs at the right juncture for designing complex lending products.

Further, drawing upon various PRSC experiences including that of the Ethiopia PRSC, an OPCS
assessment13 concludes as follows:

"Particularly in countries where donor budget support represents a significant share of
total budgetary resources, it is important for the PRSC to be aligned with other budget
support programs, and for budget support to be aligned with the government's annual
PRSP, budget, and planning cycles. The PRSC has emerged as an important tool for
mainstreaming the implementation of the PRSP in order to make it a more relevant framework for
government planning. The result (can be) a timely and predictable multi-sectoral budget support
that is informed and guided by the PRSP process and improves coordination across ministries and
levels of government. PRSC has become a useful platform to facilitate donor coordination and
harmonization around the common framework provided by the countries' PRSPs and annual
progress reports. The aim is for governments to negotiate effectively on broad comprehensive
reform program, with lower costs in terms of time and effort, preparation, reporting and
monitoring. The content of all donor programs should be consistent with PRSP priorities and
with each other, and streamlined."

            ETHIOPIA: POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC I &II)
        BORROWER'S COMMENTS -- IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT

Introduction

The Agricultural Development Led Industrialization (ADLI) was conceived in mid 1990s as a
long-term development (umbrella) strategy for Ethiopia designed by the Government for the
transformation of the Ethiopian economy from subsistence to market - oriented economy and
there by extricating the people from extreme poverty to healthy and prosperous livelihood. As an
integral part of this long-term strategy, a series of policy reforms and strategies at macro and
sectoral levels and including governance have been designed and implemented with positive
results achieved especially since 200014. The process of decentralized governance structure and
devolution of power of decision-making and resource allocation to the regional and local district
(woreda) level that emanated from the federal constitution have created the conditions with
profound impact on sustainable development for a long time to come. However, external factors
such as the border conflict with Eritrea(from 1998           to 2000), declining price for primary
commodities in the international markets and the vagaries of weather conditions affecting
agricultural production have resulted in wide fluctuation in pattern of economic growth during the
1990s although the various sources of shocks are currently being addressed through developing
programs aimed at the utilization of Ethiopia's water resources(small scale irrigation and water
harvesting).

The United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ushered in the issue of poverty
reduction to the international development agenda and its close linkages with economic growth
and social development. Thus, most donors rallied and supported the Government with in the
framework of Ethiopia's first generation PRSP for attaining the MDGs. Ethiopia's first generation
PRSP known as the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) was
formulated with wider participation of stakeholders. The main thematic areas enshrined in the
SDPRP include (i) rapid economic growth; (ii) improved human development; (iii) promoting
democratization and governance; and (iv) improved public sector service delivery performance.

The SDPRP, covering a medium term of three years (2002/03 -2004/05), was launched in August
2002 as multi-sectoral multi-tier policy action matrix. Although Government treasury has been
is the major source of funding for the implementation of SDPRP, the World Bank as the largest
contributor and other bilateral and multilateral donors also participated in reviewing and funding
of the Program. Under the auspices of the International Development Assistance package of
financing, series of annualized Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSCs) were developed to
provide the financing as multi-donor Direct Budget Support (DBS) and released under single



14The main ones of these include Rural Development Policies and Strategies and Instruments, Industrial
Development Strategy, Capacity Building Strategy and Programs, Civil Service Reform Programs,
Decentralization, Governance, Parliamentary and Judiciary Reforms, Sustainable Development and Poverty
Reduction Program (SDPRP) and more recently the Urban Development Policy. Sector Development
Programs for Roads, Water, Education and Health are being implemented as part and parcel of the ADLI
strategy.




                                              -73-

tranche upon achievement of selected actions among the thematic areas of SDPRP. PRSC I was
approved by the Board in January 2004 and the tranche disbursement in March 2004, and PRSC
II was approved in November 2004 and the tranche was released in December 2004.

The overall objective of PRSC series is conceived to meet the developmental objectives of a wide
range of cross - cutting and sectoral reform issues to help achieve simultaneous progress across
multiple areas towards SDPRP goals and MDGs. More specific objectives of the annualized
PRSCs are (1) to consolidate progress in the implementation of the SDPRP's multifaceted reform
program; (2) to support progress on the harmonization and financing alignment agenda; (3) to
develop, update and extend the SDPRP policy matrix as a three-year rolling planning framework.

In the next section, a brief overview of the PRSCs will be elaborated in line with the thematic
areas and policy actions. Section 3 presents the major achievements in terms of outcomes and
output under each of the themes for PRSC I & II. Section 4 presents the sustainability of the
achievements. The challenges faced in the reform and the lessons learnt are presented in sections
5 and 6, respectively.

      Overview of PRSCs

The overview covers the two sequentially administered grants, PRSC I and PRSC II. However,
there are no sharp distinctions among the activities and actions across the two grants. The actions
indicated under each of the themes for the two PRSCs tend to overlap over the period of 2003/04
and 2004/05.
The policy actions and indicators selected from SDPRP for implementation in the PRSC series
consist of four thematic areas:

    a) Public expenditure and institutional performance;
    b) Rural development and vulnerability
    c) Private sector development
    d) Human development

The policy actions and the achievements against each area of reform are outlined in turn below.

     Public Expenditure and Institutional Performance

This thematic area comprises 10 of the selected policy areas and a series of bolded (mandatory)
actions and non-bolded action instruments for achieving the desired performance level. The
primary focus under this theme has been the harmonization of the budgeting and planning
reforms, public financial management, devolution of public procurement responsibilities to
budget institutions, assigning of expenditure and revenue responsibilities to municipalities and
woredas with all actions anchored on the pillars of the fiscal decentralization strategy. In order to
tackle the issue of institutional performance, measures included adopting the result-oriented
performance evaluation (ROPE) system and public service delivery improvement program (PSIP)
for increased performance management at federal and regional levels. Implementation processes
are set for timely release of and access to raw statistical data for monitoring and evaluation
purposes as part of improving institutional performance.

As presented in the Program Documents for PRSC I and PRSC II, all the prescribed bolded
(mandatory) and non-bolded actions have been accomplished on the part of the government of the
FDRE under the above stated theme. Action on development and completion of the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) has been delayed mainly due to belated


                                             -74-

response of 'no objection' by the Bank for clearance of the bid document for contracting
consultants.

    2.2 Rural Development and Vulnerability

This thematic area comprises 5 of the selected policy areas and each of the policy area consists of
a set of bolded and non-bolded actions. The actions under rural development focus on improved
efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural technology generation and dissemination resulting in
credible division of labor in research, extension and cooperative/ private sector involvement in
input delivery. Commissioning a study on the options available for reforming the market structure
for the import and distribution of fertilizers and formalizing the warehouse receipt operation by
legal enactment to protect producers' income at a season of declining prices was the required
action for improved agricultural marketing.

Issuance of rural land proclamation to enhance land tenure security (PRSC I) and a directive to
establish appropriate land administration institutions in the four major regions (PRSC II) and
subsequently in the other emerging regions were actions to be implemented. On the issue of
vulnerability, implementation modalities and monitoring mechanisms for a system of multi-
annual productive safety nets were considered necessary to be put in place. It was also considered
necessary to give consideration to the social and environmental risks of settlement programs as
well as to the implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation system in resettlement areas.

The requirements for compliance to the guidelines for mitigating social and environmental risks
were to be met before delivery of specific purpose grants to the food security program.
Parliamentary approval of environmental proclamation including EIA, environmental pollution
control and setting up regional environmental units/ organs need to be in place. Workshops on
implementation of EIA, pollution guidelines need to be conducted and awareness materials to be
disseminated.

In those areas, the FDRE has been able to ascertain that all the bolded and the non-bolded actions
have been accomplished as agreed.

    2.3 Private Sector Development

The thematic area under Private Sector Development contains 5 policy areas selected as part of
PRSCs. These policy areas consist of actions such as appointment of the members of the Fair
Trade Practices Commission and establishment of the secretariat along with the formulation of
regulations through the conducting consultation with the private sector. In regard to reducing the
regulatory burden, the costs and time of registration and the process of the commercial
registration and licensing regulation were need to be reviewed.

Submission of application to accession and the subsequent submission of the Memorandum of
Foreign Trade Regime to WTO along with the preparation of the road map to WTO accession are
to be carried out.

Finalization of Privatization Action Plan and commencement of implementation of agreed
measures for accelerating privatization program and parliamentary approval of the merger
between PESA and EPA were needed to be achieved.

In the areas of urban land use, actions in the areas of revised urban land provision for Addis
Ababa, issuance of directive for management of and regularization of informal settlements,


                                              -75-

issuance of draft concession law to ensure compensation to affected parties in the event of
government take-over, directives for and start of regularization of informal settlement in Addis
Ababa and finally revision of urban land lease proclamation in Addis Ababa.

In the telecom sector, actions need to be taken for the adoption of revised telecom policy allowing
for partial liberalization of the communication sector and also for mobile phone tariff reduction.

Restructuring plan for CBE and the promotion of retail lending operations for the rural sector and
on-lending operations to MFIs from CBE were the actions pending for enhancing the capability
of the financial sector. In addition, review of micro and rural financial strategy and development
of action plan to improve access to micro and rural finance is prescribed as priority action (PRSC
II).  In this area, both bolded and non-bolded actions prescribed under the two PRSCs were
accomplished on time as far as the government of Ethiopia is concerned.

Regarding the telecom sector, the Government believes that the policy measure has been
accomplished as per the agreement reached with the Bank i.e., issuance of strategy and policy for
sector's development.

         2.4 Human Development

The thematic area of human development is represented by the education and health sectors and
together five policy areas are selected along with the corresponding actions.
In the areas of the education, the implementation progress of 2004 sector review and conducting
survey for baseline data on textbook to student ratio and class to number of students' ratio will be
completed. Design and analysis of The National Learning Assessment for grades 4 and 8 students
will be undertaken and recommendations to be developed based on the results. Guideline will be
developed for school construction with alternative options for school building with lower costs.

In the health sector, the HSDP III has been formulated and integrated in to the PASDEP and is
currently under implementation. Actions such as adoption of guidelines for defining minimum
package services at woreda level including the health extension program and related roles for
health posts and health centers along with training of health extension workers were to be carried
out. Further, biological surveys on the prevalence of HIV/AIDS were to be conducted and
reproductive health strategy will be developed.

The bolded and the non-bolded actions prescribed under PRSC I and PRSC II have been achieved.
The government has recently designated the Ministry of Agriculture (supply side) and the
Ministry of Health (demand side) as lead focal institutions for nutrition. The National Nutrition
Strategy for Ethiopia has taken shape through multi-sectoral and participatory process.

       Achievements During PRSCs

The four thematic areas considered under PRSC I and PRSC II as presented in Section II above.
For each of the thematic area goals and the corresponding outcomes and outputs that are
identified in relation to each of the mandatory actions (bolded or prior actions) as specified in
policy matrix of the SDPRP are presented as follows. The detailed action matrix framework
Matrix is presented in Annex Table 3.

The Public Service Delivery Improvement Program (PSIP) was part of Civil Service Reform
Program and has been rolled out to 17 towns for restructuring and performance improvement.

Monitoring and Evaluation
Issuance by CSA of guidelines and service standards to ensure timely release of and access
to raw statistical data
CSA guidelines and service delivery standards have been approved by the Council of Ministers
and have been under implementation since then.
3.2. Theme 2: Rural Development and Vulnerability

Goal: Higher and more stable growth in national income and reduction in vulnerability
Outcome: Increased rural income and agricultural production

Outputs: Detail outputs are outlined below

         (a) Agricultural research and extension

Percentage of Extension staff without responsibility for delivery of inputs and credit
administration increased to 70% and share of annual fertilizer sales with regional government
guarantees reduced to 200,000 m tons

At present The Extension service is decentralized and regional governments do not
encourage participation of DAs in Non-extension activities. The absence of the private
sector and other institutions force the condition for the government to engage in fertilizer
distribution especially in remote areas where small quantities are demanded. In most other
areas and in the 4 major regions primary cooperatives and their unions are heavily involved
in fertilizer sales to their members.

         (b) Improved land tenure security with more flexible and transferable right

Issue rural land Proclamation to enhance land tenure security and a directive to establish
appropriate land admin institutions in 4 major regions
Federal Land Use and Land Administration Proclamation No 456/2005 was issued and the 4
regions are in the process of establishing appropriate land administration synchronized with the
Federal prototype.

Review Regional Land Proclamations, identify best practices, and harmonize regional
proclamations as appropriate according to emerging best practices
Harmonization of regional proclamation has taken place by Tigrai and Amhara Regional States
that require Regional Cabinet approval and Oromia and SNNP Regional States are in the process
of approval in 2006. The Regional Land Proclamations aimed at minimizing the effect of land
fragmentation and promote watershed management concept of land administration with strong
component of soil conservation was passed. Thus, areas exposed to erosion are allotted for tree
planting, bee honey production, grass-cover, etc., in accordance with emerging best practices.

         (c) Vulnerability

Define institutional arrangements, implementation modalities and monitoring mechanism
for a system of multi-annual productive safety nets and begin implementation
Safety nets involve short-term direct support of food for vulnerable groups such as children,
elderly and those unable to work; while others who can work are assigned to engage in public -
work programs. For the long - term, an IDA credit/grant amounting to USD 88 million is under
implementation for asset building of vulnerable households through credit provisions and training.
It is one of the special purpose federal administered grants that is implemented by the designated
woredas where productive safety - net programs are initiated.

(d) Environment

Circular issued to regions confirming that access to federal specific purpose grant for food
security will require compliance with guidelines for mitigating social and environmental risk
under the Access to New land (resettlement) Program upon finalization of such guidelines

The circular entitled "Environmental and Social Management Framework" has been drafted as a
technical guideline and distributed to the appropriate public agencies for further distribution to
the regions in 2005.
Parliamentary approval of environmental proclamations including for environmental
protection organ; environmental impact assessment and environmental protection control.

There have been mandatory proclamations enacted in previous years such as the Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) proclamation of 2002, Pollution Control proclamation and the Public
Health proclamation. Along the same line, regional Environmental Proclamations exist for all
regions under different titles. Institutional organs are established or delegated to related agencies
for the implementation of the proclamations.

3.3. Theme 3: Private Sector Development

Goal: Higher and more stable growth in national income and reduction in vulnerability of poor
people
Outcome: Increased contribution of Private Sector Development to GDP growth


                                                -79-

Output: The output details are described below:

(a) Public sector institutions regulating and supporting PSD

Reduction in the cost of new registration from $425 to $65 and time of registration from 44
days to 8 days.

The process was started with study on the Civil Service Reform Program (CSRP) and after the
Business Process Reengineering (BPR) was initiated by the MoTI. The criteria for registration
were rationalized and made very specific and short. Within the MoTI, the charge for registration
was reduced to Birr 80 and about one hour is sufficient for new registration as well as renewal.
The system of business registration is computerized at present.

Submission of application for accession to WTO

In accordance with the Marrakech Agreement of Article 12, which stipulates that, the procedures
for accession to WTO, a country wishing to become a member of WTO should submit a
document known as Memorandum of Foreign Trade Regime (MoFTR) to the secretariat of WTO.
The preparation process for accession started in January 2003 and a Working Party was
established in Geneva in February 2003. Based on the guideline of WTO the first draft was
submitted to the Council of Ministers in July 2004 and later the improved version of the draft was
presented in November 2004 with new laws and regulations related to trade were incorporated in
the document.

        (b) Increased contestability in the financial sector and development of micro and
rural credit
Approval by MoFED and commencement of implementation of a restructuring plan for
CBE
The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia has taken major steps on the restructuring process since 2004.
The bank carried out business process re-engineering (BPR) and installed ICT at the head quarter
and branch office levels. Through the use of various modalities such as contract management of
key functions, appropriate collateral schemes and applying swift foreclosure procedures the levels
of NPLs were reduced and in addition, the level of excess reserves rationalized through loans to
projects operating under DBE and other corporate bodies. Negotiations have started for loans to
private banks and Micro-Finance Institutions.

Review micro and rural finance strategy and develop action plan to improve access to micro
and rural finance
The micro rural finance strategy has been prepared in 2004 by the National Bank of Ethiopia. The
strategy is currently being implemented.

        (c) Access to urban land

Revised urban land provision adopted for Addis Ababa; including adoption of a directive
for the management and regularization of informal settlements and regularization under
implementation
A consultant has reviewed the urban land lease provision and the work is completed at the
Federal level. For Addis Ababa the provision is prepared and sent to the to the higher authorities
for decision.

        (d) Access to Telecommunication

Adoption of revised telecom policy allowing for partial liberalization of the communications
sector and commencement of implementation
The implementation of the strategy and policy formulated for the development of the sector is
currently under implementation.

3.4. Theme 4: Human Development

Goal: Education, Health: Increased proportion of Ethiopian people is healthy and educated and
enjoys a decent standard of living with access to economic opportunities.

Outcome: Increased access, completion and equity in education and improved health status of all
the people and specially the poor.

Output: Health Extension program improved

Adoption of guidelines defining the minimum package services at woreda level including
health extension program and related roles for health posts and health centers
The health extension package is implemented at three levels (1) Type A: community level; (2)
type B: Health Center level; (3) Type C: District Hospital level. At community level 2 health
workers (females) are assigned for every 5000 residents with all essential training and equipment
for immediate intervention for preventive purposes including normal delivery. Each Health center
is planned to serve 25,000 residents and is used for curative purpose. About 3200 HCs are
planned although the number at present stands at 335 to be increased to 500 by the end of
1999EC. About 2166 Health Officers are under training at present and it will be increased to 5000
in the course of implementing HSDP III (2005/06-2009/10).

IV. Sustainability of the Achievements

The Government of Ethiopia has been able to deepen and sustain the achievements of the reform
measures carried out under the series of PRSCs (SDPRP). The reform measures and
achievements just outlined are organically linked to the four pillars up on which the SDPRP and
its successor Plan entitled "A Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty
(PASDEP)" is built. The four building blocks of the SDPRP are: the Agricultural Development
Led Industrialization (ADLI) Strategy, Capacity Building for Public and Private Sectors,
Decentralization and Empowerment, the Justice and Civil Service Reform Program. The reform
measures and achievements just outlined cut-across each of the building blocks of the SDPRP,
the PASDEP and by extension the MDGs.The Government of Ethiopia has formulated the
PASDEP based on a domesticated Ten year MDGs Plan/strategy in perspective.

The sect oral MDGs needs assessment which finally was translated in to a synthesis MDGs
Plan/strategy has been the basis for the PASDEP. The PASDEP is just the first five year phase of
the Ten Year MDGs Plan. The PASDEP deepens the fundamentals of the SDPRP being at the
same time comprehensive articulating sectors that have not featured prominently under the
SDPRP such as Tourism, Small and Medium Enterprise Development and Job Creation, Urban
Development and Construction, Telecom, Energy and Mining, Population and Development,
Spatial Dimensions of growth & Rural-Urban linkages. With concrete targets in on key sectors
for the PASDEP period and by extension the MDGs, the PASDEP is now considered as a
Comprehensive Medium-term(five year) National Development Plan built on progresses achieved
during the implementation of the SDPRP(such as the achievements of PRSC I & II). The


                                             -81-

PASDEP has been discussed and reviewed at various levels with in and outside Government
including federal and regional cabinet and was finally endorsed by the Parliament following a
thorough review.

Being a natural continuation of the SDPRP, the policies and strategies being pursued under the
PASDEP are naturally built on progress made under the former (SDPRP). This is a real testimony
for the commitment of the Government and the sustainability of the reforms pursued and
implemented under the SDPRP. From the points of view of the Ethiopian Government, the reform
measures carried out under the two PRSCs operations have been its real national commitments in
its endeavor in pursuing its overriding national development agenda of poverty reduction and its
ultimate eradication. Broad-based pro-poor growth policies have been and still are at the center of
its developmental endeavor through enhancing the participation of the private sector. The
Government has pursued in earnest those reform measures and even deepened them in the context
of the implementation of the PASDEP.

During the PASDEP period, Ethiopia will build on the development strategies pursued under the
SDPRP (expanding education, strengthening health service provision, fighting HIV/AIDS, Food
Security Program, Capacity Building as well as Decentralization). It will also continue to pursue
on the ADLI Strategy this time with important enhancements to capture the private initiative of
farmers and support the shift in emphasis to diversification and commercialization of agriculture
on small holders. An accelerated growth strategy is at the core of the PASDEP. The instruments
to achieve this under the PASDEP include: construction of farm-to-market roads, development of
agricultural credit markets, specialized/menu based extension system for differentiated
agricultural zones, development of national business plans and tailored packages for specialized
export crops, supporting small scale irrigation, measures to improve land tenure security through
issuance of land holding certificates, reforms to improve the availability of fertilizer and
improved seeds, development of cooperatives that are considered to be the highest form of private
operators in the country.

In order to make a dent on the goal of rural development and reduction on the vulnerability of the
poor people, the outcome of increased income and agricultural production is based on concerted
efforts and interventions of agricultural research and extension systems in nexus with marketing
system that are together responsive and effective in transforming the rural sector. Improving the
land tenure security, arresting land and water degradation along with better environmental
management will have the capacity to bring about sustainable income growth to the rural
community.

The positive outcome envisaged due to increased contribution of private sector development to
achieve the goal of higher and more stable national income is sustained as a durable outcome
considering the emergence of the private sector in Ethiopia and its potential as an engine of
growth. The government of FDRE is committed to nurture and support the efforts of a viable and
developmental private sector.

The theme on Human Development covers a much wider cross-cutting issues and societal
concerns than is being narrowly understood related to the theme of public institutional
performance encompassing areas of governance and democracy. Thus, the outcome of increased
access to quality education and affordable and quality heath services especially for the poor can
be sustainable with durable outcome only if the district level decentralization process of
empowering local communities concerning decisions affecting their locality. Prevention of
malnutrition and childhood diseases will have long-term impact in human development in
particular and on sustainable socio-economic development of the country in general. The


                                              -82-

government has taken the necessary steps in the formulation of a comprehensive Nutrition
Strategy for Ethiopia that is integrated with multi-sectoral activities of food security, child and
maternal care and health services and healthy environment.
The fact that the suspension of Direct Budget Support operations such as World Bank PRSCs has
not disrupted the processes that lead to the formulation and subsequent issuance of the PASADEP
is a clear testimony that the Government has been able to sustain the gains made under PRSC I
& II. Independent assessments on the implementation of PRSCs have shown that there has been a
strong sense of ownership of the actions implemented under PRSCs I & II.

V. Challenges faced during the reforms under PRSCs and Beyond

Limited implementation capacity particularly at the decentralized level of administration (at
Woreda level) was the main challenge facing the government in the reform under PRSC I & II.
Building implementation capacity of Woredas is still a work in progress which has serious
implication for accelerated implementation of scaled up development programs and service
delivery.

The government of FDRE recognized implementation capacity gaps much earlier and has long
launched its Capacity Building Strategies and Program in 1998 that served as a framework for the
identification, prioritization and implementation of 14 areas of capacity building sub-components
that broadly articulated public, private and civil society's capacity building needs. In 2001, the
Capacity Building for Decentralized Service Delivery project (CBDSD) was initiated which was
later succeeded by the Public Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP) in 2005.
Implementation of the PSCAP is currently well underway. This is meant to build and enhance
implementation capacity of Regional states and Woredas.

Institutional coordination used to be a challenge in the course of implementing the SDPRP. Given
that the PASDEP was discussed at the Cabinet level (in the presence of both Regional and
Federal Cabinet) and finally endorsed by Parliament (following a thorough discussion) this has
facilitated high level ownership of the PASDEP compared to its predecessor, the SDPRP.

VI. Lessons Learnt

The process of designing the Policy Matrix following the logical framework approach (goals,
outcomes, outputs, inputs/actions) among complex activities in a program such as SDPRP has
been quite a challenge. The lessons gained and the experience acquired has wide application
across the different levels of Government and their respective executive bodies. The SDPRP
Monitoring framework has helped coordinate the activities of state and non-state actors. Now The
PASDEP Policy Matrix has been re-organized in such a way that it accommodates the
requirements of almost all donors as it was updated through consultation with the same. The
linkages to the MDGs are now well articulated in the PASDEP for almost all sectors covered by
the Five Year Development Plan.

Monitoring and evaluation has taken a longer-term view with the MDGs in perspective. This has
helped for the database for monitoring and evaluation of the SDPRP, the PASDEP and hence
MDGs to be accessible in a more user -friendly way and to be able to measure the impact of the
reform resulting from PRSCs interventions on a sustainable basis. The information requirements
of the SDPRP implementation process being huge, it has helped improve data processing and its
utilization more than any time in the past. It also helped improve partnership and working
relationship between research and higher education institutions and Government Departments.



                                               -83-

      This has also contributed to enhancement of internal technical capacity of government institutions.
      This also helped improve sect oral monitoring and evaluation systems.

      The government of FDRE takes note of its gratification to having close working relationships
      with the World Bank and its affiliated institutions as the key development partner. Being the
      leader among the DBS donors, the World Bank through its PRSC operations have taken a lead
      role in the implementations of the budget and planning reforms of the government, among others,
      in terms of budget predictability and the single tranche arrangements.

      Although the discontinuity of the PRSC operations following the aftermath of the 2005 Election
      created pressure on financing government programs, the design and implementation of the
      Protection of Basic Services Project under the leadership of the World Bank has been considered
      a well thought come back to sustain the achievements of SDPRP .

      Based on the experiences gained in the implementation of SDPRP, the government of Ethiopia
      has already passed through the implementation of the first year of the successor plan entitled A
      Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP) covering the
      period 2005/06 to 2009/10. It is mainly focused on scaling - up of the implementation of
      successful activities initiated under the SDPRP and deepening the existing and broadening new
      initiative in the reform programs that require the support of external assistance in development
      partnership.
