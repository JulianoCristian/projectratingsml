(ERSC); the Economic\n            Structural Adjustment Credit (ESAC); First Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSC I); and the Second Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSCII). These four operations were\n            undertaken within a period of less than four years. The\n            first two credits were independent operations which were\n            intended to prepare for a series of Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits (PRSCs), and the last two operations were\n            part of a projected series of three PRSC operations. The\n            overall rating of the ERSC is highly satisfactory in\n            Implementation Completion Report (ICR'S) rating; and\n            the overall outcome of the ESAC, PRSC I, and PRSC II is\n            rated satisfactory in ICR rating; and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for all four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory. The main lessons of the review as follows: (i)\n            budget support and other program assistance need to be\n            undertaken within a medium-term policy framework. This\n            lesson was learned from the first two operations prior to\n            the PRSC program; (ii) complementary investment or capacity\n            building projects may be critical to the effectiveness of\n            direct budget support through a PRSC; (iii) successful\n            programmatic budget support through PRSCs requires careful\n            preparation. Prior analytical work and policy dialogue are\n            needed to prevent misunderstandings and inconsistent\n            expectations; and (iv) direct budget support is high-risk.\n            It is vulnerable to sudden loss of political support from\n            bilateral donors and is no less subject to sudden\n            termination than policy-based lending."}, "docdt": "2008-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
