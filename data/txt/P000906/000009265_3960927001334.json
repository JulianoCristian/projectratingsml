Technical assistance\n            will be provided for institution building, including support\n            for the sector reorganization, devising a policy framework,\n            and in the design and implementation of a management\n            improvement program. Finally the project will attempt to\n            ensure, through consultation with donor groups, that funds\n            are directed towards priority rehabilitation rather than\n            pure expansion."}, "docdt": "1988-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
