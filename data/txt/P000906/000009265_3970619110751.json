           Telecommunications Project for Ghana were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, International Development\n            Association (IDA's) performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: (a) state-owned monopolies generally are\n            unable to satisfy the demand for services and to mobilize\n            the investment and skills needed to develop the\n            telecommunications sector; and (b) in today's\n            increasingly global and competitive economy, performance in\n            the telecommunications sector can be improved significantly\n            through the introduction of fundamental sector reforms which\n            allow private participation and the introduction of a\n            competitive market structure."}, "docdt": "1997-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
