In post-conflict contexts, stay focused on a\n            few essential activities even if opportunities abound.\n            Expand capacity through mentoring opportunities between\n            beneficiaries. Future involvement in the water sector should\n            bring focus on efficiency and sustainability. Project\n            outcome assessments should be continuous.
