                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the proposed project are threefold: (i) improve the availability, quality and reliability of basic municipal services and in particular, water supply
                         and sanitation; (ii) strengthen the ability of cantonal and municipal governments to improve management and institutional capacity for infrastructure
                         development through Urban Management Development Plans; and (iii) where possible, foster deeper social cohesion through improvements in overall living
                         conditions.

                         Citizens in more than 20 municipalities benefited from better water, sanitation, transport, housing, and other public services supported by the Project. Since project implementation
                         start in 2005, the number of people connected to public water supply has increased from 259,000 in 2004 to 335,000 in 2011. To date, 83,000 households have benefited from
                         rehabilitation works in the project region and the average share of people in project areas with access to 24-hour water supply has increased from 75 percent to close to 100 percent.
                         Up to 40,000 people who have not had access to safe drinking water benefited from the Project. On average, the share of people in project regions who trust their local government
                         has increased, e.g. in the Municipality of Srebrenica from 13.5 percent in 2004 to 28.8 percent in 2010. Eight water utilities were directly supported by the project; six of them have
                         established feedback mechanisms for customer satisfaction; and 76 km of pipes were rehabilitated in the project region. Six cities and municipalities have finalized urban
                         management plans; and more than 60 municipal and public utility staff were trained in municipal finance, utility tariff policy, procurement, and customer services. In sum, although
                         some activities under implementation had been delayed and required an extension of closing date, the Project has achieved its Development Objective.
