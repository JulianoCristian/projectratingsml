In 2004, only forty five percent of those\n            connected to the public water supply had 24 hour service.\n            The water and wastewater network was in dismal condition,\n            leaking up to sixty percent in some cities. Half of the\n            pipes needed replacing in the water network, and more in\n            some places. Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery\n            Project has helped to upgrade public service delivery in\n            twenty municipalities by replacing pipes and training public\n            utility staff"}, "docdt": "2011-07-19T04:48:01Z"}
