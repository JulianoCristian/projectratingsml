Although the Project has experienced some delays and required an extension of 
closing date, overall project implementation is progressing well and the Project remains 
on track to achieve impacts prescribed in the PDO. The project has been rated 
Satisfactory (S). Out of the total available funds in the amount of US$25 million, 
US$17.8 million were fully disbursed as of December 31, 2010; US$5.2 million are 
committed; and biddings process in the total value of US$2 million are currently 
underway and will be committed soon. The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by the 
closing date.  Project implementation activities under Component 3 (Investments for 
Improved Efficiency) are progressing in all regions and implementation is proceeding as 
scheduled. With support under Component 2, Urban Management Plans were prepared in 
Page  7

all participating regions except for two, and will be fully completed soon. High priority 
investments under the same component are currently implemented in all regions, with 
most of the activities underway in Mostar.  Overall, investments and technical assistance 
financed under the Project have had a positive impact on living conditions of 
beneficiaries in the targeted areas.
 
3. 
 There are no outstanding financial management or procurement issues.  The 
Project was included in the joint fiduciary review conducted during December 2009. The 
review concluded that the financial management system, including accounting, 
budgeting, and reporting, continues to be adeq
uate and satisfies the Bank's requirements. 
There are no audit reports outstanding. 
The project is in complia
nce with all environmental 
safeguards requirements.  The proposed reallocation requested by the Ministry of Finance 
and Treasury of Bosnia and Herzegovina on December 12, 2010 is necessary to allow the 
Borrower to (i) address the increased amount required for works and goods, which 
became necessary because of priority investments in Mostar identified recently under the 
urb
an management plan; and (ii) reflect the decreased amount required for consultants’ 
services, because audits carried out by local auditors are financed by the utilities’ 
budgets. 
Because of the above mentioned reasons, 
the Borrower proposes a reallocation 
of the grant funds from Category 3 (Consultants’ Services, training and audits) and 
Category 4 (Unallocated) to Category 1 (Works) and Category 2 (Goods). The requested 
reallocation of funds under the categories is expected to support the achievement of 
objectives.  
4. 
T
hi
s
will be the project’s second reallocation of proceeds.  The first reallocation 
of proceeds was done earlier to allocate the unallocated funds under the initial credit.
