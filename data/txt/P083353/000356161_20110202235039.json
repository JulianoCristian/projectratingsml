The project has\n            experienced some delays and required an extension of closing\n            date, overall project implementation is progressing well and\n            the project remains on track to achieve impacts prescribed\n            in the project development objective. The reallocation\n            requested by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of Bosnia\n            and Herzegovina on December 12, 2010 is necessary to allow\n            the borrower to address the increased amount required for\n            works and goods, which became necessary because of priority\n            investments in mostar identified recently under the urban\n            management plan; and to reflect the decreased amount\n            required for consultants' services, because audits\n            carried out by local auditors are financed by the\n            utilities' budgets. This will be the project's\n            second reallocation of proceeds. The first reallocation of\n            proceeds was done earlier to allocate the unallocated funds\n            under the initial credit."}, "docdt": "2011-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
