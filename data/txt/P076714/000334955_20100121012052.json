AND PACIFIC/A,TF039887-CHINA SECOND ANHUI HIGHWAY\n            PROJECT - PREPARATION", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7183", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Anhui Highway\n            Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: there is a need for improving traffic forecasting\n            and related economic analysis for expressways. As\n            China's road network increases in complexity and\n            provides a range of alternative routes for travelling\n            between two points, traffic forecast also becomes\n            increasingly complex and subject to a higher degree of\n            uncertainty than in the past. The forecast is especially\n            difficult in the case of expressways whose main traffic is\n            likely to be long-distance, since this requires a broader\n            network analysis and is further complicated by competing\n            expressways whose expected completion time is normally not\n            known at the time of project appraisal. Rural road\n            components in China highway project often use the change in\n            gross domestic product (GDP), before and after the rural\n            road improvements in the areas where the roads are located,\n            as an indicator of the impact of such investments. A more\n            appropriate way to assess the impact of such improvement\n            would involve measuring the reduction of poverty in similar\n            socioeconomic areas as a counterfactual, instead of, or in\n            addition to, comparing poverty levels before and after the\n            improvements. Still, the projects need to find a proper\n            balance in the selection of indicators between simplicity on\n            the one hand, and capacity to reflect the effect of\n            interventions on outcomes on the other. Many safety\n            improvements were identified and implemented during the\n            construction of the expressway and the rural roads.\n            Effective road safety improvements during implementation\n            appears to be learned from the two main factors: (i) there\n            are normally not sufficient details provided in the\n            engineering drawings, and (ii) decent technical knowledge is\n            still required to ensure that road can achieve the maximum\n            safety despite the recent major progress in the\n            understanding of road safety issues among professional\n            staff. This lesson suggests that the engineering documents\n            should be modified to ensure that all safety measures are\n            clearly described and listed in such documents, and that\n            continuous training is required on road safety design."}, "docdt": "2009-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
