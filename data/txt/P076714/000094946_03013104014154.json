SECOND ANHUI HIGHWAY\n            PROJECT - PREPARATION", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "For the adverse environmental impacts of\n            the Second Anhui Provincial Highway Project, this\n            environmental assessment describes the measures to avoid,\n            mitigate, or otherwise compensate for adverse impacts that\n            might result. Although the report elaborates on mitigation\n            measures that will be incorporated into the project design,\n            this abstract will focus solely on measures to alleviate\n            impacts during the construction and operation phases. During\n            construction, to protect biodiversity, restore temporary\n            land uses; notify forest authorities first before\n            undertaking activities in sensitive woodland areas or near\n            natural habitats; avoid noisy construction at night; define\n            protective zones or build protection/walls/slopes; carefully\n            select borrow pits and waste disposal sites; strictly\n            control wood product usage; and provide contractors\n            education and training. Other measures to control noise\n            include restricting the operation of heavy machinery during\n            the daytime, erecting temporary noise barriers, and\n            redirecting traffic during the day while banning traffic\n            altogether at night. To reduce adverse impacts to surface\n            water, use cofferdam techniques in bridge column\n            construction and completely isolate work areas; wait until\n            low flow period to do river crossing construction\n            activities; and treat sewage before discharging. To minimize\n            air pollution, spray water to suppress dust; locate mixing\n            stations and other emissions sources leeward, far enough\n            from sensitive receptors; and cover dump trucks with canvass\n            and parking places with bamboo or straw sheet. To preserve\n            cultural relics, halt work until archeologists can examine\n            \"chance finds\" and contractors will receive\n            training in identifying and protecting cultural relics.\n            During the operational phase, to protect the ecosystem,\n            build pest management stations, inspect motor vehicles, ban\n            vehicle horn blowing in places wildlife frequent, and\n            establish emergency procedures to save wounded animals. To\n            control noise impacts, prevent sensitive facilities from\n            being built with a specified distance from roads and\n            highways; and enforce traffic management and use traffic\n            signage. Enforce applicable standards for motor vehicles and\n            fuels and implement motor vehicle inspection programs to\n            reduce air emissions. Prevent vehicles leaking fuel from\n            going near sensitive water bodies; and monitor the transport\n            of hazardous materials and an emergency response system as\n            well as strictly enforce licensing and permit procedures."}, "docdt": "2002-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
