There are five project components: Component 1\n            expands highway capacity and promote regional integration by\n            constructing approximately 116 km of trunk highway.\n            Component 2 improves accessibility to low-income counties by\n            rehabilitating and improving 243 km of the Class III/ IV\n            highway network. Component 3 improves road safety by\n            upgrading selected dangerous sections (blackspots) that are\n            key to the road network. Component 4 strengthens the highway\n            management capacity of Anhui Provincial Comnunications\n            Department (APCD) through technical assistance and training,\n            including studies on construction supervision, and\n            overloading of vehicles.  Component 5 finances land\n            acquisition and resettlement."}, "docdt": "2003-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
