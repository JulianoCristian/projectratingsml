After several extensions of\n            the Loan effectiveness deadline, the Loan was allowed to\n            terminate, without having become effective, on April 11,\n            1994. The primary reason the Loan was terminated was\n            government's failure to comply with effectiveness\n            conditions related to the same agricultural trade and policy\n            issues that caused the temporary suspension of negotiations\n            in late 1991."}, "docdt": "1994-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
