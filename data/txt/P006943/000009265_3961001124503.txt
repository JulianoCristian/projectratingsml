MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TBE INTERNATI:ONAL 8MMK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIFECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR INVESTMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Costa Rica for US$41 million equivalent is submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable over 17 years including 5 years
of grace at the Bank's variable interest rate and standard charges. It would
help to: (a) improve the scope and quality of agricultural services anld
productivity of small farmers, through a sector investment and institutional
development program; and (b) develop an appropriate technical foundation for
lmproved natural resource use in Costa Rica. The project would be implemented
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), the Executive Secretariat
for Agricultural Planning (SEPSA), the Agrarian Development Institute (IDA), and
the Ministry of Public Works and Transports (MOPT). A Project Coordinating Unit
(PCU), responsible for overall project coordination, would be established within
SEPSA.
2.        Rack0Zugnd: Costa Rica's agricultural sector accounts for about 20%
of GDP and 70% of the country's foreign exchange earnings, and it employs 30% of
the country's labor force. Coffee and bananas dominate the agricultural economy
with 50% of agricultural GDP and half of the value of Costa Rica's exports.
3.        Prior to 1987 industrial protection policies discriminated heavily
against agriculture. Food self-sufficiency policies led to heavy protection of
basic grains. Consumer subsidies caused substantial losses by the state-owned
marketing agency--Consejo Nacional de la Produccion (CNP). Mandatory credit
allocations provided heavily subsidized agricultural credit at a high cost to
the Government. Under the first and second Structural Adjustment Loans (SAL I
and SAL 1I), approved in April 1985 and November 1988, respectively, mandatory
credit allocations were removed; subsidized credit granted by public commercial
banks from their internally generated tesources has been capped at the end-1986
level, in nominal terms. In addition, the anti-export bias of the trade regime
was reduced, consumer and producer prices of basic grains were unified, and
nominal protection levels for basic grains dropped to 40%. However, up to the
time of the proposed operation, quantitative trade restrictions on the import of
basic grains and beans have persisted.
4.        Significant impediments to agricultural growth remain, in terms of
ineffective public sector institutions and high public expenditure levels.
While the Minister of Agriculture--as Head of the National Agricultural Council
(CAN)--has sector policy planning and coordination responsibilities, CAN's
planning secretariat (SEPSA) is ill-equipped to provide sector-wide policy
guidance and control over budgeting and public expenditures of key parastatal
organizations (i.e. CNP and IDA).  A particular weakness in sector investment
planning relates to the lack of common criteria among MAG, IDA and MIRENEM for
land use planning, soil management and erosion control. This results in some
agricultural activities being poorly planned, poorly sited and consequently
contributing frequently to environmental degradation.
5.        Other major factors affecting growth adversely are: (a) CNP's
inefficient and ineffective intervention in food retail operations and continued
control over grain marketing and trade; (b) the high cost and multiplicity of
public institutions responsible for agricultural research and extension; and



-2-
(c) inefficient resource use in land settlements, derived from IDA's inability
to complete the settlement process (land titles and basic rural infrastructure
services).
6.        Rationale for 3ank Involvement:  Fiscal adjustment and reform of the
public sector are central compor -.ts of the stabilization program and the
adjusttent process supported by SAL I and SAL IX. A comprehensive reform of the
public sector based on a redefinition of its functions and expenditures is a
necessary step towards achieving a substantial and permanent reduction of the
fiscal gap and accelerating the integration of Costa Rica into the world
economy. The reform of public sector institutions would encourage private sector
initiatives to expand production and exports. Measures undertaken to close the
fiscal gap should be consistent with the medium and long-term development
strategy of Costa Rica, which heavily relies on the agricultural sector. Long-
term sustainable growth will not occur without investment in key areas (i.e.
drainage, flood control, titling, rehabilitation of rural roads, agricultural
services) even if an appropriate economic and administrative framework is in
place.
7.        The proposed project supports the country's development strategy by
focusing on institutional reform and rationalization of public expenditures to
reduce constraints to growth in the agricultural sector. The project builds
upon the policy changes introduced in the context of the Government's structural
adjustment program supported by SAL I and SAL II, and would help enhance sector
planning capacity, streamline administration of sector institutions, and
decentralize their operations. By supporting tight budgetary controls and the
establishment of a consistent cost recovery policy for key agricultural sector
institutions, the project would contribute to reducing and refocusing public
ricurrent expenditures in agriculture.
8.        Government recognition of the institutional and budgeting constraints
affecting growth makes this an appropriate time to support a sector reform
program. By removing trade and price distortions affecting basic grains and
boans (removal of quantitative restrictions, institution of price
liberalization, and significant reduction of the Government's role in grain
marketing), the Government will be allowing farmers to respond to comparative
advantage. Agricultural extension and marketing services will be improved by
expanding the role of the private sector.
9.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Lendina:  Costa Rica, to date, has
received 33 Bank loans and one IDA credit totalling US$680 million net of
cancellations. Of the total Bank lending to Costa Rica, four loans were made
for agriculture, amounting to US$56 million. Two loans (Loan 538-CR and Loan
827-CR) were for directed agricultural credit; one (Loan 1410-CR) was for a
nationwide program including credit, rural roads, seed production and
strengthening of the extension servicel and the fourth, the Atlantico
Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2764-CR), still under implementation, is
aimed at expanding agricultural production mainly through credit and rural roads
construction.
10.       Project lending in a distorted policy environment not only faile4 to
promote agricultural growth in Costa Rica but deepened or institutionalized
public resource misallocation. Poor project implementation has also been
related to fragmented Government leadership and the lack of a clear policy
framework for the sector. Project success depends in part on a clear link
between the commitment of the Government to carry out sector reforms and
disbursement of Bank funds. In the proposed project, this link was achieved at
the design stage by "front-loading" conditionality--that is, major policy



actions were taken prior to Board presentation. This approach was essential to
ensure political consensus for the implementation of the sector's reform
program. It is expected that the comprehensive approach to institutional and
technological change, introduced under this project, will prove to be more
effective than the piecemeal strategy applied under previous agricultural
projects in Costa Rica.
11.       Luring project design, major policy actions were identified and agreed
upon as necessary preconditions to specific sector investments. The proposed
project became the means of achieving a broad spectrum of sector policy reforms,
normally associated with fast-disbursing loans, but within the context of a
sector inveatment operation. Linking policy actions to sector investment has
significantly strengthened the position of reform-minded elements in the
Government, increasing the likelihood of successful and sustainable policy
implementation.
12.       Bank lending experience in Costa Rica was also incorporated into the
project design in the project's attention to coordination between agencies,
clearly defined project objectives, and elimination of overlapping
implementation responsibilities. Project implementation arrangements have also
taken into account the inherent complexity of addressing key subsector issues
and investments within the same operation (para. 26).
13.       Poor inter-relations between funding and executing agencies, and lack
of adequate monitoring and evaluation are being addressed by the project through
public sector reform measures, providing back-stopping for the execution of the
overall program, and by training staff in critical technical areas. Reflecting
the Government's economic priorities, the project's focus is on institutional
reform, highly selective export-oriented public investments, and poverty
alleviation.
14.       Proiect ObJectives:  The project aims to support Costa Rica's
sustainable agricultural growth by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
public sector institutions and their expenditures. It would: (a) strengthen
sector policy planning, evaluation, and monitoring capacity of SEPSA; (b) shift
public expenditures away from inefficient food distribution operations and
marketinig of basic grains towards growth enhancing services such as agricultural
research and extension, land titling, and land settlement consolidation
(including the provision of basic rural infrastructure up to specified minimum
standards); (c) support sector reforms directed at improving the regulatory
framework and economic environment for private sector development; and
(d) develop an analytical framework for the design of projects, regulations and
incentives to encourage appropriate land toe, with emphasis on soil erosion
control. By helping to regularize land rights and improving agricultural
productivity of small farmers, the project would also contribute to alleviating
rural poverty.
1S.       Protect Descrintion:  The project has three componentss  The 8ector
Institutional Develogment comnonent (45% of total project cost, including
contingencies) would: (a) strengthen CAN policy coordination and SEPSA's
coordination of sector planning and budgeting; (b) support the design and
implement an agricultural information network to strengthen planning,
monitoring, and evaluation capacity; (c) support a shift of financial and
technical responsibilities to regional offices of MAG and IDA, while privatizing
some activities, retrenching redundant staff, and strengthening critical
functions; (d) improve land use classification, assess ecosystems susceptible to
soil losses and measure the extent and cost. of the actual and/or potential



damage to the natural resource basea and (e) demarcate the boundaries cf
National Parks, Biological Reserves, and other protected areas.
16.       The agricultural esearch and Extension compone2nt (21% of total
project cost, including contingencies) would: (a) consolidate and/or foster the
emergence of privats technical assistance services for small and medium-size
producersa (b) transfer extension responsibility from IDA and CNP to XAG, making
it the only government institution responsible for public research and
extension; (c) concentrate MAG's research and extension activities on small
producers; and (d) develop a group extension approach to transfer simple and
cost effective technologies to small farmers.
17.       The LMnd Titling and Settlement Consolidation eomoonent (34% of total
rroject cost, including contingencies) would provide resources to: (a) IDA for
land titling; and (b) MOPT for consolidation of small holder settlements by
providing basic rural infrastructure such as roads and communal facilities. The
project would assist IDA to improve its organization, procedures and regulations
for land acquisition, beneficiary selection, infrastructure development, and
land titling.
18.       Xmolementation Arranoements:  A unit reporting to the head of CAN
through SEPSA and comprised of qualified consultants, assisted by local staff,
would be responsible for project coordination. Specialized executing agencies
(MAG, SEPSA, IDA, and MOPT), selected according to their experience and
capability, would implement each component. A careful analysis of key sector
institutions has been carried out during preparation to identify tasks, skills,
inter-institutional relationships, capacity gaps, and institutional
strengthening required.
19.       Proiect Costs and Financing:  The project, to be carried out over a
seven year period, would provide funds for civil works, equipment, materials,
vehicles, technical assistance, training and studies. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$70 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$29.5 million (42%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Costa Rica
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map relevant to the project,
and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 9760-CR dated February 18, 1992, are also
attached.
20.       The financial requirements of the project would exceed available local
savings, thus requiring Bank financing of approximately 30% of local costs.
Local cost financing will be necessary given the deterioration in Costa Rica's
capacity to mobilize sufficient domestic resources. The Government's
stabilization program aimed at raising revenues and reducing local expenditures,
by adjusting the fiscal accounts and implementing significant cuts in capital
expenditures, has severely constrained public investment budgets. This
situation was aggravated by the collapse in the international coffee agreement
on September 1989 and the rise in oil prices on the second half of 1990. In
addition, significant domestic public savings will be required for
rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the
earthquake that hit Costa Rica in May 1991, and floods that affected that
country's Atlantic Region on July 1991.
21.      Key Issues and Actions.  Significant policy and institutional reform
steps required under the project have already been accomplished, or action plans



for their implementation agreed.  (A) The Governr.ent confirmed the completion of
the sector's labor mobility program according to agreed targete (dismiesal of
1000 employees from MAG, CNP and IDA). (B) A decree has been issued authorizing
the Minister of Agriculture, as Head of CAN, to hold responsibility and
authority over the sector's budget and investment program review process. (C) A
decree has been issued stating IDA's and MAG's reorganization plant it specifies
tha delegation of functions, decentralization of facilities and services, and
transfer of personnel to the regional offices, according to agreed timetables.
(a) A decree has been issued stating that the Government, prior to June 30,
1992, will: (i) eliminate any quota restrictions for imports and exports of
badic grains and bean3; (ii) cause the newly established tariffs on the
importation of such commodities not to exceed a maximum of 20%; and (iii) not
intervene or fix prices of basic grains and beans. (E) Through a resolution of
its Board of Directors, CNP (which has already privatized its food retail
operations) has agreed to: (i) not undertake food retail activities nor create
any new wholesale stores} (Ui) not re-open any of its remaining four grain
storage and processing facilities; (iii) limit its annual purchases of maize and
beans to agreed targets; (iv) cause the wholesale prices of maize and beans to
reflect the full cost of storage and handling; and (v) maintain regional price
differentials in the farmgate and wholesale prices of basic grains and beans.
In addition, the Government has signed a Statement of Policy regarding occupants
of national parks and natural and biological reserves, other than indigenous
reserves. This Statement of Policy affirms the principles that boundaries will
be re-defined to exclude areas presently occupied except where such occupation
constitutes a threat to the integrity of the park or reserve. In the latter
event, the Government will relocate the occupants or expropriate the land and
compensate them as provided by law.
22.      During negotiations the Government agreed to the following actionst
(A) The Government will complete a study on the future role of CNP and implement
an action plan satisfactory to the Bank. (B) IDA will implement and carry out
all obligations as set forth or referred to in the policy letter dated October
11, 1991. These include inter-alia beneficiary selection criteria which give
women an equal opportunity to men, minimum standards for the settlement
consolidation process and a clear title transferability policy, and limitation
of the time period (3 to 5 years) for IDA's direct involvement with new
settlements. (C) The Government will cause IDA to limit further land
acquisitiona to: (i) an aggregate amount not to exceed US$3 million equivalent
per year until all lands, including those with ongoing settlements and those
which are presently vacant, are completely settled and titled; and (Li) those
lands which meet the agreed socio-economic criteria and Environmental Assessment
Guidelines. (D) Agricultural research and extension services will be
consolidated within NAG, thus eliminating duplication of functions within public
sector institutions. (3) Agronomists' professional practice will not be
*         constrained by Government regulations.  (F) IDA beneficiaries will be
responsible for the periodic maintenance of settlements complemented by routine
maintenance to be carried out by MOPT. (0) Cost recovery for MAG, IDA and CNP
services will be achieved in accordance with agreed targets and actions.
(H) Annual reviews and a mid-term review will be held in March of every year and
at the end of the third year of project implementation, respectively.
(I) Project performance will be evaluated in accordance with agreed targets as
defined in the project performance indicators which are stated in a Supplemental
Letter to the Loan Agreement. If progress is found to be unsatisfactory, the
Government shall implement remedial actions satisfactory to the Bank. (J) The
Government will make available to the respective executing agencies the
necessary counterpart funds to allow project execution in accordance with the
agreed implementation schedule.

23.       The Conditions of Effectiveness are as follows:  (a) the project
coordinating unit, and project steering committee are established and staffed;
(b) project coordinators are appointed by executing agencies; (c) the contract
between MAG and IDA has been signed; (d) each executing agency has established a
pro4ect account to cover about four months of project-related expenditures; and
(e) the Government shall haves (i) eliminated all quota restrictions to imports
and exports of basic grains and beans; (ii) established tariffs on the
importation of basic grains and beans, subject to a maximum rate of 20%, and
applied to the CI' "normal" price; and (iii) eliminated all price controls on
basic grains and beans.
24.       The Conditions of Disbursement for the respective project components
are as follows:  (a) an operational plan for the implementation of the
agricultural information network has been prepared In terms satisfactory to the
Bank; (b) the operational agreement between MAG and Banco Nacional de Costa Rica
for the implementation of the PTA voucher "pilot" program has come into effect;
(c) HAG and IDA have sold or otherwise disposed of at least 240 existing non-
operational or high maintenance cost vehicles; (d) for the third phase of the
land titling program: (i) the boundaries of those settlements have been
demarcated; (ii) land use plans and technical and economic justification for the
rehabilitation and construction of rural infrastructure for such settlements
have been presented to the Bank; and (iii) an assessment satisfactory to the
Bank of the environmental impact of the consolidation process of such
settlements has been furnished to the Bank. In respect to rural road
expenditures related to the above phase, an economic evaluation, engineering
standards and environmental assessments of expenditures related to such works
have been presented to the Bank; and (e) in respect of training expenditures
consisting of post-graduate studies, the Bank has approved the respective
proposals.
25.       Proiect Benefits:  The main project benefits would be to generates
(a) higher agricultural output growth by emphasizing Costa Rica's comparative
advantage in international markets and by providing higher quality and cost-
effective public services for the sector; (b) higher small-farmer income by
enhancing access to modern agricultural technology; (c) greater settler well-
being by regularizing land ownership rights and providing improved access to
bapic rural infrastructure; and (d) a better technical foundation to improve
natural resource use, with emphasis on developing an environmentally sound soil
management strategy. A stronger SEPSA would also be in a better position to
help formulate sound public policies. While supporting agricultural growth, the
project would contribute significantly to reducing public expenditures in the
sector. Net fiscal savings during the project life would be approximately US$42
million equivalent. In addition, the privatization of the Government's food
retail operation and grain processing and storage facilities, would reduce CNP's
operational budget by US$32 million annually (or approximately 23% of its 1991
budget, a reduction significantly greater than the value of MAG's entire
recurrent budget).
26.       Proiect Risks:  The most important risks lie on the extent of
institutional change envisioned, the multiplicity of public sector institutions,
and the complexity of the decision-making process in Costa Rica which may
constrain timely implementation of policy reforms. These risks would be
mitigated by supporting institutional development of sector institutions and
ensuring that implementation of the respective project components falls within
the ongoing responsibilities of the line Ministries or government agencies.
Particular emphasis would be given to CAN and SEPSA in terms of enabling these
entities to carry their legal mandate by improving their administrative
framework, and strengthening their technical skills and capacity to implement



- 7 -
and monitor a rigorous sector planning and budgeting process. Technical
assistance under the project would minimize risks during implementation by
providing back-stopping to SEPSA in project execution and by training staff in
specific subject matters. Prior to Board presentation, major agreed
institutional changes and policy actions have been implemented by the
Government, thus ensuring a- adequate institutional framework for project start-
up. Budgetarv risks, which may lead to slower than planned project
implementation, would be addressed by the Government through public sectcr
savings agreed under the project and the reallocation of resources within the
sector.
27.       Recommendations:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with
the Articles of the Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
