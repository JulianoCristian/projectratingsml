efficiency and effectiveness of public sector institutions\n            and their expenditures.  The project consists of three\n            components.  The sector institutional development components\n            will: a) strengthen policy coordination of sector planning\n            and budgeting; b) support the design and implement an\n            agricultural information network; c) support a shift of\n            financial and technical responsibilities to regional\n            offices; d) improve land use classification, assess\n            ecosystems susceptible to soil losses and measure the extent\n            and cost of the actual and/or potential damage to the\n            natural resources base; and e) demarcate the boundaries of\n            national parks, biological reserves, and other protected\n            areas.  The agricultural research and extension component\n            will: a) consolidate and/or foster the emergence of private\n            technical assistance services for small and medium-size\n            producers; b) transfer extension responsibility; c)\n            concentrate research and extension activities on small\n            producers; and d) develop a group extension approach to\n            transfer simple and cost effective technologies to small\n            farmers.  The land titling and settlement consolidation\n            component will provide resources to: a) IDA for land\n            titling; and b) the Ministry of Public Works and Transports\n            for consolidation of small holder settlements by providing\n            basic rural infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1992-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
