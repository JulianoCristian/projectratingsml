     Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: earmarked funding can be effective to increase\n            participation of targeted segments of community groups. The\n            validity of this lesson was demonstrated by the successful\n            implementation of the women's empowerment program.\n            Efficient use of funds for disaster relief programs requires\n            coordination with long-term development plans. Such\n            coordination is needed to ensure appropriate levels of\n            rehabilitation for infrastructure that will be reconstructed\n            at a large scale in a later stage, whilst at the same time\n            considering the benefits of short-term rehabilitation to get\n            communities 'back on their feet' and develop\n            productive activities. Flexibility in design and\n            implementation arrangements is essential for disaster\n            recovery projects. Because of a high level of uncertainty\n            during preparation, the project design should allow the Bank\n            and the Grantee to adapt to changing circumstances during\n            implementation when more information becomes available."}, "docdt": "2011-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
