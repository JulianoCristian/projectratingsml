processed in parallel with the\n            Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund. It supports\n            the same reform program, and requires the same prior actions\n            for Board presentation. This operation recognizes the very\n            significant progress that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has\n            made in improving the quality of its financial management,\n            and supports further improvements in this area. The\n            operation is intended to provide budgetary support to the PA\n            during a period of acute economic, and fiscal crisis,\n            therefore it will help leverage contributions from other\n            donors, by encouraging them to channel their funding through\n            the new trust fund. The project seeks to help the PA avoid\n            fiscal insolvency, contribute to the economic rehabilitation\n            of the West Bank and Gaza, and, help advance the broader\n            hope for peace, and stability in the region. There are\n            nevertheless, internal and external risks to the program.\n            Internally, two risks worth noting: first, it is the risk to\n            the management of funds - however, as expressed in the\n            recent Country Finance Accountability Assessment, a number\n            of improvements, i.e., internal audit, financial control and\n            payroll functions, provide assurance on eligible and\n            budgeted expenditure spending; second, there is a political\n            and administrative risk that the PA's public financial\n            management reform program, could lose momentum, and stall.\n            And, externally, there is a risk that the PA will be unable\n            to obtain enough funding to cover its revenue gap, placing\n            the operation effectiveness in doubt."}, "docdt": "2004-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
