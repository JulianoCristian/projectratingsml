The lessons learned indicate that support of\n            an already ongoing reform process provides legitimacy and\n            increases commitment to project development objectives,\n            which facilitates implementation. The Reform Fund enables\n            the Bank to accompany the Palestinian Autorities PA's\n            reform program beyond the life of the adjustment operation.\n            The Bank's AAA program played a key part in helping the\n            PA prepare and internalize the necessary reforms. The\n            adjustment operation, and the accompanying Reform Fund are\n            based on a common performance assessment framework and a\n            joint review process, which harmonize general budget support\n            of nine donors. While the overall reform program is quite\n            ambitious, the Bank kept individual benchmarks simple and\n            realistic. Benchmarks related to the security services have\n            arguably been the most difficult to implement."}, "docdt": "2005-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
