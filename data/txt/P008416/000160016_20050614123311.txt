but experienced some delays with procurement of large consultants contracts due to the
periods of political instability in Georgia, as well as due to the change of the approachto

Association'ssupport        in providingtechnicalassistance          to some of thepotential
candidatesforprivatization.       The proposedamendmentsrespondtothegovernment's
request and would not fundamentally alterthe purpose of the Project; they areintended to
facilitate successful private sector development in Georgia. The amendmentsproposed in
this regard are outlinedin the following paragraphs.

5.      Modification of theProjectDevelopmentObiective.             It is proposed tomodifythe
ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveandtoexpand                    the Projectdescriptioninorderto
accommodate the government's request and include technical assistance to state-owned
enterprises. The proposedmodificationsoftheProjectdescriptiondonotchangethe
nature and the scope of the Project's activity,but would make carrying out of,diagnostic
analysis,restructuringandbusinessvaluationoflarge               and medium-sizedstate-owned
enterprises included in the privatization list, eligiblefor financing under the Project..

6.      Adiustments in Financing      Arrangements.adjustment
                                                    The                            of the Project
descriptionwillhavesomefinancial               and procurementimplications.         The Borrower
requestedthereallocation         of theremainingfunds           under the"Unallocated"         and
"RefundingofProjectPreparation             Advance'' Categoriestothe"Consultants'Services
and Training'' Category:The          proposed adjustmentwouldallowfinancing               technical
assistance for defensive restructuringof the state-owned enterprises.

7.      ModificationtoProcurementProcedures.              In ordertofacilitatetimely        Project
implementation and completion and provide more flexibility to the Borrower in procuring
consultants'services,it      is suggestedto add one of thestandardprocedures              which is
available within the Bank's procurement guidelines (but was not originally included in
theproceduresauthorizedforthisCredit),                 i..e. SelectionBasedofConsultants'
Qualifications. proposed
              The       amendment     wouldallow                     the Borrower   to
                                                                                    procure
consultants'servicesthroughthisprocedure            in addition to theprocurementprocedures
established in the Development Credit Agreement.

8.      Costs,
             Benefits        and RisksAmendments. the
                                       after          Eachofrecommended
amendments fully
            was discussed                    between theAssociation's Project           team and
representatives of the Borrowerand is consistentwith the recommendations to theProject
team and IDA management provided by the Qualityat Supervision Assessment (QSA-6)
conducted by the Quality Assurance Group. The proposed changes to the Project would
notalterProjectassumptionsorrisks.             The Project's purpose and scope of activities
remain essentially unchanged by the proposed amendments. All proposed amendments
are introducedas direct response to the evolving reform agenda potential implementation
bottlenecks.

9.      EnvironmentalSafeguardIssues           and TheirManagement. In accordance with the
WorldBanksafeguardpoliciesonenvironmenttheProjectwasassignedCategoryC,

indicatingthatnoenvironmentalissuesareanticipated.This          is based upon the Project
designwhich     is primarilytechnicalassistance       and doesnotincludeanyphysical
construction activities. The Project does not deal with enterprises with severe problems
(including environmental ones) which can not be solved without large investments. The
proposed Project modification will not    affect its environmental assessment. In fact, the
Project is likelytohavefutureenvironmentalbenefits.         As theProjectenvironmental
assessment underscores, the general Bank experience showsthat even basic restructuring
oriented to cost accountability may have positive environmental consequences, such as
better useof energy and water, limitation of production waste, better use of materials.

10.     WhiletheProjectwillnotfinanceanyinvestments,              it willprovide  technical
assistance to state-owned enterprises and Georgian authorities. The terms of references
for consultancies will highlight relevant environmental issues, ifany, and offer guidance
on how they are to be handled. Consultant contracts will require the assistance rendered
to be consistent with Bank Safeguard Policies.The Bank's supervision of both socialand
environmentalaspectswillensure         that the advice providedbytheconsultants          to
enterprises and Georgian authorities is consistent with the Bank Safeguard Policies.

11.    Implementationarrangements. The proposed amendmentwould not requireany
changes in implementation    arrangements.
                                         The
                                         Project's monitoring
                                               existing
arrangements will also be adequate to measure implementation progress of the activities
in the proposed amendment.
