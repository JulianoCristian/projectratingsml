capacity. Furthermore, the project\n            will strengthen institutional capacity, thus facilitating\n            reform. In addition, it will support the creation of\n            associations of enterprise consultants and managers, as well\n            as small private businesses. The project consists of two\n            main components: 1) the enterprise rehabilitation will be\n            supported through non-investment restructuring of new and\n            privatized enterprises. Initially, foreign consultants with\n            a knowledge proven record from transition economies, will\n            lead the way, providing extensive on-the-job training to\n            local consultants; 2) the enhancement of managerial and\n            consulting skills, will be achieved through the organization\n            and co-financing of secondment, in leading foreign\n            enterprises. Critical risks are cited, such as a discrepancy\n            between regulatory framework and actual practice, as well as\n            a lack of implementation in the reform agenda."}, "docdt": "1998-11-25T00:00:00Z"}
