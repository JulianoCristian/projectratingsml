satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned included:\n            1) Despite a long legacy of central planning and\n            disappointing results of the first wave of privatization,\n            the ERP has produced evidence that enterprises willing to\n            accept restructuring and learn new techniques from\n            successful enterprises in more developed market economies\n            can adapt to market conditions and become profitable without\n            an additional capital investment; 2) A non-governmental\n            organization working in conjunction with Government policy\n            support can be a major instrument of change in private\n            sector development; 3) The dissemination of the experience\n            of managers attending internships and other public education\n            tools can provide a powerful demonstration effect but\n            requires follow-up and analysis to be useful in Center for\n            Enterprise Restructuring and Management's planning and\n            marketing of services; 4) Surveys show that the main reason\n            for purchasing Enterprise Restructuring and\n            Management's services was to obtain new quality\n            standards. However, in terms of effectiveness in meeting\n            client needs, the responses were highest for assistance in\n            modernizing financial systems; 5) Unprofitable enterprises\n            in transition economies, and probably non-transition\n            economies as well, can make dramatic turnarounds in their\n            performance with strategically focused\n            restructuring/business planning and/or training using\n            existing assets, without any capital investment; 6) A\n            strategically focused, non-governmental agency with varied\n            funding sources can be a powerful tool for addressing market\n            failures in enterprise development but it should be lean and\n            flexible enough to respond to market changes; 7) A results\n            framework for a technical assistance project geared to\n            turnaround restructuring and management training should\n            establish a few clear monitoring indicators and apply them\n            to a consistent sample of enterprises; and 8) The shift in\n            the Bank's design of objectives and indicators from\n            multiple objectives, with few quantitative indicators to\n            broader objectives with detailed outcome indicators,\n            provides more flexibility in responding to Government priorities."}, "docdt": "2007-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
