PREVENTION PROJECT,TFM28932-Strategic Investment  in\n            HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in Bangladesh,TFS28932-BANGLADESH HIV/AIDS PREVENTION PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the HIV/AIDS Prevention\n            Project in Bangladesh were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Lessons learned included: well\n            implemented Targeted Interventions (TIs) are the key to\n            success; therefore, having Non-Government Organizations\n            (NGOs) in place early on, with a strong NGO capacity\n            building program in place, is essential. The project\n            preparation phase, with the prospect of incoming funds,\n            should be leveraged to convince political and bureaucratic\n            stakeholders of the urgency of taking such crucial actions.\n            Piecemeal extensions and interrupted funding are disruptive\n            to project implementation; particularly in TIs among high\n            risk groups. At the field level, NGOs lose credibility with\n            the community they are serving; and when the objective is\n            long term behavior change, sudden interruptions in\n            programming can cause irreparable harm. The Bank's own\n            business model of investment support with defined\n            effectiveness and closing dates is largely to blame for this\n            situation, as it is not well adapted to an ongoing program\n            with a life span which is far longer than the World\n            Bank-financed project's. The relationship between the\n            IDA and government teams is an important one, and one that\n            is built on mutual trust and understanding. Using a\n            problem-solving, partnership approach allows even tough\n            decisions to be taken and subsequently successfully\n            implemented. Making ad hoc changes in supervisory staff, or\n            an adversarial attitude on the part of the supervision team,\n            can break down the channels of communication between the\n            Bank and government and further impede implementation\n            progress. In low prevalence countries such as Bangladesh,\n            political urgency to respond proactively to a  HIV/AIDS\n            epidemic could be low. It is crucial that political\n            commitment is demonstrated at the highest level, and a\n            network of champions developed within the system, to ensure\n            that the institutional arrangements put in place have the\n            necessary ownership, technical skill and managerial autonomy\n            to successfully implement the program."}, "docdt": "2008-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
