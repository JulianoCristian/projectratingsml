F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To control the spread of HIV infection within high risk groups and to limit its spread to
the general population, without stigmatizing the high risk groups

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

  Outcome indicators to measure progress toward the development objective were
changed several times over the course of the project. Since these changes were quite
numerous, this section will report on the final indicators agreed at the MTR, when a new
logical framework was developed, retaining the same objective, to be measured by two
PDO indicators. Annex 9 contains all the details of changes made to the Results
Framework during the life of the project and the status of the original indicators agreed in
the PAD.

Comments        The indicator was reworded at the MTR to refer to commercial sex workers,

(incl. %        MSM and IDUs. The target for the first two groups was revised to < 1 percent

achievement)    at the MTR and was changed back to < 5 percent in the May 15, 2005 ISR. ( see
                Annex 9)

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design (this section is descriptive, taken from
other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative):

1.1.     Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
         Bank assistance):

The HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (HAPP) was appraised in June 1999. Although prevalence
was low at the time of Appraisal, it was envisaged that HIV/AIDS was likely to become a major
developmental challenge to Bangladesh, since there was some evidence that it was beginning to
spread among vulnerable groups who were at high risk of contracting and spreading the disease.
1998-99 sero-surveillance data indicated that prevalence rates were still low among brothel-based
female sex workers (FSWs) at 0.6%, but rising among injecting drug users (IDUs) at 2.5%. The
risks of rapid spread among the IDUs were high due to widespread sharing of needles (96%).

The presence of other risk factors also suggested a possible general epidemic: (i) a large
commercial sex industry involving an estimated 36,000 workers, with an average of 3-4 clients
per day; (ii) high levels of sexually transmitted disease (STD), with syphilis rates ranging from
46% for brothel-based FSWs to nearly 57% for street-based FSWs; (iii) low levels of consistent
condom use, varying from 4% for brothel workers to 27.8% among street workers; (iv) largely
unscreened blood supply based on professional donors, of whom 20% had tested positive for
syphilis and hepatitis; and (v) porous borders with countries with larger rates of HIV prevalence.

Awareness of the dangers of HIV and STDs was also low: in 1996/97, only 19% of ever-married
women and 33% of men had heard of HIV, and condom use was extremely low. The lower status
of Bangladesh women also made them more vulnerable to infection.

The overall assessment was that Bangladesh had a window of opportunity for making
investments in key strategies to curtail the incidence of HIV infection even at such a nascent stage
in the epidemic by: (i) promoting safe behavior through targeted interventions (TI) among groups
most likely to contract and spread the disease; (ii) preventive measures for the general population,
such as Information, Education, Communication (IEC) campaigns; (iii) strengthening government
capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS in monitoring and evaluation (M&E), surveillance and
operations research; and (iv) building up infrastructure for blood safety and STD treatment.

Government Strategy: Government of Bangladesh (GOB) had made efforts in partnership with
bi-lateral and other donors to control the spread of HIV since the mid-1990s:
· A high level National AIDS Committee was formed and an STD/AIDS program was
    established within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) as part of the
    Essential Services Package (ESP). Action was taken to develop a National AIDS Policy, with
    an attempt to develop a multi-sectoral response to HIV. Specific action plans and guidelines
    for the National Program were also developed.
· A network of about 200 NGOs was formed, with about 50 NGOs actively engaged in HIV-
    related activities among the most marginalized and hard-to-reach risk groups, supported by
    government and development partners.
· Multi- and bi-lateral development partners, such as UNAIDS, UNDP, WHO, USAID, and
    DfID, were financing a range of HIV prevention activities, often through NGOs.

While these early efforts formed a basis for comprehensive HIV programming, they faced
significant challenges: implementation was slow; component-specific plans needed to be
prioritized; quality needed to be strengthened; and the most effective interventions needed to be



                                                  1

scaled up. Coverage of TIs among priority high risk groups was as low as 10%. It was feared that
the scale of the response was insufficient to attenuate an epidemic given the widespread existence
of risk factors.

The project was in keeping with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS; Report No.
17453-BD; date of latest CAS discussion: 03/31/1998; Progress Report discussed on 07/20/1999),
the over-riding objective of which was to assist Bangladesh to reduce poverty. The CAS
highlighted promotion of human development (health, nutrition and population, as well as
education) as a key priority of IDA's assistance strategy. The project was to help Bangladesh to
scale-up the response to HIV, thereby promoting human development and directly supporting
interventions that assist the poor.

The expected value-added of IDA support was: (i) IDA had already undertaken a key role in
developing and coordinating the Health and Population Sector Project (HPSP), and as such was
well situated to assist in developing the strategic links with other health investments in
Bangladesh; (ii) The substantial cross-country experience that was available to IDA as financier
of HIV/AIDS prevention and control projects globally would provide critical technical inputs to
the project; and (iii) IDA investments in other sectors in Bangladesh, including education, would
contribute to strengthening the necessary cross-sectoral linkages required for the HIV response.

1.2.     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) [as approved]:

To assist GOB to prevent HIV infection from gaining a larger foothold within high risk groups
and to limit its spread into the general population, without stigmatizing high risk groups.

1.3.     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), and reasons/justification:

N/A

1.4.     Main Beneficiaries, original and revised (briefly describe the "the primary target
         group" identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other
         individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project):

The project was to directly benefit: (i) groups at high risk of contracting and spreading HIV, such
as FSWs and IDUs; and (ii) other vulnerable groups at risk of contracting HIV, such as clients of
FSWs and men having sex with men. It was estimated that the project would reach about 750,000
individuals. About 40% of project costs were to be devoted to interventions to these groups.

In addition, the population of Bangladesh was expected to benefit from the preventive
interventions, such as the IEC campaigns and blood safety component. Women would benefit
from efforts to reduce their vulnerability to HIV and resulting additional marginalization. People
living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) would benefit from cost-effective care and support and drugs
for STDs. Efforts to reduce the spread of disease, thus mitigating the social stigma and economic
impact of HIV were to benefit the whole population as well.

1.5.     Original Components (as approved):

Component 1 (US$22.68 million; 43.1% of total costs): High Risk Group Interventions
This component included TIs for four priority high risk groups: (i) FSWs; (ii) IDUs; (iii) Clients
of sex workers (CLSW); and men having sex with men (MSM).


                                                  2

Component 2 (US$15.85 million; 30.1% of total costs): Communications and Advocacy
This component included interventions to create support for the HAPP by: (i) raising awareness,
knowledge and understanding among the general population about HIV/AIDS/STDs; (ii)
encouraging the mobilization of resources and commitment for implementation of the STD/AIDS
program; and (iii) reducing stigmatization of AIDS affected people. Sub-components included (i)
advocacy and (ii) public awareness.
Component 3 (US$5.01 million; 9.5% of total costs): Blood Safety
This component intended to facilitate the expansion of safe-blood initiatives, initially focusing on
funding the continuation of UNDP's Safe Blood Transfusion Project (scheduled to end in 2001)
for the provision of laboratory equipment and human resource capacity building for 97 district
and tertiary facilities.
Component 4 (US$9.05 million; 17.2% of total costs): Project Support and Institutional
Strengthening
This component included: (i) Program Management and Capacity Building by strengthening the
National AIDS/STD Program (NASP) technical and managerial capacity; and (ii) M&E and
Operations Research. The project also supported a package of policy and institutional reforms
under this component, which included: (i) strengthening of the line Directorate, ESP and other
critical MOHFW capacity in key technical areas such as procurement and financial management,
M&E, and communications strategy development; (ii) developing a mechanism to facilitate the
contracting and coordination of NGOs; and (iii) strengthening GOB's sentinel and behavioral
surveillance and operational research capacity.

1.6.     Revised Components:

There was no formal revision of the components.

1.7.     Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
         schedule, and funding allocations):

Due to serious delays in start up, and slow implementation progress, the scale of the project was
substantially reduced following re-structuring during the Mid-Term Review (MTR) (see section
2.2). The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended and $15.4 million was canceled
from the Credit on June 18, 2003, leaving $15.4 million remaining. In January 2006, a request
was made to re-allocate the proceeds of the Credit between Categories (Reallocation Memo,
January 2006); and it was agreed that funds would be reallocated from Categories 1 (Goods), 3
(Incremental Salaries and Operating Costs), and 4 (Unallocated) to Category 2 (NGOs, IEC
Activities, Consultants' Services and Training).

The original project Closing Date was June 30, 2005. The first Extension to June 30, 2006 was
granted based on the recommendation of the Joint Review Mission (April 11-21, 2005) to (i) give
an opportunity for interventions to become fully established; (ii) to strengthen the capacity of
NASP to effectively lead the national response to the epidemic; and (iii) to ensure a smooth
transition into the Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program (HNPSP). Subsequently a
further extension of 18 months was requested (A-M, April 2006). This period was to (i) further
strengthen management capacity at NASP; (ii) provide an opportunity to plan the mainstreaming
of HAPP into HNPSP; and (iii) provide an opportunity for HNPSP to bring on board the
Management Support Agency (MSA) which was to handle NGO contracting, and thus avoid any
interruption of services after the merger. The new agreed Closing Date was December 31, 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.     Project Preparation, Design Stage, and Quality at Entry (including whether lessons of
         earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigation identified, and
         adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable):

Project Preparation and Design: Clearly, the project was not adequately prepared and appraised
before it went to the Board. Project implementation plan (PIP) and implementation arrangements
were not discussed and firmed up during project preparation. Key activities were deferred to the
first year of implementation, without any plan in place for completing them; for example, the
project's Strategic Implementation Plan (SIP) was to be completed within the first year of
implementation, but had not been done two years into the project period. Since this was the first
HIV/AIDS project in Bangladesh, it was crucial that the project was clear and well-designed, with
management and coordination arrangements (particularly between the project and NGOs) laid out
in detail.

Quality at Entry: Quality at Entry is rated Unsatisfactory. Project design was based on three
unsupported assumptions: (i) That given the experience in the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition
Project and National Nutrition Program, contracting of NGOs could be undertaken by NASP
(PAD, Annex 2, pg. 39). NGO contracting under BINP was relatively small, and when it was
scaled up under the NNP, proved to be extremely problematic. Despite identifying delays in
operationalizing GOB/NGO collaboration as a risk in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD),
adequate safeguards were not put in place; (ii) That NASP had the capacity to complete the
activities assigned to Phase I and undertake the complex set of activities required to complete
preparation of subsequent phases of the project. Inadequate leadership, institutional and
management capacity were identified in the PAD as being a high risk; the mitigation measure for
this was that MOHFW would post regular staff to NASP and guarantee their continuity for the
duration of the project. However, within the government system, appointments and transfers of
staff are made at the highest level and extremely politicized; the PAD recognized this, yet the
project did not put in place any systemic solution to the problem; (iii) That there was a need to
rush the project through because of the "rapidly closing window of opportunity to prevent an
HIV/AIDS epidemic" (PAD, pg. 5). In fact prevalence among the high risk groups was low; and
some TIs among these groups were already in place, funded by DfID and USAID. While there
was definitely a need for a well designed national HIV/AIDS program to scale up effective
interventions, putting in place instead a poorly prepared project due to an unnecessary sense of
urgency actually was self defeating.

Lessons Learned and Assessment of Risk: The design of the project did take into account best
practice interventions established through global experience: (i) scaling up TIs among high risk
groups through partnerships with NGOs; (ii) expansion of advocacy and awareness efforts among
the general population; (iii) measures to reduce stigma and discrimination against PLWHAs; and
(iv) capacity building within government and NGO partners. Although a risk assessment was
undertaken as is required in the PAD, the mitigation measures put in place were not well
articulated (see above).

Participatory Processes: The project was developed in close consultation with different groups of
beneficiaries, including FSWs and IDUs at the national and local levels. Key donors, including
UNAIDS, UNDP, the HPSP Donor Consortium, NGOs, and researchers also provided feedback
on the preparation and design of the project during individual and group meetings and stakeholder
workshops.

2.2.     Implementation Stage (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review,
         Project at Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

Several factors affected project implementation progress:

Delays in Project Start-Up: The project faced serious start-up problems in the first two years of
implementation. While poor preparation was identified as an important reason for this (see
above), the Problem Solving Mission prior to MTR also identified two other issues: (i) Unclear
implementation arrangements: There was confusion within the MOHFW on whether HAPP was
part of HPSP or not. Since HAPP was being financed by a separate IDA Credit, even though an
Annual Operation Plan (AOP) was approved under HPSP, each action was being scrutinized
again for clearance; (ii) Capacity constraints: NASP lacked management, technical and
procurement capacity. Regular staff was to be appointed on a long-term basis, gradually
developing greater experience and knowledge of HIV-related issues, as well as consultants in key
technical areas. However, regular staff was never appointed to NASP; it continued to be
managed by MOHFW officials on deputation for short periods of time; there was frequent
turnover of senior staff, with the Line Director holding multiple charges; and GOB was reluctant
to hire consultants. Only one of the nine consultants agreed in the AOP was hired; this was the
Procurement Consultant, who subsequently resigned due to delays in fee payments.

Mid-Term Review and Reprogramming: The project was twice designated as a "Problem Project"
prior to the MTR. In preparation for the MTR scheduled for mid-2003, several additional reviews
were undertaken: (i) a "Problem Solving Mission" was fielded in January 2003 to not only
undertake a retrospective review of project implementation, but also to get the project back on
track (A-M of Problem Solving Mission, February 2003); (ii) a Quality Enhancement Review
(QER) was held in March 2003; and (iii) a Preparatory Technical Mission for the MTR was
fielded in March 2003.

The main issues identified by these reviews and missions were: (i) inadequate preparation of the
project prior to approval, and non-completion of preparatory activities even two years into the
project period; (ii) unclear implementation arrangements, due to the merging of this project into
the HPSP mid-stream into that program; and (iii) lack of capacity and full-time personnel within
NASP to manage the project. The QER Panel concluded that restructuring the project appeared to
be the appropriate option (Panel Report, Bangladesh HAPP QER; March 2003). The Panel
recommended that the restructuring should: (i) simplify and focus the components; (ii) simplify
implementation arrangements; (iii) ensure adequate project leadership; and (iv) develop a post-
project integration proposal.

The MTR was, therefore, used as an opportunity to undertake a major re-structuring of the
project. While it was decided that the Project Development Objectives (PDOs) remained valid,
design aspects were re-structured as follows (A-M, MTR; June 2003):

· The overall size of the project was reduced by half, and a partial cancellation of both the IDA
    Credit and DfID grant was agreed.
· A new logical framework was proposed with a new set of indicators to measure progress
    towards achievement of PDOs.
· The scope of TIs was changed, with only 5 of the planned 15 packages of TIs being retained.
· A new HIV/AIDS Interventions Fund (HAIF) was established to procure the services of
    NGOs through a simpler mechanism, also to be managed by UNICEF.
· It was agreed that UN agencies would be contracted to support the implementation of each of
    the components: UNICEF for procurement of NGO services, Communications and



                                                  5

     Advocacy, WHO for Blood Safety, and UNFPA for Project Support and Institutional
     Strengthening.
· Pharmaceuticals were to be procured through UNICEF.
· To address the issue of non-disbursal of DfID funds, funds were now to be disbursed in an
     80-20 distribution between the Bank and DfID, managed by the World Bank, based on a
     common withdrawal application.
· The DCA was amended to change the disbursement percentage for incremental salaries and
     operating costs for the remaining two years of the project to 80%.

Short-term extensions to the Closing Date: Due to delays in formalizing implementation
arrangements with UNICEF and subsequently contracting NGOs, it was August 2004 by the time
NGO activities with high risk groups got underway (A-M, October 2004). In June 2005, a one
year extension to the Closing Date was requested and granted; however, there was a three month
delay by the time the necessary clearances to maintain UNICEF as the implementing agency were
obtained. UNICEF had no facility for retroactive financing, and during this interim period, NGOs
could not be reimbursed for any activities, and hence TIs were suspended. A second extension to
the contract was granted in June 2006, but due to various procedural delays, the service delivery
agreements with the NGOs were signed finally only on December 31, 2006. This time UNICEF
did pay for some part of the operating costs of the NGOs, but did not cover program costs,
resulting in another interruption in services.

Another consequence of the piece-meal extensions was the inability of both NGOs and
implementing agencies to retain good staff. Without the assurance of longer term employment,
staff was quick to take up opportunities which were more likely to offer secure employment
(Personal communication, UNICEF Program Officer).

2.3.     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Results Evaluation Framework

The outcome indicators to measure progress toward the development objective were changed
several times over the course of the project (see details in Annex 9). While baseline values were
available for some of the indicators, no targets were set and many of them were very difficult to
collect data for in a consistent manner over time. At the MTR, a new logical framework was
agreed, which retained the same objective, with two PDO indicators: 1) % of HIV infected people
among CSWs, MSM and IDUs; 2) Prevalence of syphilis among CSWs and IDUs. Of these, the
first indicator has been tracked till the end of the project, albeit with a change in targets while the
second one was dropped in May 2005. No explanation was offered in the ISR or relevant Aide-
Memoire for either of these changes.

A large number of intermediate and output indicators were also included in the Logical
framework of the PAD and were subsequently dropped in the MTR. At the same time several
new indicators were included during the MTR and dropped in May 2005. The initial Logical
Framework being poorly conceptualized follows from overall poor project preparation; however,
poor tracking of indicators has been a problem throughout the project period.

Surveillance: The national HIV surveillance was established in 1998 by GOB. Under the project,
five rounds of sentinel serological surveillance were undertaken by the ICDDR, B. In addition
three rounds of behavioural surveillance surveys (BSS) were completed with financing from
USAID. Surveillance has been a strong component of the HAPP (A-M, November 2007) and has
provided critical information to track the evolution of the epidemic and for overall programming


                                                   6

purposes. By identifying groups at most risk it has been instrumental in sharper targeting of these
sub-populations. There is some concern that the serological surveillance may underestimate
prevalence since the sample was limited to intervention areas and accessed through NGOs.
Respondent driven sampling (RDS), a technique to obtain more representative samples of hard to
reach populations, has been successfully tested and is likely to be expanded to other groups in
future rounds.

Dissemination of the results of the surveillance has been weak mainly due to the lengthy process
of clearance required within MOHFW for sharing surveillance findings, leading to substantial
delays in release of information. The data is thus not currently being routinely discussed with
implementing NGOs to better plan and focus HIV prevention services, and triangulate
information with the data on NGO interventions being routinely collected by UNICEF.

Monitoring of NGO interventions: NASP did not have the capacity to implement the TI
monitoring plan, and the participation of NASP in monitoring visits was irregular. UNICEF
monitoring was also initially weak, but picked up after the first phase. During the last phase, a
structured system has evolved of regular meetings with NGOs to share findings of monitoring
reports and to agree on actions to remedy shortcomings identified in the field. The NGOs'
quarterly reporting covers a list of input and activity indicators: number of awareness raising
sessions, counseling sessions, condoms and syringes distributed etc.

Monitoring of the Blood Transfusion Component: The indicators for blood transfusion that were
agreed in 2005 related to percent of blood screened in the centres, and other input related ones
such as number of centres fully equipped and staff trained in screening and rational blood use.
These were revisited in August 2007 and another set of indicators recommended. Neither set of
indicators were tracked regularly nor was there any focus on monitoring the blood transfusion
centres to improve effectiveness of services.

NASP has finalized the National AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and Operational
Plan for 2006-2010, in line with the three "ones" with the assistance of UNAIDS.

2.4.    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as
        applicable):

Tribal Development Plan: The PAD identified the tribal populations of the Chittagong Hill
Tract (CHT) as being possible risk populations for HIV, as identified by a separate social
assessment. Estimates put the population of CHT at between 1 and 1.5 million: only about 1% of
total population. The MTR noted that, while it was too early to assess compliance with safeguard
policy, there was an urgent need to take actions to take into account the findings of the social
assessment conducted for the project. The MTR made several recommendations, and by April
2005 (A-M, May 2005), some progress had been made with regard to these recommendations: (i)
tribal groups were consulted when preparing IEC materials; (ii) the Surveillance Advisory
Committee (SAC) had included tribal populations in the sample of the 7th Round; (iii) three NGO
projects had been undertaken in tribal areas for raising awareness under the HAIF. A Technical
Assistance Project Proposal entitled Raising Awareness on HIV/AIDS among the Indigenous
Populations in Bangladesh to make tribal people aware of the spread and prevention of
HIV/AIDS had been prepared and was to be implemented by NASP with SIDA funding.
Subsequent IDA missions did not specifically record progress on this component in aide-
memoires. However, based on an overall assessment of progress with planned activities, the
Safeguards rating was changed from "U" to "MS" in May 2005 (PSR#12), and this rating was
maintained for the remaining project period. It appears that with no clear Tribal Strategy in place,


                                                 7

and with more pressing technical and management issues to address in the project as a whole, this
component received scant attention.

Environmental Issues: Environment Category `C' (environmental assessment and plan not
required).    The management and disposal of used needles and syringes by IDUs had been
identified during project preparation as an issue. It was expected that since HAPP was included
under the overall umbrella of HPSP, the waste management system under HPSP would include
this component. In addition, NGOs would be required to adopt safe segregation practices; and
final disposal was to be through transportation of waste in dedicated vehicles to the closest Line
Directorate Hospital. In actual practice, NGOs did collect used needles from their clients; but
final disposal was undertaken on site by burning used needles and syringes (personal
communication with NGO field workers).

Procurement: Procurement under HAPP has been Unsatisfactory. Procurement of goods and
services had been delegated to UNICEF for NGO services as well as condoms and medicines. A
Procurement Specialist was brought on board at NASP shortly after the MTR, but he resigned
within a year. Subsequently there were disruptions in supplies of goods, particularly condoms.
The gap of 3.5 million condoms in the period July 2005-February 2006 was tided over by an ad
hoc arrangement with FHI. Another Procurement Specialist was recruited in late 2006; and it is
expected that a Procurement Focal Point will be in place after the transition into HNPSP. Under
HNPSP, procurement of services for HIV/AIDS activities will be undertaken by the Management
Support Agency (MSA); and the CMSD will undertake procurement of goods, along with other
goods procured under the HNPSP.

Financial Management: Initially, the project suffered due to a lack of clarity on how funds
would flow for its implementation: although it was financed under a separate IDA Credit, it was
treated as part of HPSP for implementation purposes. Additionally, there was no provision for the
pooled co-financing of DfID, as a result of which there was complete non-disbursement of DfID
funds prior to the MTR. All these issues were clarified during the MTR (June 2003); yet in
October 2004, the Aide-Memoire recorded that financial management and reporting were
complicated by the lack of a unified financial management system for HAPP. Over the duration
of the project, financial management capacity remained weak and several audit issues that were
pending since 2003 remained unresolved. Most of the audit objections related to financial
reporting requirements of UN contracts and could have been avoided with more effective
coordination with the UN Agencies. It is expected that with the transition to HNPSP, with more
standardized reporting formats and systems, and a dedicated financial management team in place,
financial reporting will improve.

2.5.     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-
         completion operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation &
         Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next
         phase/follow-up operation, if applicable):

HAPP is now being mainstreamed into the sector-wide HNPSP. Reasonable progress has been
made towards this transition (ISR #17; 11/29/2007). Funding for HNPSP is already in place, and
allocations have been made within the program for HIV/AIDS activities.

Institutionally, the NASP will continue to function as the nodal point for HIV/AIDS activities.
Key positions at NASP have been recently filled, and it needs to be seen whether they have the
technical competence to manage the program. NASP has prepared Procurement Plans for the 3-
year period remaining under HNPSP, for which No Objection has been received from the Bank.


                                                 8

MOHFW has agreed to contract UNICEF to manage the NGO contracts for 12 more months until
December 31, 2008, after which it is expected that the Management Support Agency (MSA)
under the HNPSP will take over this activity. Given the volume of contracting to be undertaken
by the MSA, and the long drawn out procedure for doing so, involving clearances from various
parties, there is some apprehension that the transition from UNICEF to the MSA will not be a
smooth one. The financial management arrangements of HAPP will be transitioned into the
arrangements set up under HNPSP, where there is a dedicated Financial Management cell, and a
system is already in place for accounting and reporting that is acceptable to the Bank.

Technically, the globally accepted approach of focusing on TIs among high risk groups is well
accepted within the program and will continue under HNPSP. Both BSS and sero-surveillance
have been undertaken over several rounds; it is important that the MSA ensure that experienced
and high quality institutions are brought on board at the earliest for the remaining period of
HNPSP to undertake this key activity without interruption. The monitoring of the various
contracts with NGOs and other institutions remains a matter of concern, as long as NASP lacks
the capacity to do so effectively.

At the political level, the National Policy on HIV/AIDS and STD related issues was ratified in
1997, based on which various policies and/or guidelines have been developed for a range of
issues. More recently, the National Harm Reduction Strategy for Drug Use and HIV, 2004-2010
and the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV and AIDS, 2004-2010 have been endorsed. The
Operational Plan of NSP and Resource Requirement for Prevention, Treatment, Care and Support
form the basis for the rollout of the NSP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
        priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

Objectives: The objective of preventing the spread of HIV among high risk groups, and within
the general population, was and continues to be highly relevant to Bangladesh. While 1998-99
sero-surveillance data indicated that prevalence rates were still low among high risk groups, risk
factors for rapid spread were present. Globally, the Millenium Development Goals established in
September 2000 had established halting and reversing the spread of HIV prevalence as an explicit
goal for all countries; and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had begun
to support large scale prevention and treatment programs across the globe.

Design: The design of the program, with a strong focus on TIs among high risk groups, was in
keeping with global best practice. The additional components of advocacy and communication,
blood safety and capacity building were appropriate for the HIV program; and they were in
keeping with similar projects being implemented in the region and globally.

 Implementation: The implementation of the TIs through NGOs was the appropriate strategy,
 since NGOs had a strategic advantage in dealing with the marginalized communities at high risk
 of HIV infection. Implementation arrangements for the project were initially envisaged as part
 of the sector-wide HPSP; but when this was shown to be ineffective, it was changed at the MTR
 into more of a project mode, to facilitate greater focus and ownership. Partners were also
 brought on board for the implementation of key components, to strengthen the hands of the
 NASP.

3.2.    Achievement of Project Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
        linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 4):

PDO and Intermediate outcome indicators that were tracked over the project were: HIV
prevalence among high risk groups (end of project target: < 5%); proportion of high risk groups
reached by NGOs contracted under the project ( end of project target: 100 percent); proportion of
IDUs that did not share needles in the last week (end of project target: 95 percent); and
proportion of FSWs that reported using condom during last sex act with new client (end of project
target: 50 percent). The assessment of achievement of development objectives is based largely on
these indicators using data from serological and behavioural surveillance surveys. Baseline values
for 2001 are available but since project supported targeted interventions were initiated in August
2004 the analysis will focus mainly on changes during this period.

Here it is important to note that targeted interventions are also implemented through other
financing streams. HIV preventive services for high risk populations in Bangladesh have been
underway for more than a decade. In 1997/98, CARE Bangladesh, with DfID financing, initiated
interventions in Dhaka among brothel and street based workers and harm reduction programs for
IDUs, expanding to other cities and high risk groups before ending in March 2005 with the
withdrawal of DfID financing. In the subsequent period, needle exchange programs and
interventions among brothel based FSWs were entirely supported by the project. Preventive
efforts with other sub-groups of female sex workers were also implemented by Family Health
International (FHI) with USAID support, although HAPP was the larger financier for these
groups. Other high risk groups such as MSM, MSW and transgender sex workers were largely
financed by FHI. HAPP support for these populations was initiated late and covered a short
period of barely seven months. Targeted interventions supported by the Global Fund have been
initiated only recently at the end of 2007.

HIV prevalence among high risk groups: The seventh round of serological surveillance
undertaken in 2006 confirms that HIV prevalence among all high risk groups with the exception
of injecting drug users in Dhaka has remained below 1 percent (FSW <1%; MSM 0.6% using
BSS and 0.2% using RDS) with no significant change over the five rounds of surveillance
undertaken between 2001 and 2006. HIV prevalence among IDUs was less than 2 percent in all
sites with the exception of Dhaka. In Dhaka, prevalence rose from 1.7 % in 1999 to 4 % in 2002
and in 2006 to 7 percent marking the first concentrated epidemic among any high risk group in
Bangladesh. The epidemic was localized to a sub-region in Dhaka where prevalence has risen to
10.4 percent as compared to prevalence of 1 percent in other part of the city. Overall levels of
prevalence among the general reproductive age population is less than 0.1 percent as would be
expected given the low prevalence among most at risk populations and the protective effect of
high levels of male circumcision.

Syphilis prevalence among high risk groups: Active syphilis rates have fallen among most high
risk populations. Between 2003-04 and 2006 a significant decline in active syphilis rates was
noted in brothel based sex workers, street based female sex workers in Dhaka and among IDUs in
Dhaka and Rajshahi. Active syphilis rates among brothel workers ranged between 3.2 and 12.2
percent in 2003-04 while the comparable range for 2006 was 0.4 to 6.3 percent. Active syphilis
rates also declined among Hijras, but remained similar in MSM and MSW. There has been little
change in syphilis prevalence of street based workers in Chittagong and hotel based workers in all
three major cities.

Behavioural Indicators: Progress on behavioural outcomes is mixed and varies by high risk
groups and location (Tables 1&2).         Needle sharing among IDUs worsened or remained


                                                10

unchanged in the cities sampled for BSS with the exception of Dhaka. In Dhaka which has the
highest concentration of IDUs and is the main centre of the epidemic there was considerable
reduction in reported sharing from 85 to 55 percent. Despite the improvement the majority was
still using unsafe injecting practices, i.e. the reduction achieved is not enough for lasting program
impact. Condom use rose substantially between 2003-04 and 2006-07 in most groups of female
sex workers. The increase is particularly notable among street and brothel based FSWs while
modest or little change was observed among FSWs working in hotels in Dhaka and Chittagong.
Hotel based workers are specially vulnerable to HIV as they have the highest number of clients;
mean number of clients in the last week for hotel based workers in Chittagong and Dhaka was 61
and 42 respectively as compared to 19 for brothel based workers and between 8 to 15 for street
based workers in Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna.

The evidence does not in some cases indicate the expected linkage between condom use and
changes in syphilis prevalence. While a falling trend in syphilis prevalence is noted for brothel
based workers and street based workers in Dhaka, substantially higher condom use particularly
among street based workers in Chittagong was not associated with a significant decline in syphilis
prevalence.

Coverage: The BSS monitors coverage as reported by high risk populations in select cities with
the highest concentration of particular risk groups. A comparison of BSS data for 2004 and 2006
indicates that exposure to interventions reported by IDUs and FSWs declined in all cities and sub-
groups with the exception of IDUs in Chandhpur where an overwhelming majority was involved
in the needle exchange program and street based workers in Chittagong where reported coverage
increased dramatically from 42 to 87 percent (Tables 1 & 2). Lower levels of exposure could be
due to the timing of the survey from November 2006 to February 2007 that overlapped with the
transition period between phase two and three of the UNICEF contract from June to December
2006. The transition and the associated interruption in financing would have adversely impacted
on field level activities. An additional problem could be the fact noted in the BSS report that the



                                                   11

surveillance was preceded by a clean-up drive as well as political unrest that would likely have
lead to dispersion of street based high risk populations such as IDUs and FSWs making them
more difficult to reach.

Exposure to needle exchange programs reported by IDUs was still reasonably high ranging
between 73 and 98 percent. Mean number of contacts with the interventions over the past month
varied more markedly across sites from 15 and 11 in Chandhpur and Dhaka, respectively, to less
than 3 each for Rajshahi and Chapinawabganj. The latter two cities also saw an increase in needle
sharing. In 2006/2007, even in the better served cities, the impact on needle sharing is not
evident, reflecting on the poor quality of the contacts, particularly the adequacy of syringe and
needle distribution. Estimates derived in the NGO Performance Audit indicate that roughly 23
needles/per month/per IDU were supplied during 2007 on the assumption that these were only
provided to IDUs and not the larger population of drug users which is also covered by the
interventions (Performance Audit 2007). The average estimates hide irregular supply of needles
and syringes over the year. According to NGO monitoring reports the supply of needle/syringes
was significantly lower in the first quarter of December to Februray 2007, the initial start-up
period of the third phase, more than doubled over the second quarter and increased by another 40
percent in the third quarters (UNICEF 2007).

Despite lower reported coverage, condom use improved remarkably among brothel based and
street based FSWs in Dhaka as well as Khulna. Although exposure to interventions had decreased
over the previous round, more than half of street based workers (56 percent in Dhaka and 53
percent in Khulna) and three fourths of brothel workers reported contact with prevention efforts.
In general, participation of FSWs was highest in the education component of the program on
HIV-AIDS, safe sex and correct use of condoms but they were not so dependent on NGOs for
condom supplies;in the previous month the majority of brothel based (77 percent) and street
based workers in Dhaka (61 percent) relied on shops or pharmacies for their supply of condoms.

An assessment of country-wide coverage of interventions of high risk groups has been initiated
on the basis of a consultative process involving NGOs, government organizations and research
institutions. In the absence of comprehensive mapping information, the likelihood of error in size
estimates is considerable. Preliminary estimates suggest 100 percent coverage of brothel based
workers, 51 percent for IDUs while the scale of preventive services for street based FSWs,
MSM/MSW and transgender is limited at 18, 15, and 10 percent respectively. Nationwide
coverage of hotel based workers at 90 percent is contrary to findings of BSS of very low exposure
to interventions even in the main urban centres of Dhaka and Chittagong. The estimates are being
re-examined currently by a group lead by UNAIDS and including the Bank.

3.3.     Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate
         norms, least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return):

No economic analysis was undertaken during project preparation.             Instead of ex-ante cost
effectiveness analysis, the PAD indicated that the project would finance monitoring and
evaluation of costs and effects of specific interventions, which would contribute to a meaningful
economic analysis in the future. This was not undertaken during the course of the project.

Efficiency is rated as modest. The project appropriately prioritized preventive interventions
targeted at high risk populations that are most cost effective in a concentrated epidemic. Targeted
interventions accounted for 46 percent of total project costs. Expenditure by high risk groups are
not readily available but rough estimates for 2007 provided in the Performance Audit of NGOs
indicate that the package for injecting drug users/heroin users accounted for roughly 50 percent of


                                                 12

total expenditures on preventive programs for high risk groups in 2007 (HLSP 2008). Heroin
users who occasionally inject and are at much lower risk comprised roughly two-third of the
targeted population covered by the services. The delay in initiating the recruitment of NGOs,
short term contracts with gaps in funding and associated uncertainties and fluctuations in field
activities diluted the impact of preventive efforts on behavioural outcomes particularly among
groups that were most at risk including IDUs and hotel based sex workers.

3.4.     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs,
         and efficiency):

          Rating:    Moderately Unsatisfactory

Although the PDO remains highly relevant to the country context, corporate goals and global
priorities and the project's development objective has been met, the evidence on intermediate
indicators of behavioural change and coverage suggest that it is impossible to ascribe the outcome
to project interventions alone. Prevention efforts have had limited effect on changing behaviours
of groups of the greatest epidemiological importance to the epidemic such as IDUs, hotel based
sex workers and transgender workers. Additionally the evidence points to inefficiencies due to
short term contracts particularly for IDUs that not only led to fluctuations in coverage but also
negatively affected quality particularly of harm reduction services through irregular supply of
needles and syringes. The project however did contribute to safer behaviours among select
groups of sex workers. The increase in reported condom use along with data on declining STI
rates for brothel based workers nationally and street based workers in Dhaka suggest that
interventions have been effective in reducing risk behaviours in these populations. As noted
earlier interventions for street based sex workers were also implemented by FHI.

3.5.     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered
         or to amplify discussion above):

         (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

. See section 3.2.

         (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on
             longer-term capacity and institutional development):

It had been envisaged that the project would be implemented as an integral part of the HPSP,
through government entities, NGOs and other private sector organizations. No separate
implementation unit was to be created (PAD; pp 18).            However, as part of HPSP, the
implementation concerns of the larger sector-wide program completely overshadowed the
objectives and challenges of the HIV program; and a separate project management unit was set
up. Institutional capacity has been an on-going area of concern: in December 2002, the IDA
review team (PSR#5) pointed out that "Weak management, low implementation capacity and lack
of motivated staff have been the most critical underlying causes for lack of implementation
progress". This situation did not change substantially throughout the project (A-M, November
2007). The expectation that HAPP could manage the contracting of NGOs was unrealistic: the
experience under the Bangladesh NNP had also shown that this was a difficult area for which
GOB had limited capacity. The capacity of NASP/GOB to provide on-going oversight and
monitoring of NGO contracts was also limited, and there is some evidence that this could have
lead to mismanagement of funds in some cases (see note: BWHC Corruption Issues 060508,



                                                 13

internal memo, Bangladesh HNP team).

Associated with this are questions regarding the political commitment to the program within
GOB (specifically MOHFW): although some major policy decisions were taken, delays in
granting clearances for key activities such as the extension of the UNICEF contract, and frequent
transfer of key officials, seem to indicate a lack of ownership of the program. Repeated requests
(A-M, June 2003; April 2006) that GOB demonstrate long-term commitment to the program by
undertaking an Functional Task Analysis (FTA) have not led to the desired results.           The
recommendations of the FTA undertaken by UNFPA have not yet been accepted or implemented
by the NASP/MOHFW.

With specific reference to the UNFPA efforts towards capacity building of NASP, from
September 2003 until March 2007, under the contract (i) about 252 person months of local TA
and 4 person months of international TA were provided; (ii) 13 pieces of technical work were
produced very largely with their support, including technical guidelines and support materials
essential to the project and program; and (iii) a FTA was completed, which provided an analysis
of the capacity building needs of NASP and recommendations. However, an assessment of
UNFPA's efforts conducted by the Bank in April 2007 concludes that very little was
accomplished by way of long-term institutional strengthening of NASP, although this was
repeatedly raised as an issue by various Bank/DfID missions.

        (c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):




HAPP laid the foundation for the development of the national program, managed through the
NASP office. This resulted in the development of the national response to HIV/AIDS, as well as
the beginnings of some stewardship capacity; and provided an opportunity to develop the
capacity to work with international agencies, particularly the UN, in a coordinated manner. The
capacity built through the project was instrumental in drafting the successful GFATM proposals.

3.6.    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops (optional for
        Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

        N/A

4. Rationale for Rating of Risk to Development Outcome

         Rating:    Moderate



Financial. Apart from HNPSP, several other sources of funds are also available ­ USAID
through FHI, and GFATM (Rounds 2 and 6) through Save the Children, USA. Bangladesh has
also been invited by GFATM to participate in Round 7. The total amount of funding for
HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support, and treatment, from various sources is now substantial.

Institutional. HIV/AIDS prevention is a very small part of the larger HNPSP, and there is a real
danger of it falling between the cracks. The program will soon face the challenge of having to
identify the genuine high-risk groups (i.e. IDUs and not heroin smokers), substantially scale up
TIs among these groups, as well as develop content for several core components. With the



                                                 14

addition of GFATM Round 6 funds, coverage of vulnerable groups is expected to double, thereby
increasing the challenges of coordination, stewardship and management. Given the volume of
funding flowing into Bangladesh from multiple streams, there is a real danger of duplication and
mismanagement, given the lack of both technical and managerial expertise within NASP.

Technical. The very high level of male circumcision in Bangladesh, practiced for religious
reasons, makes a generalized epidemic unlikely. However, other risk factors ­ high levels of
commercial sex work, low condom use, pockets of IDUs ­ do exist, and require a coordinated
response. While the technical paradigms in place for TIs are sound, coverage is still an issue of
concern. No comprehensive mapping has been done to estimate the denominators for various
high risk groups; and it is not possible to tell what proportion of high risk groups are currently
being covered, and how much of a scale-up is really required. Surveillance has been well done
within the current framework; however, it is confined to areas where TIs are already being
implemented, and this methodology will require re-thinking. The ability to guide and manage the
revised surveillance system is not available at NASP, and any delays in contracting a competent
agency to undertake this activity will seriously undermine the evidence-base for interventions in
the country. Components such as the Advocacy and Communication and the Safe Blood program
were not well implemented under HAPP, and it is not clear how HNPSP will ensure that they will
be better done henceforth.

Social. Bangladesh is a conservative society, and while substantial progress has been made with
regard to addressing issues of vulnerability, stigma and discrimination among high risk groups,
more widespread IEC and advocacy have not yet been implemented. National level networks of
FSWs exist but are not very active, and no coordinated programmatic approach has been
developed under HAPP to develop and involve community groups. However, there are strong
NGOs on the ground, with the capacity to work closely with the high risk communities with
quality interventions.

Political. A detailed review of the Policy Environment was recently undertaken ( Towards a
coordinated national response for Targeted Interventions in Bangladesh: A brief review and look
forward. Tony Bondurant et al; World Bank consultants' report; November 12, 2007), which
concluded that "the necessary policy building blocks exist, although implementation is limited in
some areas". Major policies have recently been adopted that will provide an enabling
environment, if implemented; and GOB has been taking a pragmatic and evidence-based
approach to HIV prevention; a good example is the wide implementation of the needle-sharing
program for IDUs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
    outcome issues)

5.1.    Bank

        (a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through
             lending phase):

          Rating:   Unsatisfactory

Quality at Entry is rated Unsatisfactory. It is the general consensus of Country Management and
the independent reviews that the project was poorly prepared. The PSR dated 12/22/2002 carries
the following comment from the Manager: "The project's implementation performance
demonstrates once again the impact of project quality at entry. However, the project was not


                                                 15

adequately prepared and appraised before it went to the Board. Project implementation plan (PIP)
and implementation arrangements, including project management arrangements were not
discussed and firmed up during project preparation. The fact that all these critical project
preparation activities were deferred to the first year of project implementation proved to be a
major failure and will continue to impact on the project performance for the remaining project
period...". This view was fully supported by the Problem Solving Mission and the QER Panel,
which squarely held poor project preparation responsible for a large part of the problems faced by
the project during the initial phase.

        (b)       Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

          Rating:     Moderately Satisfactory

Quality of supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The initial delays in project start-up
were largely due to poor preparation; but could also be attributed to the Bank's wanting to
mainstream the project into the sector-wide program, which caused the loss of focus and
ownership of HAPP both within GOB and the Bank. However, when it became clear that the
project was seriously faltering, the Bank did take proactive steps to address the issue: a Problem
Solving Mission, followed by a QER were undertaken shortly prior to the MTR to add value and
provide guidance to the MTR process; and based on the recommendation of these missions, re-
structuring was undertaken in a proactive manner, and an attempt was made to put the project
back on track. The MTR was used as an opportunity to set realistic goals for the project and to
scale down project activities to fit within the reduced timeframe. Subsequently, the project did
benefit from advice and technical assistance from the team, and was able to improve
implementation performance as a result.

Joint Review Missions were undertaken along with DfID and UNAIDS, conducting a
comprehensive review of project implementation, as well as analysis of available data. Issues
faced during implementation were documented in the Aide Memoires and PSR/ISRs. There was
a period prior to the MTR when documentation was perfunctory (PSR #04), and the Manager's
Comments section reflected managements dissatisfaction; however, this was not repeated. Project
ratings were fair, and reflected the assessment of the mission; they were responsive to changes in
project status.

However,
· There were 7 changes in Task Team Leaders (TTLs) over the course of the project. This lack
    of continuity caused disruptions in dialogue with the government and in some cases led to
    differing advice. For instance the package for male sex workers, a group widely recognized
    to be most at risk, was dropped during the MTR as being "too sensitive" and included again
    in the last phase of the project.
· Although the MTR attempted to get TIs off the ground, this was problematic: due to the
    procedural lags involved in contracting UNICEF and then the implementing NGOs less than
    a year was left in the project period by the time the TIs were initiated. Given that HIV
    prevention interventions deal with sensitive socio-economic, gender and behavior change
    issues, the Bank should have explored options early on to ensure continuity and longer-term
    engagement, particularly for TIs.
· The subsequent short term extensions further compounded the uncertainties; here again, the
    timing of the extensions was determined by the constraints of the HNPSP, and not the best
    interests of the activities initiated under HAPP.
· The design and follow-up on the Results Framework has not been systematic. Some



                                                  16

    indicators included in the PAD were never reported on; many indicators had no targets set;
    and many were re-worded without explanation. In addition some of the targets were overly
    ambitious and not adjusted in line of the reduced time frame of interventions such as 100
    percent coverage and 95 percent of IDUs not sharing needles by end of project.

        (c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

          Rating:      Moderately Unsatisfactory

         Since preparation was Unsatisfactory and supervision only Moderately Satisfactory; and
        Development Outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory; overall rating is Moderately
        Unsatisfactory.

5.2.    Borrower
        NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide
        rating and justification only for Overall Borrower Performance.

      Click here if the Government and the Implementation Agency is the same or indistinguishable


        (a) Government Performance:

         Rating:       Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project was managed on behalf of GOB by the National AIDS and STD Program (NASP).
Government performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory:

· There was no movement on any of the components for the first two years of project life,
    largely due to lack of leadership and ownership of the project within the NASP.
· Capacity at NASP for managing the project was an on-going concern. There were frequent
    changes in leadership at the level of both Line Directors and Director General Health
    Services, leading to lack of knowledgeable oversight. Several activities suffered as a result,
    including extensions of the UNICEF contract, and as a result, NGO contracts.
· Professional posts, that ought to have been filled with specialists, were filled with a mix of
    MOHFW out-posted staff, contract staff and consultants, all with different loyalties and
    different pay structures. As a result there was no cohesive and functional team.
· The work itself was carried out by UNDP-contracted consultants who were to assist the
    NASP team. Instead, they did NASP's work and NASP staff missed an opportunity to
    strengthen their skills by working together with the consultants.
· The capacities of NASP were further over-stretched by having to not only manage the
    program but also try and coordinate among donor partners over current and future programs.
    As a result, both activities suffered.
· Both technical and managerial supervision were weak. PMU staff rarely went to the field;
    and in any case, many were not technically competent to provide useful guidance.

Despite this, NASP was able to push through important policy initiatives, as well as a large
number of guidelines and standards for service delivery. They have also been able successful in
repeatedly mobilizing a large amount of funding and support from international agencies such as
the GFATM. The Program also deserves some credit for being open to the innovative solution of
using a UN Agency for managing the contracting and monitoring of NGOs. NASP has also
managed to complete many of the preparatory activities for mainstreaming HAPP into HNPSP,


                                                 17

such as the Operational Plan and Procurement Plan.

        (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

           Rating:  Moderately Unsatisfactory

The UN Agencies and NGOs were involved in the implementation of various components. The
assessment of the UN agencies' performance should be seen in the context of the fact that they
agreed to take on a role that was outside their mandate and area of expertise (particularly in case
of UNICEF and UNFPA) in a last ditch effort to salvage the project.

UNICEF (NGO contracting and IEC): UNICEF performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
37 NGOs, grouped in 12 consortia, implemented the TIs among various high risk groups
identified under HAPP. During the second extension phase, the consortia covered a target
population of 109,229, including IDUs and heroin smokers (31%), SBSWs (5%), BBSWs (4%),
HRBSWs (8%), MSM (6%), and CLSWs (46%). From 2003-2006, UNICEF also managed the
HAIF, which provided small grants to NGOs and Community Based Organizations. This was
discontinued in 2006 due to high management costs, limited evidence of impact and poor
targeting. There were gaps in service delivery due to the delays in government clearance of
extensions and to UNICEF procedures that did not allow for retroactive financing. Despite
managing the contracting of NGOs over a period of 3 years, UNICEF has not been able to
develop reliable costs for each package; and given the current variation in costs, it is evident that
there is also a variation in the content and quality of services being offered by different NGOs.
Capacity building of implementing NGOs was undertaken in an ad hoc manner. However, TIs for
high risk groups, implemented by NGOs contracted by UNICEF and others, have been the central
focus and backbone of HIV prevention efforts in the country (A-M, November 2007).

In terms of communications, the main output of UNICEF was the National HIV/AIDS
Communications Strategy 2005-2010, produced by the Johns Hopkins University. The strategy
and implementation plan have mixed advocacy and awareness-raising without prioritization or
clear goals. Stakeholders were not adequately involved in the process of developing the strategy,
as a result of which there is little ownership and interest in implementing the recommendation.

UNFPA (Capacity Building): The performance of UNFPA is rated Unsatisfactory. The specific
objectives of the UNFPA contract were to: "achieve a strengthened institutional response within
the MOHFW and the NASP to lead and coordinate national efforts...; effective management and
administrative support...; intensified and scale up interventions; improved institutional capacity
within other key ministries; broader base of technical expertise available in Bangladesh..."

A final assessment of the UNFPA "Capacity Building" contract under HAPP was undertaken in
April 2007. The assessment observes that not much progress was made in developing the
organizational and management structure that should have served as the basis of capacity building
and concludes that very little was accomplished by way of long-term institutional strengthening
of NASP. There was a complete mismatch between the expectations of the Bank/DfID and the
understanding within UNFPA of its role vis-à-vis capacity building under HAPP; UNFPA was of
the view that management/organizational issues were not part of the contract while the funding
agencies expected UNFPA to take the lead in analysis of organizational tasks, proposing options
and actively advocating for solutions. The ambitious objectives of the TA were beyond the
technical capacity of UNFPA and the situation was further compounded by the fact that MOHFW
did not allocate sufficient or adequately qualified counterparts at NASP reflecting a lack of
government commitment and ownership. A part of the failure to perform could also be ascribed


                                                  18

to lack of a support from UNICEF, UNAIDS and WHO (A-M, Joint Review Mission, April,
August 2006) in the effort to get NASP to be more proactive in coordinating the activities of
various agencies.

As elaborated in Section 3.5 (b) the TA did contribute to the program through several pieces of
technical work some of which were of high quality including the STI guidelines and the harm
reduction strategy.      It was less successful in developing implementation plans for the
communication and advocacy strategy.

WHO (Blood Safety): The performance of WHO is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.                 The
specific objectives of the WHO contract were to strengthen capacity of 19 blood transfusion
centres through ensuring mandatory blood screening including quality assurance, rational use of
blood and increasing voluntary blood donations. WHO was also to provide supplies to continue
screen in 79 other centres.

An expert assessment of the safe blood transfusion component was conducted at the end of
project in November 2007. The assessment found that although the centres were well equipped,
good quality supplies were used for testing and managers and medical staff had been trained, little
attention had been paid to make effective use of these inputs to improve blood safety
management and quality assurance in any of the centres visited. The equipment was installed in
unsuitable premises because the planned refurbishment of the centres could not be completed
over the three year period and there was no planning for service maintenance of the equipment.
Improvement in voluntary blood donations was limited. Despite extensive training of a large
number of staff there was little change in practice due to the lack of a system of mentoring and
supportive supervision of the trainees. Part of the problem was that the Government did not
assign a counterpart from the Ministy. International TA provided by WHO comprised of brief
visits by four different consultants who often provided differing advice.

The limited progress was attributed to the lack of focus on monitoring and improving
effectiveness of inputs, little oversight and sustained guidance of the project by an international
expert as well as to the short term repeated contracts that were conducive to an input based
approach. The assessment concluded that "despite some improvements in provision of numerous
inputs under the SBTP program in the previous 3 years, progress on improving standards of blood
safety had not been satisfactory....."

NGOs (Implementation of TIs): The performance of implementing NGOs is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. 130 Drop-In Centers (DICs) formed the core of the intervention, and were set up at
all intervention sites. Peer Educators were used to communicate with the target groups.
Awareness raising activities were undertaken with both high risk groups and the general
community, as also STD treatment and other referral services, condom distribution and needle
exchange. However, many intermediate indicators of service delivery show variable results.

        (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

          Rating:    Moderately Unsatisfactory

Although government commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts has been growing, this has
not been reflected in more human and other resources being allocated to the prevention program.
Capacity within the program to manage key activities such as NGO contracting, financial
management and procurement of goods continues to be weak. However, there is a strong



                                                 19

partnership with capable grassroots organizations across the country, as well as with other donor
partners. This could serve as a good basis for scaling up the program in future.
It is commendable that Government took a strong public health approach and dealt with normally
marginalized groups in society in a professional manner in order to combat HIV.

6. Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

During Preparation

Ensure that key actions are taken during project preparation to ensure readiness for important
project components. Well implemented TIs are the key to success; therefore, having NGOs in
place early on, with a strong NGO capacity building program in place, is essential. The project
preparation phase, with the prospect of incoming funds, should be leveraged to convince political
and bureaucratic stakeholders of the urgency of taking such crucial actions.

Ensure that available capacity is adequate to handle additional challenges. Leaving the bulk of
detailed preparation to project authorities after the project has been declared effective is not
advisable, especially when available capacity has already been assessed to be inadequate.
Detailed preparation of project components requires technical and managerial capacity which
may need to be contracted.

During Implementation

Ensure that institutional development is built on the political will to address the critical needs of
the program response to HIV/AIDS. In low prevalence countries such as Bangladesh, political
urgency to respond proactively to an HIV/AIDS epidemic could be low. It is crucial that political
commitment is demonstrated at the highest level, and a network of champions developed within
the system, to ensure that the institutional arrangements put in place have the necessary
ownership, technical skill and managerial autonomy to successfully implement the program.

Avoid interruptions in funding to projects. Piecemeal extensions and interrupted funding are
disruptive to project implementation; particularly in TIs among high risk groups. At the field
level, NGOs lose credibility with the community they are serving; and when the objective is long
term behavior change, sudden interruptions in programming can cause irreparable harm. The
Bank's own business model of investment support with defined effectiveness and closing dates, is
largely to blame for this situation, as it is not well adapted to an ongoing program with a life span
which is far longer than the World Bank-financed project's.

Facilitate absorption into the sector program. Having a sector-wide operation in place to absorb
the interventions of the current project, as in the case of the HNPSP, is one way to ensure
sustainability of project interventions. However, this needs to be planned well so that the start-up
difficulties and other constraints being faced by the larger operation do not negatively impact the
current project. In this case, if HAPP had been provided a one-time extension of a longer period
based on a realistic timeframe for the readiness of HNPSP to absorb it, the disruptions could have
been minimized.

Ensure continuity of staff. Having a revolving door with MOHFW officers on short-term
deputations occupying technical positions only denies the project technical expertise. In the long-
run, there needs to be a strong technical cadre within the PMU that can advice the PD and keep
the project on track. In the absence of a dedicated cadre of staff technical assistance for capacity
building cannot be expected to yield sustainable results.


                                                   20

Continuity of IDA supervision staff is also important. The relationship between the IDA and
government teams is an important one, and one that is built on mutual trust and understanding.
Using a problem-solving, partnership approach allows even tough decisions to be taken and
subsequently successfully implemented. Making ad hoc changes in supervisory staff, or an
adversarial attitude on the part of the supervision team, can break down the channels of
communication between the Bank and government and further impede implementation progress.

Partnerships should be carefully assessed for continued relevance. Circumstances sometimes do
drive the establishment of partnerships; but over a period of time, such partnerships should be re-
assessed to ensure that they continue to be relevant. For example, NGO contracting may never
become a core competency in government; in this case, establishing a partnership with a
contracting agency maybe a more effective strategy. However, when the area of partnership is
not the core competency of the partner organization, clearly they should not continue to be
responsible for that activity. For example, the partnership with UNFPA was evaluated and
terminated because it was not yielding the desired results. In the case of ICDDR, B, the
partnership was extremely beneficial, since the technical area was one that was clearly the strong
point of the partner organization, and they were performing effectively.

For Future Operations

HIV is a longstanding issue and sustained effort will be required to tackle it. The response to HIV
will need to be well orchestrated and long term. With HAPP being mainstreamed into the
HNPSP, it is essential that HIV/AIDS issues continue to receive high priority, even though they
will form a small part of the larger operation. The Bank Team and GOB should ensure that: (i)
TIs focus on the most at risk groups, as identified by the technical review of targeted
interventions ­ IDU, FSW, MSM, MSW and Hijras ­ rather than spreading resources thinly
among groups that are less crucial to controlling the epidemic; (ii) a comprehensive package is
implemented among these groups, ensuring full coverage of core interventions; and (iii) funds
from various sources (UNICEF, SC/US, FHI) are coordinated to minimize duplication and at the
same time ensure that no group falls between the cracks.

         Annex 2.        Outputs by Component

    1. High Risk Group Interventions
The objective of this component was to limit the transmission of HIV infection among those populations with the
highest prevalence of risk behaviors and from those groups to the general population.

Progress at end of project: 45 NGOs through 14 consortia were contracted out to implement 6 packages between
2004 and 2007. UNICEF was the management agency dealing with NGO contracts. The 6 packages were street-
based sex worker, brothel-based sex worker, hotel and residence-based sex worker, drug users, transgender/ men
who have sex with men, and clients of sex workers. A total of 145 drop in centers was established covering 46
districts of the country. The high risk intervention packages included condom promotion, STI management,
needle/syringe exchange, detoxification, peer education, health education / counseling, resting/recreation facility,
community awareness and local level advocacy. Supplies such as syringes, needles lubricants and condoms were
delivered to NGOs as per the standard procurement plan agreed between NASP and UNICEF. There is some
evidence to show that there was a drop in supply when there was interruption in the contracts due to piecemeal
extensions (A-M; November 2007). STI management guidelines for high-risk groups were distributed to all
NGOs by NASP in order to ensure harmonization of the treatment of STI. Training on STI management and
record keeping was provided. Joint monitoring visits (GoB/NASP/UNICEF) were carried out to assess the
functionality of the services and to identify need for support and areas for improvement.

Source: Performance Audit of NGO Implemented Activities under HAPP. PRDA; February 2008.

HIV/AIDS Intervention Fund (HAIF) was established to complement the NGO service component through a
simpler mechanism of small grants of up to US$20,000 per proposed project. The component was managed by
UNICEF. A total of 1185 proposals were screened and 74 of small grants were awarded under this fund. The
selection process was time and human resource consuming but it resulted in a considerable capacity building of
the small NGOs during the proposal approval phase. By June 2006, HAIF was discontinued because of the time
consuming nature of its implementation and its poor targeting of interventions.. Effective interventions like
MSM/Transgender and important lessons like involvement of PLWHA group / self help group of SW were
integrated into TI packages.

An external review of HAPP TIs was undertaken in September 2007, which concluded that: (i) the population of
greatest epidemiological concern is IDUs, especially in Central Dhaka, and NASP should focus on harm reduction
strategies during 2008; (ii) TIs need to be intensified, with more regular and comprehensive coverage, lower peer
to client ratio, greater efforts to involve Self-Help Groups, and greater involvement of the target groups in the
planning, implementation and monitoring of interventions; (iii) capacity development had been ad hoc and needs
to be more systematic and needs-based. The Performance Audit of TIs under HAPP (February 2008) also came to
the same conclusions.

    2. Communications and Advocacy
The objective of this component was to create support for HIV/AIDS prevention program by: (a) raising
awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about HIV/AIDS/STD; (b) facilitating the
adoption of safe practices across the whole society; (c) encouraging mobilization of resources and commitment
for the implementation of the HIV/AIDS/STD Prevention Program; and, (d) reducing stigmatization of
HIV/AIDS affected people. These objectives would be achieved through activities to be financed under two sub-
components: (1) Advocacy; and (2) Public awareness.

Progress at end of project: Strategic Communication Plan for the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (HAPP)
Advocacy and Communication Component (ACC) 2004-2005 was prepared but not implemented. A revised
action plan was submitted in July 2007. However, the plan tries to cover too many activities, and is a mixture of
advocacy and general awareness raising activities. The IDA review recommended that the plan focus on
objective 1, which was "Provide support and services to the priority groups of people" and within that objective
focus on IDUs and harm reduction strategies. Other advocacy materials included various flip charts and booklets
that were distributed to the outreach workers in the field. Advocacy materials such as mugs, pins, card holders
with the national HIV logo were also developed.

Capacity of implementing agencies to develop and implement effective advocacy and communication strategies
was undertaken. Capacity building modules were developed: one for local level advocacy targeting the field level
staff (DIC in charges) and the other on the use of folk and cultural media in HIV intervention. Tools for
quantitative assessment of behavioral changes were developed and assessments conducted. However, UNICEF
would need to expand their advocacy platform to be more inclusive of other stakeholders, increase advocacy
capacity of NGOs and SHGs, as well as support greater networking among civil society organizations.

    3. Blood Safety
This component would seek to facilitate the expansion of safe blood initiatives. It was agreed that the
component's design and activities would be developed by the end of Year 1 of project implementation. It was
expected, that, initially this component would focus on channeling funding for the continuation of UNDP's Safe
Blood Transfusion Project for provision of laboratory equipment and human resource capacity building for 97
districts and tertiary care facilities.

Progress at end of project: The management of the Blood Safety component was transferred to WHO at the MTR,
and was implemented through a network of 98 safe blood transfusion centers around the country, requiring civil



                                                         24

works and other inputs. This component commenced its activities in December 2004 and was managed by WHO.
Screening kits for HIV, viral hepatitis B, C, malaria and syphilis were procured and distributed to 98 centers.
However, the reconstruction of all centers has not been completed, and this and the absence of equipment
maintenance plans are likely to cause problems down the road. Two training programs for Medical Technologists
were completed covering several areas of blood safety. Two orientations program on Safe Blood were completed
where experts and authority of 19 centers attended. Despite progress in the provision of inputs during the last
three years of the project, a comprehensive vision of a safe, efficient and sustainable blood transfusion system was
lacking. When this component is taken over by HNPSP, the challenges will be greater since there will be no
technical assistance readily available; procurement of materials will go through the government system; and the
flexibility available under the WHO will end.

Monitoring of the SBTP needs to be strengthened, with more accurate and regular measurement of indicators; and
better use of the information for high level management decision-making. Available data indicate the following

    4. Project Support and Institutional Strengthening
This component would provide necessary foundations for the delivery of high-impact HIV prevention services
through components 1, 2 and 3. It would do so through activities under the following sub-components:
    I.       Project Management and Capacity Building
    The objective of this sub-component would be to strengthen the STD/AIDS Program's technical and

    managerial capacities with the aim of facilitating the rapid scaling up of HIV/AIDS prevention activities. This
    would be achieved by securing adequate disbursement of funds and procurement of goods and services,
    including the contracting of NGOs and other partners; the provision of critical training activities to NGOs and
    other implementing partners; and effective supervision of project activities. These activities would be carried
    out in the context of the Health and Population Sector Program (HPSP).

    II.      Monitoring, Evaluation and Operational Research
    The objective of this sub-component would be to provide critical information on the progress of the
    STD/AIDS program as a whole (regardless of the source of financing) as well as on the success of project
    activities, thereby facilitating feedback into project design. It would contribute to the development of regular
    nationwide behavioral and biological surveillance. It would also, through the surveys and research, contribute
    necessary technical information for continued project implementation and adjustments which could enhance
    the impact of the STD/AIDS program. It was agreed that the details of this sub-component would be prepared
    by the end of Year 1 of project implementation.

Progress at end of project: Institutional capacity of the program has been an on-going challenge throughout the
life of the project. Frequent changes in leadership, the failure to procure and retain technically competent staff,
and the reluctance to appoint the agreed consultants have all contributed to the management problems at NASP.
Capacity for managing crucial NGO contracts was weak, and therefore delayed so much that at the MTR a
decision was taken to transfer this responsibility to a partner agency ­ UNICEF. This relationship also did not
proceed smoothly, leading to interruptions in service during the periods when project extensions were being
sought. Currently the greatest challenge before the NASP is to coordinate the funding from multiple donors to
ensure that there is no duplication in coverage, double-dipping by NGOs and wastage in resources. This is a
daunting task, and one that requires that NASP's capacity be substantially strengthened with the appropriate
technical and managerial personnel. NASP/MOHFW has embarked on this task with a meeting called in June
2007 of many of the DPs involved in implementing HIV/AIDS interventions; following this, NASP has started
developing a database of their activities; they are also in the process of developing reporting arrangements.

UNFPA signed a contract with the Government in June 2003 for providing technical support to improve the
capacity of the National AIDS/STD Program. Under the contract, UNFPA provided technical assistance
(consultants) and other logistical support to NASP. The areas of Technical Assistance provided included program
implementation; safe sex promotion; drug users interventions; advocacy/BCC; STI Management; monitoring and
evaluation; financial and administrative management; and coordination of the TA. Various policy and program
documents were developed with the help of the consultants and a resource center was established at NASP. An
assessment of the performance of UNFPA is provided in the main text (Section 5.2(b)).

ICDDR,B was engaged for conducting the annual sero-surveillances. It completed 5th, 6th 7th and 8th round of
surveillance. The serological surveillance collect data on high risk groups in sentinel sites in major urban centres
with the highest concentration of particular risk groups. The geographical coverage has expanded over time from
5 sites in the first round to 23 in 64 districts currently. Coverage of high risk groups has also expanded from
IDUs, brothel and street based sex workers in Dhaka to include other vulnerable populations including heroin
smokers, hotel based sex workers and transgender. Data has also been collected in some rounds on bridging
populations that are likely clients of sex workers including STI patients and transport workers as well as their
regular partners.

A National AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and Operational Plan for 2006-2010, in line with the
three "ones" has been developed with the assistance of UNAIDS.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND


In response to HIV/AIDS situation in Bangladesh HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (HAPP) was
conceived and approved in December 2000 by GoB and IDA/DFID. The project is financed
through a credit from the International Development Association (IDA) and a DFID grant, along
with a financial contribution from GOB. But
due to its serious implementation problem        HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (HAPP)
till 2003, few progress were achieved. Since
January 2003, GoB, World Bank with other         Effective date: February 1, 2001
development partners stepped up efforts to       Closing date: June 30, 2005
address the implementation problems. A           Revised closing date: December 31, 2005
problem solving mission was fielded in           Actual closing date: December 31, 2007
January 2003. The Problem Solving Mission        Original budget: US$ 52.59 million
followed in March 2003 by a Quality              Revised budget: US$ 26.23 million
Enhancement Review (QER) in addition a           Phase 1: September 2003 ­ June 2005

Preparatory Technical Mission for the Mid        Phase 2: July 2005 ­ June 2006

Term Review was also held in June 2003.          Phase 3: July 2006 ­ December 2007

The main causes for poor implementation identified by the Mid Term Review mission were a)
inadequate preparation of the project before its approval, and non-completion of preparatory
activities even after two years of the project's life; b) unclear implementation arrangements,
resulting from the introduction of this project's activities into the Health and Population Sector
Program (HPSP) and c) the lack of capacity and full-time personnel to manage this project.

As per the recommendations of the Mid Term Review Mission HAPP was restructured. The
coverage and volume of
activities were reduced.              HIV/AIDS Prevention Project
Activities          were
prioritized           and
implementation
arrangements        were      High Risk         ACC/BCC         Blood Safety     Institutional
                              Intervention                                       Strengthening

project was implemented       (PNS & HAIF)                                       GoB

with     technical    and     UNICEF                                             UNFPA

management support from UN Agencies as follows: a) UNICEF; USD 5.5 million for target
interventions covering most vulnerable groups (PNS Package), USD 2.5 million for small grant
fund to NGOs, CBOs and other agencies (HAIF Package), and USD 3.5 million for
communication and advocacy (ACC/BCC Package), b) UNFPA; Institutional capacity
strengthening of NASP (USD 0.99 million for technical assistance) and condom procurement,
and c) WHO for blood safety component (USD 3.09 million). In addition to the fund managed by
UN agencies, the remaining 10.65 million USD was proposed to be managed by NASP for
advocacy/ communication activities as well as institutional strengthening and capacity
development.


GOAL:

The goal of HIV/AIDS Prevention Project is to prevent and control the spread of HIV
infection within high-risk behavior groups and to limit its spread to the general


                                                33

population, without discriminating and stigmatizing the high-risk groups including
People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).

and 2006.

Initially nine consortiums and two individual NGOs were contracted (34 NGOs in total) were
contracted to implement the five packages of PNS. The process started on August 1, 2004. All the
NGOs have established required infrastructure to provide services. In late 2006, other NGOs were
contracted to implement newly added MSM / Transgender package. In totality 45 NGOs through
14 consortiums were contracted to implement 6 packages over 2004 to 2007. Two consortiums
(RPDO & GHARONI) were terminated due to performance and irregularities.

A total of 145 Drop in Centers (DIC) covering 46 districts were established. Supplies such as
syringes, needles lubricants and condoms were delivered to NGOs as per the standard
procurement plan agreed between NASP and UNICEF. A STI management guideline for high-
risk groups has been recommended, shared and distributed to all NGOs by NASP in order to
ensure harmonization of the treatment of STI. Moreover training on STI management and record
keeping has been provided. Joint monitoring visits (GoB/NASP/UNICEF) were carried out to
assess the functionality of the services and to identify need for support and areas for
improvement.


In general the high risk intervention packages included condom promotion, STI management,
needle/syringe exchange, detoxification, peer education, health education / counseling,
resting/recreation facility, community awareness and local level advocacy

Based on surveillance results, the process to review the strategy to ensure expansion and
consolidation of interventions to achieve full national coverage and strengthened services were
initiated.

In paper the contract period of high-risk intervention was 51 months, stretched from September
2003 to December 2007, actual period comes down to 42 months as per signing date of contract.
It further downed to 33 months or less, as actual implementation at field by the NGOs started
from August 2004 and subsequent contract extension took 1-2 months for each time. So, in reality
high risk intervention was in the field less than 33 months separated and interrupted in three
phases.

There were no structured baseline or end line assessments in the HAPP work plan. In absence of
baseline and end line study, it was difficult to assess the impact of the high risk interventions.
Successive sero and behavioral surveillances could be the best guess of changing situation of HIV
epidemic within the high-risk population. Although other interventions impact and time factors
have to be kept in mind. Fifth sero and behavioral surveillance conducted in 2003-04 could be
used as baseline and 7th Sero and 6th Behavioral survey conducted in 2005-06 and 2007
respectively could show end line status of the epidemic.

HIV/AIDS Intervention Fund (HAIF): HAIF was established to complement the PNS component
through a simpler mechanism of small grants of up to US$20,000 per proposed project. HAIF
will be implemented through Government Organizations, Non Governmental Organizations,
Community Based Organizations, and private sector initiatives. It is also envisaged that it will
bring flexibility and innovation to the prevention of HIV and AIDS and make possible for
necessary interventions to reach the general population in Bangladesh at the community level.
The component was managed by UNICEF. The agreed tasks include were: (1) developing and
disseminating the Operational Manual; (2) soliciting proposals and selecting qualified
organizations against defined criteria; (3) disbursing funds; (4) monitoring the projects conducted
by grantees; and (5) building capacities of participating service organizations.

A total of 1185 proposals were screened and 74 were awarded of small grants under this fund.



                                                 36

The selection process was time and human resource consuming but it resulted in a considerable
capacity building of the small NGOs during the proposal approval phase. By the June 2006,
HAIF was discontinued. Effective interventions like MSM/Transgender and important lessons
like involvement of PLWHA group / self help group of SW were integrated in to TI packages.
These 74 NGOs worked in 34 districts in all 6 divisions of Bangladesh.

Component 2: Communication and Advocacy

This component aims at expanding awareness and knowledge of the general population, civil
society and policy makers. The Advocacy and Communication Component (ACC) was proposed
to achieve the following objectives: (1) to raise awareness and develop understanding of
HIV/AIDS prevention methods among the general population; (2) to encourage the mobilization
of resources and commitment for the implementation of the STD/AIDS programme; (3) to reduce
stigmatization of HIV/AIDS affected people; and (4) to provide interpersonal communication and
counseling by health workers in public and private sectors to clients at health facilities. Thus,
ACC was envisaged to "create support for the HIV/AIDS Programme" by involving general
population and key groups who influence or are instrumental to the success of HAPP, such as key
national, religious and opinion leaders while PNS and HAIF target the vulnerable groups. The
component was managed by UNICEF in collaboration JHU/BCCP and valued worth US$ 3.5
million.


ACC component was planned to achieve three overall outputs:
        1. Updated HIV and AIDS advocacy and communication strategy and materials in place
        2. Motivated policy makers, national and local leaders taking actions to foster and
             support the HAPP goals
        3. Motivated citizenry who understand their roles in HIV and AIDS prevention and who
             provide care and support for people living with HIV and AIDS

The first output of the HAPP ACC was the Strategic Communication Plan for the HIV/AIDS



                                                37

Prevention Project (HAPP) Advocacy and Communication Component (ACC) 2004-2005. As the
primary objective of ACC was to create support for the HIV/AIDS prevention programme, the
Plan was developed to set forth a detailed plan of actions for HAPP ACC so that an enabling
environment for HIV and AIDS prevention can be created in this country.

Another accomplishment was collect necessary information and develop the National HIV and
AIDS Communication Strategy 2005-2010. As for other communication materials, flip charts and
booklets that were developed and distributed to the implementing agencies at the field level so
that all peer educators and outreach workers have adequate communication materials to help their
work. Advocacy materials such as mugs, pins, card holders with the national HIV logo were
developed.

Capacity of implementing agencies to develop and implement effective advocacy and
communication strategies were done. Capacity building training was developed: one for local
level advocacy targeting the field level staff (DIC in charges) and the other on the use of folk and
cultural media in HIV intervention. Tools for quantitative assessment of behavioral changes were
developed and assessments conducted.


Component 3: Blood Safety:

Blood Safety component was implemented through a network of 98 safe blood transfusion
centers around the country. Strategies to motivate and educate blood donors, select and retain
safe donors, maintain records and management information, training staff in the centers, quality
assurance and monitoring and evaluation were all part of this comprehensive safe blood
transfusion package.

The component was managed by WHO, an agreement between Ministry of Health and WHO was
signed on 4 September, 2004 with a total value of US$ 3.08 million.

This component has been designed to upgrade 19 centers of excellence for blood transfusion
including national and teaching hospitals and some hospitals in the private sector to ensure
mandatory blood screening including quality assurance, the rational use of blood and to increase
voluntary blood donation. The GOB has identified 6 states of art Blood Banks & 13 blood banks
for upgrading.

Based on the objective the implementation of activities within this component commenced
in December 2004 and a work-plan was developed through consultation between national
authorities and WHO. National Coordinator, National consultants, and other technical and
administrative staff were recruited.

The screening kits for HIV, viral hepatitis B, C, Malaria and syphilis were procured and
distributed to 98 centres . The two training programmes for Medical Technologists were
completed covering several areas of blood safety. Two orientations programme on Safe
Blood were completed where experts and authority of 19 centres attended.


Component 4: Project support and institutional strengthening

National AIDS/STD Program (NASP) has mandated as an oversight and stewardship body to
address the national response to HIV /AIDS. In order to carry out the national mandate, UNFPA
and the Government signed a contract in June 2003 for providing technical support to improve
the capacity of the National AIDS/STD Program to play an appropriate role in the national
response to HIV/AIDS. The component was comprised of consultant and other logistical support.



                                                 38

Through this component, consultants provided Technical Assistance to NASP. The TA
concentrated on strengthening NASP's capacity with the following objectives:

    · Strengthened institutional response within MOHFW and NASP to lead and co-ordinate
        national efforts in HIV/AIDS and supporting multi-sectoral initiatives.

    · Improved institutional capacity within other key ministries (Home Affairs, Religious
        affairs, Education, information, Youth, Women and Child Affairs) for an expanded and
        sustainable response to HIV/AIDS.

    · Boarder based of technical expertise available in Bangladesh addressing different
        dimension of HIV/AIDS


The areas of Technical Assistance provided were:
    · Programme Implementation
    · Safe Sex Promotion
    · Drug Users Interventions
    · Advocacy/BCC (2 positions)
    · STI Management (2 positions)
    · Monitoring and Evaluation
    · Financial and Administrative Management
    · Coordination of the TA

Through this component following policy / programme documents were developed ; National
Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS for 2004-2010, HIV/AIDS Module for Health Managers, National
Harm Reduction Strategy, National Guidelines for ART, National STI management guideline,
Nurses' manual on HIV/AIDS, Media workshop guideline, HNPSP Operational Plan for
HIV/AIDS (2006-2010), Conceptual framework of the National HIV/AIDS Monitoring and
Evaluation, Monitoring indicators for different high-risk interventions, Monitoring tools. A
resource center was established at NASP.


Sero and Behavior surveillance: ICDDR,B was engaged for conducting the annual sero-
surveillances. It completed 5th, 6th and 7th round surveillance. Surveillances covered MARG such
as injecting drug users, heroin smokers, brothel, street and hotel based female sex workers, male
sex workers, MSM and transgender population. In certain rounds bridging population like
rickshaw pullers, truckers, part time casual female sex workers were included in study population.
Approximately 10368 and 7167 samples were used for 7th round sero-surveillance. To improve
the design of surveillance, a piloting of "Respondent Driven Sampling" methodology was done.


Constraint faced:

1.Preparatory:
    · Adequate preparations were not done before launching the formal implementation of the
        project. There were lacks of human and physical infrastructure at NASP to effectively
        implement the project. NASP was not prepared to handle large number of NGO selection,
        contract, manage and monitoring. Human resources were in adequate and implementation
        mechanism was not clear.




                                                 39

2.Implementation:
   · Due to administrative process and bottlenecks in MOHFW, DGHS, MOHFW, World
       Bank and UNICEF, there were delays in fund disbursement from donor to implementing
       NGOs.
   · The implementation periods were stretched in to three short phases of 12 ­18 months.
       This made the administrative process of proposal development and approval, contract
       signing, repetitive and time consuming which further shortens the actual time of
       implementation. This resulted frustration within the project beneficiaries and loss of
       trained manpower from implementing agencies.
   · There were delays in reporting by Management Agencies specially the financial reports.
       This made difficult for NASP to compile the report and have a clear look of the situation.
       It also delayed the process of submission of report to different relevant authorities.
   · In the HAPP plan there were no provision for operation research, so it was difficult to test
       out different strategies of the ongoing interventions.

3.Evaluation:
   · In the project plan there was no plan for structured baseline and end line assessments. In
       absence of that implementing NGOs did rapid situation assessment by their own, which
       was not well coordinated by management agency and methodologically not sound. The
       data could not be compiled and used. End line survey was also not planned; there was
       confusion that who will responsible for the assessment. In absence of that the
       opportunities will be missed to find out the impact of the project and return of resource
       investment.


Lesson learned:

   · A large programme like HAPP needs adequate pre-implementation preparation before
       formal launching. This involves time duration and physical and human infrastructure. In
       absence of these required pre factors, actual implementation hampers and activities slows
       down. NASP did not have the requisite human and physical infrastructure at the
       beginning of the programme launching.
   · There should be a clear under standing of implementation modalities. Role of
       coordinating, implementing agencies should be clear to all agencies.
   · For effective implementation a simple M & E system need to be established. Data need of
       different level have to be identified and process of compilation and dissemination
       established.
   · Interventions in the high risk behavior groups need support of local law enforcing
       agencies from the very beginning. Adequate planning and advocacy needed in this
       regard.
   · Greater impact of programme needs involvement of certain key ministries like home,
       education, youth and employment.
   · Repeated disruption and short phases hampers the project outcomes. It creates loss of
       credibility to the at risk population, loss of trained manpower. For effective output
       intervention should have minimum duration of 3 years.
   · Capacity development of NGO and GO should be a continuous and institutional process
   · Involvement of Self Help Group (SHG) of vulnerable population in the implementation
       brings greater and sustainable results.


Role of stakeholders



                                                40

UNICEF

Three agreements were signed between UNICEF & Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in
October, 2003 for implementation of following interventions; a) Procurement of NGOs services
(PNS-US$ 5.5 m), b) HIV and AIDS Intervention Fund (HAIF-US$ 2.5) and c) Advocacy and
Communication Component (ACC- US$ 3.5) with a total value of US$11.5 m. UNICEF was the
largest stakeholder of HAPP. They were involved in large group NGOs selection, contracting,
managing and monitoring. Their contribution in this regard is commendable. Initially the
coordination mechanism with UNICEF was weak and irregular. It took considerable time and
efforts to improve the situation. The internal administrative process of UNICEF some times
slowed down the implementation process. Few efforts were made to tap UNICEF's international
expertise and resources.

UNFPA

UNFPA was responsible for managing part of the fourth component ­ Institutional Strengthening
and Capacity Building worth US$ 0.99 m. There contribution came in the form of recruiting and
managing consultants and logistics supply. This improved human capacity and physical
environment of NASP. The understanding of institutional strengthening and capacity building
was not clear and no formal plan was agreed upon. Which caused lack of coordination between
NASP and UNFPA and resulted in only providing consultants and logistics. Some institutional
assessments were done which were not adequately followed up.

WHO

WHO managed the blood safety component in providing support for procurement of equipment
and reagents and facilitating training and facilitating continuous on-site technical support. This
was in major part continuation of UNDP supported earlier activities.


World Bank

WB as a whole facilitated the project implementation. Through local WB office and regular Joint
Monitoring Mission, supports were provided. WB helped NASP to progress the project in every
phase. WB helped to restructure the project and redefining implementation mechanisms. Initially
the administrative and decision making process within WB was time consuming which was
simplified later on.


Conclusion

HAPP was an unique experience of NASP to run a multi-stakeholder project, where three UN
agencies acted as management agency and with more that 100 implementing NGOs. Successful
completion of HAPP increased the capacity of NASP. The project enabled GoB to expand critical
high risk intervention nationally and develop national strategies and guidelines. With the
experience of HAPP, NASP/GoB will be able to expand and manage nation wide HIV/AIDS
intervention.

Purpose to Goal
HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh remains low prevalence. To date evidence suggests that it remains predominantly within most
at risk groups particularly IDUs, Female Sex Workers and MSM. With the exception of IDUs, prevalence also remains low
within these groups (overall 0.9%). The project has contributed to this continued low prevalence. This means that the spread
of HIV infection has been controlled sufficiently so that it has not impacted on poverty reduction or accelerated human
development in Bangladesh. There are some concerns in Bangladesh about the numbers of returning migrant workers who
are HIV positive however there is currently limited evidence to support this. The GoB is planning to improve this evidence
base and design interventions accordingly.

Project Purpose Rating- General /Overall progress assessment                                3-Likely to be partly achieved
Justification
This project suffered major problems in it's early years (2001 ­ 2004) and little had been implemented or achieved by 2004.
This early slow progress was due to the project not having been fully planned before it was launched, weak capacity within
the MoHFW to manage or implement the project and insufficient support provided by the World Bank or DFID to drive the
project forward. In 2003, the IDA Credit and DFID grant to the project were cut by a half due to this slow disbursement
and implementation. At this time, 3 UN agencies were invited to implement different parts of the project on behalf of
NASP; UNICEF to procure NGO services to implement high-risk intervention and innovative approaches, together with
communication and advocacy; UNFPA for capacity building, and WHO for blood safety. Agreeing the contract details
between UN agencies and government took time. Project activities only really got underway in August 2004 and the
project was originally due to end in 2005. In 2005 a one year extension was granted, and in 2006 a further 18 month
extension was agreed (to December 2007).

During project supervision and reviews, the UN agencies have been criticised for their performance in implementing the
project, and it is clear that there were some shortfalls, particularly with UNFPA and WHO in fulfilling their terms of
reference. However, they were asked to participate in the project as an `emergency measure' in a failing project and none
of the agencies (except for WHO) was implementing an activity that is considered to be within its area of expertise.
Additionally, the three short contracts that they were given meant that their ability to develop and sustain their capacity to
support NASP and project activities was compromised. These short contracts (and the funding gaps that took place
between them) also impacted on the quality of services provided by the NGOs to deliver targeted interventions and on their
ability to have the sustained engagement with beneficiaries needed to change behaviours.

Despite these delays and gaps in maintaining project funding and activities, since 2004 and largely through the NGO
interventions progress has been made in half of the purpose-level indicators. The things that have been achieved include the
major objective of keeping HIV prevalence below 5% among all categories of female sex workers, men who have sex with
men, and transgendered persons (hijras). Furthermore, active syphilis is significantly declining or at least being kept in
check among all FSWs, IDUs, MSM and transgendered persons. Hepatitis C among IDUs in Central A has significantly
declined over several rounds of measurement. A rating higher than "3" is not justified because, on the down side, HIV
prevalence amongst IDUs has risen over the life of the project to 7% in Central-A, with one neighbourhood as high as
10.5%. Hepatitis C among IDUs outside of Central A is a mix of some decline and some increase. There has been some
limited impact on the policy environment, including the development and approval of some important strategies. The
challenge has been and will continue to be the need for sustained capacity within the MoHFW to ensure effective
implementation of these and other policies.

Project Outputs Rating- General /Overall progress assessment                               3-Likely to be partly achieved
Justification
Overall, the outputs are likely to be partly achieved by the end of the project as highlighted above. Three out of four Outputs
are scored "3" and one is "4" leading to this composite score.

There has been an impact on some high risk behaviours in most at risk populations. Whilst the results across geographical
areas and population groups are mixed, in the most vulnerable geographical area ­ `Central A', condom use amongst female
sex workers has increased significantly and needle sharing amongst IDUs has decreased. This is important and significant for
controlling the epidemic. The quality of the interventions could undoubtedly be improved, but the short term contracts and
lack of systematised capacity building given to the NGOs limited their ability to focus on quality. The component of the
project focussed on interventions with high risk populations has been undoubtedly the most important and successful of the
project and has had the most impact. Under HNPSP and GFATM funding, it is essential that the focus is on improving the
quality and coverage of interventions particularly with IDUs.

Other components have been less successful. The blood component has been subject to significant delays and setbacks and
there have only been patchy improvements in parts of the Blood Transfusion System.                  Under HNPSP it has been
recommended to the GoB that blood safety is given higher priority, and that high quality technical support is available.
Institutional strengthening of NASP has been, and remains a challenge, largely due to frequent transfers of staff, the relatively
low priority given to HIV and AIDS within the MoHFW, and a lack of strong long term technical support focussed on
institution building. Advocacy plans and strategies have been developed, but advocacy and awareness raising efforts remain
somewhat ad hoc and not well monitored. It is difficult to gauge how far the project has contributed any increases in
awareness about HIV and AIDS in the general population. It has been recommended to NASP that they rationalise their tasks
and functions, develop a technical assistance framework, and for the medium term contract consultants to support their
priority roles and functions.

Purpose Attribution
Any achievement of the project purpose may be attributed to the first two outputs. Limiting the spread of HIV through
successful targeted interventions that hold HIV low in high risk groups is likely to help limit the spread in the general
population. This is not necessarily dependent upon success in achieving the third output of developing a blood safety
strategy. Nor is it dependent upon the NASP technical and managerial capacity during the life of the project.

The project has relied upon the high quality National Surveillance date (behavioural and serological) to assess its impact.
Whilst there is no doubt that the project has contributed to the gains made in behaviour change and to keeping HIV
prevalence low, there have also been interventions (smaller and limited in their scope) funded by USAID through Family
Health International which will also have contributed to progress made.

Risk Category                Medium
Has the Risk Category changed since the last review? If so explain why.
No.
Key Risks
How successful was the action taken to monitor / manage these risks
The main risks initially identified that have occurred were inadequate leadership, institutional and management capacity in
NASP and frequent changes of staff, delays in operationalising GoB/NGO collaboration, and insufficient NGO capacity.
The first two of these risks could have been monitored and managed more proactively in the early years of the project.
Radical measures were taken in 2003 to manage them by `outsourcing' the project components to UN agencies.

The plan to manage the latter was to phase in NGOs and initially sole-source NGOs that had proven capacity and experience.
This did not happen in practice and some NGOs that were awarded contracts had gaps in their capacity to deliver high

 quality interventions. This could have been managed with strategic and planned technical support (perhaps contracted out),
 but this support only come after some time when UNICEF (the managing agent) developed it's own capacity.

 Measures to monitor and manage other risks were largely successful.

                Lessons Learned

 Lessons learned, and suggested dissemination.
 1. Working with Partners
 · In a low HIV prevalence setting, stakeholders (Government, development partners and NGOs) need to be constantly
     reminded of the evidence that should drive the priorities for the National response. In Bangladesh there are clear
     epidemiological indications that the focus of the response should be on most at risk populations particularly harm
     reduction with IDUs. Whilst this project was focused on the right issues, efforts can easily be distorted by particular
     institutional interests, misinformation or global directives from the International Community (such as `Universal
     Access' or pushes to ensure a multisectoral response)..
 · Funding through the World Bank does not necessarily mean reduced transaction costs for DFID. Early reviews indicate
     that the transaction costs to DFID to get the project on track were high.
 2. Best Practice / Innovation
 · Participation by most at risk populations in programming decisions and implementation was limited in this project but
     where it happened, it proved important for programme success and sustainability.
 3. Project / Programme Management
 · Funding for HIV prevention efforts with most at risk populations must be uninterrupted and long term (e.g. at least 3
     years).
 · Whilst it ensures transparency, contracting out of NGOs through an open tendering process may not always get the best
     results particularly when working with stigmatised or marginalised groups.           These processes are also open to
     interference and rent seeking.
 · There needs to be a clear understanding at all levels about the difference between advocacy and awareness raising.


 Key Issues / Points of information
 Two no-cost extensions were granted to the project at the GoB's request. These were largely to ease the transition from
 HAPP funding to funding under HNPSP as the planned institutional mechanisms were not in place to contract NGOs.
 The bureaucracies of the GoB as well as development partners meant that there were gaps in funding between these
 phases. This was far from ideal and undoubtedly impacted on the quality of the interventions.

If appropriate, please comment on the effectiveness of the institutional relationships involved with the project
(eg comment on processes and how relationships have evolved)
DFID and the World Bank developed strong relationships with the NASP through interactions on the project, particularly its
reviews. The supervision missions have been a critical point for discussing the national HIV and AIDS programme in
Bangladesh and bringing together key stakeholders. They have also allowed DFID and the World Bank to provide strategic TA
support in a timely and demand driven way. Once the project activities are subsumed under HNPSP there will not be the same
opportunities to monitor them. Efforts are underway to ensure that there is a joint HIV and AIDS annual review which will
draw in all funders and stakeholders and ensure a space is created for strategic discussions.

Annex 9: Project Outcome and Intermediate Indicators

Outcome indicators to measure progress toward the development objective were changed several
times over the course of the project. According to the PAD, the indicators to measure
achievement of PDOs were: (i) reductions in behavioral, biological (STD, HepC) and social
indicators listed in the evaluation framework; (ii) prevalence of HIV infection among sex workers
and injecting drug users remains below 5%; and (iii) AIDS Program Effort Index. Of these (iii)
was never defined or used and (i) was translated in the first PSR into the following specific
indicators:
    · Reductions in behavioral indicators: (a) % sex workers who used condom with last client;
         (b) % IDU who shared no needle last week;
    · Reductions in biological indicators: percentage of sex workers with positive test for
         active syphilis;
    · Reductions in social indicators: (a) # IDU and sex workers beaten by police last year; (b)
         # IDU and sex worker forced into sex by police last year.

While baseline values were available for the above indicators, no targets were set and many of
them were very difficult to collect in a consistent manner over time. At the MTR, a new logical
framework was agreed, which retained the same objective, with two PDO indicators: 1) % of HIV
infected people among CSWs, MSM and IDUs; 2) Prevalence of syphilis among CSWs and
IDUs. Actual values at the MTR for these two indicators were reported in the PSR (#08), and
end-of-project targets were recorded. Of these, the first indicator has been tracked till the end of
the project, albeit with a change in targets while the second one was dropped in May 2005. No
explanation was offered in the ISR or relevant Aide-Memoire for either of these changes.

A large number of intermediate and output indicators were also included in the results framework
of the PAD and were subsequently dropped in the MTR. These included indicators of:
knowledge and attitudes of the general population; advocacy such as number of workshops
conducted; blood safety; and institutional capacity. At the same time several new indicators were
included during the MTR and dropped in May 2005. These included: behavioural indicators of
high risk populations such as passive sharing of needles/syringes among IDUs, consistent use of
condoms by FSWs, use of condoms by clients of FSWs; rephrased questions on knowledge of
HIV transmission among the general population; a new set of indicators of blood safety; and of
institutional capacity.
