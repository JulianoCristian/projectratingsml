within high risk groups and to limit its\n            spread into the general population, without stigmatizing the\n            high risk groups. This project has four main components. 1)\n            High Risk Group Interventions will limit the transmission of\n            HIV infection among those populations with the highest\n            prevalence of risk behaviors and from those groups to the\n            general population. 2) Communications and Advocacy will\n            create support for the HIV/AIDS prevention program by i)\n            raising awareness, knowledge, and understanding among the\n            general population about HIV/AIDS/STDs (sexually transmitted\n            diseases); ii) encouraging the mobilization of resources and\n            commitment for the implementation of the STD/AIDS Program;\n            and iii) reducing stigmatization of HIV/AIDS affected\n            people. 3) Blood Safety will facilitate the expansion of\n            safe-blood initiatives. 4) Project Support and Institutional\n            Strengthening will strengthen the STD/AIDS Program technical\n            and managerial capacity with the aim of facilitating the\n            rapid scaling up of HIV/AIDS prevention activities; monitor\n            the progress of the STD/AIDS Program at large; evaluate the\n            impact of these interventions; and conduct research that\n            will enhance the impact of the STD/AIDS Program."}, "docdt": "2000-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
