nutrition, health, and\n            education of the population while reducing soil erosion and\n            thereby arresting the decline in agricultural productivity.\n            The program would also create employment possibilities,\n            develop local energy resources, and reduce the sedimentation\n            rate of the Sidi Salem reservoir.

The project would also start up specific\n            agricultural, soil conservation and forestry activities,\n            together with productive infrastructure works, and would\n            include a foreign technical assistance component."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
