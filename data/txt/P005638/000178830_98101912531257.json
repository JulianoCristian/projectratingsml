which aims to increase the\n            income and improve the nutrition, health, and education of\n            the population while reducing soil erosion and thereby\n            arresting the decline in agricultural productivity. The\n            program will also create employment possibilities, develop\n            local energy resources, and reduce the sedimentation rate of\n            the Sidi Salem reservoir. The project will concentrate on\n            establishing the institutions which would implement the\n            program, including the Office, and the extension, research,\n            credit, and livestock development services. The project will\n            also start up specific agricultural, soil conservation and\n            forestry activities, together with productive infrastructure\n            works, and would include a foreign technical assistance component."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
