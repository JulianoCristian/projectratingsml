The loan was\n            closed on December 31, 1989, two years behind schedule. A\n            sum of US$6.5 million was cancelled in 1987 and a further\n            US$1.1 million was cancelled at closing. The primary\n            objective of the project was to tackle the problems of the\n            backward and depressed Northwest of Tunisia where the\n            poorest sections of the rural population live. The project\n            mainly achieved its targets in construction of\n            infrastructure (building, roads, schools, and water points).\n            This has increased social welfare (improved quantity and\n            quality of water, provided schooling opportunities that were\n            previously not available, etc.) and increased access to\n            backward areas of the country thereby allowing marketing\n            activities, delivery of inputs, and permitting improved\n            delivery of health and administrative services. The primary\n            reasons for shortfalls in implementation rate were\n            organizational deficiencies, staff shortages, land tenure\n            and use patterns, resistance of small-scale, subsistence\n            farmers to accept perceived risks in changing production\n            systems and failure to promote development of effective\n            producer groups until toward the end of the project period."}, "docdt": "1991-10-04T00:00:00Z"}
