The\n            project comprises a credit line and a technical assistance\n            component. The credit line component will provide resources\n            through qualified participating banks for medium-term loans\n            to private enterprises. The technical assistance component\n            will aim at overcoming deficiencies in: 1) bank regulation\n            and supervision; 2) commercial banks' institutional\n            capacity and appraisal skills; 3) the Government's\n            capacity to reorganize/liquidate inviable state-owned\n            enterprises; and 4) enterprise strategic planning\n            capability. In addition, targeted assistance will be\n            provided to ensure that sub-projects are adequately screened\n            for environmental impact."}, "docdt": "1995-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
