LITHUANIA
ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Loan and Project Sunmnary
Borrower:            Republic of Lithuania
Beneficiaries:       The Government of Lithuania, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL),
participating banks and private and privatized enterprises
Poverty
Category:            Not applicable
Amount:              About US$25 million equivalent
Terms:               A Single Currency Loan (SCL) consisting of two tranches: US$22
million at the Bank's standard US$ LIBOR-based interest rate and
DM4.5 million at the Bank's standard DM LIBOR-based interest rate;
with a proposed 10 year bullet maturity (i.e., repayment of principal
in one installment after the grace period) for the credit line component
and a 5 year grace period and a 20 year maturity for the technical
assistance component.
Onlending terms:    The credit line component will be passed on to participating banks in
US$ and DM respectively in the form of a 9.5 year bullet loan; with
interest rates from the Government to the Apex at the cost of Bank
funds plus 0.5 percent as compensation for the commitment fee
payable under the Bank loan and administrative costs; from the Apex
to participating banks with additional spreads of I percent to cover
operational costs of the Apex, and I percent representing the value of
access to the Government's credit and a credit risk premium against
the risk of non-repayment by the participating banks; and from
participating banks to final borrowers in US$ and DM at freely-
determined market interest rates. Technical assistance funds for
enterprise technical assistance will be passed on in US$ as a grant
from the Government to the Enterprise Restructuring and Consulting
Agency (Consulta).
Objectives:          To support and help accelerate the Government's reform efforts in the
enterprise and financial sectors, focusing in particular on strengthening
the banking system and on the delivery of finance to support the
development of private and privatized enterprises, by providing
financial resources for this purpose, and technical assistance to
improve the capacity of both the banking system to deliver such
resources, and of enterprises to prepare plans to secure them. An
important ancillary objective is to accelerate the reorganization and/or
liquidation of large inviable state-owned enterprises to move their
assets into the hands of private entrepreneurs who are expected to use
them more effectively, and to facilitate the required post-privatization
restructuring of troubled firms.



- ii -
Description:          The Project comprises a credit line and a technical assistance
component. The credit line component would provide resources
through qualified participating banks for medium-term loans to private
enterprises. This would be supplemented by a Capital Fund of
approximately US$10 million equivalent from the Government of
Sweden, which would be available to expand the capital base of
participating banks. The technical assistance component would aim at
overcoming deficiencies in: (i) bank regulation and supervision;
(ii) commercial banks' institutional capacity and appraisal skills;
(iii) the Government's capacity to reorganize/liquidate inviable state-
owned enterprises; and (iv) enterprise strategic planning capability. In
addition, targeted assistance would be provided to ensure that sub-
projects are adequately screened for environmental impact.
Project Benefits:     Anticipated benefits of the proposed Project are that it will:
(i) improve the quality of bank intermediation by strengthening the
legal and regulatory environment for banks, the capability of the BOL
to effectively monitor and supervise the banks, and the institutional
capacity and capital base of a core group of private commercial banks;
(ii) strengthen the supply response to the Government's reform
program by freeing up assets in unproductive use through initiation of
out-of-court reorganization and/or liquidation under bankruptcy of
inviable enterprises, by providing technical assistance for business
planning and post-privatization restructuring to privatized enterprises
and by enabling privatized and new private enterprises to obtain term
financing to undertake urgently needed restructuring and expansion
investments; (iii) contribute to a more orderly development of the
financial system and a normalization of interest rates; and (iv) enable,
through the SCL terms, the onlending of that currency which is best
suited to the needs of the sub-borrowers without requiring the
Government or the commercial banks to take the foreign exchange
risk.
Project Risks:        Risks include: (i) macroeconomic instability--this risk should be
mitigated by the continued presence of the currency board (a condition
of Loan effectiveness) and the recently approved IMF Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) Program which covers the period October 1994 to
September 1997; (ii) institutional weakness of the BOL and the
commercial banks--technical assistance has been incorporated into the
Project design specifically to address this risk; (iii) slow disbursement
of the credit line due to banks' and enterprises' inexperience with
project planning and appraisal and possibly also as a result of
Government directed/subsidized lending schemes and the absence of a
hard budget constraint on state-owned banks--this risk is addressed
through targeted technical assistance aimed at enterprises and banks
and by features of the Project design that make the use of Bank funds
simple and attractive (the Swedish equity, the single currency
denomination, LIBOR-based interest rate and the bullet maturity);
moreover, the currency board limits the Government's possibilities to
provide excessive assistance to banks and to introduce new directed
and/or subsidized credit schemes, while planned Bank operations in



- iii -
the agricultural and housing sectors will focus on phasing out
remaining sector-specific schemes; and (iv) the LIBOR basis of the
SCL may create interest rate risk for those sub-bormwers whose
revenues do not have the same interest rate sensitivity; credit
appraisals should take into account the capability of sub-borrowers to
manage this risk.

LITHUANIA
ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1          Lithuania has taken major strides in reorienting to a market economy, but the
results have been uneven. The present Government is implementing a comprehensive reform
agenda. Notable progress has been made in the areas of fiscal policy, currency reform, price
reform, trade reform, privatization and the development of a social safety net. As a result,
the economy is stabilizing with relatively low (single digit monthly) inflation. The recently
introduced currency board is expected to reinforce monetary discipline. However, in
implementing this program, the Government is trying to soften some of the painful
consequences of adjustment for the more vulnerable segments of the population. Also,
measures still need to be taken to make the policy and institutional environment more
conducive to private investment, to strengthen key financial institutions to facilitate the
appropriate provision of credit and movement of capital, and to reorient the social safety net,
public services and infrastructure, as well as the dominant energy sector, to the needs of a
market economy.
1.2          Among the key areas in the enterprise and financial sectors needing sustained
or increased policy action are: (i) reform of the commercial banking sector which needs
improvements in the legal and regulatory environment, supervision, technical assistance, and
measures to address weaknesses and deficiencies in bank capital; and (ii) reform of the
enterprise sector through proper incentives to private sector development and adjustment in
enterprise behavior through systematic reinforcement of financial discipline and targeted
technical assistance. The proposed Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project has
been designed specifically to address the need for policy reform and technical assistance in
these areas. In the policy area, five specific policy actions were requested as a precondition
for processing the proposed Project: (i) enactment of new banking legislation; (ii) adoption
by the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) of a program to strengthen bank regulation and supervision;
(iii) enactment of a scheme to phase in tax deductibility of bank loan loss provisions;
(iv) enactment of meaningful amendments to the bankruptcy law and related legislation; and
(v) initiation of pilot bankruptcies of two inviable state-owned enterprises. All of these policy
actions have been completed.
1.3          The Project would be directly supported by the proposed World Bank Loan of
about US$25 million equivalent and by parallel cofinancing from various sources of about
US$25 million equivalent.
1.4          The IMF Board recently approved a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
Program for Lithuania that covers the period October 1, 1994 to September 30, 1997. This
program, which was designed in close cooperation with the Bank, also contains various
structural reform measures in the enterprise and financial sectors. The prior policy actions
requested for the proposed Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project and prior
actions and reform measures under the IMF EFF Program closely match each other and have
been mutually reinforcing.

II. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
2.1           Lithuania's financial sector is weak and small. Since the country became
independent, three state-owned banks, twenty-five commercial banks (all locally owned) and a
development bank have been established. In the period immediately fcllowing independence,
a significant (but undocumented) informal financial sector also sprung up, based predom-
inantly on local trading companies in search of profitable outlets for excess liquidity; at least
one investment fund established in association with the country's voucher privatization scheme
also entered into the informal banking market. More recently, however, the importance of
these informal institutions has declined sharply, and quite a few of them have gone bankrupt.
A. The Banking Sector
2.2           To date, Government efforts to develop and restructure the banking system
have focused mainly on attempting to privatize the state-owned banks. Insufficient attention
has been paid to establishing the preconditions necessary for the safe and sound operation of
the banking sector post-privatization. Specifically, until recently, insufficient attention was
paid to building an adequate legal and regulatory framework, or to identifying and addressipg
operational weaknesses and bad asset problems in individual banks. In the interim, both state-
owned and private banks have focused on highly profitable foreign currency operations, and
short term lending. Both deposit taking and lending have been at very high nominal interest
rates, although more recently rates have started to come down (between 17-33 percent for
Litas, and 11-39 percent for US$ in December 1994). With inflation at around 3 percent per
month, interest rates have been positive in real terms.
2.3           Due to the absence, until recently, of loan classification and provisioning
requirements, provisioning for loan losses has been minimal. Audits and portfolio reviews in
accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) have been or are now being
conducted in many of the banks, providing a basis for proper and necessary adjustments in
this regard. The introduction on April 1, 1994 of a loan classification and provisioning rule
is also contributing to increased awareness of the need for adequate loan loss provisions. An
amendment to the corporate income tax law allowing loan loss provisions to be tax deductible
was passed by Parliament in July 1994.
2.4           Based on BOL balance sheet data, the structure of Lithuania's banking system
as of September 1, 1994 was as shown below in Table 2.1. The data in this table are
unaudited and before adequate loan loss provisions, and may therefore materially over- or
understate banks' importance.

The State-Owned Banks
2.5           The three state-owned banks are the State Commercial Bank (SCB), the State
Agricultural Bank (SAB), and the State Savings Bank (SSB). As can be seen from the
foregoing table, these banks as a group are still major players in the Lithuanian banking
system, accounting for nearly 50 percent of market share in total assets. It is not anticipated
that any of the state-owned banks will qualify for participation in the proposed Project, as
significant and complex issues have to be resolved first before these banks can be successfully
restructured and privatized. These issues are not addressed under the proposed Project.
Nevertheless, a brief description of their operations is useful in giving an overall insight into
the structure of Lithuania's banking system.
2.6            The SCB has 28 branches located mainly in the larger cities throughout the
country and employs over 1,470 staff. It became independent from the BOL only in
September 1992. Its deposits are mostly demand deposits from state-owned and private
enterprises, denominated both in foreign and local currency, retail deposits, and Government
deposits and funding. On the asset side, lending is mostly to state-owned and formerly state-
owned enterprises in the industrial sector. The bank also has a portfolio of subsidized
housing loans. Other assets are mainly foreign currency accounts with banks abroad. A
review of the bank's loan portfolio by an international accounting firm as of end December
1992 concluded that as much as 52 percent of total loans were impaired. According to the
audit, key problem areas were clients in the textile industry, electrical machinery, wholesale
consumer goods, housing cooperatives, retailing and the construction and machinery sector.
Another portfolio review and a full financial audit in accordance with international accounting
standards as of end December 1993 confirmed the bank's insolvency under International
Accounting Standards (IAS). However, the quality of SCB's loan portfolio did improve
during 1993: as of end December 1993 the percentage of loans classified as impaired had
declined to 26.



- 4 -
2.7          In preparation for its separation from the BOL, SCB management initiated its
own corporatization and privatization. In December 1992, temporary statutes prepared by the
management, establishing the bank as a joint stock bank (49 percent owned by non-
Government shareholders), were approved by the Government and registered by the BOL.
These statutes pose some problems for corporate governance, as they contain provisions that
effectively shield management from accountability to its shareholders. On January 1, 1993
the SCB became officially independent from the BOL. The bank received a banking license
from the BOL only in December of 1993, and in the interim operated in a regulatory vacuum.
2.8           The SAB has a network of 46 branches in various cities, towns and villages
and employs approximately 1,900 people. Its liabilities consist of deposits mainly of agro-
processing enterprises, state and cooperative farms, private farmers and the Government. In
addition, the SAB is dependent on BOL refinancing and special Government funding for an
important part of its funding, reflecting the continuation of credit subsidy programs for
agriculture which continue to be channeled through the bank. In the context of the Bank's
ongoing policy dialogue, discussions will be initiated with the authorities on phasing out these
programs. It should be kept in mind, however, that the presence of the currency board
regime restricts the ability of the Government to continue and/or expand such schemes. On
the asset side of the bank, loans consist mainly of credit to agriculture. The bank also holds a
portfolio of housing loans. Non-loan assets mainly comprise interbank claims.
2.9           A portfolio review and international audit of the SAB in accordance with IAS
confirm that the bank was deeply insolvent as of end 1993. The SAB's management has not
agreed with the findings of the international auditors, and is of the opinion that many of its
non-performing loans to large agro-processing enterprises are de facto guaranteed by the State
as these enterprises, in its opinion, are 'too big to fail.' The audit also pointed to significant
weaknesses in the bank's credit policies, procedures and internal control systems.
2.10          The SAB formally became a joint stock bank with capital of 20 million Litas,
49 percent private share ownership (including some employee ownership) in October 1993,
when the BOL extended, under threat of litigation in court, a license to the bank as a joint
stock bank. Shareholders were attracted to the bank with promises of preferential access to
credit, that at the time of share subscription (Spring 1993) was still subject to credit ceilings.
Consequently, the majority of the bank's shareholders are bank clients.
2.11          The SSB has 52 branches, 564 subbranches, 85 agencies, and more than 4,200
employees. It has by far the largest network of all banks in Lithuania. With over 5.5 million
demand and time deposit accounts, the bank still mobilizes the bulk of local currency retail
deposits (89 percent of demand, and 23 percent of time deposits as of September 1, 1994).
On the asset side, the largest single item on the SSB's balance sheet continues to be the bank's
claim on the former USSR savings bank, notwithstanding that the latter no longer formally
exists. Even though SSB did convert the claim early on from Roubles into Litas and
unilaterally started to accrue interest on it, the claim's importance as a percent of total assets
has declined (from 39 as of end 1992 to 23 percent as of September 1, 1994).
2.12          Although the bank only recently has started lending, it has already build up a
sizeable loan portfolio, mainly comprising loans to new private businesses and individuals. A
first IAS audit and portfolio review as of end December 1993 shows that 47 percent of the
portfolio is impaired. As a result, the bank was insolvent as of end December 1993.



- 5 -
2.13          SSB's management initiated the corporatization and privatization of the bank
in October 1992 when the bank's temporary statutes to become a closed joint stock bank with
10 million Litas in capital were approved and registered. Subscription of 49 percent of shares
offered in a closed subscription to private investors, mainly textile companies and bank
employees, took place during the summer of 1993. One private insurance company bought a
stake of 4 percent, and the SSB is now contemplating the sale of this company's insurance
policies through its branch network. Notwithstanding continued uncertainty regarding its
claim on Moscow, the bank's privatization was formalized with the issuance of a banking
license in December 1993. Although the Government still owns 51 percent of the bank's
stock, it is unclear to what extent it can exercise control as the legitimacy of new share issues
that would dilute its stake has been called into question.
2.14          SSB's deposits have been indexed several times to compensate policy holders
for inflation. One of these indexations used privatization vouchers rather than cash, in an
attempt to limit its inflationary impact and to speed up privatization. The most recent
indexation scheme envisages the use of privatization proceeds to compensate depositors.
Opposition parties in the Parliament have been promoting the idea of further indexation in
addition to the existing scheme, but so far have failed to obtain the required support; a
referendum on this issue was held in August 1994 which did not muster the required number
of votes.
The New Private Commercial Banks
2.15          Of the twenty-five new commercial banks, approximately eight can be
characterized as active banks, both in terms of asset size and activity. The remainder can best
be characterized as foreign exchange offices or 'pocket' banks. A number of these 'pocket'
banks are now close to failure. Five banks recently had their minimum reserve balances with
the BOL frozen due to reported liquidity problems, and some of these, as well as others, have
officially been declared bankrupt either by the general prosecutor's office or by their
creditors.
2.16          Until recently, the BOL as the bank regulator was unable to intervene with
and liquidate problem banks. With the adoption in July 1994 of a new interim law on the
resolution of bank failures, this deficiency in the legal framework was rectified. The interim
law has subsequently been incorporated into the new Commercial Banking Law which was
enacted by Parliament in December 1994.
2.17          Most of the new commercial banks started out as the treasury arm of their
state-owned enterprise founders. However, progress in enterprise privatization, and
successful attempts to raise new capital have enhanced the true private influence in these
banks. Reportedly, a few banks are part of larger holding companies that also own
enterprises. Some of the banks have acquired sizeable credit lines from foreign sources
(mainly Swiss and German banks). Three of the eight larger banks (Vilniaus Bank,
Innovation Bank and Baltic Bank) have participated in an ECU3 million credit line for small
and medium sized enterprises funded by the European Union's (EU) Phare program.
2.18          The larger banks all have small but growing branch networks. Their funding
mainly comes from new private sector enterprises, and is to a large extent foreign currency
denominated. Their lending activities are mostly focused on newly private and privatized
enterprises. While initially most of these banks' assets consisted of short term foreign



- 6 -
currency loans and foreign correspondent bank account balances, reflecting the importance of
foreign operations (including trade in precious metals), more recently most banks have
significantly expanded their lending activities, including lending in foreign currency. All of
the larger banks have either already completed first financial audits and portfolio reviews in
accordance with IAS or have initiated discussions with foreign auditors to that effect. The
portfolio reviews, coupled with the introduction on April 1, 1994 by the BOL of a loan
classification and provisioning rule, indicate that most banks will have to build up their loan
loss provisions. The banks have started to respond to this challenge by cutting their dividend
pay-outs and by aggressively raising new capital.
2.19          Another bank, the Lithuanian Development Bank, recently became
operational. This bank is owned jointly by EBRD and the Government with a start-up capital
of US$10 million, and will channel credit lines from the Nordic Investment Bank, the
European Investment Bank and possibly EBRD itself.
Informal Banks
2.20          Shortly after independence, a reportedly large number of informal banks
emerged in Lithuania. These informal institutions were engaged in taking deposits from the
general public and making loans, often at interest rates significantly above those of licensed
banks. The institutions started out mostly as trading companies, registered with the Ministry
of Economy as limited liability or joint stock companies. Trading, particularly in metals, was
highly profitable in the period immediately after the collapse of the former Soviet Union. As
a result, during various stages of the currency reform process, when there were Rouble
shortages and temporary deposit withdrawal restrictions, these companies were faced with the
need to use excess liquidity at a time that interest rates were rising sharply. Lending offered
a natural and profitable outlet for this excess liquidity. This lending has been mostly to new,
often unregistered activity, as tax and accounting controls in privatized enterprises, due to
continued partial Government ownership, made these enterprises less attractive loan
candidates.
2.21          Until the companies started to attract deposit-like funding, this lending activity
was legally allowed under the Enterprise Law, which states that enterprises may lend to each
other. For this reason, the BOL initially did not pay much attention to these institutions.
Thus, they had an opportunity to grow rapidly, and became more and more active, openly
advertising for deposits at higher rates than the banks offered. Growth of the informal system
probably also was encouraged by the fact that interest on deposits in licensed banks is taxed
and withheld at the source.
2.22          A number of insurance companies and at least one large investment fund
reportedly also became active in the informal market. The informal banks posed unfair
competition for the formal banks, which must comply with unremunerated reserve
requirements and a series of prudential rules.
2.23          In an attempt to deal with the problem, the Government issued a decree in
October 1993 authorizing the Ministry of Economy to take legal action against any registered
company lending more than its authorized capital. This approach was not very effective, as it
did not deal with underlying weaknesses in the then existing banking legislation which did not
contain clear definitions of concepts such as deposits and banks, and as it ignored the
supervisory responsibility of the BOL. The new banking legislation which has been enacted



- 7 -
as a precondition for the proposed Project, provides the BOL with adequate tools to take
action against the informal banks. It should be noted, however, that more recently, the
informal banks have started to whither away due to other factors, such as the drying up of the
metal trade. Also, failures and runs on a few informal banks have significantly eroded
depositor confidence and as a result, banks have been receiving a large inflow of funds from
the informal system. This inflow in turn has put downward pressure on interest rates.
Linkages Between Various Segments of the Banking Sector
2.24          Linkages between the various groups of institutions in the banking sector--
state-owned banks, private banks and informal banks--are not very strong, and therefore the
risk of a spill-over of a crisis from one segment into another is minor. The interbank market
is very underdeveloped in Lithuania, and SAB, the most troubled of the state-owned banks in
terms of insolvency, is nearly completely dependent on the Government and the BOL for its
funding needs. Thus, a liquidity crisis in this bank would hardly effect the rest of the banking
system. The small private banks--pocket banks--and the informal banks are linked by a web
of off-balance sheet guarantees, but there is little guarantee activity between these banks and
the larger private and state-owned banks. As a result, the runs that have hitherto taken place
on pocket banks and informal banks have not had any systemic implications. The risk of a
crisis is also mitigated by the fact that the formal banking system, notwithstanding the
insolvency of a number of institutions, is still very liquid as a result of an inflow of funds
from the informal system and sizeable capital inflows from Russia and other former Soviet
republics.
The Payments System
2.25          The central computer facility located in the BOL is responsible for all
domestic interbank clearing and settlement. The center processes the accounts of 90
commercial bank branches, with the balance of 50 branches forwarding their end-of-day inter-
bank transactions on diskettes/telex etc. to the center where the clearing and settlement
functions are accomplished. The center processes approximately 45,000 transactions daily
with about 30,000 comprising inter-bank financial obligations. The bulk of transactions are
on account of corporate clients, as consumer payments are still mostly cash-based. The banks
receive daily liquidity and account reports and the computer center processes all inter-bank
payments within a two-day time frame, which is quite efficient given the rudimentary
telecommunication infrastructure which is not conducive to high speed data transfers. The
Norwegian Banks' Clearing and Payments Center Limited, has proposed the installation of its
own clearing system at the new National Clearing Center which is to be established in the
near future. Making the center operational, and allowing banks to adequately connect to the
center, will require external financing for the purchase of software, equipment and technical
assistance. While it was suggested early on in the preparation of the proposed Project that it
could include a component for this purpose, the BOL indicated it first wanted to explore other
potential sources of financing.
2.26          International payments are made through correspondent accounts in foreign
banks. Many banks either already have or are in the process of establishing SWIFT
connections. New telecommunication initiatives are also underway. For payments to and
from former Soviet republics, the BOL has an agreement with the central banks of former
Soviet republics. All branches of Lithuanian banks can have accounts in local currencies of
former Soviet republics at the BOL. All commercial banks can open correspondent accounts



-8 -
in former Soviet republics. These arrangements notwithstanding, payments from and to
former Soviet republics remain cumbersome and slow, but the problem is largely outside of
the Lithuanian authorities' control.
B. Capital Markets
2.27          Lithuania has a nascent insurance industry and while the infrastructure for the
development of a securities market exists, the market is still in its infancy. The legal
framework for the insurance industry is weak and the playing field is uneven, with the State
Insurance Company enjoying significant competitive advantages. The securities market is
currently governed only by temporary regulations, although work has been ongoing for quite
some time on the development of a Securities law. The voucher privatization program has led
to the emergence of a large number of Investment Funds (IF), currently also still governed by
a set of temporary regulations. A new IF law that would more clearly delineate permissible
activities, encourage IFs to develop in the direction of true mutual funds, and strengthen IF
regulation and supervision was submitted to Parliament recently. The proposed Project is not
addressing developments in the capital markets area, as the issues to be addressed in the
banking sector are considered to be of a higher priority at this point in time. More details
about the state of capital markets development can be found in Annex I.
C. Legal Franework
Banking Legislation
2.28          In December 1994, Parliament enacted a new central banking law and a new
commercial banking law. Both of these new laws represent significant improvements over
their predecessors, and together should provide a good legal framework for the future
development of the Lithuanian banking system.
Law on the BOL
2.29          The new central banking law states that the BOL shall be held accountable to
the Parliament and shall be independent from the Government and other institutions of
executive Authority. In addition, the law specifies that the Central Bank's principal objective
should be to stabilize the Lithuanian currency. In conducting its operations, the BOL should:
(i) ensure the reliable functioning of the currency market and the system of credit and
settlements; and (ii) support the Government's economic policy, provided that this policy is
consistent with stabilizing the currency.
2.30          The new law directs the BOL to perform the functions traditionally assigned
to a central bank. These functions include issuing the national currency (the Lita),
implementing monetary policy, performing various financial operations for the national
Government, operating domestic and international payment systems for banks, and acting as
the lender of last resort. Lithuania now operates under a currency board arrangement, and
the law contains a provision that inactivates the provisions of the law dealing with monetary
policy as long as the currency board arrangement is in effect.
2.31          The central banking law gives the BOL broad authority to supervise the
banking system, including the power to grant bank licenses and determine various prudential
standards, such as capital adequacy. To carry out these supervisory responsibilities, the new



- 9 -
law authorizes the Central Bank to examine banks, require reports, issue rules and
instructions, and apply various sanctions when banks violate banking laws or regulations or
engage in risky banking activities. More detailed provisions relating to the Central Bank's
supervisory responsibilities and powers are contained in the commercial banking law.
Law on Commercial Banks
2.32          The Law on Commercial Banks governs the organization and operation of
banks, and outlines the procedures to be followed by the BOL in supervising banks. The
law's primary objective is to assure a stable, reliable, efficient and safe banking system.
2.33          In order to establish a bank, the founders of a bank must apply for a license
from the Central Bank and submit materials that would allow the Central Bank to judge the
merits of the application. The law expressly states that founders must have an impeccable
reputation and must provide information regarding the origin of funds to be used to capitalize
the bank. The Central Bank is authorized to grant a license only if the bank meets the
minimum capital requirement, has experienced managers of impeccable reputation, and has
adequate premises and equipment to carry out banking operations. Finally, the new law
expressly prohibits any organization from engaging in banking operations without a license--a
provision that was missing in the preceding law and led to the creation of a number of
informal banks of dubious reputation.
2.34          The commercial banking law contains extensive provisions relating to the
organization and management of a bank. These provisions cover: who can and cannot be
shareholders of a bank; the rights and powers of these shareholders; and the responsibilities
and operations of a bank's Council and Board. The law states that the shareholders' meeting
shall be the supreme management body of the bank, with the power to adopt and amend the
bank's statutes, elect and dismiss members of the Board and adopt decisions on the liquidation
or reorganization of the bank.
2.35          The permissible activities of banks are listed in the commercial banking law.
The current listing includes all activities that customers of banks are likely to require in the
current setting. Moreover, the law authorizes the Central Bank to expand this list over time,
if new needs should arise.
2.36          In order to promote a sound banking system, the law authorizes the BOL to
establish prudential standards that all banks must meet. These standards include capital
adequacy ratios, liquidity ratios, a maximum open position in foreign currencies and precious
metals, and a limitation on lending to any single party. These prudential standards are to be
set by regulation, and can be altered from time to time, as appropriate. In addition to these
prudential standards, the commercial banking law limits bank lending to any connected party
to 10 percent of the bank's capital. However, the law does not contain any limitation on the
aggregate amount of a bank's connected lending. Finally, the law prohibits a bank from
paying dividends to shareholders if the bank would not be in compliance with the capital
adequacy ratio and minimum capital requirement set by the Central Bank.
2.37         The commercial banking law provides the BOL with a broad array of
sanctions that can be employed to preserve the soundness of the banking system. These
sanctions include warnings, fines, the suspension or revocation of a bank's license, the
removal of members of the Board, and the appointment of an administrator for the bank.



- 10 -
Sanctions can be applied when a bank fails to provide the Central Bank with required
information or provides incorrect information, the bank fails to comply with prudential
standards, or the bank violates banking laws or Central Bank regulations.
2.38          To discourage any unwarranted use of these broad sanction powers by the
Central Bank, the law gives banks the right to seek judicial review of a sanction. In
conducting such reviews, the court is instructed to consider only the validity of the grounds
for the sanction and the procedures followed by the Central Bank, not the professional
judgement employed by that organization.
2.39          One of the major shortcomings of the earlier commercial banking law was the
Central Bank's lack of authority to close and liquidate insolvent banks. The new law specifies
that the court shall institute bankruptcy proceedings for a bank following a statement by the
BOL that the bank is insolvent, or following a suit by bank creditors in which the Central
Bank confirms the bank's insolvency.
2.40          At present, Lithuania does not have an explicit deposit insurance system.'
Consequently, in order to give protection to small individual depositors of a bankrupt bank,
the commercial banking law gives these depositors prior preference (up to the equivalent of
US$1,250) over other unsecured creditors to the proceeds from the liquidation of the bank.
Collateral Legislation
2.41          A mortgage law was adopted by Parliament in October 1993, which covers
various types of mortgages on both movable and immovable property. This law was intended
to replace existing provisions relating to secured lending in the ex-Soviet Civil Code and Civil
Procedures Code, and to introduce modern concepts of loan security. The new law so far has
had limited practical applicability, however, as it envisages the creation of mortgage agencies
which are supposed, among other things, to act as registers and entities through which to
organize the foreclosure on mortgaged property. Inappropriately, it was also envisaged that
the mortgage agencies would undertake some activities normally reserved for the lender. At
the Bank's suggestion, the Government has decided to abolish the concept of mortgage
agencies and intends to submit amendments to the law shortly that will allocate the various
activities related to secured lending to more appropriate, often already existing bodies and
institutions. USAID and other donors are providing targeted technical assistance in this area.
Both the Lithuanian authorities and these donors recognize, however, that building up
modern, integrated real estate registration systems will take time given that--as elsewhere in
the former Soviet Union--title to and encumbrances on land and buildings are currently being
registered separately. Therefore, to ensure practical application of the law in the near term,
the USAID assistance includes a component focused on allowing movable goods to be pledged
as collateral, inter acia through the creation of a new register for liens on movable goods.
The banking community, which has already initiated activity in this area on its own account,
acts as the main counterpart for this assistance. Specific steps and timing of policy actions in
the area of collateral law and registration system reform are also envisaged under the IMF
EFF Program.
The ex-Soviet Civil Code does, however, specify implicit protection by the State of deposits held in
fully or majority state-owned banks (i.e., the Civil Code states that the State "guarantees" the deposits
in these banks).



- 11 -
Bank Regulation and Supervision
2.42          Under the new banking legislation, the BOL is exclusively responsible for the
regulation and supervision of banks. While the new laws do provide the BOL sufficient
powers to adequately enforce prudential rules, a number of banks (including in particular the
three state-owned banks) are currently in violation of existing prudential rules. Therefore, the
Project sets stringent eligibility criteria for participating banks, including the need for banks to
be or move into compliance during a pre-determined time-table with a set of internationally
accepted prudential rules. More details on the eligibility criteria for banks to participate in
the Project can be found in paragraph 4.7 below.
2.43          At this time, banks are subject to prudential regulations in the following areas:
minimum liquidity, capital adequacy, loan classification and loan loss provisioning, large
exposures, foreign currency exposure, and insider lending. These rules have been revised
based on the work of various international agencies (see paragraph 4.17) and although
significant progress has been made, there is still room for improvement. Additional rules
are--inter alia--needed to limit connected lending and to detect and fight money laundering.
Detailed procedures will also need to be developed for BOL intervention in troubled banks,
and for BOL-led liquidations of insolvent banks. While work is planned under the program to
strengthen bank regulation and supervision (see paragraphs 2.45, and 5.16 below) to move
Lithuanian rules towards standards applicable in market economies, in the near future
differences will continue to exist. Therefore, the eligibility criteria for participation of banks
in the Project are based exclusively on a set of internationally accepted prudential rules using
IAS definitions of capital.
2.44          Bank supervision took a major step forward with the introduction, in April
1994, of new prudential reporting forms. These forms were developed by the BOL in
conjunction with the World Bank and the IMF, and are based on the conversion key that the
World Bank developed for Russia, which brings financial statements prepared in accordance
with the GOSBANK chart of account more in line with financial statements prepared
according to IAS. Simultaneously with the introduction of the new prudential reporting
forms, the BOL and the banks also agreed on the introduction of so-called Broadly Adapted
Financial Statements, which are also based on the conversion key mentioned above and which
can be used by the banks for external reporting purposes (i.e., reporting to potential investors,
correspondent banking relations, etc.). The World Bank is providing ongoing technical
assistance to ensure that the two sets of new reporting forms are well understood both by
BOL staff and the banks. Work has also been initiated on reform of the existing GOSBANK
chart of account and the concurrent application of IAS for banks.
2.45          Notwithstanding this encouraging development, bank supervision remains
weak. The schedule for on-site inspections currently in use does not guarantee that each bank
is examined at least once a year, as the BOL does not have sufficient on-site examiners.
Also, there are no set procedures to be used during on-site inspections. A capability to
analyze off-site reports and an early warning system to detect difficulties during on-site
inspections still need to be developed. These issues, and the further refinement of existing
prudential rules as well as the development of new rules in the areas outlined above, will be
addressed in the context of a comprehensive program to strengthen bank regulation and
supervision. The BOL has formally adopted this program and has already started its
implementation.



- 12 -
D. Issues in the Financial Sector
2.46          Until very recently, the most critical i, -e in Lithuania's financial sector was
the lack of adequate banking legislation, which limited the capacity of the BOL to properly
regulate and supervise banks, act against informal banking institutions and ensure effective
and prudent governance in commercial banks. Because of the critical nature of this issue, the
Bank requested enactment of new banking legislation as a precondition for the proposed
Project. The new legislation, which remedies the situation, was enacted by Parliament in
December 1994.
2.47          A second set of issues relates to inadequacies in the commercial banking
sector where most banks: (i) have a relatively low capital base which restricts their volume of
lending; (ii) lack proper provisioning for potential losses; (iii) lack institutional and strategic
planning capacity; and (iv) have only short-term funding on the liabilities side of their balance
sheets, limiting their capability to meet the enterprise sector's demands for longer term
finance. The proposed Project would address all of these issues by requiring audits according
to IAS and appropriate adjustments to provisioning, by providing technical assistance for
individual banks to implement comprehensive and tailored institutional development programs,
by supplying financial resources for term lending through the banking system and through
infusions of equity from the Swedish Capital Fund. To ensure banks actually do make
provisions in accordance with the BOL's loan classification and provisioning rule, the Bank
requested, as a precondition for the proposed Project, that the BOL and the Ministry of
Finance enact a scheme for phasing in the tax deductibility of loan loss provisions, which
adequately balances prudential concerns with fiscal revenue considerations. This condition
was met with the issuance of a series of decrees by both agencies over the course of the last
few months.
2.48          Issues not addressed by the Project include: (i) the restructuring and
recapitalization of the state-owned banks; (ii) the modernization of the payments system; and
(iii) resolving inadequacies in legislation or institutional capacity for most other financial
markets including, in particular, those which relate to insurance. While the Bank did early on
stress the importance to the authorities of the restructuring of the state-owned banks and did
propose the inclusion of an adjustment component in the Project for this purpose, in the
context of Project preparation it became clear that weaknesses in the old banking legislation
and in bank supervision and regulation made it virtually impossible to implement serious
restructuring measures. The proposed Project, by requiring as prior actions the adoption of
new banking legislation, a program to strengthen bank regulation and supervision and the
implementation of transparent loan classification and provisioning rules, has created the basis
for a targeted bank restructuring exercise. At the same time, the Project aims at
strengthening a core group of private banks to ensure early results in improving the quality of
bank intermediation.
2.49          A program aimed at further restructuring of the banking system, including in
particular the resolution of the insolvency of the state-owned banks, is required beyond what
is envisaged in this Project. Given the interrelated nature of bank and enterprise
restructuring, such a program would naturally also have to focus on a further strengthening of
the legal framework for enterprise workouts (see paragraph 3.29). The Government has
already asked the Bank's assistance in this area, and the Bank may support the development of
an effective bank and enterprise restructuring program with a follow-up operation. The other
remaining issues in the financial sector mentioned above could also be addressed in the

Source: Ministry of Economy; 1994 data are as of end September.
3.2           The growing importance over time of heavy industry in Lithuania reflects the
emphasis placed on this type of activity by the former Soviet regime, rather than Lithuania's
comparative advantage. Before independence, Lithuanian enterprises were tightly integrated
into an All-Union industrial network, particularly in the machine building, chemical and
electronic industries. These enterprises depended heavily on supplies of raw materials
(metals, crude oil, basic chemicals, cotton, wool and so on) from other parts of the former
Soviet Union. At the same time, a substantial share of industrial output was exported to the
former Soviet Union. Electronic components and components for machines accounted for a
substantial part of these exports.
2.     These data may be distorted to the extent they include registered enterprises that are not operational,
and exclude unregistered enterprises (see also paragraph 3.20).



- 14 -
3.3            Lithuanian independence and the break-up of the former Soviet Union
abruptly have severed these input and output linkages. The Lithuanian Government responded
by quickly negotiating bilateral trade treaties with various ex-soviet republics. However, as
Lithuania is outside the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), many enterprises face
punitive tariffs on both their inputs and outputs, and although a slight shift of production and
employment towards more promising export-oriented industries such as food processing and
light manufacturing is already discernable, many enterprises still have not adjusted to the new
situation. The proposed Project aims to accelerate the required adjustment by focusing on the
reorganization and/or liquidation of inviable enterprises that remain in state hands and on the
restructuring of privatized enterprises, and by providing targeted technical assistance in these
areas (see paragraph 4.20). Additional measures to strengthen enterprise financial discipline,
including commercialization of remaining state enterprises and measures to reduce
interenterprise arrears are also envisaged under the IMF EFF Program.
B. Privatization
Legal Framework
3.4            Privatization in Lithuania is governed by a set of laws, of which the Law on
the Initial Privatization of State Property (LIPSP), which was adopted in 1991 and various
Government decrees specifying implementation details are the most important. The law calls
for the privatization of two-thirds of the total value of state property (excluding land), in a
majority of sectors in the economy including manufacturing industry, transport, construction,
trade, public services, agriculture and residential property. The law has required the break-up
and restructuring of large enterprises into smaller units prior to sale and as a result, the
number of enterprises to be privatized under LIPSP did increase from the initial number of
3,500 to over 8,400 in May 1994. The privatization of land, some other natural resources
and forestry, and the privatization of housing is covered by separate laws. Since the
beginning of the privatization process, various laws regulating privatization have been
amended or new laws and decrees have been introduced, to remove impractical features such
as very limited initial use of cash, to widen the circle of persons enjoying the right to acquire
privatized property including in some instances foreign investors, and to facilitate land
restitution by allowing payment in property other than that initially held, or vouchers. New
restrictions, however, were also introduced, in particular the right of employees to acquire on
a preferential basis up to 50 percent of the shares instead of 30 percent before3 and the right
for suppliers of agro-processing enterprises to purchase the remaining 50 percent of shares on
preferential terms.
Institutional Responsibilities for Privatization
3.5            A number of institutions share the responsibility for privatization in Lithuania.
Any of these institutions may propose the privatization of an enterprise, and the controlling
body of the enterprise may do so as well. In practice, however, monthly privatization
programns are developed by the Department of Privatization in the Ministry of Economics for
property under the jurisdiction of the Republic, and by local councils and commissions for
property under their respective jurisdictions. The Government and the local councils
3.     The additional 20 percent does not carry voting rights, however.



- 15 -
determine the assets under their respective jurisdictions that will not be privatized. Thus,
there are various lists of 'strategic' enterprises not to be sold.
3.6            At the central level, the Central Privatization Commission is appointed and
may be dissolved only by Presidential decree. This Commission has the following
responsibilities:
-      confirming the national privatization program in coordination with the
Government (either body can take decisions on privatization);
-      approving privatization proposals for property under the jurisdiction of the
line Ministries;
-      certifying the results of privatization of property under Republican
jurisdiction, issuing titles of ownership, making decisions on initial prices,
price reductions and other sale conditions;
-      determining privatization procedures for enterprises that are classified as
monopolies (defined as producing over 50 percent of output in a given market)
in cases where break-up prior to sale is not possible;
-      approving the list of enterprises to be sold for hard currency (i.e., in so-called
commercial privatization, see paragraph 3.14 below).
3.7            In addition, the Commission can also prepare legislative proposals for
consideration by the Parliament, in coordination with the Government.
3.8            The privatization department of the Ministry of Economy performs an
advisory function with respect to the Central Commission and coordinates the implementation
of the Commission's decisions. The department consolidates the separate privatization
programs prepared by different line ministries and other state institutions which have
founders' functions, and those of local privatization commissions into a general (national)
privatization program for Lithuania. It also compiles monthly privatization programs and
submits these to the Central Commission for approval.
3.9            Local privatization commissions have been established in eleven cities and
forty-four districts (regions). These play the same role as the Central Commission with
respect to municipal property. The Central Commission may override the decisions of the
local commissions, and to some extent, monitors their activities though the right of
intervention is rarely exercised.
3.10           The actual implementation of privatization of both republican and local
property is carried out by privatization agencies. These are created by local councils. In
each district or town, the agency undertakes the privatization programs for all property subject
to privatization in that area, prepares the necessary documents, organizes auctions and public
subscriptions for shares, and makes recommendations to privatization commissions on
discounting the prices of property which could not be sold in the auctions. The agencies also
perform an informational role, providing relevant data for publication and for those who need
information on enterprises or assets being privatized.



- 16 -
Sales Methods
3.11           The privatization process in Lithuania has been dominated by the use of
vouchers4 and by the presence of significant insider preferences. Investment funds collecting
vouchers emerged spontaneously, and rules to regulate their behavior have been put in place
and/or are still being refined (see paragraph 2.27 above). Some concern emerged in late 1992
and early 1993 about a possible voucher overhang, with a substantial part of vouchers as of
that time not yet being used. It is expected, however, that any remaining overhang will be
further reduced as the first phase of the privatization program draws to a close (currently
scheduled for June 1995).
3.12           Privatization of industrial state property can take place either through auction,
public subscription of shares or so-called commnercial privatization. Entities whose book value
does not exceed 10,000 Litas are sold at auction, for a combination of cash and vouchers.
These auctions are organized by the local privatization agencies. Entities with a nominal
value exceeding 30,000 Litas are privatized through initial public offering (IPO) of shares,
again for a combination of cash and vouchers. Entities with a nominal value of between
10,000 and 30,000 Litas are sold either at auctions or through IPO (the choice is made by the
Central Privatization Commission). Employees of enterprises privatized through IPO have an
exclusive right to purchase up to 50 percent of the equity at the nominal value. For
enterprises in agro-processing, local farmers, other rural residents and suppliers have the right
to purchase the remaining 50 percent. None of these preferences apply in commercial
privatization. Some specific sub-sectors are sold through closed auctions (e.g., pharmacies,
veterinary medicine, medical services).
3.13           The IPO process at times has been ineffective in generating sales, due to the
presence of a rule that requires organization of a new auction in case of insufficient interest to
buy shares at the nominal price in the initial auction. This has led the Government to propose
several amendments to LIPSP, that were approved by Parliament in September 1992 and
February 1993. These amendments have introduced the possibility to sell enterprises that
failed to attract interest in an IPO to be sold through a tender method (the 'best business plan'
approach). Foreign and domestic investors were granted the right to participate in these
tenders. Under the best business plan approach, investors' proposals are evaluated according
to the business plan presented by potential buyers, taking into account factors such as job
preservation, new investment, etc. Price is a factor of secondary importance in the
evaluation.
3.14           Comrnercial privatization means sale through auction or tender for hard
currency, or by individual bid in case there is only one tenderer. Both foreign and local
investors can buy enterprises offered through these methods. The Central Privatization
Commission draws up the list of enterprises for hard currency sales, determines tender
features, evaluates bids and negotiates with the bidder(s). In case a foreign investor offers to
create a joint venture with an enterprise on the list for hard currency sale, the enterprise can
be taken off the list, and a joint venture be negotiated separately.
4.     The use of vouchers is administered by the SSB. The process of determining individual voucher
eligibility, of voucher distribution and of the actual use of the vouchers in sales transactions has been
relatively straightforward and simple, and implementation to date has been smooth.



- 17 -
3.15          Agricultural property is subject to so-called 'specific privatization'. To date,
agricultural privatization has taken place mainly through the break-up of 1,100 collective and
cooperative farms into 12,300 smaller units and the subsequent sale of these units. The right
to choose the privatization method is vested with farmers who have a priority right to
purchase farm property. Others can buy only if farmers don't exercise their priority right,
and in all land sales preference is given to those willing to farm. Farmers have been given
additional 'compensation' vouchers amounting to between 10 and 30 percent of regular
voucher holdings depending on the number of years they have been employed in the
agricultural sphere. The additional vouchers can only be used to purchase agricultural
property. Land plots offered for sale are limited in size, and there are restrictions on the use
of the land after sale. State-owned land for new construction is sold by way of auction and
for cash only. Under the Lithuanian constitution, legal entities (be they local or foreign) are
precluded from owning land; thus, land is sold only to individuals.
Results to Date
3.16          The pace of privatization was fastest in the period until December 1992; there
was a brief formal interruption in the privatization process during which various amendments
to the enabling legislation were passed. The pace of privatization did not pick up
significantly, however, after passage of these amendments. This partly reflects the fact that
the best enterprises at that point already had been sold, but also increasingly proactive
attempts by insiders to position themselves for buy-ins. Founding bodies also did exert
growing pressure to shift enterprises out of the voucher auctions and into cash sales methods
in an attempt to generate cash. As of end December 1994 the results of voucher
privatization, privatization through auction and public subscription of shares were as outlined
in Table 3.2 below. It is estimated that up to an additional 25 percent of the total value of
state property has been privatized through other sales methods.

3.17          Small scale privatization has been virtually completed. Out of 2,993 small
units to be privatized under LIPSP 2,612 have been sold, mainly through auctions (of which
nearly 1,900 were already sold by the end of 1992). Two thousand five hundred medium-size
and large enterprises have been sold mainly through IPO, including 629 in industry, and a
large part of the value of the remainder is made up of strategic enterprises in sectors such as



- 18 -
energy and infrastructure. There is a group of about 200 enterprises for which initial
privatization efforts have either failed or have been stopped, due to problems of viability
and/or pressures exerted by insiders to take their firm off the list of units to be sold through
public sales methods. Privatization of the housing stock also has been virtually completed,
with 93 percent of the total stock in private hands as of March 1994. Privatization of farms
also has had significant results, with some 29 percent of total cultivated areas presently held
by private farms.
C. Private Sector Development
3.18          Due to the early and successful privatization of both small and large
businesses, Lithuania has experienced rapid growth in the development of the private sector.
The number of registered private enterprises increased dramatically from 48,278 in mid 1992
to 88,446 in mid 1993. As of April 1994, more than half (53 percent) of the working
population was employed in the private sector.
3.19          As in other transitional economies, the growth of the private sector has
hitherto been concentrated mainly in trade and services. The sharp increase in the number of
enterprises in industry is probably to a large extent attributable to the rapid pace of the
privatization program and the break-up, in the process, of large industrial state enterprises
into smaller units rather than to the emergence of new manufacturing activity. Table 3.3
provides a sectoral breakdown of the small business population in Lithuania (defined as
businesses with fewer than 100 employees).

3.20          These statistics on private sector activity, however, may be unreliable on two
counts. In the first place, they do not capture the informal, non-registered private sector
which is probably quite large. In addition, there appears to be less visible private sector
activity in Lithuania than progress in privatization and the early implementation of a series of



- 19 -
small business development measures5 would suggest. This may reflect the continued
presence of constraints to the development of new businesses, favorable tax treatment for new
start-up businesses and also constraints to post-privatization restructuring. The Bank has
recently completed a Private Sector Assessment documenting these constraints and formulating
recommendations for their removal.
11 Legal Framework
Enterprise Law
3.21          Lithuania's Law on Enterprises constitutes an umbrella law for different
company structures. The law defines the accepted legal forms of enterprise ownership and the
owner liability associated with each form, identifies what activities are prohibited without a
license issued by the Govermnent of Lithuania, and specifies what activities are restricted to
state enterprises. The Law specifically does not apply to entities engaged in "non-
commnercial" activities. In addition to defining the basic forms of enterprise ownership, the
law provides for court review of license denials or delays, provides for independence from
state interference in corporate governance, establishes basic documentary requirements, and
sets out the bases for liquidation and reorganization. Separate legislation has either been
enacted or is envisioned to establish rules governing the allowable forms of company
ownership such as: (i) sole proprietorships; (ii) general partnerships; (iii) limited
partnerships; (iv) stock corporations--both public and closed; (v) state enterprises;
(vi) agricultural companies; and (vii) cooperative companies.
3.22          The Law on Enterprises provides for certain activities which cannot be
undertaken without a license issued by the Government. These include, inter alia, legal
practice, pharmacies, various mining activities, tourist services, and prospecting for mineral
deposits. The Enterprise Law further identifies goods and services which only the state can
provide, e.g., manufacture or sale of narcotics, alcohol, explosives, and treatment of specific
diseases.
3.23          The Law on Enterprises essentially follows a German model of corporate
governance. For corporations with more than fifty shareholders or more than 200 employees,
a two-tier governance structure (management board and supervisory council) is mandatory.
Supervisory councils consist of three to fifteen members, one-third of whom are selected by
the employees and two-thirds of whom are elected by the general assembly of shareholders.
As currently written, the law poses a number of problems fbr effective corporate governance,
e.g., excessively limited scope of liability for management board and supervisory council
members, payment of management board and supervisory council members only out of
corporate profits, and prohibitions on delegation of functions. Given limited resource pools to
draw from, the law may also be overly restrictive in prohibiting an individual from serving on
more than three boards at one time. The law further fails to provide appropriate disclosure
hurdles as an individual or corporation increases its ownership of a target company. The
5.     These include the adoption, in December 1991, of a Law on Small Businesses, which offers various tax
concessions for firms with less than 100 employees, and introduces simplified accounting rules; the
issuance of a Government decree in 1992 requiring the contracting out of a number of public services;
the creation, with EU Phare assistance, of a nation-wide network of business centers, and the
availability of an EU Phare funded small business credit line.



- 20 -
recent adoption by Parliament of a new joint stock company law has remedied some of these
deficiencies, but further action will be needed to ensure consistency of this new law with the
Law on Enterprises.
Accounting Law
3.24         The Accounting Law covers both state-owned and private entities (excluding
banks, for which accounting rules are set by the BOL; see paragraph 2.44 above). It
mandates the use of IAS and EU directives (implementing regulations, however, have still not
been drafted). State enterprises, stock and limited liability companies are required to establish
"an independent accounting department or an accountant post", to approve specimen charts of
accounts, and to prepare annual financial statements including balance sheets, income
statements, changes in financial position, and notes. The law does not provide for
certification of audit professionals nor does it provide for a body to rule on appropriate
accounting practices. Clearly, further reform measures in this area are needed, and the IMF
EFF Program envisages specific policy actions to meet this need.
Bankruptcy Law
3.25         The current Law on Bankruptcy applies to enterprises governed by the Law on
Enterprises and specifies that proceedings against "banks and other credit institutions,
insurance agencies, and agricultural enterprises may be established by other . . . acts.
The law further provides that it does not apply to "special-purpose State enterprises,
budgetary and public organizations, or non-profit organizations." There was a separate law
on the bankruptcy of agricultural companies that expired in March 1994. Neither the regular
bankruptcy law nor the law on the bankruptcy of agricultural companies has been used to any
meaningful extent. This is due to, among others, the presence in the law until recently of
certain specific preconditions for bankruptcy (e.g.,bankruptcy against a company could not be
initiated if its financial difficulties stemmed from unpaid receivables), the absence of detailed
implementing procedures, and the absence of courts with a specific responsibility for
bankruptcy. To remedy the situation, the Bank requested enactment of a set of amendments
to the bankruptcy law and other related laws and initiation of two pilot bankruptcies of
inviable state enterprises as a precondition for the proposed Project. Satisfactory amendments
were approved by Parliament in May 1994, and a new court law was adopted recently that
assigns responsibility for bankruptcy cases to the old arbitration court in Vilnius, which has
been transformed into a commercial court.
3.26         During appraisal of the proposed Project, a detailed review was undertaken of
the amendments and of the implementation of the law as amended in two pilot out-of-court
bankruptcy proceedings for inviable state enterprises. This review concluded that the
amendments constitute sufficient progress towards allowing a meaningful use of the
bankruptcy law. Notwithstanding the fact that this condition for the proposed Project has
been met, further technical assistance to the authorities will be needed to assist them in
developing measures that would further facilitate the use of the bankruptcy process. USAID
has agreed in principal to provide such assistance. The IMF EFF Program also contains
specific steps and timing of additional policy action in this area.



- 21 -
3.27           Founding ministries can initiate the reorganization/liquidation of state-owned
enterprises under an out-of-court bankruptcy procedure. However, until recently, little
experience existed with this procedure, and transparent implementation rules did not exist.
Two pilot reorganizations/liquidations of the state-owned enterprises Vilma and Panevezys
--both of which failed initial privatization attempts--are providing valuable experience in this
regard and input into the development of transparent implementation rules. During Project
appraisal, proof was obtained that action plans for the reorganization/liquidation of these
companies exist and have been formally adopted by the companies' creditors, and while they
are not very sophisticated, progress towards their implementation has been made. During
appraisal, it also has become apparent that the Ministry of Industry, at its own initiative, has
initiated the reorganization/liquidation under out-of-court bankruptcy proceedings of another
five troubled state-owned enterprises. Notwithstanding the progress made, also in this area
additional technical assistance is available to the authorities from EU Phare through its
assistance to Consulta (paragraph 4.20) to accelerate the process and achieve early results.
E. Issues in the Enterprise Sector
3.28           The key reform priority in the enterprise sector appears to be the initiation of
post-privatization adjustment by larger enterprises. The proposed Project addresses this issue
by providing technical assistance for post-privatization restructuring, and investment finance
for restructuring and expansion activities. Other constraints to private sector development and
foreign direct investment will also need to be removed to sustain the hitherto rapid growth of
the private sector.
3.29           Another important area in which further reform efforts are needed is the legal
framework and the supporting infrastructure. Inconsistencies between the enterprise law and
the new joint stock company law need to be removed. Inviable state-owned firms need to be
reorganized/liquidated and their assets freed up for more productive use in private hands.
Transparent procedures for out-of-court reorganization and liquidation of such firms need to
be developed, and a cadre of trained administrators/liquidators must be created. Similarly,
for troubled privatized firms the restructuring process needs to be initiated. The proposed
Project has started to address these issues by having requested enactment of meaningful
amendments to the bankruptcy law and related legislation and the initiation of pilot
reorganization and/or liquidation of inviable state-owned enterprises under the bankruptcy law
as conditions for negotiations. The technical assistance component of the Project also
supports the training of administrators/liquidators. More can be done, however, to further
enhance the efficiency of the bankruptcy process, e.g., a bankruptcy procedures code should
be developed, bankruptcy judges will need to be trained, the number of courts that can handle
bankruptcy cases should be increased, etc. and specific policy actions in this area are
envisaged under the IMF EFF Program. While these actions will further strengthen the
bankruptcy process, this process in and of itself may be of limited use as a tool for economy-
wide enterprise restructuring, and additional measures, including the introduction of simplified
legal procedures and the creation of strong incentives for both creditors and debtors to initiate
and successfully conclude restructuring efforts will probably be needed to generate a critical
mass of enterprise adjustment. It is envisaged that this issue and the other remaining issues
outlined in this section will be taken up in the context of a follow-up operation.
3.30           Even though Lithuania has made significant and early progress in enterprise
privatization, a number of issues remain to be resolved for the process to be successfully
completed. The intransparent nature of the legal and institutional framework for privatization.



- 22 -
coupled with heavy reliance on voucher privatization and insider preferences, are limiting the
effectiveness of the privatization process, and are likely to have contributed to the slow pace
of post-privatization adjustment in enterprise behavior. Restrictions on post-privatization
labor lay-offs and changes in business activity also are likely to have inhibited post-
privatization adjustment. Moreover, the new shareholders--possibly with the exception of the
more sophisticated IFs--are, as yet, ill-prepared to evaluate the worth of what they hold and to
actively exercise governance over the companies they own. New sales methods, such as
privatization through liquidation, are needed to deal with troubled enterprises that cannot be
sold easily through regular means, and the privatization of remaining state property of a non-
strategic nature needs to be accelerated.
3.31          Due to a requirement to survey land before it is restituted, the resolution of
claims for the restitution of land is proceeding only slowly: as of December 1, 1994 only
142,409 out of a total of 560,684 claims (or just 25.4 percent) had been processed. Legal
entities cannot own land, which inhibits the development of a land market and limits the
possibilities for the banking system to undertake secured lending. With regard to housing,
pressures may arise to reverse the privatization that has occurred if gaps in the legal
framework (such as the absence of condominium laws) and issues such as the maintenance of
common property are not addressed. Some steps have already been taken to address these
issues. A draft Condominium law has been submitted to Parliament recently, and the
Government is working on a proposal to amend the Constitution in order to allow legal
entities and foreigners to own land.
3.32          The Ministry of Economy has been working on redesigning the privatization
process. The ongoing voucher privatization program will formally end in June 1995 and it is
expected that the next phase of the privatization process will be cash-based only and thus
radically different from the first phase. A new draft law has been prepared to replace LIPSP.
The Government is currently reviewing the draft, and has agreed under the IMF EFF
Program to submit it to Parliament. Additional policy measures envisaged under the IMF
EFF Program, particularly those related to the commercialization of remaining state
enterprises, will complement the new privatization legislation.
3.33          The proposed Project aims to supplement and reinforce these reform initiatives
by focusing specifically on the privatization of troubled state enterprises through
reorganization/liquidation, on building up the capability of the banking sector to support post-
privatization restructuring and on preparing the grounds for an effective use of the bankruptcy
process. The provision of targeted technical assistance to privatized enterprises will also
contribute to maintaining the momentum and political support for privatization.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Development and Objectives
4.1           The Government's Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project will be
supported by a proposed World Bank Loan of about US$25 million equivalent which would
finance two components:
-      a credit line component of about US$20.5 million equivalent, to be channelled
through qualifying participating banks to private and privatized enterprises;
and
-      a technical assistance component of US$4.5 million for assistance to private
and privatized enterprises in business planning and restructuring, and for
assistance to state-owned enterprises that need to be reorganized or liquidated.
4.2           Grant-based technical assistance from various bilateral and multilateral sources
will supplement the Bank financed technical assistance component (see paragraph 4.16). To
the extent additional grant funding is obtained, there will be a reallocation from the technical
assistance component of the Loan to the credit line component.
4.3           The Project was conceived following a study of Lithuania's financial and
enterprise sectors, finalized in March 19936 which demonstrated that: (i) there is a need for
further policy reform in the enterprise and financial sectors and the fortunes of these two
sectors are intimately linked; (ii) private and privatized enterprises need reasonably-priced
medium-term finance and technical assistance to prepare and implement critically needed
restructuring plans; and (iii) the commercial banks lack resources of the right maturity as well
as the required appraisal skills to prudently make loans of this type. With its strong prior
policy action requirements and blend of credit and technical assistance, the Project is designed
to address all of these issues.
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.4            The proposed operation will support the restructuring and strengthening of
both the enterprise and banking sectors. As noted above, it evolved from the Bank's informal
study of the enterprise and financial sectors. The findings of this study were reconfirmed
during Project appraisal. The presence of a strong demand for term finance also was
corroborated during the assessment of Lithuania's eligibility for SCL terms. Estimated credit
demand projections of five private prospective participating banks--only a subset of the total
banking system--were a multiple of the proposed credit line amount. Interviews with a larger
number of banks, undertaken in the context of the Private Sector Assessment, also
reconfirmed the presence of strong loan demand and identified the lack of term finance as a
serious constraint on the banks' lending activity.
4.5           The Bank throughout Project preparation has sought and helped to find
solutions to these problems. Technical assistance has been incorporated in the proposed
6.     The study is available in the Project file.



- 24 -
Project's design to strengthen the capacity of enterprises to prepare bankable investment
projects, of commercial banks to provide prudent yet supportive banking services, including
in particular credit appraisal skills, and of the BOL to regulate and supervise the commercial
banks. During Project preparation the Bank has also assisted in the development of
mechanisms for utilizing technical assistance to initiate the reorganization and/or liquidation of
inviable state enterprises. The Bank has helped to coordinate bilateral and multilateral aid
input to finance this technical assistance package, and will supplement these resources to fill
critical gaps. Working closely with the Government of Sweden, and in parallel with similar
operations in the other Baltic countries, the Bank has helped to design and develop
mechanisms for the proposed injections of capital into qualified banks which will augment
their capacity to expand lending from the Bank itself as well as from other sources.
C. The Credit Line Component
4.6           The credit line component will provide a line-of-credit of about US$20.5
million equivalent, to be channelled through an Apex unit to be established in the BOL to
participating commercial banks. Qualifying private enterprise borrowers under the credit line
can be engaged in a broad range of economic activity, including all forms of production as
well as the provision of services. Specifically, the credit line component will finance the
procurement of machinery and equipment, spare parts and permanent working capital, the
construction or purchase of plant, building or storage facilities associated with start-up or
expansion projects, and cost-effective investments in technology improvements and waste
minimization which would have environmental benefits. This component will also assist to
finance the technical assistance services required to address and resolve production,
marketing, and financial management needs of private sector enterprises.
Eligibility Criteria for Participating Banks
4.7            A set of eligibility criteria will be used to determine the suitability of
Lithuanian banks for participation in the credit line and the Swedish equity program. To
qualify, a bank must:
(a)    have an acceptable audit report which (i) covers one full year of operations,
(ii) incorporates a portfolio review, and (iii) is prepared by an internationally
recognized audit firm in accordance with IAS;
(b)    have been in existence and have produced operating results for a minimum of
two years;
(c)    agree to engage in an institutional development program (i) designed in
conjunction with the World Bank, (ii) to address identified deficiencies, and
(iii) to be implemented with the assistance of a foreign bank or other
acceptable experts;
(d)    provide a Certificate of Compliance from the BOL stating (i) that it has a
valid banking license, and type and date of license, (ii) that the BOL is not
aware of any criminal proceedings ongoing against the Bank or any of its
shareholders holding voting rights in excess of 10 percent, and (iii) that the
Bank is in general compliance with all relevant banking laws and regulations.



- 25 -
(e)    have minimum assets (as defined under IAS) equivalent to US$25 million;
(f)    have minimum equity capital = net worth = assets minus liabilities as defined
under IAS equivalent to US$2 million and will increase its capital as necessary
to comply with future increases required by the BOL;
(g)    have a minimum BIS risk-weighted capital (as defined under IAS) adequacy
ratio of 4 percent by year-end 1994, 5 percent by year-end 1995, 6 percent by
year-end 1996, 7 percent by year-end 1997 and 8 percent by year-end 1998;
(h)    have exposure to any one borrower as a percent of its IAS equity capital of no
more than 50 percent by year-end 1994, 40 percent by year-end 1995, 35
percent by year-end 1996, 30 percent by year-end 1997 and 25 percent by
year-end 1998; and
(i)    have aggregate exposure to insiders (defined as Council members, members of
the Management Board, employees in a management position and shareholders
with voting rights in excess of 10 percent) of no more than 100 percent of
IAS equity capital as of year-end 1994, 90 percent as of year-end 1995, 80
percent as of year-end 1996, 70 percent as of year-end 1997 and 60 percent as
of year-end 1998.
4.8           In the course of Project preparation, Bank staff visited 10 banks that have
expressed interest in participation in the credit line and the Swedish equity program.
Discussions with these banks have focused on identifying whether or not they would comply
with the qualification criteria, and on identifying their technical assistance needs. Results
suggest a critical mass of private qualifying banks (4-5) exists. A final and detailed
assessment of prospective participating banks will be undertaken once the banks' end-year
1994 IAS audits are available.
The Swedish Equity
4.9           It is anticipated that equity from the Swedish Capital Fund will be made
available to the participating banks in a fixed ratio with World Bank funds. Hence, a
qualified bank which is making a qualified sub-loan and which also has reached an agreement
with the Swedish Capital Fund on investment conditions, will receive financing for the sub-
loan in the form of a subsidiary loan from the World Bank credit line (through the Apex), as
well as funds in the form of a capital injection from the Swedish Capital Fund.
4.10          The Swedish Capital Fund, as equity owner, is expected to exercise its rights
of governance in the recipient banks by, inter alia, requesting representation in the recipient
banks' Council. The Fund's representatives are expected to be experienced commercial
bankers, who will actively monitor bank managements' activities and request corrective action
as and when needed. It is also anticipated that the Fund will obtain up to a maximum of
20 percent of total voting rights. Furthermore, provisions will be build into the Fund's
capital contribution that will automatically trigger changes, such as temporarily increasing the
Fund's voting and dividend rights, in case predetermined events that jeopardize the bank's
solvency occur.



- 26 -
4.11           Relevant laws and regulations, and a number of bank statutes (bylaws) have
been reviewed to assess whether the Swedish capital can be injected into participating banks
without requiring any changes. It appears that the existing laws provide sufficient flexibility
in structuring bank capital investments in a manner that allows strong corporate governance to
be exercised along the lines outlined above. Also, there appears to be no need to modify
existing Lithuanian bank capital definition rules to allow capital injections in the form of
various types of preferred and common stock and subordinated debt to be accommodated.
Criteria for Sub-Borrowers and Sub-Projects
4 12           The- fllowing criteria for borrowinlg enterprises and their sub-projects are
r ropose(i
Enterprises will be required to mzeet the following criteria to obtain a sub-loan
under the proposed line ot credit:
-      private ownership of 5 1 percent or more;
-      a maximum debt:equity ratio of 70:30 (after receipt of the sub-loan);
Sub-projects will be required to meet the following criteria to be eligible for
financing under the proposed line of credit:
for sub-loans above IJS$500,000 equivalent, a financial rate of return
of at least 20 percent and an economic rate of return of at least 15
percent (the calculation of economic rates of return will be required
only in cases where major price distortions in inputs or outputs are
evident);
certification from the relevant local or national authorities that the
proposed sub-project meets all environmnental laws and standards in
force in Lithuania, as well as the World Bank policy on environmental
assessment.
4.13           In addition, as part of the eligibility criteria for sub-borrowers and sub-
projects, participating banks will be expected to include in their credit appraisals a
demonstration that the currency and terms of the sub-loans are appropriate given the projected
revenues of the sub-borrowers (see paragraph 5.2).
Maturity of Sub-Loans
4.14           Sub-loans will have a minimum maturity of two years, to ensure that the
World Bank resources are not used to finance short term needs such as trade finance, for
which other sources of funding are readily available. Assuming that the participating banks
do not like to incur a funding mismatch, the maximum maturity of the sub-loans will be
driven by the proposed bullet repayment7 of all subsidiary loans to the Apex (i.e., nine and
7.     Repayment of principal in one installment after the grace period.



- 27 -
one-half years after extension of the first subsidiary loan, see paragraph 5.5). Thus,
maximum sub-loan maturity is likely to decline over time.
Environmental Requirements
4.15          The Project is a category "B" project involving financial intermediary lending.
It is proposed that the environmental screening of sub-projects will use existing Lithuanian
environmental standards and permitting mechanisms. Bank environmental staff have reviewed
these standards and mechanisms, and have found them to be satisfactory. EU Phare funded
consultants have been working with the newly created Ministry of Environment on the
preparation of a new Environmental Impact Assessment Law, which is currently being
reviewed by the Government. Until this new law is adopted, existing standards will be
followed. Therefore, the primary environmental emphasis of this Project will be to ensure
that these existing standards and permitting mechanisms are properly used (see paragraph 5.29
below).
D. The Technical Assistance Component
4.16          For the credit line program described above to be effective, it will be critical
to ensure that adequate technical assistance is in place to overcome deficiencies in: (i) bank
supervision; (ii) commercial banks' institutional capacity and appraisal skills; and
(iii) enterprise strategic planning capacity. In addition, targeted assistance to ensure sub-
projects are adequately screened for environmental impact will also be provided (see
paragraph 5.29 below). The following paragraphs describe the technical assistance plan
which is being developed to accomplish these objectives, together with a financing package
which is being assembled to pay for it. The newly created Enterprise Restructuring and
Consulting Agency (Consulta) will assume project implementation responsibilities for the
Bank funded part of the technical assistance component of the proposed Project (see
paragraphs 5.1, 5.22 below).
Bank Regulation and Supervision
4.17          The BOL has received technical assistance from a variety of institutions
including the World Bank, the IMF, the US Treasury, the Government of Switzerland and
others. However, in response to an immediate and obvious need, the BOL has embarked on a
comprehensive program to further strengthen its regulatory and supervisory capability. This
program is outlined in more detail in paragraph 5.16 below. USAID is funding the bulk of
the foreign assistance needed to implement the program, while ongoing IMF involvement will
finance the remainder. This assistance is a critical element of the proposed program of World
Bank support, as bank regulation and supervision will be an important vehicle for determining
the initial and continuing eligibility of Lithuanian banks to participate in the proposed capital
expansion and credit line scheme. Until and unless the BOL's supervisory capability has been
sufficiently built up, however, significant reliance will also be placed on the use of end-year
IAS audits prepared by international auditors.
Strengthening Commercial Banks
4.18          Enhancing banking skills so that bankers can make sensible decisions about
investment lending is a critical element of the proposed Project. Several of the commercial



- 28 -
banks have already taken steps to secure this type of expertise both through local recruitment
and the services of foreign advisors. However, further support will be required for each of
the banks to obtain the level of expertise which will be required to make them eligible for
participation in the Project. A very effective way of obtaining this type of assistance is
through a twinning arrangement with a Western bank, whereby that bank would agree to
provide staff over a period of about two years, with specific skills as required, to design and
implement an institutional development program for the Lithuanian bank. Other forms of
providing technical assistance (e.g., using banking consultants) may also be appropriate.
4.19           For commercial banks which otherwise qualify for participation in the
proposed Project, a technical assistance scheme is proposed whereby EU Phare, the Swedish
Government and other bilateral donors would finance the cost of securing the necessary
expertise (see also paragraph 5.19 below).
The Enterprise Restructuring and Consulting Agency (Consulta)
4.20           Two types of technical assistance for enterprises are envisaged: post-
privatization assistance for privatized enterprises, and pre-privatization assistance for those
enterprises for which initial privatization attempts have failed. Under a program developed
jointly by the Lithuanian Government, EU Phare and the World Bank, this assistance will be
made available through the newly created Enterprise Restructuring and Consulting Agency
(Consulta). This agency is an independent non-profit organization, with an overview Board
comprising representatives of various line ministries, the private sector and the scientific
community. Consulta is supported by a consortium of foreign consulting firms funded by EU
Phare and will be responsible for the implementation of the program.
4.21           Full-time staffing of Consulta will consist of four long term foreign experts,
one of whom will be designated Team Leader, and eight local staff. While Agency staff will
conduct initial enterprise diagnoses and provide immediate advice to enterprises, the Agency
will also have access to funds from sources other then EU Phare and its own means, including
the proposed World Bank funds, to finance special studies and the preparation of realistic
business plans and restructuring plans as appropriate. The Agency is also expected to play a
coordinating role in matching specific enterprise assistance needs with technical assistance
offered from a variety of sources.
4.22           It is anticipated that the principal clients for pre-privatization technical
assistance will be state-owned enterprises for which privatization efforts have failed. Two
pilot studies in major electronic enterprises where privatization has not been successful have
confirmed the urgent need for this kind of assistance. According to the Ministry of Industry,
there are at least forty more enterprises in similar situations. While in a few cases, some
simple restructuring may be appropriate to isolate the core business which could then be
privatized as a going concern, more typically it is envisioned that the main work of this type
will be the reorganization of the assets into relatively small, saleable packages for liquidation.
In this respect, a small component of the proposed technical assistance package would be a
program to train Lithuanian administrators/liquidators for this work. A similar program has
been effectively implemented in Estonia and the experience of this program would be applied
to Lithuania. Candidates for pre-privatization assistance would be identified through the
initiation by creditors of reorganization under bankruptcy or, alternatively, the founding



- 29 -
ministries may initiate such reorganization. The principal objective would be to tum assets
over as quickly as possible to new owners who could use them to start new businesses and
create new employment opportunities. The Agency would not charge fees for this work.
4.23          Post-privatization technical assistance is essentially envisaged as low-cost
consulting services to be made available to enterprises whose management is not well
equipped or experienced in strategic business planning in a market economy. This applies to
many Lithuanian enterprises, especially those privatized primarily for vouchers. The need for
such assistance was dramatically evidenced by five pilot studies in privatized enterprises.
While the specific problems and the future prospects of each of these companies differed, they
all had a clear requirement for immediate technical assistance to define their strategic
direction and to prepare realistic business plans for their future operations.
4.24          In response to a request from an individual enterprise, Consulta will send a
small team to an enterprise to undertake an initial diagnosis. The outcome of this diagnosis
would be immediate advice to the enterprise and, where appropriate, proposals for additional
technical assistance such as a market study, a feasibility study, or a detailed business plan
which may be required to obtain investment financing from the World Bank credit line or
other sources. Where such additional work is required, Consulta may propose specific
expertise from its own resources, or work with the enterprise to prepare detailed terms of
reference and to identify a short-list of qualified consultants (including, where appropriate,
executive volunteer programs) to undertake the work. Enterprises would not be charged for
initial diagnostic work, but would typically pay 20 percent of the foreign costs and 40 percent
of the local costs of any subsequent studies or other types of assistance, adding up to about
USS0.8 million equivalent in total. These percentages will be reviewed from time to time
during Project supervision.

Financing Plan
4.27           As detailed below in Table 4.3, the proposed financing plan includes the
US$10 million of Swedish equity for bank capitalization, the proposed World Bank loan of
approximately US$25 million, and technical assistance funds from a variety of sources
including EU Phare, USAID, and other donors. Enterprises will pay an estimated US$0.8
million equivalent for post-privatization assistance (paragraph 4.24 above), as well as a part of
sub-project cost (by raising equity) in case they cannot meet the 70:30 debt:equity ratio test
(paragraph 4.12 above). This co-payment is estimated to be US$6 million equivalent. Details
of the proposed on-lending terms for World Bank funds are presented below in paragraph 5.3.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
A. Proposed Lending Arrangements
5.1           The proposed World Bank Loan of about US$25 million equivalent would be
made to the Government represented by the Ministry of Finance. As further elaborated
below, the Ministry would on-lend the credit line component (two tranches of US$17.5
million and DM4.5 million respectively) to participating banks through an Apex to be
established in the BOL, and would make the remaining US$4.5 million available as a
technical assistance grant to Consulta. A detailed Project Implementation Plan is provided in
Annex IV.
Eligibility for Single Currency Loan
5.2           For the credit line component, the Government has requested an SCL with
two tranches of US$17.5 million and DM4.5 million as all of the prospective participating
banks: (i) have sizeable anticipated loan demand from borrowers which earn revenues in
these currencies (in an aggregate ratio of approximately 85:15 percent); (ii) conduct a
substantial part of their lending and other operations in these currencies; (iii) are all privately
owned and thus autonomous from the Lithuanian Government, and will service their share of
Bank debt from their own resources; and (iv) have the capacity to manage the risk associated
with the foreign currency on their books. Moreover, all sub-borrowers will be privately
owned (see paragraph 4.12) and therefore autonomous from the Government. These
enterprises are responsible for managing their own foreign exchange risk. An SCL in US$ is
also proposed for the technical assistance component as: (i) it is relatively small compared
with the credit line component; (ii) the Government will have the capacity both to service this
debt and manage the risk associated with it; and (iii) this component may be reallocated to the
credit line component to the extent additional grant resources can be found. Eligibility for the
Bank's pilot SCL program was established during appraisal and confirmed during
negotiations.
Intermediation Spreads
5.3           Proposed intermediation spreads are outlined in Table 5.1 below. These
spreads will be reviewed from time to time during Project supervision. Such reviews will
take into account cost and risk considerations on the one hand, and the price of World Bank
funds compared to funds from other sources on the other hand.

For the Technical
Assistance
Component
From Government    passed on interest-    This component constitutes direct Government
to Consulta for     free and without      assistance to the enterprise sector, financed by the
technical assistance   repayment obligation   World Bank Loan, but repayable from budgetary
resources when due
5.4              The Bank has suggested and the Government has agreed that the 1 percent
spread for the Government be placed by the Ministry of Finance in an escrow account, where
it will earn interest over the life of the Loan. Assuming that both the credit line component
of the Bank Loan and the subsidiary loans to the participating banks will have a bullet
maturity structure (see below), this would provide a buffer against the risk of non-repayment
by participating banks of approximately 20-25 percent of the total principal balance due. The
balance could also be used to cover any defaults by participating banks on their interest
payment obligations.
The Bullet Maturity
5.5            The standard term for World Bank lending to Lithuania is 20 years, including
5 years of grace, with principal repayed in installments after the grace period. Since the
initial sub-loans under the credit line component are expected to be for terms as short as 2-3
years (see paragraph 4.14), and given that Lithuania has requested the maximum loan life
available to it, this raises the question as to how reflows from these initial loans should be
treated. If the 20 year maturity is preserved, three options are possible: (i) leave the funds
with the participating banks for the full 20 years, which is an excessively long period of time
compared with the life-spans of the underlying sub-projects and would eliminate the incentive



- 35 -
for the banks to seek alternative sources of long-term funding early on; (ii) recycle the funds
back to the Apex for subsequent relending, which would require the Apex to continue to
perfbrm its functions long beyond Project supervision will have ceased; or (iii) repay the
funds to the Government which can simply have the use of them for general Government
spending until they are due to be repaid to the World Bank. All of these options have their
drawbacks, particularly since World Bank supervision of the Project will end long before the
Loan is repaid and therefore it is proposed, for the credit line component, to use a Loan with
a 10 year maturity. In order to provide the Government of Lithuania with the same average
life for this component of the Loan, it is proposed that the Loan be structured as a single
bullet repayment to the World Bank at the end of that term. The Government would then on-
lend the funds to the participating banks as bullet loans with a maturity no greater than 9 1/2
years.
5.6           The Government of Lithuania and the participating banks have requested a
bullet structure rather than standard country terms. The use of a 10 year bullet maturity as
opposed to the standard repayment terms, in combination with allowing the banks to use the
reflows, is particularly attractive to the Lithuanian banks given the current composition of
their liabilities. The bulk of the banks' liabilities are currently very short term, while the
mraturity of foreign credit lines--including G-24 funds initially intended for balance-of-
payments support and subsequently converted into bank credit lines--generally does not exceed
5 years, and in many cases is of a bullet nature. While participating banks are keen to have a
stable source of long-term financing in order to extend the maturities of their lending to 2-5
years, they do not want to incur 20-year liabilities at this time. The shorter amortization
period is more suitable for participating banks' emerging business plans. It reduces the risk
of managing reflows, both by the participating banks and the Government, and will encourage
the participating banks to develop access, without their Government's guarantee, to other
funding sources for the future. The bullet structure will enable the participating banks to gain
experience in revolving the full amount of the credit line throughout the life of the loan and
simplifies their planning and budgeting for debt servicing, since there would only be one
repayment. The bullet maturity would, in addition, provide more flexibility to the banks to
manage their funding, for example by facilitating the use of interest rate swaps to convert the
Bank's floating rate funding into a fixed rate obligation. With a bullet maturity, entering into
such swaps would be both simpler and cheaper. Finally, the proposed bullet structure would
resemble the terms of other sources of funding currently available in the market.
5.7            The use of a bullet maturity will create a one-time refunding need for the
banks at the due date of the bullet subsidiary loans (i.e., after 9 1/2 years). Calculations
taking into account the projected Swedish equity injections, and assuming average annual asset
growth of 6 percent and a return on assets of 1 percent indicate that this refunding need would
be equal to approximately 30 percent of the banks' capital. Standard Bank loan terms would
result in lower, recurring refunding requirements over a period of 15 years. Given that
banks' average annual refunding requirements, however, generally are a multiple of bank
capital, particularly in Lithuania where the bulk of the banks' liabilities are currently very
short term, the additional refunding risk posed by the bullet structure is marginal and the risk
of default would not be substantially greater than would be the case if the loan were
structured on standard country terms. The participating banks will manage the liability
incurred under the Bank's Loan within the context of their overall asset/liability management.
The Government will manage its credit risk exposure by involving several participating banks
and by establishing the proposed escrow account (paragraph 5.4).



- 36 -
5.8           The proposed bullet structure is an attempt to tailor the Bank's lending
products better to the need of its clients, in this case the intermediary banks. Borrowing
enterprises will also benefit as the bullet maturity would significantly enhance the banks'
capability to undertake long term lending. The proposed bullet maturity is long enough to
allow relending of the reflows for two or three times, while at the same time it is not so long
that it would take away the incentive for the banks to seek alternative sources of long term
funding early on. The bullet maturity might also act as an incentive for the banks to draw
down the credit line early, as the earlier they draw down the line, the sooner they could avail
themselves of the use of the reflows. If the proposed terms do indeed have these favorable
incentives effects, application of similar terms in other countries in comparable circumstances
may be warranted.
B. The Apex
Activities
5.9           The Apex Unit will have primary responsibility for channeling the World
Bank credit line to eligible participating banks for on-lending to viable investment sub-projects
in qualified enterprises.
5.10          Specific activities of the Apex will include:
-      Reviewing sub-loan applications, and ensuring their compliance with agreed
qualification criteria, and with Bank guidelines for procurement and policy on
environmental assessment.
-      initially, until the Bank is satisfied with the quality of sub-project
appraisal, full loan application and review documentation will be
prepared by the participating bank and reviewed ex ante by the Apex
as well as by the Bank;
-      thereafter, for sub-loans below US$1,000,000, loan application and
review documentation will be prepared and retained by the
participating bank; a simple summary will be provided to the Apex as
the basis for disbursement requests, but full documentation will be
available to the Apex on request so that it can fulfil its ex post review
obligations; for sub-loans over US$1,000,000 full documentation will
be passed on to the Apex and reviewed ex ante by both the Apex and
the Bank.
-      Opening a Special Account with sub-accounts in US$ and DM in a qualified
foreign bank for the management of World Bank funds, and disbursing funds
from the Special Account to eligible banks for financing eligible sub-projects.
-      Maintaining Project accounting records and arranging for regular audits of
Project accounts and the Special Account.
Conducting post-lending reviews of sub-project lending applications of the
borrowing banks.



- 37 -
Ensuring that all compliance requirements under the terms and conditions of
the proposed World Bank loan are met, monitoring overall aspects of Project
implementation, and preparing semi-annual progress reports to the World
Bank.
Informing the Swedish Capital Fund about disbursement activities under the
credit line component of the Project.
5.11          The Apex will work closely with the BOL's Bank Supervision Department in
assessing the initial and continuing compliance of participating banks with the Bank's
eligibility criteria. This notwithstanding, final determination of banks' eligibility to enter and
continue to participate in the proposed Project will rest with the Banking Supervision
Department, subject to World Bank approval.
Legal and Organizational Structure
5.12          The Apex will be a newly-created division in the BOL, under the
responsibility of the Director of the International Department. The Apex will be empowered
to act for the Government of Lithuania, in terms of disbursing and collecting World Bank
funds, and administering the relevant bank accounts. It will thus require authorization to hold
and conduct transactions in foreign exchange accounts.
5.13          The Apex will have four professional Lithuanian staff:
A General Manager, responsible for the overall operation of the Apex. The
General Manager will have management education and experience, and prior
experience in credit administration and banking.
A Credit Manager, responsible for: (i) ruling on sub-loan eligibility and
obtaining appropriate confirmations and approvals as required; (ii) preparation
of standard sub-loan documentation, and monitoring performance under sub-
loan agreements; and (iii) analysis and consolidation of sub-loan portfolio
performance, and reporting on this as required. The Credit Manager will
have an accounting background and prior experience in credit administration
and banking.
A Chief Accountant, who will be responsible for: (i) setting up a complete
accounting system for the Project; (ii) maintaining the Special Account,
including requesting replenishment and authorizing disbursements from the
Account; (iii) collecting repayments; (iv) ensuring repayments to the World
Bank; and (v) reporting, as required, on sub-project disbursements and
repayments. The Chief Accountant will have an accounting education and
experience.
A Project Officer who will be responsible for: (i) monitoring and advising on
procurement where necessary; (ii) verifying that participating banks adequately
screen sub-projects for environmental impact (paragraph 5.31); and



- 38 -
(iii) reviewing and reporting on physical progress of sub-project
implementation where appropriate. The Project Officer will have a technical
background and experience in project administration.
Training and Technical Assistance for the Apex
5.14          The head of the Apex has been selected, and is in the process of selecting the
remaining professional staff. The head of the Apex as well as the Director of the
International Department have already received preliminary familiarization and training on
World Bank procedures in Washington.
5.15          A short term foreign advisor is in place to assist the head of the Apex during
the initial period of the unit's operations. A longer term advisor with international experience
and knowledge of the Bank's procurement and disbursement policies and procedures will be
identified to provide specialized advice and on-the-job training to the Apex on credit line
procurement and disbursement thereafter. It is envisaged that this advisor would:
(i) coordinate and participate in the group's training; (ii) provide six months' continuous
advisory assistance in Vilnius beginning at Project effectiveness; and (iii) be available for
approximately one week per month for one year thereafter for such additional advisory
services as may be required. The total cost of this service is estimated to be some
US$250,000, including fees, travel and related expenses. The Swedish development agency
BITS has expressed interest in financing advisory services for the Apex unit. Detailed terms
of reference for the advisor can be found in Annex IIA.
C. Technical Assistance to the Financial Sector
Program to Strengthen Bank Regulation and Supervision
5.16          The BOL has made good progress in improving its supervisory capabilities.
However, much remains to be done, particularly in strengthening the on-site examination
process. For this purpose, the Bank has requested, as a precondition for the Project, and the
BOL has agreed, to adopt a program that consists of the following six elements:
-      Review, and where necessary revise, existing prudential regulations.
-      Increase the frequency of on-site bank examinations so that every bank in the
system will be examined at least once each year--this will require a
considerable increase in the number of examination staff.
-      Arrange for participation of a foreign bank examiner to assist in a series of
on-site bank examinations.
-      Develop detailed policies, procedures and reports for conducting on-site
examinations and for taking needed enforcement actions.
-      Develop an "early warning system" to identify problems in banks at an early
stage and to monitor developments in known problem banks.



- 39 -
Develop policies and procedures for handling problem  banks and begin the
process of closing insolvent banks.
5.17          During appraisal, it became apparent that the BOL has already taken steps to
implement this program. First, the BOL has hired several new examiners, thereby increasing
its capability to conduct on-site examinations. Second. a resident USAID funded bank
examiner is now in place. This examiner will design and participate in on-site examinations,
develop policies and procedures for conducting examinations, prepare a bank examination
manual, and upgrade the BOL's existing examination report form. Third, an additional
resident advisor financed by USAID has been in Vilnius since early January 1995 to assist in
the development of policies and procedures for handling problemii and failing banks.
Arrangement also has been made for the remainling time of two IMF funded advisors to be
used for reviewing the BOL's present prudential regulations and for developing an off-site
surveillance ("early warning") system.
5.18          Full implementation of the program will require approximately three to four
person years of technical assistance, most of which will be provided by USAID. Further
support will come from the IMF-financed technical advisors. It is expected that the duration
of the technical assistance program for the BOL will be between one-and-a-half and two
years. However, as the program is a 'minimum' program addressing only the most urgent
and immediate needs, it is anticipated that further assistance beyond this period may be
needed, and this issue will be taken up in the context of ongoing policy discussions with the
authorities.
Institutional Development Programs for Commercial Banks
5.19          Two private commercial banks will initially participate in the Project while it
is anticipated that two or three additional private banks will qualify for participation in the
near future. For the first group of qualifying banks, tailor-made terms of reference are being
developed to form the basis for a comprehensive institutional development program for each
bank. These institutional development programs should preferably take the form of twinning
arrangements with foreign banks. Part of the institution building effort will be focused on
training participating banks in the use of appropriate project appraisal methodologies and the
preparation of appropriate sub-loan documentation. In addition, the banks will receive
assistance in establishing adequate supervision practices, including the requirement that sub-
borrowers submit suitable financial statements on a regular basis and that banks carry out
periodic on-site inspections. The anticipated cost of the institutional development programs is
approximately US$1 million equivalent per bank. Financing for these efforts is available
from EU Phare, while other bilateral donors have also expressed an interest to provide grant
financing in this field. The institutional development programs for individual banks will be
supplemented by a joint donor effort, led by EU Phare, to create a bank training institute.
D. The Enterprise Restructuring and Consulting Agency (Consulta)
5.20          The principal lessons learned from the Bank-assisted program of pilot
enterprise studies are that there is a real and important need for technical assistance in many
Lithuanian enterprises. This assistance should take the form of a relatively long-term
advisory relationship rather than a quick one-time study. The proposed Consulta
arrangement, with a pool of permanent advisors and access to funds from a variety of



- 40 -
sources, including the proposed Loan, was conceived during Project preparation with
considerable input from Bank staff. This arrangement will ensure that a wide range of
consulting activities can be financed to meet specific needs of enterprises. Other key points to
note are:
Once a broad assistance strategy for an enterprise has been worked out (most
probably primarily with Consulta's own staff), subsequent assistance will be in
the nature of short, focussed interventions such as a quick market analysis, a
search for technical partners in relevant countries, a brief tour of similar
facilities outside Lithuania, or assistance in preparing a loan application
package for a specific investment.
The enterprises will pay for the assistance they receive (see paragraph 4.24).
If they have a stake in the study they are much more likely to take its
proposals and recommendations more seriously. The subsidy inherent in this
proposal reflects the national interest in promoting improved performance in
the industrial sector, and takes into account enterprises' own financial
constraints.
The enterprise managers will be actively involved in preparing the terms of
reference for any study or other consultant activity to assist them.
A "case officer" will be assigned to each enterprise to coordinate the various
assistance delivered, and to ensure responsiveness to individual enterprise's
special needs.
E. Procurement
5.21          Procurement will be undertaken by the borrowing enterprises with advice as
necessary from the participating banks or the Apex. All procurement of goods, works and
services will be according to World Bank guidelines for financially intermediated operations.
Goods and works costing less than US$1 million equivalent will be procured through
established local cormmercial practices. In anticipation of a formal Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) scheduled for FY95, information on the use of such practices by
private firms was gathered during appraisal, which confirms that private borrowers'
procurement practices do lead to competitive international prices and would be suitable for
packages of less than US$1 million equivalent. Due to the limited size of participating banks'
capital, it is anticipated that the average sub-loan will, at least initially during the period when
the banks are still building up their capital base, not exceed US$500,000 equivalent.
However, with the expected growth of bank capital over time, and possibly also with the
occurrence of syndicated lending, larger sub-loans may materialize. In the event requests for
financing of contracts of US$1 million equivalent or more will materialize, full international
competitive bidding (ICB) will be required, using the Bank's standard bidding documents. In
ICB procurement, local suppliers will be given a margin of preference of 15 percent. Prior
Bank review will be mandatory for (i) the first contract financed by each participating bank;
and (ii) all ICB procurement.



- 41 -
5.22          Consultant services procured under the Project will be procured according to
the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Contracts for consultant services below
US$50,000 equivalent for individuals and below US$100,000 equivalent for firms will require
a prior review by the Bank of the terms of reference only. The first two contracts procured
by Consulta, contracts equal to and above US$50,000 equivalent for individuals and equal to
and above US$100,000 equivalent for firms and single-source contracts will require a prior
review by the Bank of the terms of reference and be subject to the Bank's approval. Other
consulting contracts will be subject to the Bank's ex-post review.
F. Disbursement
5.23          Disbursements will be administered by the Apex for the credit line component
and by Consulta for the enterprise technical assistance component. To facilitate Project
implementation, two Special Accounts will be established (one for the credit line component
with two subaccounts in US$ and DM respectively, and one for the technical assistance
component in US$) in one of the major foreign commercial banks on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, to cover the Bank's share of expenditures. The authorized
allocations to the Special Account for the credit line component would be US$2.5 million and
DM1.0 million respectively, and the authorized allocation to the Special Account for the
technical assistance component would be US$200,000 equivalent, representing about four
months of average expenditures effected through the respective accounts. At the request of
the Borrower (i.e., the Ministry of Finance) and based on the Project's needs, the Bank will
make deposit or deposits into the Special Accounts up to the amount of the authorized
allocation8. Applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts will be submitted monthly
or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documen-
tation requirements for replenishment will follow standard Bank procedures. In addition,
monthly bank statements of the Special Accounts, which have been reconciled by the
Borrower, will accompany all replenishment applications. The minimum application size for
direct payments will be US$50,000 equivalent.
5.24          Statements of Expenditures will be used for expenditures under contracts for
goods and works under the credit line component of the Project of up to US$1,000,000
equivalent. In all other cases, full documentation will be required. Disbursements will be
made against 100 percent of the costs of local and foreign consultants, works, the CIF cost of
imported goods and the ex-factory cost of locally procured goods, and against 80 percent of
local expenditures for other items procured locally.
5.25          Retroactive financing for sub-projects and consulting activities procured under
Bank guidelines after October 15, 1994 is proposed up to a limit of US$2.5 million
equivalent, equal to 10 percent of the proposed amount of the credit. The Project is expected
to be completed by end 2000. The proposed closing date is June 30, 2001.
8.     With the proviso that initial deposits will not exceed US$1.5 million and DM0.5 million respectively
for the credit line component and US$0.1 million for the technical assistance component, until the
aggregate amount of withdrawals reaches US$4 million and DM2.5 million respectively for the credit
line component and US$0.7 million for the technical assistance component.

G. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting
5.26          The Borrower will be responsible for appropriate accounting for the funds
provided by the Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for
ensuring that audits of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. The
Apex and Consulta, on behalf of the Borrower, will establish appropriate accounting systems
to provide information on the proper receipt and use of the funds in accordance with the Loan
Agreement. The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-
related accounts will be maintained in accordance with IAS. Commercial banks will maintain
accounts for sub-loans supporting procurement and disbursement documents. This system
should ensure timely and accurate accounting of all transactions under the Loan and clear
presentation of financial information.
5.27          Audit reports for the Apex, Consulta and each commercial bank will be
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the close of each financial year. Audits
will also be carried out, at the same time, and for corresponding periods in accordance with
the World Bank guidelines, for Statements of Expenditures against which disbursements have
been made or are due to be made out of the Loan proceeds, and specific reference to the
Special Accounts and Statements of Expenditures will be made in the audit reports
accompanying the financial statements. The audit reports should also review the accounting
systems and supporting internal procedures and practices for the Special and Project Accounts
and Statements of Expenditures, and recommend any needed changes. The audits will be
performed by suitably qualified independent auditors acceptable to the World Bank and in
accordance with International Auditing Guidelines. The commercial bank audits will include
a certification that the commercial bank continues to be in compliance with the eligibility
criteria for participation (paragraph 4.7). Enterprises, as part of their sub-project
documentation, will have to provide audited accounts or accounts which have been approved
by the tax authorities.
5.28           In addition to this financial reporting, full progress reports will be prepared
by both the Apex and Consulta, and submitted to the Bank every six months. These reports
will detail all Project and related activities, report on progress in relation to agreed schedules,
and identify any problems which may have been encountered and which could adversely affect
the overall impact of the Project.
H. Environmental Aspects
5.29          One of the conditions of the World Bank Loan is that the participating banks
processing the sub-loans take into account the environmental legislation of Lithuania and the
policy of the World Bank on environmental assessment. Environmental screening of
individual sub-projects by the banks will be required and those sub-projects which require
environmental permits under Lithuanian law must receive approval prior to finalization of
lending. These approvals are issued by either the Environmental Impact Assessment Board
connected to the Ministry of Environment or by the Ministry's Regional Environmental
Protection Departments, depending on the classification of the proposed sub-project under
Lithuanian guidelines.



- 43 -
5.30          All of the parties involved in this process will require technical assistance to
ensure effective implementation of the requirements outlined above. For this purpose, a
technical assistance package with three sub-components has been developed during appraisal.
5.31          First, for banks and enterprises, an environmental manual in English and
Lithuanian is being developed that will explain the existing Lithuanian environmental
standards and permitting mechanisms and will provide guidance for their implementation.
The manual will also contain a negative list of activities which cannot be financed by the
Bank. During appraisal, prospective participating banks have been briefed about these aspects
of the credit line. Shortly before Loan effectiveness, a seminar for both banks and enterprises
will be held to demonstrate the use of this manual. A local consultant has been hired to
develop the manual, and is financed using PHRD Project preparation funds.
5.32          Second, a foreign advisor will provide assistance in institutional strengthening
of the Ministry of Environment and the Environmental Impact Assessment Board. USAID and
the US Environmental Protection Agency are providing financing for this advisor. Finally,
legal advice to define liability for the clean-up of existing and future pollution is being
provided to the Ministry of Justice and other involved ministries, financed from the PHRD
grant for Project preparation.
I. Supervision Arrangements
5.33          The proposed plan for Project supervision envisages an average of three
supervision missions per year. The skills mix of supervision staff would ensure the presence
of adequate bank supervision, banking, enterprise development and restructuring, environ-
mental and legal skills, as well as knowledge of Bank procurement and disbursement rules, as
necessary. A mid-term review is planned for January 1997, at which time overall progress
towards meeting Project objectives will be assessed. Annex III describes the proposed
supervision arrangements in more detail.
5.34          The Bank's monitoring will focus on: (i) the performance of the BOL in its
capacity as bank regulatory and supervisory agency and as Apex; (ii) the performance of
participating banks including their continued compliance with the eligibility criteria, financial
performance and the rate at which they are making sub-loans and the repayment character-
istics of such loans; (iii) Consulta, and its performance with respect to the delivery of
technical services to enterprises both pre- and post-privatization; and (iv) the performance of
enterprises receiving technical assistance and sub-loans under the credit line.

- 44 -
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
6.1           Anticipated benefits of the proposed Project are that it will:
(i)    improve the quality of bank intermediation, by strengthening (a) the legal and
regulatory environment in which banks operate, (b) the capacity of the BOL to
effectively monitor and supervise banks, and (c) the institutional capability and
capital base of a core group of private banks, enabling them to initiate and
expand their term lending to private enterprises with viable business plans;
(ii)   strengthen the supply response to the Government's reform program and
enterprisefinancial discipline, by (a) initiating the reorganization/liquidation
of inviable state-owned enterprises, thus freeing up their assets for more
productive use by private entrepreneurs, and laying the groundwork for the
initiation of the restructuring of troubled privatized enterprises, (b) providing
critical technical assistance to private and privatized enterprises to enable them
to make realistic assessments of their prospects under the rapidly changing
market conditions which they are facing, and (c) enabling these enterprises to
obtain term financing to undertake urgently needed restructuring and
expansion investments, thus strengthening their capacity to compete
effectively;
(iii) contribute to a more orderly development of the financial system and a
normalization of interest rates, by enhancing the BOL's capability to intervene
in troubled and informal banks and by providing stable long term funding to a
core group of banks; and
(iv)   through the SCL terms, enable the onlending of that currency which is best
suited to the needs of the sub-borrowers; SCL terms will also benefit the
participating banks and the Government as they can onlend in the currency
best suited to the needs of the sub-borrowers without having to assume the
foreign exchange risk themselves.
6.2            The Project also faces a number of risks. In particular, there is a risk of
further macroeconomic instability, which can make both lending and borrowing riskier and
which in some cases may lead to a mis-allocation of resources. Absence of a hard budget
constraint on the state-owned banks and Government directed/subsidized credit schemes may
also be a factor. Alleviation of this risk is provided by the currency board arrangement and
by the EFF approved by the IMF Board in October 1994. A second risk stems from
institutional weakness. The BOL is untested as a bank supervision agency, and the
commercial banks are small and still learning traditional commercial bank functions.
Technical assistance has been incorporated into the Project design specifically to address these
risks. A third risk is slow disbursement of the credit line which in other countries in the
region has been found to be associated with: (i) lack of capacity of the enterprises to properly
prepare sub-projects; (ii) lack of sub-project appraisal capacity in the banks; and (iii) lack of
interest on the part of the banks in moving Bank lines of credit under conditions which are
often seen as excessively complicated. The Project design addresses these risks through
technical assistance aimed at enterprises and banks and by features aimed to make the use of



- 45 -
Bank funds simple and attractive. These latter include the Swedish equity and the single
currency denomination and the proposed 10 year bullet maturity of the credit line component
of the Loan. Also, under the currency board arrangement, the Government is constrained
from providing excessive financial assistance to banks, while planned Bank projects in the
agricultural and housing sphere, where subsidized credit is most pronounced, will target a
phasing out of existing programs. Finally, the LIBOR basis of the SCL will add some interest
rate sensitivity to the debt service of sub-borrowers under the credit line. During supervision
by the BOL and the Bank, and in advising on project risk, the capacity of the sub-borrower to
bear the foreign exchange risk will be assessed. Participating banks will be advised to
exercise care in appraising sub-projects to ensure that sub-borrowers are capable of bearing
this risk. Given the likely unfamiliarity of many sub-borrowers with the historical volatility
of LIBOR, participating banks also should be sure to inform them of these risks.



- 46 -
VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1           During negotiations, agreement was reached on all Loan documentation
including the provisions of: (i) the fiscal agency agreement to be used between the
Government and the BOL; (ii) the subsidiary loan agreements to be used between BOL and
the participating commercial banks; (iii) the sub-loan agreements to be used between
participating commercial banks and borrowing enterprises; and (iv) the implementation
agreement covering the transfer of technical assistance funds from the Ministry of Finance to
Consulta. In addition, agreement was reached on the technical assistance concepts to be
applied by Consulta (paragraphs 4.20, 4.24 and 5.20 respectively), on SCL terms
(paragraph 5.2), on the use of an escrow account for the Government's I percent onlending
margin (paragraph 5.4) and on the disbursement, accounting, auditing and reporting rules
(paragraphs 5.23 and 5.26 respectively).
7.2          Conditions for the loan to become effective are:
-      a confirmation in the Legal Opinion issued on behalf of the Borrower that the
currency board is in full force and effect as of the date of Loan effectiveness;
and
-      the fiscal agency agreement and at least one subsidiary loan agreement with a
participating bank signed and entered into force.
7.3           A condition for the disbursement of the technical assistance component will be
that the implementation agreement between the Ministry of Finance and Consulta is signed.
7.4           The proposed Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank Loan to the
Republic of Lithuania in the amount of approximately US$25 million equivalent at the
standard rate for US$- and DM-denominated SCLs, for a period of 10 years, including a
grace period of 10 years for the credit line component and a period of 20 years, including a
grace period of 5 years for the technical assistant component.

LITHUANIA
ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROJECT
State of Development of the Capital Markets
The Insurance Industry
1.           As of September 1994, the insurance sector comprised 35 authorized
insurance companies of which only about ten are actively involved in insurance business. The
minimum capital requirement for insurance companies is 0.5 million Litas, equivalent to
US$125,000. Insurance companies are supervised by a 12 member Insurance Council, which
consists of representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture and Internal Affairs, the
State Insurance Company, private insurance companies and large insured clients. The Council
has the right to license and de-license insurance firms. De-licensing supposedly will take
place automatically in cases where companies have not started operations within one year of
receiving a license.
2.            The largest insurance firm is the State Insurunce Company, the former branch
of the all-Soviet Union Ingosstrah for domestic insurance activity. The State Insurance
Company employs a staff of 2,800, of which 1,070 are agents working on a comnmission
basis; no independent agents are used. The State Insurance Company has approximately
900,000 policy holders and capital of between 3-4 million Litas. The company insures state-
owned and private property (real estate, equipment, cars, etc.), and provides life insurance
(third party liability insurance as of yet does not exist in Lithuania). Legally, the State
Insurance Company is still a state-owned enterprise, reporting to the Ministry of Finance. Its
Chairman is appointed by the Prime Minister. The current Chairman was appointed after the
previous one had incurred large losses for the firm (reportedly related to the forced provision
of insurance for the property of state farms and cooperatives, much of which disappeared in
privatization). The new Chairman is pushing for the Company's privatization, in an attempt
to get away from Government influence.
3.           In 1991, the Government indexed the State Insurance Company's existing life
insurance policies to compensate policy holders for inflation. These policies combined a
savings element with risk coverage (new policies only provide risk coverage), and stipulated a
pay-out of 500 rouble, equivalent to six months average salary before independence, in case
of death or disability. The indexation was done by writing up half of the policies' pay-out
(250 rouble) through the issuance of privatization vouchers. Another indexation took place in
1992, during which the other half of the pay-out was written up by a factor 10. Premiums
were simultaneously increased by a factor 10. The Company itself took this indexation one
step further, by offering clients a write-up of 20 or more times with a simultaneous increase
in premiums. As no audited financial statements of the Company are available, it is not
possible at this point to determine whether the indexation has caused financial distress for the
institution, and if so, how much.

4.            Most of the active private insurers provide all types of insurance, including
life insurance and domestic credit insurance. The emergence of credit insurance may reflect
difficulties experienced by banks in obtaining adequate security for their loans. The volume
of the business of most insurers is still very low. Growth is hindered by the fact that
insurance premia cannot be counted as a business expense under the corporate income tax
law.
Securities Flmis
5.            Until September 1992 the Ministry of Finance was responsible for registering
and regulating companies involved in securities activities (mainly investment funds created in
the context of the voucher privatization program). This responsibility was taken over by the
Lithuanian Securities Commission, that was established by decree in September 1992 (this
decree also established the stock exchange, but the exchange opened only one year later).
The Commission, while still a Governmental entity funded from the budget, has an
independent staff and has been pro-active in creating the basic legal and regulatory framework
for securities activities.
6.            As of July 1994 there were 102 registered brokers. None of the registered or
licensed brokers were foreign. There were four banks among the licensed brokers. Capital
requirements for brokers are very limited since they are not obliged to act as principal for all
orders as market makers do.
The Stock Exchange
7.            The establishment of the Lithuanian Stock Exchange was authorized by a
decree issued in September 1992. An agreement formalizing French Government assistance
worth FFr 5 million for the creation of the Exchange was also signed that month with the
Paris Bourse. The Lithuanian Stock Exchange was subsequently licensed by the Securities
Commission in May 1993.
8.            The Exchange is a joint stock company with a Council and a Board, and
authorized capital of 1.23 million Litas. The Republic of Lithuania (through the Ministry of
Finance) owns 44.7 percent of the capital. The other 55.3 percent is owned by over 120
different shareholders, including banks, investment funds, local (both state and privately
owned), foreign companies and private individuals. Currently, a plan is being discussed to
sell approximately 20 percent of the capital owned by the State (10 percent of the Exchange's
authorized capital) to banks so that they can become more active participants in the brokerage
business. Any natural or legal person, Lithuanian or foreign, may become a shareholder and
member of the Exchange. Members get the right to trade on the Exchange if they are a
licensed brokerage firm, if they establish a brokerage firm, or if they execute a contract with
a brokerage firm. All members of the Exchange must also be members of the Central
Depository. The Depository, which started operations in August 1993, organizes, performs
and controls the dematerialization of shares and accounts for their movements.



- 49 -
ANNEX I
Page 3 of 6
9.            The first step for companies that want their shares to be traded on the
Exchange is to register with the Exchange. Additionally, any broker with at least one buy or
sell order can request that the security be listed, irrespective of the issuer. As of December
1994, 230 firms were listed. After registration, on the issuer's behalf, a securities account
must be opened at the Central Securities Depository and a cash account must be opened at the
designated clearing bank. Currently, for securities trades, Vilniaus Bank performs the role of
clearing bank. The Exchange maintains both a current list and an official list of securities
registered with the Exchange. Requirements for trade on the current list are nominal.
However, if an issuer wants to be entered on the official list, this requires a minimum of six
months trading on the current list, a certain minimum size, at least 25 percent of capital to be
traded at the exchange, certain minimum liquidity of the shares, and compliance with certain
disclosure requirements. As of December 1994, no entities were registered on the official
list. However, it is expected that the shares of several commercial banks and Treasury bills
may be added to the official list within a year. Both bearer and registered securities may be
traded on the Exchange.
10.           Trading in the central market takes place once a week, on Tuesday mornings
at 11.00 am, using a centralized order driven system based on fixed price quotation. Orders
can be presented until 10.00 am; then a computer matches buy and sell orders, and fixes the
price for each share based on demand and supply. All orders during a particular trading
session are executed at this price. Orders conditional on a different minimum or maximum
price are not executed. There are limits on the maximum price fluctuation allowed between
trading sessions. Initially, these limits were set at 10 percent upwards or downwards from the
fixed price in the previous session. Now the limit on price fluctuation is linked to the
volume: the limit ranges from a maximum of 60 percent if volume is very low to 20 percent
if the share turnover of a particular issuer exceeds 5 percent of its total emission (stock
outstanding). For officially listed companies, the Exchange may allow larger price
fluctuations due to major corporate events to which it did not respond by stopping trade. As
the market operates on a strictly cash basis, all orders are covered with relevant
cash/securities provision, without any netting. The settlement risk (market risk, the risk of a
broker going bankrupt, and obligations arising from exchange transactions) is covered by a
Market Guarantee Fund, to which all brokerage firms contribute cash deposits. In addition to
trades through the central market, block trades (with terms negotiated outside the Exchange)
are also permitted. In cases where there is a market determined price, the price of shares
traded through the block market cannot deviate by more than 20 percent from the price in the
central market. As of October 1994 securities of only 29 issuers have been traded in the
central market. Block trades have occurred in securities of 87 issuers.
11.           Trading volumes to date have been very low. Moreover, growth of trading
volume has not been as fast as initially expected. After a period of initial rapid progress in
enterprise privatization, during the summer of 1993 certain changes were introduced in the
joint stock company law and other laws that facilitated insider buy-outs of companies.
Consequently, there has been a tendency for state enterprises to transform into closed, rather
than publicly traded joint stock companies. Shares of these companies will not be traded at
the Exchange. With the adoption in July 1994 of a new joint stock company law and the



- 50 -
ANNEX I
Page 4 of 6
expected changes in the second phase of the privatization program (see paragraph 3.32 of the
main text), it is likely that the trading volume will gradually increase. The existing
infrastructure could easily handle such an increase.
12.           Both the Securities Commission and the Exchange are eligible to receive
advise on legal and regulatory issues concerning stock trading under an ongoing EU Phare
legal technical assistance program. In addition, the Securities Commission has requested EU
Phare to provide assistance in building up investment advisory services that would facilitate
widespread share ownership.
Investment Funds
13.           Investment funds (IFs) emerged in the context of Lithuania's voucher
privatization program. IFs were legally authorized under a Government decree, issued in
January 1992. This decree, and other temporary rules issued since by the Securities
Commnission, stipulates that IFs may not buy more than 50 percent of a company's capital in
privatization. In case of oversubscription, IFs jointly cannot buy more than 30 percent of the
capital of the company offered for sale. After privatization, there are no limits on ownership.
IFs were initially subject to a maximum capital restriction of 0.8 million Litas, in an attempt
to prevent them from becoming large holding companies. This restriction was later abolished
and replaced with the minimum capital requirement for joint stock companies of 2,500 Litas.
With the adoption of the new joint stock company law in July 1994 that minimum was raised
to 100,000 Litas (US$25,000). All IFs are closed end, and IF shares officially can only be
traded on the Exchange. In primary sales, their share price may not exceed 110 percent of the
nominal value of the shares in their portfolio.
14.           As of September 1994 there were 395 IFs of which 172 were registered with
the Securities Commission. The total authorized capital of registered IFs was 251 million
Litas, and assets were worth about 189 million Litas. Individual IFs vary widely in size: the
biggest fund, Invalda, has an authorized capital of 8.6 million Litas, while the smallest fund
registered on the current list of the Stock Exchange has authorized capital of 40,000 Litas.
More typical among the IFs registered at the Exchange, however, is capital of between 1 to 4
million Litas. Many other unregistered IFs are likely to be much smaller.
15.           Most IFs have invested in a relatively small number of companies. Among
the IFs registered on the Exchange, the portfolio size ranged typically between 5 and 20
companies. All in all, it is estimated that about 100 IFs have actively participated in the
privatization process as portfolio investors. Another 180 IFs are reportedly inactive, and exist
only on paper. The remaining 80 IFs are holding companies of privatized firms bought by
management and workers. Officially, investment funds are obliged, under a Securities
Commission decree, to buy and sell securities only on the Lithuanian Stock Exchange. In
reality, IFs have found a loophole to this requirement by exchanging blocks of shares among



- 51 -
ANNEX I
Page 5 of 6
themselves. If these trades do not involve money payments, the trades need not go through
the Exchange. At their own initiative, IFs have created the Lithuanian Association of
Investment Funds. This Association is chaired by the Chairman of Invalda. At least one
large IF (East Baltic States West) is reportedly also engaged in unlicensed banking activity.
One private bank, Hermis Bank, legally owns and operates four IFs.
Relevant IAgislation
16.           A Securities Law has been drafted by the Securities Commission and is being
reviewed by the Government and a new Investment Fund Law, also developed by the
Commission, has been submitted to Parliament. This new law that is to replace the existing
temporary rules (see paragraph 2.27 in the main text) and envisages the transformation, over
a period of a number of years, of existing IFs into either mutual funds or holding companies,
and introduces stricter regulation and supervision concepts. IFC has provided the Securities
Commission with a resource memorandum to assist it in identifying the gaps in the
Temporary Regulations, systemic problems (information disclosure), and in drafting a new
Securities Law. EU Phare has assisted in preparing a first draft of an investment fund law,
modelled on EU investment fund directives.
17.           The insurance sector is governed by the Law on Insurance. The law provides
for the "coordination of matters related to insurance" by an Insurance Council formed under
the auspices of the Ministry of Finance and consisting of three groups of representatives of:
(i) the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other bodies having an
interest in insurance-related activities; (ii) the State Insurance Agency; and (iii) other
insurance agencies and of various insured persons. The law provides, inter alia, for basic
uniform requirements for contracts, licensing of agencies by the Insurance Council, types of
coverage (property, personal, compulsory), types of insurance carriers (corporations,
insurance societies, mutual societies), terms and enforceability of insurance contracts, rights
of the State Insurance Agency, termination and suspension of agencies, etc.
18.           While it sets the basic parameters for the operation of insurance companies,
the law also suffers from a number of deficiencies:
the law includes few consumer protection measures;
the law does not provide adequate guidance on the anticipated regulatory
functions of the Insurance Council; in particular, it does not: (i) specify the
relationship between the Insurance Council and other financial sector
regulators (such as the BOL and the Securities Commission)--especially
problematic as the law allows insurance companies to make unlimited loans,
take deposits, and make unlimited equity investments; (ii) prescribe regular
collection and analysis of information by the Insurance Council and periodic
inspection of agency operations; (iii) specify valuation of assets and liabilities;
(iv) set accounting, auditing, and actuarial standards; and (v) specify
investment prohibitions or limits;



- 52 -
ANNEX I
Page 6 of 6
-      the law allows the State Insurance Company to maintain a monopoly position
in certain segments of the market such as compulsory insurance for the
property of state-owned enterprises, private housing (fire/storm/hail, but not
burglary or theft) and for travel on public transport; the State Insurance
Company also may count provisions for losses as expenses, while private
insurance companies are not allowed to do so, giving it an unfair competitive
advantage over other companies.
19.           To address these deficiencies, a new law is currently being drafted by a
working group consisting of representatives of the insurance industry, the Ministry of Finance
and local universities. The working group is also drafting accounting rules for the insurance
sctor. EU Phare legal technical assistance is available to assist the working group in its
efforts.

LITHUANIA
ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROJECT
The Apex Unit
Activities
1.            The Apex Unit will have primary responsibility for channeling the World Bank
Credit Line to eligible participating banks for on-lending to viable investment sub-projects in
qualified Lithuanian enterprises.
2.             Specific activities of the Apex will include:
(a)    Reviewing sub-loan applications, and ensuring their general overall quality as
well as their specific compliance with agreed qualification criteria, and with
World Bank guidelines for procurement and environmental impact.
For sub-loans below US$1,000,000 equivalent, loan application and
review documentation will be prepared and retained by the
participating bank. A simple summary will be provided to the Apex
as the basis for disbursement requests, but full documentation will be
available to the Apex on request so that it can fulfil its review
obligations'.
For sub-loans over US$1,000,000 equivalent (and for the first loan
applications of any size from each participating bank, until their
appraisal capacity is satisfactorily demonstrated), full documentation
will be passed to the World Bank for final review.
(b)    Opening a Special Account in a qualified foreign bank for the management of
World Bank funds, and disbursing funds from the Special Account to
suppliers, based on documentation from banks, for financing eligible sub-
projects. Maintaining Project accounting records and arranging for regular
audits of Project accounts and the Special Account.
(c)    Conducting post-lending reviews of sub-project lending applications of the
borrowing banks.
The "simple summary" envisaged in this context would be primarily a check-list that all World Bank
conditions related to the proposed sub-loan have been complied with. It would be up to the Apex to
assess how frequently it would need to check the underlying documentation to be able to confirm the
validity of the check list. "Full documentation" includes the business plan and/or feasibility study on
which the loan assessment has been made, financial projections for rate-of-return calculations and
debt:equity determination where required, procurement documentation, environmental clearances, etc.



- 54 -
ANNEX II
Page 2 of 4
(d)    Ensuring that all compliance requirements under the terms and conditions of
the proposed World Bank Loan are met, monitoring overall aspects of Project
implementation, and semi-annually reporting to the World Bank.
(e)    Provide, on a quarterly basis, detailed information on World Bank Loan
disbursement activities to the Swedish Capital Fund.
3.            The Apex will work closely with the Banking Supervision Department of the
BOL, in assessing the initial and continuing compliance of participating banks with the World
Bank's eligibility criteria. This may require the use of external auditors to prepare financial
statements in accordance with IAS which can be used as the basis for determining compliance
with some of the criteria2. This notwithstanding, final determination of banks' eligibility to
enter and continue to participate in the proposed Project will rest with the Banking
Supervision Department, subject to World Bank approval.
Legal and Organizational Structure
4.            The Apex will be a newly-created division in the BOL, under the direction of
the Director of the International Department. The Apex will be empowered to act for the
Government of Lithuania, in terms of disbursing and collecting World Bank funds, and
administering the relevant bank accounts. It will thus require authorization to hold and
conduct transactions in foreign exchange accounts.
5.            The Apex will have four professional Lithuanian staff:
(a)    A General Manager, responsible for the overall operation of the Apex. The
General Manager will have management education and experience, and prior
experience in credit administration and banking.
(b)    A Credit Manager, responsible for: (i) ruling on sub-loan eligibility and
obtaining appropriate confirmations and approvals as required; (ii) preparation
of standard sub-loan documentation, and monitoring performance under sub-
loan agreements; and (iii) analysis and consolidation of sub-loan portfolio
performance, and reporting on this as required. The Credit Manager will
have an accounting background and prior experience in credit administration
and banking.
2.     Annual audits in accordance with IAS are envisaged. Arrangements for these audits will be made by
the banks themselves. The role of the Apex will be limited to making sure that they have been
undertaken, and that the BOL has correctly used this information in assessing the banks' compliance
with the World Bank's eligibility criteria.

(c)  A Chief Accountant, who will be responsible for: (i) setting up a complete accounting
system for the Project; (ii) maintaining the Special Account, including requesting
replenishment and authorizing disbursements from the Account; (iii) collecting
repayments; (iv) ensuring repayments to the World Bank; and (v) reporting, as
required, on sub-project disbursements and repayments. The Chief Accountant will
have an accounting education and experience.
(d) A Project Officer who will be responsible for: (i) monitoring and advising on
procurement where necessary; (ii) helping participating banks to categorize projects
for environmental impact; and (iii) reviewing and reporting on physical progress of
sub-project implementation where appropriate. The Project Officer will have a
technical background and experience in project administration.
Training and Technical Assistance for the Apex
6.            The head of the Apex unit has already been selected, and has received
preliminary familiarization and training on World Bank procedures in Washington. The head
of the unit is currently in the process of selecting the remaining staff.
7.            The foreign advisor is to provide specialized advice and on-the-job training to
the Apex. It is envisaged that the foreign advisor would: (i) provide six months' continuous
advisory assistance in Vilnius beginning at Project effectiveness; (ii) arrange, as needed,
additional training of Apex staff in Washington; and (iii) be available for approximately one
week per month for one year thereafter for such additional advisory services as may be
required. The total cost of this service is estimated to be US$250,000 equivalent including
fees, travel and related expenses.

LITHUANIA
ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Terms of Reference for the Apex Advisor
Background
1.           The Government of Lithuania has prepared an Enterprise and Financial Sector
Assistance Project which will provide funding as well as comprehensive technical assistance
for the development of the Lithuanian enterprise and financial sectors. The project will be
implemented with support from the Swedish Government, the EU Phare program and USAID
as well as the World Bank and other donor agencies. The proposed World Bank Loan will
support two major components:
(a)    A credit line of about US$20.5 million equivalent, to be channeled through an
Apex unit in the BOL to participating private banks, for on-lending to private
and privatized enterprises (it is expected that Swedish equity from a Swedish
capital fund will be disbursed to the participating banks in parallel with the
credit line); and
(b)    Technical assistance of US$4.5 million equivalent, to be utilized by an EU
Phare funded Enterprise Restructuring and Consulting Agency (Consulta) to
provide low-cost consulting assistance to Lithuanian enterprises.
2.           In addition to the capital fund, Swedish financial support for technical
assistance is anticipated for funding the Apex advisor which is the subject of these Terms of
Reference. The EU Phare program will also finance technical assistance to banks, as well as
provide financing to Consulta. USAID assistance is ongoing in the BOL for strengthening
bank supervision, and is anticipated for strengthening bankruptcy mechanisms including
assisting with further revisions to the bankruptcy law and institutional development, and
training for bankruptcy administrators.
3.           Approval of the World Bank Loan is anticipated by mid March 1995.
Meanwhile, the Apex unit has been established in the BOL. The functions of the Apex are
described in the attachment to these Terms of Reference. Foreign advisory services are
required to assist in its establishment and initial operation. The nature and scope of these
services are the subject of these Terms of Reference.

Objectives
4.             The advisory services to be provided under this assignment consist of
providing an Apex Advisor to provide advisory services to help the BOL to: (i) build a

any case not later than June 30, 1996.
Scope of Work
5.             To meet the above objectives, the services to be provided by the Apex
Advisor would include assistance to: (i) establish the Apex Unit; (ii) develop sound operating
procedures for its continuing operation; (iii) initiate its operations. In particular, the Advisor
would:
(a)    Assist the BOL to establish the Apex Unit including:
Hiring of competent staff (a General Manager, a Credit manager, a
Chief Accountant and a Project Officer, whose duties and
qualifications are further described in the Attachment to these Terms
of Reference).
Setting up of suitable office space, including procurement and
installation of office equipment and selection and hiring of suitable
support staff.

- 59 -
ANNEX IIA
Page 3 of 5
(b)    Establish standard procedures for the Apex unit, including:
Developing procedures for the review of sub-projects, including
environmental review where required.
Developing standard formats and outlines for procurement
documentation for services and goods where this is required, including
letters of invitation, terns of reference, draft contracts, and goods

Disseminating such standards to participating banks by organizing
seminars and preparing and distributing guidelines for preparation of
the relevant documentation for procurement of goods and services.
(c)    Assist the Apex unit in its early operations to:
-      Review sub-loan applications, and ensure their overall quality as well
as their specific compliance with agreed qualification criteria, and with
World Bank guidelines for procurement and environmental impact.
-      Maintain Project accounting records, including the opening and
managing of a Special Account for the use of World Bank funds, and
arrange for regular audits of all of these accounts.
-      Conduct post-lending review of sub-project lending applications of the
participating banks.
-      Monitor continued compliance of participating banks with the agreed
eligibility criteria including ensuring that annual financial statements
are prepared according to International Accounting Standards (IAS),
and that eligibility criteria are evaluated on the basis of these
statements.
Ensure that all compliance requirements under the terms and
conditions of the proposed World Bank Loan are met, monitor overall
aspects of Project implementation, and prepare bi-annual progress
reports for the World Bank.

Organization of Work and Counterpart Arrangements
6.            The Advisor will report, and provide recommendations on the development of
the project coordination function, to the Director of the Foreign Relations Department of the
BOL. To facilitate the effectiveness of his work, and as further elaborated in the attachment
to these Terms of Reference, the Advisor is expected to: (i) coordinate and participate in the
training of local staff of the unit in Washington; (ii) provide six months' continuous advisory
assistance in Vilnius beginning immediately after World Bank and Swedish funding for the
proposed project are confirmed; and (iii) be available for approximately one week per month
for one year thereafter for such additional advisory services as may be required. While many
of the services described herein could be provided by a single Advisor, it is anticipated that
the Advisor would have back-up access to additional specialized assistance (for example for
the creation of the unit, and subsequently for technical, environmental, procurement and
accounting, functions) as may from time to time be required in order to fulfil all of the
responsibilities described above.
7.            From the start of his work, the Advisor is expected to work closely with the
various project implementation agencies', and provide assistance as requested. The Advisor is
expected to involve the counterpart staff in his day-to-day activities as a way of on-the-job
training.
8.            Office facilities for the Advisor will be provided by the Foreign Relations
Department of the BOL, including telephone and facsimile facilities. This Department will
also facilitate other arrangements for the Advisor's assignment including, where required, in-
country transport.
Time Schedule and Reporting Requirements
9.            The Advisor should start work as soon as World Bank and Swedish financing
for the project is reasonably assured, and be prepared to move to Vilnius shortly thereafter.
Bank-arranged PHRD (Japanese grant) financing has been arranged to cover the first two to
three months of these advisory services and Swedish financing (BITS) is being sought to
finance the balance. Assuming such financing can be arranged, the BITS-financed contract
between the BOL and the successful contractor would be for a period of eighteen months,
with the possibility of extension.
10.           As mentioned above, the Advisor will report to the Director of the Foreign
Relations Department of the BOL. Brief written progress reports by the Advisor are expected
monthly. Within three months of the start of his work, the Advisor is expected to present his
Which would include, inter alia, the Ministries of Finance and Environment, the BOL, the participating
banks, sub-borrowers, the Swedish Capital Fund, Consulta, the World Bank, USAID, EU Phare, etc.

ANNEX IIA

recommendations on the organization of the Apex unit as outlined above, including proposals
for standardized formats for procurement documentation and progress reporting. At the end
of his assignment, the Advisor is expected to present a full written report, summarizing the
main conclusions and recommendations of his work.
Qualifications of the Apex Advisor
11.          The Apex Advisor is expected to have extensive experience with the
implementation of assistance projects in conditions similar to those in Lithuania. The advisor
is expected to have worked effectively in a developing country environment for an extended
period. He is expected to be fully conversant with procedures of the World Bank and other
donor agencies concerning project implementation, including those related to the procurement
of goods, works and services, environmental assessment, progress reporting, and Loan
disbursement.
12.          The advisor should have demonstrated capabilities to communicate effectively
with counterpart personnel and agencies in a project implementation environment. The
advisor should be fluent in spoken and written English. Familiarity with the Lithuanian
language would be of great advantage.
