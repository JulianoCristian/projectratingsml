planning and evaluation system to modernize\n            public sector management and the privatization of public\n            assets whose continued holding by the public sector is no\n            longer in line with the government's priorities; and\n            (ii) increasing efficiency in resource allocation and use by\n            eliminating public or quasi-public monopolies in critical\n            economic sectors and their replacement by an incentive\n            structure promoting freedom of entry and a competitive\n            sector environment.  In addition, the loan will finance a\n            technical assistance program to prepare and implement the reforms."}, "docdt": "1990-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
