INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMEqDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
INDONESIA FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.           I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
US$4.6 million to the Republic of Indonesia for an education project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.           Following reconnaissance missions by the Association in
January and June 1969 and a UNESCO project preparation mission in
November 1969, the Government of Indonesia requested a credit to assist
in financing a technical education project. The proposed project was
appraised in February-March 1970.
3.           Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington
from September 14-18, 1970.  The Borrower was represented by: Dr. Soejoto,
Deputy Chairman, National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS); Mr. Kartomo,
Chairman, and Mr. Hadis Sumantri, Project Director-Designate, Office
of Educational Development, Ministry of Education; Mr. Atmono Surjo,
Minister-Counsellor (Economic), and Mr. Herqutanto Sosronegoro,
Educational and Cultural Attache, Embassy of Indonesia.
4.           If approved, this would be the Association's first credit
for education in Indonesia; together with the Third Irrigation
Rehabilitation Credit to be considered by the Executive Directors on
the same date, this would bring the total number of credits to
Indonesia to thirteen.
5.           The following is a summary statement of Development Credits
to Indonesia to date, with disbursements as of August 31, 1970:

/ Signed September 15, 1970
7.          After a very slow start, disbursement under the two credits
extended to Indonesia in 1968 is now proceeding satisfactorily. Disbursements
under the three credits extended in 1969 are as follows:  under Credit 154-
IND, $61,000 has now been disbursed on consultant services; bids for work-
shop equipment and for highway equipment and spares have been issued, and
it is expected that about $9.3 million of the Credit will be disbursed in
fiscal 1971. Under Credit 155-flu, $1 million has been disbursed, mostly
on procurement of fertilizer; consultants for management advisory services
have now assumed their duties and it is estimated that a further $3.3
million will be disbursed during this fiscal year. Credit 165-lDu was
declared effective only on June 1, 1970; management consultants are now in
the field and it is estimated that disbursements of about $2.8 million will
be made during fiscal 1971. The remaining six credits were all signed since
June 15, 1970. None of these is yet effective.   It is expected that necessa:ir
action will be completed by the Government in time to have these credits
declared effective before the end of December, 1970 and that disbursement
will commence soon thereafter.
8.          Later this fiscal year I expect to present to the Executive
Directors proposed credits for a second highways project, a tea estates
development project, and a rice seeds production project.

PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
Borrower:          Republic of Indonesia
Amount:            Various currencies equivalent to US$4.6 million
Purpose:           The construction and equipment of five technical
training centers, the training of teachers to staff
those centers, and related technical assistance.
Amortization:      In 50 years, including a 10-year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments of i per cent from
December 1, 1980 through June 1, 1990 and of 1½q
per cent from December 1, 1990 through June 1, 2020.
Service Charge:    3/4 per cent per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project - Indonesia"
(PE-19a) dated October 13, 1970.
10.        Responsibility for education in Indonesia is centered primarily in
the Ministry of Education.  The Ministries of Religion and of Agriculture
also direct education programs, and most of the other Ministries, including
the Ministry of Manpower, run training programs for the upgrading of specific
skills0 The Ministry of Education was recently re-organized to clarify
responsibilities and improve coordination within the Ministry. An Office
of Educational Development has been established in the Ministry of Educatior
to improve overall planning in the education sector.
ill        In the last few years, the Indonesian Government has concentrated
its development and reconstruction efforts largely on agriculture and infra-
structure. In keeping with this focus, and because of the lack of adequate
planning for education, external aid for education, with the exception of
technical assistance, has been minimal. However, because of the need to
improve skills if other development targets are to be met, extensive studies
have recently been started to assess the structure, organization and curricula
of Indonesia's educational system and their relevance to the country's
manpower needs. At present, it is already clear that improved training for
skilled workers and supervisors deserves immediate attention. There is now
a shortage of well-trained middle-level manpower with skills primarily in
mechanical, electrical and civil engineering; the demand for such people will



increase sharply with growing investment in infrastructure and manufacturing
industries.
12.        The Droposed project would consist of:  (a) the construction and
equipment of five technical training centers, each located in a major area
of industrial employment and serving from two to four senior technical
secondary schools, offering them workshops and laboratory facilities;
(b) the training of about 330 teachers to staff the centers; and (c)
technical assistance to help in the initial operation and supervision of the
centers.
13.        The total cost of the project is estimated at about $7.6 million,
including a foreigi exchange component of $4.6 million-- approximately 61
per cent of the total cost. The proposed credit would cover all the foreign
exchange expenditures of the project. Local manufacturers of furniture
would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 per cent or the import duty,
whichever is less; if all contracts were won by local manufacturers,
approximately $40,000 of the above expenditures would then be incurred not
in foreign exchange but in local currency, and the credit would be used to
finance those local costs. The Indonesian Government would bear the balance
of the local costs of the project. Contracts for civil works, furniture
and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. It is unlikely that foreign firms not already operating in Indonesia
would participate in the bidding for civil works contracts. Disbursements
are expected to begin approximately 9 months after the Development Credit
Agreement is signed; they will likely reach a peak approximately in 2½
years, and be completed in approximately 6½4 years.
14.        The project would be administered by a Project Implementation Unit
to be established within the Ministry of Education. The Unit would consist
of a Project Director (already designated by the Government), an architect,
a technical educator, a procurement officer, and an accountant.  The Govern-
ment has agreed that these posts would be filled in consultation with the
Association.
15.        A representative National Advisory Committee would be established
to advise the Government on overall policy for the project centers and feeder
technical schools. In addition, local advisory committees would also be
established for each center, to stimulate the employment of graduates and
ensure the relevance of the curricula to the needs of industry.
16.        In addition to the staff of the Unit referred to in para. 14
above, a team of five specialists acceptable to the Association would be
employed over a period of about four years, to provide about twelve man-
years' of technical assistance. These specialists, each an expert in a
different technical field, would be assigned one to each center; they would,
however, also visit the other centersperiodically so that all centers would



benefit from their specialized knowledge and experience. The specialist
residing in Djakarta would serve as the leader of this group, and would
also assist the Project Director in the programming and supervision of
the teacher-training courses.
17.          The five proposed centers would be operated on a double-shift
basis five days per week. The workshop instructors and laboratory teachers
who would staff the five centers would participate in a special one-year
training course before assuming their duties at the centers. The Government
has agreed that such staff would be paid supplements to their basic
salaries to give them an incentive to remain on the job and devote their
full-time attention to their duties at the centers.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
180          The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
referred to in Article V Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
19.          The draft Development Credit Agreement is in the usual
form for this type of project and contains specific covenants of the
Government on the various matters described in the preceding paragraphs.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.          The last economic report on Indonesia (EAP-lOa) was issued
on November 14, 1969, and was supplemented by a special report, "Current
Investment Activity in Indonesia" (EAP-l1a) distributed on March 27, 1970.
A Bank mission is now in the field assessing the current situation and
prospects in preparation for the next meeting of the Inter-Governmental
Group for Indonesia (IGGI) scheduled for December 15-16 in the Netherlands.
21.          Indonesia is still in the early stages of rehabilitation and
development which got under way only after the new economic policies
introduced in the post-Sukarno period had begun to take effect and relative
stability had been attained. In April 1970, basic exchange reforms were
introduced, unifying the exchange rate except for a special rate for
program aid. The economy remains sensitive to variations in the supply
of major commodities, particularly rice, but prices have been steady
in recent months. The foreign exchange markets have been kept broadly
in balance since the April exchange reforms. Export receipts in 1969
increased by 12 per cent over 1968 and are currently being maintained
at higher levels in spite of falling prices for rubber and tin. Exchange



reserves are minimal, however, and a continuing inflow of aid is
required.
22.        The external debt position of Indonesia was clarified and improved
in April when agreement was reached with the Paris Club of Western creditor
countries and Japan on the rescheduling over a 30-year period of their share
of the debts incurred during the Sukarno regime. The settlement, which
covers about 36 per cent of this debt amounting to some $2.1 billion, is
now being implemented by bilateral agreements. In August, the USSR agreed
to a further rescheduling of its Sukarno debt (42 per cent of the total) on
the same soft terms as the Paris Club, and also indicated its willingness
in principle to resume aid.
23.        The Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia has provided substantial
aid. Their pledges for 1970/71 approach the $600 million requested by the
Indonsian Government - $260 million for projects and $340 million in program
aid. The program aid includes $140 million with which to buy rice and wheat
to fill the gap between basic food requirements and domestic production and
commerical imports.
24.        Indonesia has been making major and succeosful efforts to increase
the domestic resources available to the public sector. An increase of more
than 45 per cent in revenues is projected for 1970/71. TMia would allow for
a surplus of Rp. 37 billion over current budgetary expenditures for transfer
to the development budget, up from Rp. 27 billion in 1969/70. With the
counterpart funds generated by program aid, a rupiah development budget of
Rp. 116 billion is feasible. This is still small in relation to the needs
of the economy but it will be augmented by project aid from IGGI, disbursements
of which are gathering momentum. It will be some time, however, before
these expenditures, domestic and external, result in the completion of
projects which will add significantly to national output. Institutional
reforms and administrative improvements will have to be brought about before
the public sector will be adequately equipped to make its own contribution
to recovery and development,and effectively support the growth of the economy
as a whole.
25.        The full investment requirements of Indonesia are only now becoming
apparent with the completion of sector and project studies started in the
early stages of rehabilitation. A comprehensive assessment of national
economic prospects would still be premature. The indications are,however,
that Indonesia should be able to approach the six per cent growth rate of
the second Development Decade if the present sound economic policies are
maintained and development administration strengthened, and if the necessary
amount of aid, on appropriately soft terms, can be obtained.



PART VI - COMPLIANCE lNITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
26.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMM$NDATION
27.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
