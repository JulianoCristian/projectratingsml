APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the construction, equipping,
and staffing of five technical training centers. The centers are clearly
identifiable as priorities for improvement in Indonesia's education system.
Further priorities, leading to possible Bank/IDA investment, should result
from the educational planning work now undertaken by the Ford Foundation and
UNESCO to reform Indonesia's education system.
ii.       Specifically, the project would comprise:
-    constructing and equipping five technical
training centers which would provide prac-
tical training for about one-fourth of the
students enrolled in senior technical secondary
schools in Indonesia;
-    training of 330 teachers from the technical
secondary schools to enable them to teach in
the centers in various fields of engineering
(civil, mechanical, electrical, building and
construction); and
-    12-1/4 man-years of technical assistance to
help Indonesian counterparts in the initial
operation and supervision of the centers.
iii.      The quality of the present senior technical school graduates in
Indonesia tends to be low partly because facilities and funds for the train-
ing of skilled craftsmen and lower-level technicians are either lacking or
very limited. Yet, industrialization and expansion of infrastructure
facilities and services, especially in Indonesia's major cities, require
technical school graduates trained not only in theory but also in practice.
Although adequate manpower studies and reliable statistics are not yet avail-
able, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the proposed centers
would meet an immediate need.
iv.       Each center would be located in a major area of industrial
employment and would serve from two to four technical secondary schools.
The centers would provide students from 15 technical secondary schools with
practical training in modern laboratories and workshops. An Advisory Com-
mittee would be established to promote coordination between the schools
and employers, and to ensure that the curricula used are relevant to
industrial needs.
v.        A Project Implementation Unit would be established for the
execution of the project. It would consist of a project director, an
architect, a technical education specialist and other supporting staff.



- ii -
vI.       Action has been taken to acquire the sites for four of the centers
and the fifth will be acquired soon. Civil works contracts and furniture
and equipment supply contracts would be awarded in accordance with the
Association's guidelines for international competitive bidding. If all
furniture contracts were won by local manufacturers, about US$40,000,
corresponding to 50% of the total estimated furniture cost, would represent
local currency financing.
vii.      The project is estimated to cost about US$7.6 million, with a
foreign exchange component of about US$4.6 million (about 61 percent of
the total cost). The project is suitable as a basis for an IDA credit of
US$4.6 million equivalent to the Government of Indonesia.



I. INTRODUCTION
The Request
1.01      A first IDA reconnaissance mission in January 1969 concluded
that, although basic manpower data for planning Indonesia's future education
and training development were still lacking, education projects limited in
scope and in areas of obvious priority could be undertaken. In June 1969,
an IDA reconnaissance mission identified such a project in technical and
agricultural education. A UNESCO mission assisted the government in November
1969 in preparing this project for presentation to the Association.
1.02      A mission comprising Messrs. van der Wal (agricultural educator),
Kadleigh (architect), Tsantis (economist), and Jones (consultant, technical
educator) appraised the project in February - March 1970. The agricultural
project items, comprising a new in-service training institution in Djakarta
for senior extension officers and instructional equipment for two agricul-
tural senior secondary schools, were deferred because of inadequate plan-
ning. With assistance from FAO, the Ministry of Agriculture intends to pre-
pare for the Association's consideration a new agricultural training project
to include a revised program for in-service training of extension workers and
an expansion of sub-professional agricultural training. This would be done
after an examination of the administration and structure of sub-professional
agricultural training, including manpower requirements, has been completed.
The oresent project comprises, therefore, only the technical education items.
Demographic and Economic Background
1.03      The Republic of Indonesia extends over a large archipelago
of 13,000 islands. More than 65 percent of the 118 million inhabitants live
on the islands of Java and Madura which account for less than 7 percent of
the total area of the country; this makes them among the most densely popu-
lated areas in the world. The other 6,000 inhabited islands vary from slight
to heavy in density of population. More than 80 percent of the population
lives in rural areas. The age structure is similar to that of other South-
east Asian countries with about 43 percent below 14 years of age and only
about 3 percent over 65. A UN/WHO/IBRD family planning missioii has proposed
an extensive five year Family Planning Plan (1971-75) for the islands of Java
and Bali.
1.04      Bahasa Indonesia is the national language and the medium of
.'istruction after the third grade.  Approximately 80 percent otf the children
receive two years of primary education but less than half ot Jiem finish grade
six. While reliable data are lacking, the general literacy rate is eeti-
mated at about 40 percent.
1.05      The economically active population is est1iated to be about
42 million, of whom about 70 percent are engaged in agriculture and
less than 6 percent in mining ar.d manufacturing. The majority of the
workers are self-employed or uapaid family workers; substantial under-
employment exists in both urban and rural areas. Increasing urbanization
has expanded the volume of small-scale trading in the towns.



-2-
The Education System
1.06      Responsibility for education is centered essentially within
the Ministry of Education and Culture (Appendix). The Ministry has recently
been reorganized. A number of Directorates General have been eliminated in
order to reduce overlapping of responsibilities and improve coordina-
tion.  An Office of Educational Development has also been established
to improve overall planning (Chart 1).
1.07      With a view to a fundamental reform of the educational system,
the Office of Educational Development is at present conducting a National
Assessment Study, supported by the Ford Foundation, and a systems analysis
study, initiated with the assistance of UNESCO/UNDP. The National Assess-
ment Study includes collection of basic educational statistics, now often
unavailable, and a review of the education system's organization, curricula,
finances and relevance to manpower requirements. While this study will not
be completed before 1973, interim reports will be available periodically.
The systems analysis study will provide, by some time next year, broad
guidelines on options for policy decisions on the reorientation of the
educational system and its main sectors.
1.08      In addition to the Education Ministry, the Ministries of
Religion and Agriculture also direct education programs. Most of
the Ministries, including the Ministry of Manpower, run training pro-
grams for the upgrading of specific skills. Private schools play a
very significant role in education. While reliable data are lacking,
it is estimated that approximately 20 percent of the primary school
children, 35 percent of the junior secondary students, and at least
40 percent of the senior secondary students are enrolled in private
schools.
1.09      Secondary education is offered after six years of primary
education. Junior and senior secondary school courses are both of three
years' duration and are divided into four main types: general, vocational,
technical and agricultural (Chart 2). The school curricula are not
related to current manpower needs of the country. Teacher salaries are
low - below the subsistence level-with the result that teachers must have
a second job. Even though schools meet six days a week, double shifting
is required because of the great number of children and few available
teachers. Most schools are without sufficient equipment or books. For
these and allied reasons, the quality of education is very poor. Dropout
rates are high: a 1968 UNESCO report estimates them at 67 percent in primary
schools, 25 percent in junior secondary schools and 40 percent in senior
secondary schools.
1.10      About 15 percent of the junior secondary and about one-third of
the senior secondary students are in vocational, technical, or agricultural
training. Because the vocational and technical secondary schools lack
adequate facilities and equipment, teaching is devoted almost exclusively
to theory. For example, instead of learning how a machine works by using
actual machinery, students have to learn by drawing diagrams on the black-
board.

1.11      Higher education includes 40 public universities, institutes,
and teacher-training colleges. In addition, 200 other institutes and
academies are controlled by other ministries and private organizations. As
part of the adult education program, the Ministry of Manpower operates eight
centers for the upgrading of craftsmen's skills. Two of the eight, the
ones in Djakarta and Bandung, are assisted by the I.L.0.
Education Finance
1.12      Total central government recurrent and capital expenditure
on education in the 1969/70 fiscal year was Rp. 43.5 billion, or 13
percent of the total central government expenditure. This ratio is within
the range of average commitment to education by countries of comparable in-
come level. About 85 percent of the expenditure was channeled through the
Ministries of Education, Home Affairs, and Religion and the remainder through
other Ministries. Parent-teacher associations supplement the school budgets
in their area through student subscriptions.
1.13      The government's recurrent expenditure on education, excluding
the administrative expenditures of the several Ministries, was about
Rp. 34 billion in 1969/70 (Annex 1) or 15.5 percent of the total recurrent
expenditure. This includes Rp. 20 billion in transfers to regional autho-
rities through the Ministry of Home Affairs which is responsible for the
salaries of the 320,000 primary school teachers. Expenditure by the
Minis2ry of Education was about Rp. 7 billion (Annex 2).  Since 85 percent
of the total budget is spent on teacher salaries, there is a shortage of
funds for teaching materials and for maintenance of equipment and buildings.
Based on projections of growth of recurrent government expenditure, it
would be reasonable to assume that recurrent expenditure on education will
increase to about Rp. 59 billion (in 1969/70 constant prices) by 1973/74,
or about 20 percent of the central government's total recurrent expendi-
ture. This level would allow a larger share of education expenditure to
be spent on qualitative improvements, especially on didactic materials.
1.14      The total capital budget for education and culture under the cur-
rent five-year plan is Rp. 95 billion, or 15.3 percent of the total capital
budget. The emphasis to be given to the development of technical and voca-
tional education and training is reflected in the Rp. 47.5 billion to be
allocated to technical and vocational education, equivalent to 50 percent of
the total amount allocated for educational development (Annex 3).
1.15      In the recent past, the Ministry of Education has had difficulties
in implementing its development projects, partly due to the wide dispersal
of numerous small projects and to the inadequacies of existing management
and control mechanisms. In 1969/70, budget provisions of Rp. 5.6 billion
were made for 694 approved projects of the Ministry. Disbursements in the
year amounted to 80% of the total appropriations. The new Office of Educa-
tional Development (para. 1.06) is expected to improve the implementation of
development projects in the 1970/71 fiscal year.



-4-
1.16      Foreign aid to education, coordinated by the Office of
Educational Development, has provided expatriate specialists and
fellowships for overseas training, particularly in agricultural educa-
tion. An exception is a Canadian aid project for the construction and
equipment of a textbook plant valued at $150,000.

II. MANPOWER AND EDUCATION NEEDS
Manpower Needs
2.01      Information on the occupational and educational distribution
of the labor force and the labor market is very limited. The Develop-
ment Planning Board (Bappenas), with Dutch and Ford Foundation technical
assistance, is working to identify critical manpower requirements in
selected areas and projects under the five-year development plan.
2.02      The recent years have been a period of rehabilitation of the
economy. A government freeze on hiring since 1967, a very small expansion
of wage and salaried jobs and more efficient utilization of labor by the
larger industrial firms have had a restrictive effect on general labor
demand. There has been, however, a chronic shortage of well trained middle
level manpower, primarily with skills in the fields of mechanical, electrical
and civil engineering. But in the absence of a manpower survey, these
shortages cannot be quantified. In addition, a strong demand for middle
level manpower is being increasingly generated as a result of the public
sector development programs and the foreign private capital investments.
The implementation of projects approved in 1967-69, financed from foreign
sources, in the fields of manufacturing and processing, will alone create
about 7,500 new jobs for technicians and craftsmen. New job openings will
be aQjed ?t this level as investment activity in the economy gathers momen-
tum and. the execution of recently approved projects proceeds.
Education and Training Requirements
2.03      While data on the education and training needs in Indonesia
are now meager, (para. 1.07), two areas of obvious priority which require
improvement are technical and agricultural education. Improvement in the
provision of secondary technical education in order to meet the urgent
manpower needs for craftsmen and lower supervisory personnel are, therefore,
not likely to conflict with the priorities to be set by the National Assess-
ment Study (para. 1.07).
2.04      Because of inadequate funds for purchase, maintenance ard replace-
ment, the senior technical secondary schools operate, at present, with woe-
fully inadequate laboratory and workshop equipment, thus placing too
heavy emphasis on theoretical studies. As a result, the graduates are
frequently unwilling to enter industrial workshops or are unable to adapt
to employers' requirements. Because of the absence of practical training,
and because the present technical school instructors, in many instances,
also have not had this practical training, the schools have been unable to
prepare students properly for industrial employment at skilled-craftsman and
lower-supervisory levels. The senior technical secondary school system
clearly requires assistance to up-grade the quality of instruction in
practical subjects.



-6-
2.05      Most of the existing technical schools are located in the larger
industrial urban areas and in groups near each other. If, therefore,
practical training centers were established serving several senior technical
secondary schools, the need for practical training for the students could be
met at minimum cost. These centers would offer modern practical instruction
in the three main fields of engineering: mechanical, electrical, and civil.
Five such centers could supply about 4,000 much-needed workers annually at
the craftsman and supervisory levels. A demonstration of successful operation
of the centers could lead to their numerical expansion to encompass other
areas where similar arrangements for technical training can be promoted.



III. THE PROJECT
General
3.01      The proposed project, which is designed to improve practical
training in selected senior technical secondary schools, would consist
of:
-    construction of and equipment for five new
technical training centers;
-    training of 330 senior technical secondary
school staff; and
-    12-1/4 man-years of technical assistance to
help the Indonesian counterparts in the initial
operation and supervision of the centers.
The estimated cost is US$7.6 million equivalent.
Technical Training Centers
3.02      The five technical training centers would be located in major
areas of industrial employment, each serving from two to four senior
technical secondary schools and providing much needed practical training
in modern laboratories and workshops. A total of 15 senior technical schools
would be served by the five centers. Some 13,800 students of the 58,600
enrolled in senior technical secondary schools in the country would be
accommodated in these centers. The distance from the feeder schools to their
center would vary from two to eight km; hence students would be able to reach
them by bicycle, the common form of transportation in Indonesia from home to
school.
3.03      In order to make full use of the equipment, the centers would
operate on a double-shift basis, five days per week, 16 periods a day,
or 80 periods a week, compared with the normal week of 45 periods. On
the sixth day, when students have a half day of school, the centers would
be closed for maintenance and repair of the equipment. Students would
spend two 8-period shifts a week in a center.
3.04      The present curriculum would have to be changed in the feeder
senior technical secondary schools to make adequate provision for labora-
tory and workshop practice. The revised curriculum would provide 29
periods per week on theoretical subjects and 16 in practical work, instead
of the present 45 periods per week of theoretical class work. The courses
would be designed to facilitate the students' entry into the labor market,
although a small proportion of the graduates may pursue further studies.
Final examinations different from those now in use would be required so that
sufficient recognition could be given to the practical subjects and the
students' ability to respond to practical tasks properly. The government



- 8 -
has provided assurances that such a special terminal examination would be
administered.
3.05      Candidates for admission to senior technical secondary schools
are required to complete satisfactorily a junior secondary school (general
or technical) and to take a competitive entrance examination. The numbers
applying for admission are usually double the number of the available
places. The Ministry of Education does not maintain drop-out statistics,
but it is estimated that the drop-out rate between the first and second
year is high, perhaps 30 percent. If this drop-out rate were to prevail
at the project schools it would represent a significant loss in the
effective use of the expensive equipment to be installed. Assurances
have therefore been obtained from the government that, in addition to
the existing entrance examination, a specially devised aptitude test would
be employed. This will help to ensure that only students with appropriate
interest and ability in technical courses would be admitted to the selected
senior technical secondary schools.
3.06      At present, the senior technical secondary schools are generally
unaware of and unconcerned with the nature of employment followed by their
graduates. Although reliable statistics are not available, the general
impression is that the employment record of the senior technical secondary
school leavers is not good, due principally to industry's refusal to accept
the poorly trained products of the present technical secondary school system.
To ensure the continued relevance of the revised curricula to industry's
needs and to assist in improving industry's association with the senior
technical schools, the government has agreed to establish local advisory
Committees comprising representatives of local industries, feeder school
administrators, and officers of the project centers. These committees
will advise the director of the training center in their area. Similarly,
the government has agreed to establish a National Advisory Committee composed
of representatives from the Ministries of Education and Manpower the Planning
Agency (Bappenas), industry, and senior technical secondary school adminis-
trators. The national committee will advise the Director of Technical and
Vocational Education in the Ministry of Education on the overall policy
of the centers and their feeder schools. The Director of Technical and
Vocational Education will have the administrative jurisdiction of the
centers when they become operational. Assurances have also been obtained
from the government that the senior technical schools to be served by the
proposed centers will collect employment data about their graduates for at
least three years after their graduation.
Staff Development
3.07      As stated before, most Indonesian teachers require part-time jobs
to supplement their inadequate salaries. For proper functioning of the
project centers, their teachers should receive salaries which, with other
remunerations, would allow them to devote their attention exclusively to
the centers. The government is aware of the need and has given assurances
that such salary supplements would be provided for the teaching staffs of
the centers either from the national budgetary resources or through other
suitable arrangements. On the basis of current salary differentials the



- 9 -
required increases in teacher salaries would amount to less than 0.4 per-
cent of the 1969/70 Ministry of Education's recurrent budget and 0.2 per-
cent of the total recurrent budget of the central government on education.
3.08      As there are at present no teachers with adequate training to
staff the proposed centers, a special one-year training course will be
initiated for selected senior technical secondary school teachers.  The
five centers will require 305 staff members (65 laboratory teachers,
240 workshop instructors). Ideally, all should have had industrial expe-
rience, but this is difficult to attain. The Ministry of Manpower, which
operates vocational training centers in Bandung and Djakarta, can provide
courses comprising workshop, laboratory, and pedagogical training. The
precise nature of the courses will be determined by the Ministries of
Education and Manpower with advice from the leader of the technical
assistance team that is to be recruited. The cost of this training,
which would be in local currency, would be borne by the government as
a part of its contribution to the total project cost. The training pro-
gram may also benefit from UNDP/ILO assistance.
3.09      During the credit negotiations, the government has provided
assurances that the special one-year training courses for selected work-
shop instructors and laboratory teachers will be established as described
above and that the content of the courses will be approved by the Asso-
ciation. The courses would begin in 1973 and terminate in 1975 (Annex 4).
Technical Assistance
3.10      To provide much-needed advice and guidance, a team of five
ecialists, who would preferably belong to one institution only, will
be included in the project, one for each project center. The selecting
of each specialist and the terms of his employment will be subject to
approval by the Association. The team leader, who would reside in Dja-
karta, will take up duties three months before the beginning of the
training course for the teaching staff (paras. 3.08-3.09) and remain
in Indonesia for about four years. He will coordinate the work of the
team as a whole. He will also assist the Project Director, as required,
in programming and supervising the teacher-training courses. The other
four specialists will report three months before opening of the centers
assigned to them and remain at these centers for two years.  They will
help prepare timetables, advise on curriculum, and generally provide
advice and assistance to the counterparts assigned to them during the
first two years of each center's operation. Although each member of
the five-man team would specialize in a different technical field, and
would reside at a different center, each will periodically visit the other
centers. In this manner, all centers will receive guidance in all five
technical areas from the specialists. The government has provided assu-
rances that the specialists would be recruited and placed as described above
and in accordance with the timetable shown in Annex 5.

3.12      Construction cost estimates are based on:  (a) unit area costs
of US$52 to US$74 per m2 for buildings, depending on their geographical
location, and (b) site development costs at about 20 percent of the cost
of the buildings. Costs were established by the government, with UNESCO
assistance, from available data on recently completed education buildings
in Indonesia. The percentage for site development costs is high, but is
acceptable considering that a large proportion of the available land con-
sists of rice fields which present special drainage problems.
3.13      Furniture and equipment costs for each institution are reasonable.
Detailed schedules will be prepared by the project implementation unit
during the design stages of project implementation and approved by IDA
before procurement.
3.14      The contingency allowances (Annex 7) provide (a) for increases in
the cost of the project's physical facilities due to factors which may emerge
during the design and construction stages of the project; these have been
assessed as likely to represent about 10% of the basic cost of construction,
furniture and equipment; and (b) for price increases. The latter have been
difficult to assess in the absence of an official building price index and
related data. Indications are that the recent rise in construction activity,
coupled with an increasing scarcity of skilled labor in the industry would



- 12 -
accentuate the present wage-price increases in the sector, which seem to
be above the average of the other sectors of the economy. Accordingly a
relatively high rate of 8% has been used for local cost increases and a
lower rate of 3% for foreign imports per annum. Altogether allowances would
represent 21% of the total cost of the project (7% for physical increases
and 14% for price adjustments), which is justifiable in the case of the
present project.
3.15      On the basis of 3,420 student places in the five centers the
estimated unit cost per student place is shown below, not including pro-
fessional fees and contingencies:
Unit Cost per Student Place
Average number of
student places per center: 684
Type of Expenditure       Unit Cost       Percent of Total
Site Development             $111              8%
Buildings                     512             36%
Furniture                       23             2%
Equipment                     772             54%
Total      $1,418            100%
These unit costs are economical. Since this would be the first time for
the Bank/IDA to finance this type of technical training center, no compa-
rison can be made with similar institutions elsewhere.
3.16      The project's foreign exchange component has been determined
as follows: (i) construction, 40 percent; (ii) furniture, 50 percent;
(iii) equipment, 90 percent; (iv) professional services, 40 percent; and
(v) technical assistance, 75 percent. The total, US$4.6 million equival-
ent (61 percent of the project cost), is high due to the relatively large
amounts of imported equipment required for the project.
3.17      An IDA Credit of US$4.6 million is recommended to cover about 61
percent of the total estimated cost of the project, or about 100 percent of
the total estimated foreign exchange component. The government would pro-
vide the remainder of the capital costs and the recurrent costs of the
proposed project. During negotiations, it has been agreed with the govern-
ment that adequate funds will be available not later than the fifteenth day
of each quarter for the implementation of the construction of the project
and for the operation and proper maintenance of the training centers.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
Administration
4.01      The government will establish within the Ministry of Education
a Project Implementation Unit under the Office of Educational Development.
The Project Unit will be responsible for (a) the proper execution of the
project, (b) coordination with the Ministry of Manpower, and (c) liaison
with the Association. The Unit will also prepare the lists and bid pack-
ages of furniture and equipment and will be responsible for their procure-
ment. Principal officers of the Unit will comprise a project director, an
architect, a technical educator, a procurement officer, and an accountant,
all selected in consultation with the Association. They will be provided
with adequate supporting staff and accommodations. The project director,
has already been selected. The appointment, on a full-time basis, of the
project director, project architect and technical educator and the estab-
lishment of the Project Unit will be a condition of effectiveness for the
credit. The government has provided assurances that the procurement offi-
cer and accountant will be appointed according to a timetable agreeable to
the Association, which will initially provide for the procurement officer
and accountant to be available to the Unit on a part-time basis six months
after credit signing and on a full-time basis twelve months thereafter.
SalariPs of the Unit personnel and operating expenditures will be borne by
the governw2zAt.
Professional Services
4.02      A firm of architects and consulting engineers, acceptable to the
Association and experienced in tropical school building, will be appointed
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association. It would report to
the project director and would be responsible for the design and supervision
of construction under the project. It will be available to start operations
in the field within six months after the signing of the proposed Credit
Agreement.
Land
4.03      All sites for the project centers have been selected and are
satisfactory. Action has been taken to acquire four of the sites and the
fifth will be acquired soon. The government has provided assurances during
negotiations that not later than six months after the signing of the Credit
Agreement all sites would be available for the Consultants (para. 4.02) to
survey and that construction would be legally permissible 12 months there-
after.
Procurement
4.04      The awarding of civil works, furniture and equipment contracts
would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance



- 14 -
with the Association's Guidelines. Local manufacturers of furniture would
be allowed a preferential margin of up to 15% of the c.i.f. landed costs,
exclusive of import duties and other taxes. If all furniture bids are won
by local manufacturers, then about 50 percent of the furniture component
would represent local currency financing (i.e. about US$40,000 or less than
one percent of the proposed credit). Civil works contracts would be large
enough to attract international competition, but it is unlikely that for-
eign firms not already operating in Indonesia would participate in the
bidding. Procurement would be based on contract documents and bid-packages
for which concurrence of the Association would be obtained. The suppliers
of equipment would translate instructions for operation and maintenance into
Bahasa Indonesia.
Disbursements
4.05      The Association would disburse or reimburse:
(i) the foreign exchange costs of instructional equipment,
technical assistance specialists and professional
services;
(ii) 40% of civil works contracts representing the estimated
foreign exchange component;
(iii) the actual foreign exchange cost of imported furniture
and/or the ex-works cost of locally manufactured
furniture.
Completion of the project would require six years (Annex 8). The percentage
disbursed against civil works would be adjusted to distribute disbursements
over the project period and to disburse US$4.6 million equivalent or about
61% of the project costs whichever is lower. Undisbursed funds would be
available for cancellation.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During credit negotiations, agreement has been reached with the
government regarding:
(a)  provision of special entrance and terminal examinations
(paras. 3.04 and 3.05); employment data collection about
the graduates (para. 3.06); and creation of advisory com-
mittees (para. 3.06);
(b)  measures to retain the technical teachers at the centers on a
full-time basis (para. 3.07); provision of teacher training
courses (paras. 3.08-3.09 and Annex 4); and recruitment of
five technical education specialists to assist in the initial
operation of the centers and the training of counterparts
(para. 3.10);
(c)  the establishment of a Project Unit within the Office of
Educational Development to be responsible for the over-all
supervision of the project (para. 4.01).
5.02      A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit will be the
establishment of the Project Unit and the appointments, on a full time
basis, of a project director, project architect and technical educator, all
selected in consultation with the Association (para. 4.01).
5.03      The proposed project is suitable as a basis for an IDA credit of
US$4.6 million to the Government of Indonesia representing about 61 percent
of the total estimated project cost.






APPENDIX
THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
Administration
Responsibility for primary, secondary and higher education
lies generally with the Ministry of Education; a relatively large
number of "mosque" schools are separately administered by the Ministry
of Religion; the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for agricultural
education in secondary and post-secondary schools. The Ministry of Man-
power is responsible for out-of-school, skilled-worker training and a
number of other Ministries are responsible for their own pre-service and
in-service training.
Educational Structure
Primary education extending over a period of six years is
followed by six years of secondary education divided equally between
junior and senior levels. At each of the secondary levels separate
provision is made for general, technical, commercial and domestic
(home economics) education and training. Students completing a general
education course have access to all courses at the next higher level
but students in technical, commercial, or home economics training are
restricted to courses of the same nature. The general secondary schools
attract the more able students.
Education at the tertiary level is provided by some 40 univer-
sities and institutes administered by the Ministry of Education together
with some 200 other institutes and "academies" controlled by other minis-
tries and private organizations.
Technical Education
Technical education is provided at three levels corresponding
to industrial employment as craftsmen, technicians or technologists.
Training at the semi-skilled craftsman level may be given students in a
junior technical secondary school (Ministry of Education) or, for adults,
in a vocational training center (Ministry of Manpower).
The junior technical secondary schools offer 12 to 14 year-old
students a three-year course with a relatively heavy content of general
education. Graduates are eligible to enter the senior technical secondary
schools, but in competition with the graduates from junior general secon-
dary schools few (10-15 percent) are able to gain admission and the majority
must seek employment.



APPENDIX
Page 2
In principle, the vocational training centers should offer
adults both up-grading and apprenticeship courses, but owing to lack
of funds they are limited to offer specific up-grading courses financially
sponsored by industry. The centers are under-utilized.
At the technician level, the senior technical secondary schools
offer three-year courses in a large number of specialties (recently reduced
from 50 to 30) with the object of producing skilled craftsmen who may later
be promoted to lower-level technician or supervisory staff. The curriculum
makes provision for workshop experience but because of the lack of neces-
sary facilities neither laboratory nor workshop training of any real value
is given. Again, in competition with the general secondary school graduates,
few (10-15%) are able to embark upon higher studies and the majority must
seek immediate employment. In the absence of any form of guidance service
or of follow-up records, their success in doing so is not known.
Higher Education
The higher education system has two degree levels corresponding
to courses of three years and five years duration (for most students a
preliminary year of study is also required). In engineering faculties
the lower award (diploma or first degree) corresponds to the status of
engineering assistant or higher technician, a status similarly achieved
in the "academies" organized by certain government departments. The
higher award (second degree) corresponds to the status of a fully-quali-
fied engineer or technologist, or a baccalaureate degree for those in
general education.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND INSTRUCTORS
The training of existing teachers and instructors must be phased
to minimize the impact of withdrawal from the schools and to ensure the
absence of a gap between completion of training and employment in the
project centers. The program given below is based on the assumption
that the first center will come into operation in January 1974 and that
the one-year training courses will commence in January of each year.

The following program is based on the assumption that all the
new centers will be in operation by January 1975:
Year Commencing

)      12.25
Assistants             .0     .25   1.75   3.75   2.25 )
The mission leader will be available to assist the project
director as required and to take part in joint consultations with the
Ministry of Manpower with respect to the teacher andl instructor (for
laboratories and workshops) training program. He will be joined by an
assistant one year after his own arrival.
The remaining three members of the technical assistance
mission will report for duty three months before the opening of the
centers assigned to them. They will advise on time-tables, curricula,
syllabus content, and all other relevant matters. Their services will
continue for two years.
It is expected that in selecting the members of the mission,
consideration will be given to full coverage of the subjects taught
within the centers and that the services of each specialist will be
available to the others.
