aspects were highly satisfactory. The project performance\n            has generally been highly successful, with most of the\n            targets set at appraisal attained or surpassed. Key lessons\n            learned are: a) future projects could consider a simpler\n            approach based on water resource development; b) careful\n            monitoring of water resources and efficiency water use for\n            irrigation are essential to ensure sustainability; c) the\n            household production responsibility system is of key\n            importance for successful rural development; d) investments\n            in agricultural research and extension must be adequate, and\n            channeled into human resource development and linkages\n            rather than buildings and equipment; e) agroindustries must\n            involve the private sector and ensure adoption of\n            international standards of technology and management\n            training; and f) it is desirable to have a range of focused\n            aquaculture activities, conservative stocking rates,\n            attention to environmental concerns, and sound marketing."}, "docdt": "1999-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
