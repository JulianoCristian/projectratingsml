Development Project for Sri Lanka was successful. The main\n            objective, to improve the productivity, income, and living\n            standards of people in the Puttalam and Matale districts,\n            was achieved. Implementation of the project was deemed\n            satisfactory even though there were delays. The project is\n            sustainable for the future. Both the Borrower and the Bank\n            acted effectively. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            experience. First, the project confirms that the approach\n            taken to achieve a broad-based development of Sri\n            Lanka's districts, initiated under the Kurunegala Rural\n            Development Project, is appropriate and replicable under the\n            country's conditions. Second, project design should\n            have focused more clearly on organization and management\n            aspects to ensure effective coordination among the multiple\n            line agencies. Third, the project would have been easier to\n            supervise if it did not include such a wide and diverse\n            range of subprojects. Lastly, the project period should have\n            been longer than envisaged due to implementation delays that\n            arose when a large number of agencies were involved and\n            funds were in short supply."}, "docdt": "1991-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
