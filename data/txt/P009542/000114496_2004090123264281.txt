Re:
BANGIADESH: Credit 2129-BD
Third Rural Electrification Project
Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
Dear Sir:
We refer to the development Credit Agreement dated June 18, 1990 between the 
People's Republic of Bangladesh (the Borrower) and the International Development 
Association (the Association); and the Project Agreement of the same date between the 
Rural Electrification Board (REB) and the Association for the Second Rural 
Electrification Project. We also refer you to letter dated February 17, 1993 from the 
Deputy Secretary, Economic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance, Government of 
Bangladesh requesting an amendment to the Development Credit Agreement in order to 
reflect the shifting of Tarash Thana area covered by the Project from Pabna PBS-I to 
Serajgonj PBS.
We are pleased to inform you that the Association has agreed to amend Article I, 
Section 1.02 (e) by deleting Pabna PBS-1 and subsituting it with Serajgonj PBS.
This amendment will be effective as of the date of this letter.
Sincerely yours,
Ann 0. Hamilton
