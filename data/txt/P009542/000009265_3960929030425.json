The\n            project's main objectives are to substitute power at\n            least cost for imported petroleum products and to strengthen\n            REB and PBSs' performance by : a) expanding\n            distribution networks to unserved areas; b) rehabilitating\n            exisitng systems; c) reducing system losses; and d)\n            improving PBSs' financial viability and institutional\n            performance through modification of accounting practices\n            etc.  By completion, the project will extend public\n            electricity supply to about 122,000 domestic, 20,000\n            commercial, and 2,900 industrial consumers, as well as to\n            5,600 irrigation pumps. The project's eight components\n            are the following : 1) construction of 6,035 km primary\n            lines ( 3 phase and single phase ), and 3,015 km of\n            secondary lines; 2) construction of 18 substations; 3)\n            service materials ( service connections, meters, LT\n            capacitors ) for consumer connections; 4) support\n            commodities ( vehicles, motorcycles, tools, boats etc ); 5)\n            rehabilitation of 850 km of existing low voltage lines and\n            distribution substations; 6) general plant for PBSs ( local\n            transport, office and residential buildings etc ); 7)\n            infrastructure and support facilities for REB ( headquarter\n            offices, training center etc ); and finally 8) consulting\n            services to assist REB and the PBSs in project execution and management."}, "docdt": "1990-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
