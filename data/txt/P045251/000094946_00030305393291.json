Overall Borrower performance is rated as\n            highly satisfactory. The project's success was due to\n            the highly motivated commitment of the Hungarian Power\n            Companies, which carried out much of the preparation before\n            requesting Bank financing, to the use of a turnkey\n            procurement contract for the main equipment, and to the\n            absence of policy conditionality apart from standard\n            financial covenants. The Bank was able to support the\n            project under these conditions because of Hungary's\n            demonstrated success in restructuring and privatizing the\n            power sector, and in so doing, was particularly responsive\n            to the client's expressed needs. Other lessons were\n            that completing procurement prior to project effectiveness\n            could greatly shorten the project implementation period; and\n            that dealing with highly committed, competent, and\n            experienced clients could greatly reduce costs to the Bank\n            for project preparation and supervision."}, "docdt": "2000-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
