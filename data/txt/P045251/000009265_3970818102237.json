Gas\n            Turbine Project is to provide about 200 Megawatt (MW) of\n            generation reserve capacity to enable Hungary to maintain a\n            level of reliability and security of supply in line with\n            international standards.  The project consists of two\n            complete single cycle gas turbine power plants rated at\n            about 110 MW each, burning light distillate fuel oil.  The\n            plants will consist of the following fully integrated\n            components: 1) main equipment (gas turbine and generator\n            sets and auxiliaries, air inlet, exhaust gas systems,\n            including stacks, electrical equipment, power plant control\n            system, high voltage switch gear and unit transformers,\n            enclosures and light structure buildings); 2) auxiliary\n            systems (fuel supply system, demineralized water supply,\n            water supply for extinguishing system, fire detection and\n            protection system, telecommunications and remote and\n            indication systems); 3) civil works (site preparation,\n            leveling, earthwork, foundations, roads and fences, site\n            improvements, cable and piping channels and trenches); and\n            4) network and infrastructure (telecommunications link)."}, "docdt": "1997-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
