The potential\n            environmental impacts include: a) construction: noise and\n            dust levels as well as construction wastes; b) air pollution\n            and air quality: emission of dust, nitrous oxide and sulfur\n            dioxide; c) soil quality: oil manipulation; d) surface and\n            subsurface water quality: wastewater; and airborne\n            admissions; e) handling and storage of raw materials and\n            wastes; and f) noise emissions; and other impacts.  All of\n            the impacts are negligible or within Hungarian standards.\n            The impacts will be mitigated by the following measures: a)\n            emission reduction through water ejection in the combustion\n            chamber or by appropriate burner construction; b) collection\n            and transportation of communal wastes, including separation\n            of oily wastes; c) noise protection by silencers, special\n            sound insulation and casing; d) accident prevention by\n            infrastructure improvements; e) earthquake precautions; and\n            f) fire protection and decontamination procedures."}, "docdt": "1996-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
