V1 INTRODUCTION
One of the outstanding objectives of the Hungarian energy policy approved by
the National Assembly is the diversification of the energy sources, and - in
view of wire energy - the extension of the connections. Therefore, in 1991, the
Government made a decision, that the Hungaran energy system joins UCPTE,
the association of the Western-European electric energy systems, which are on
a higher technical level and which may guarantee a more safe electric energy
supply for Hungary.
One of the basic conditions of joining UCPTE is, that the Hungarian electric
energy systen should have a quick-action, so-called secondary control reserve
capacities of a size determined by UCPTE recommendations. These reserve
capacities should be equivalent at least to the greatest capacity of the electric
energy production unit of the system. In the Hungarian electric energy system
the greatest capacity production units are the 460 MW blocs of the Nuclear
Power Plant of Paks, thus the secondary control reserve capacity should be of
460 MW.
In the recent years, the Hungarian Power Companies Ltd. (MVM Rt.) has
performed comprehensive investigations for analyzing the most purposeful
possibilities of ensuring the required reserve capacity. Based on the analysis,
MVM has come to the conclusion, that 200 MW of the required reserve
capacity should be ensured by establishing quick-start gas turbine power
plants.

1/2 BACKGROUND
1/2.1 Alternatives of the location of the facility, reasons
Starting from the role of the secondary control power plants played in the
electric energy system, MVM has come to the conclusion, that it would be
purposeful to install the power plants serving for this purpose at the significant
connection points of the electriC energy system, at the great substations of the
network. In spring 1994 investigations have been carnied out for the possible
locations. Four substations have been found as optimal locations for
installation: the substation of the Nuclear Power Plant of Paks, the substation
of Lit6r, the substation of Martonvisir and the substation of Saj6szoged.
In autumn 1994 MVM invited ETV-ERC)TERV Rt. Power Engineering and
Contractor Co. to prepare a detailed feasibility study and a preliminary
environmental impact study for the above four locations. When evaluating the
conceptual plans it has become clear, that at the substation of Martonvhsir the
connection of the power plant to the network could only be done at much
higher costs with respect to the other sites, therefore further investigations
have been stopped by MVM for this location.
For the locations of the Nuclear Power Plant of Paks, of Liter and Saj6szoged
the detailed feasibility studies and the preliminary environmental impact
studies have been completed by the beginning of 1995.
Based on these documentations, in May 1995, MVM Rt started the licensing
procedure of the facilities.
In its decision No. 31.700-17/1995, the Environmental Inspectorate of the
Middle Transdanubian Region prescribed to prepare a detailed environmental
impact study fcr the secondary reserve gas turbine power plant to be
established at thc :ubstation of Lit6r.
In its decision No. 46/1995, the Hungarian Energy Office has granted a
preliminary building permit for the secondary reserve power plant of Liter.

In January and February 1996, in possession of the preliminary building
pernit issued by the Hungarian Energy Office, in cooperation with Ratky and
Co. Marketing Communication Agency, MVM Rt. organized a public hearing
in harmony with Govenmment Decree No. 146/1992.(XIA.). On April 22,
1996 a decision has been issued by the inter-depaazmental committee in
connection with the information of the public, according to § 3 of the above
said Govemment Decree.
It2.2 The investigated technological versions, their evaluation
A secondary reserve function can be ensured by the water reservoir power
plants or the quick-start open-cycle gas turbine power plants.
The advantages of the water reservoir power plant are: quick starting, the
transfornation of the cheaper night electric energy to a day-time peak energy,
the disadvantages are: the high specific investnent cost and the long building
time. It would be impossible to build a water reservoir power plant by the time
of the final joining to the UCPTE system - by the end of 1997 -, consequently,
the only alteLiLative is the installation of quick-start gas turbines.
Based on the evaluation of 12 informal proposals for gas turbines, which have
been received during the past 2 years, we have drawn the general technical
consequences, nanely, that the requirements of quick starting (rated output to
be achieved in max. 10 minutes) are primarily met by the aeroderivative gas
turbines, which are driving gears of airplanes transformed for industrial
purposes.
The most applicable types are LM 6000 (GE) and TRENT (Rolls-Royce) gas
turbines, see installation plan 1I23.-2. These gas turbines comply with the
environmental requirements, and - thanks to their layout characteristics
(container-type structLre) - they can be installed easily, quicldy and efficiently.
When evaluating the proposals, the enviromnental aspects shall fully be taken
into considen-tion. The selection of the final type and the determination of the
number of the units shall be based on the results of an intemational
competition, taking also into consideration the environmental aspects.

ETV-EROTERV RL
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
Since 100 ±20 MW has been determined in the preliminary building permit of
the Hungarian Energy Office as the capacity of the power plant, therefore,
when investigating the environmental impacts, 120 MW maximum capacity
and a two-bloc structure shall be taken into consideration, however, in some
cases, the single-bloc structure shall also be investigated.
1/23 Feasibility study
The main items of the detailed feasibility study are the following:
Location
The 2.4 ha size location is in the outskirts of Lit6r, in N-E direction, in the
northern part of the area surrounded by the Veszpr6m-BalatonfIzf5i and
Veszpr6m-Kirilyszentistvhn roads and the so-called transformer transportation
roads, in westem direction from the existing substation (see site plan No.
1/23.-i.). In the location the following equipment and systems shall be
installed (see installation plan No. 1123.-2. and the attached schematic drawing
1123.-3):
- gas turbine and auxiliary equipment
-  generator and auxiliary equipment
-  electric equipment of the power plant
-  electric technology of the substation
-  control system
-  environmental monitoring system
-  fuel supply system
-  water supply system
-  fire protection system
The power plant shall be accessible by a connection road branching from the
transportation road of the neighbouring substation. The plant shall have its
own access and transportation roads and pavements according to the needs.
The communal and fire water demands of the facility shall be covered through
a branching from the main pipeline between the water works of Liter and the
substation.

113. GEOGRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT, LANDSCAPE
The site of the projected plant is located at the meeting point of two medium
regions - Bakony region and Mez6fold -, and it is divided to fiurther small
regions, thus reflecting the variety of the environment. To North-West from
Liter the site is bordered by the Veszprem highland, to Sout-East by the
Balaton highland and, as a continuation, the Vilonya mountains, while to East
from  Ffizfgyartelep the neighbouring region is Sirr&t. Within the
geographical environment of the plant there are the following settlements: at a
distance of about 3 kIn S6ly (300 inhabitants),Vilonya (600 inhabitants) and
BalatonfEof (5300 inhabitants), at a distance of 2 kan KiTilyszentistvin (300
inhabitants), the nearest - at a distance of approx. 1 kan - is Liter (1850
inhabitants). The majority of them are very old settlements, with the traditional
"single street" aniangement, but, during the recent years, they have undergone
significant changes. There are new buildings everywhere, but it is Liter which
has expanded mostly. Vor5sber6ny and Balatonffifd are mostly resort places,
while Peremarton-Gyhrtelep and FizOgyfrtelep are expressly mdustrial
settlements with modem housing estates. The above settlements have
originally been agricultural settlements - the lands of loose rocky soil have
been under agricultural cultivation, while the dolomites have been used for
grazing - but since the appearance of the industrial plants in the region a part
of the population works in the industry. The region is crossed by the following
railway lines: at North by the Budapest-Szombathely railway line, at East by
the Hajmask6r-Csajig railway line and its embranchment at BalatonfUizfd.
Two main roads cross the region: main road No. 8 from Szekesfeh6rvar to
Veszprem and its side-road to the Balaton, and secondary main road No. 72
which connects the region with highway M-7.
The determining morphological element of the natural landscape is a dolomite
range in NE-SW direction. The treeless parts of the rocky surface covered with
a thin soil layer are characteristic to this rolling, slightly wavy country. The
northem part is a highland of an average altitude of 200 m BSL located at the
two sides of main road No. 8, which has a slight slope to NE direction, and
which lowers from 210 m to 180 m. The surface, which seems to be uniform
from a greater distance, is interrupted, in a mosaic-like shape, by small cone-
shaped fornations and groups of cone-shaped formations, and ridges, between
them there are depressions without an outlet and small valleys - keeping the
traces of a long-standing karstic process. In the main direction (NE-SW) the
dolomite range is almost cut into two parts by the so-called "great structural
line of Liter" which is followed by Bendola-creek, too. Along the Iine there
have been for millions of years, and still there are, seismic activities, and
20



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
the interaction of the petrographical structure and the
erosion has resulted in a specific morphological picture. At the NW side of the
"Lit6r crack" there is a lower strip of eroded red sand rock and aleurolite from
the Permian epoch.
The Bendola-creek, which has its source in the great structural zone, runs in
this wide, erosion bed, cut into the filled bottom of the valley. The section of
the valley over Lit6r is still at an altitude of over 200 m, but at the railway
station its altitude is below 170 m, then the valley widens and unites with the
S6Iy basin, which is at an altitude of 155 m. At the SE side of the crack there
are Triassic dolomite blocks of an altitude of 230-250 m BSL (Nyerges-
mountain, Mogyor6s-mountain, Vilonya-mountains) with steep slopes running
down to the valley of Bendola-creek located at an altitude lower by 50-80 m.
The dolomite range is transversely cut into smaller pieces by short and steep
dry valleys. In SE direction gently sloping hillsides and ridges run down
between the valleys to the edge of Sarret located at an altitude of 140-150 m.
The above mentioned karstic formations can also be found on this higher range
of mountains. It is a result of the uncovered karstic surface, that the region is
lacking natural water flows. After Bendola-creek the second significant water
flow is SRd. This creek also runs at the foot of dolomite rocks, which are likely
steep, but lower than those of Lit6r (10-30 m), then, at Hajmisker it turns to S-
SE direction and crosses the dolomite range through two short, steep-walled
canyons and runs to the lowland of Sarret.
The most important geomorphological and landscape formations of the region
are:
-  the karstic dolomite surface along main road No. 8
- the steep slope of the Liter crack with dolomite blocks
-  the right side of Sed-creek, with dolomite rocks, between Kdita and
Hajmasker
- the crossings of Sed-creek at S6ly and Vilonya
This specific "dolomite" landscape is destroyed by the sight of the planted pine
trees, which do not harmonize with the original, native plants of the region,
just like the numerous small quarries and large gravel pits, which are often
used as illegal waste disposal sites.

In the region there is no meteorological station where the vertical temperature
gradient is examined (there are only 13 such meteorological stations in the
country). The closest measuring station analyzing the vertical temperature
gradient is in Si6fok, but due to the influence of Lake Balaton, their data differ
from the transmission conditions of the area of the projected power plant in
such a great measure, that they could not be taken into consideration.
Therefore, the average occurrence frequencies in the wind velocity and
stability categories are same as the national average frequencies in Table 1/4-5

1/5 GEOLOGICAL, HYDROGEOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE
ENVIRONMENT
1/5-1 Geological conditions
The geological environment of the site of the projected plant structurally is a
part of the SE wing of the central mountain range. The area, which is bordered
by main cracks, tectonically is characterized by cracks and faults, folds and
local archings, scalings and stridings. From seismic point of view, it is more
sensitive than the average (see Tables 1/5.1-1 and 115.1-2). The majority of the
small region is built from the materials of mezozoic dolomite and lime stone
formations.
Lit6r village and its environment is located at the meeting point of the Bakony
mountain and the Balaton Highland, along the so-called Lit6r furrow (See
Fig. 1/5.1-3). In the development of the geological structure of the area the
funrows have played a significant role. They can be divided into two groups:
the cross-wise furrows of NW-SE direction, due to their open character,
indicate aquiferous strips;
the NE-SW direction longitudinal furrows, perpendicular to the above,
have a closed character, they are not aquiferous, and they are parallel to
the strike of the mountain.
In the geological construction of the area, the base rock can be found directly
under the thin topsoil: limestone, respectively dolomite, at some places lime
marl with clay marl inclusions. At a great part of the area base rock formations
can be found directly on the surface. The geological and pedological
conditions are shown by Figs. I15.1-4, -5 and -6.
1/5.2 Hydrogeological conditions
The most significant water resources in the area of the projected plant are the
karstic waters in the Triassic carbonate deposit, which forms the base rock of
Bakony. The current volume of the karstic waters of the region depends on the
water level and the pressure conditions. The rate of infiltration is primarily a
function of precipitation.

The last years are characterized by the lack of precipitation in the whole
region. According to forecasts, the extremely dry period, characteristic to the
recent years, is not yet over, and we cannot count with a significant increase of
the natural water supply in the coming few years. Regarding the water balance,
the decisive proportion of tappings of water resources are mine water
excavations since the mid of 1960's. In the recent years the karstic water
volumes excavated by mines have significantly reduced.
In general, it can be stated, that, in the last decade, due to the decreasing
infiltrations and the excessive mine water excavations, the pressure and water
level values, characteristic to the karstic water, have significantly reduced.
Despite of the favorable changes which have taken place in the recent years,
the current situation shall be decisive for a long period of time in the
management of the main karstic water resources.
From hydrogeological point of view, the area is also significantly influenced
by the geological structure and the crossing furrows. Along the NE-SW
direction furrows, which are not aquiferous, there are several springs, since
here the crosswise water flows meet vanous aquifers, which help the water to
come to the surface in the form of spring Strip. Wes can find such strips in the
line of Gyulafirit&t, Ostni, Varpalota and Inota. The appearance of the furrows
in the area of Lit6r has an importance, since by the striding of the impermeable
and aquiferous layers on each other, a formation is reproduced similar to the
water floors of Balaton. The hydrogeological conditions of the area are shown
on Fig. 115.2-1.
The springs come to the surface at an altitude of 200 m BSL or over this
altitude. The water of the spdrings flows in eastern and south-eastem direction,
this corresponds to the slope direction of the area. The spring of Diszn6domb
comes to the surface at an altitude of 215 m BSL. In the area of the projected
plant no break out of spring is expected, here the karstic water can only be
reached by deep drilling.
Due to the geological structure of the area, water can only be obtained from
karstic water. For greater volumes deep wells should be drilled, since we have
to count with the lowering of the static water level.

1/7.1 Status of waters
I/7.1.1 Subsurface waters
The most significant water resources in the area of the projected plant are the
karstic waters in the Triassic carbonate deposit, which forms the base rock of
Bakony. The subsurface water yields and the general water depth of the wells
are shown in Figs. 1/7.1.1.-i and -2.
We have water quality data of karstic water wells K-2 and K-3 which are
located in the vicinity of the projected plant from the time of their
establishment (for the location of the wells see Fig. 1/52.-I). These data are
displayed in Tables 117.1.1.-1 and -2 (VITUKI data base).

Comparing the chemical composition of the water of the wells with the
standard specifications on drinldng water, the water of the wells can be
qualified as "acceptable". The relatively high nitrate contents can possibly be
attributed to the aquitard and aquiferous formations coming to the surface,
while the significant hardness refers to the karstic origin.
117.1.2 Surface waters
Bendola-creek runs in the immediate vicinity of the area under investigation, it
falls to Sed at Veszprem (see Fig. 1/7.1.2.-i). No water quality data are
available for Bendola, the closest water quality analyzing station is in
Veszpr6m, on Sed. Bendola is in the Sd-Nador system catchment area, which
belongs to the left-side catchment area of the Si6 river. The S&d-Nador system
catchment area is 2,067 sq.km.
The Sed-Nador system is being contaminated by significant contamination
sources. Due to the numerous mine water and waste water inflows, the
reduction of springs as a result of the mining activity, dammings and passages,
we can practically not speak of natural water yield and water flow. The bed
and the water yield of Sed of Veszpr6m is divided at S6ly, the characteristic
water yield - practically the full water yield - is forwarded by the Sarviz-
Malom canal, the bed of S&d-Veszpr6m collects

only the treated waste waters discharged by the industrial and communal waste
water plants. The treated waste water of Veszprem town and that uf the
Bakony Works are discharged to Sed-Veszprem. Due to the division of the
water system S6d-Veszpr6n practically starts to run with empty bed at
Vilonya, and it is a recipient of the industrial waste waters of the Nitrok6mia
Industrial Plants of BalatonfUzfo-, the Frzfo Plant of the Company of Paper
Industry, the Chemical Work of Peremarton and the Papkeszi Plant of NIKE.
In addition to the industrial load, the volume of communal waters directed to
S6d from the Balaton catchment area is also decisive.
It is a basic problem, that the springs of Herend, feeding the water flow, do not
supply sufficient springwater, contrary, due to depression the water leaks from
the bed along the section between Veszpr6m and Herend. Earlier, some
sections of Sed-Nador of Veszpr6m, due to mine water inflows, have had free
water resources, but mine water inflows have been stopped. All these
tendencies have significantly been intensified by the long-standing dry period.
The outwash of the organic microcontaminants from the mud of the bed can be
expected for a long period of time.
Based on the computerized water quality data base of VrIUKI, the data
measured in 1994 in the bed sections of Sed-Veszprem at S6ly and Osi are
shown in Tables 117.1.2.-l and -2. The S6ly bed section is found before
meeting Bendola, while the Osi bed section can be found after the meeting
point. Based on the displayed data it can be stated, that in the Osi bed section
the water quality is much worse, especially with respect to the oxygen and
nutrient supply (it is of category V, heavily contaminated). The significant
deterioration of the water quality can clearly be attributed to the fact, that
along the investigated section great industrial plants are discharging their
waste waters to the creek, which are treated only in part.
117.2 Geological and soil investigations
The geological conditions of the immediate environment of the projected plant
is demonstrated by the successive layers of the two karstic water wells
mentioned under point I17.1.1 (for the location of the wells see Fig. 1/5.2.-1).

1/7.3 Air quality
The Department of Air Hygiene of the National Public Health Institute (OKI)
prepared a study on the air quality of the area of Balatonfiffi-Lit6r in the
period between October 1988 and March 1994. The study was based on the
measuring data of the National Immission Measuring Network. We
demonstrate the air quality conditions of the region on the basis of this study.
Description of the general air conditions of the Balatonfia*XLivir region
The Central-Danubian industrial area, from Szekesfehervar to Ajka, from
environmental point of view, is the most exposed region of the country. Within
this region, the area surrounded by Varpalota, Veszprem and Balatonfiizfo is
the most contaminated area. This also holds for the air of the region.

According to the regulations in force, the pollution load indexes for Liter and
BalatonfUizr, for solid particles are: S02, NOx and CO - 60%, other
contaminants - 50%.
From the emission data of the region, OKI has detennined by propagation
calculations the average immission values for the settlements of the region.
These values are shown in Table 17.3.-4.

The background pollution of the area are significantly influenced by the
industrial emissions of the Inota-Varpalota-P6t region and Balatonflzifo.

The main pollution source of the narrower BalatonfiizfSo-Lit6r area is the P(zfoi
industrial plant: chemical industry, power plant and paper mill. The nearby
road traffic is also a significant pollution source, mainly in the summer period:
road traffic along the shore of Lake Balaton, in western direction main road
No. 8, and the road connecting the two latters, crossing Lit6r. The increased
pollution in a 100-200 m section of this road is well manifest by the
measurements.
According to the data of the environmental infornation system, in the relevant
20x20 m emission cadaster the following emissions were measured in 1992, as
shown in Table In7.3.-2.

As it is shown in the Table, in the case of sulfur-dioxide the emissions of the
power plant was decisive, while the overwhelming majority of carbon-
monoxyde emissions can be attributed to the industrial technologies.
Description of the air quality of the BalatonfizfW&Litir region
Kirilyszentistvhn (Fig. 1/73.-4)
Sulfur-dioxide pollution is much higher than the average. Outstanding values
appear in the heating season, but these are still below the limit value.
Nitrogen-dioxide pollution is significantly higher than the average value, also
with respect to the 98% frequency. There is only a small difference between
the values of the heating and non-heating seasons. Looking back to several
years, the pollution trend is stagnating below the limit value.
Settling dust values show outstanding values in some specific half-years, but
these excess values have no tendency or regularity. Among the basic pollutants
settling dust is the one which shows a significant excess frequency (12-30%).

Sudfur-dioxide pollution is low, outstanding values appear only in the 98%
frequency value, but only in some specific heating seasons. Its tendency is
stagnating below the limit value.
Nitrogen-dioxide pollution has an increasing tendency, but it is still under the
limit value. The summer and winter values do not differ significantly. 98%
frequency values are significantly higher than the average, in some cases there
are also outstanding values.
Settling dust load is stagnating, excess values occurred in two half-years
(1989-90 heating season, 1991 non-heating season).
Balatonfuzfd (town) (Fig. I/ 73.-3)
With respect to the average values, suUkr-dioxide pollution cannot be
considered significant, outstanding values were registered in the 98%
frequency values, primarily in the heating seasons. In 1990 there were excess
values both in the heating and non-heating seasons, but since then no excess
values appeared, i.e. sulfur-dioxide pollution shows a stagnating tendency.
Nitrogen-dioxide pollution started with high values in 1989. After a
provisional reduction it is increasing again, but there were no excess values
neither in the heating season, nor in the non-heating season.
Settling dust load reached an excess value in 1990-91, since then it was below
the limit value.
Peremarton (Fig. 1/73.14)
Sulfir-dioxide pollution is stagnating on a low level, there have been no excess
values.
Nitrogen-dioxide polludon is on a higher level, but no excess values were
measured. The pollution tendency is slightly increasing.
Settling dust load have shown a decreasing tendency during the measuring
period. Excess values were measured in 3 half-years (1989 non-heating
seison. 1989-90 and 1991-92 heating seasons), in the last two years of the
measuring period no excess values were measured.

Sulfur-dioxide pollution is on a low level, no excess values were registered in
the measuring period. There were some outstanding values in some specific
half-years, which are also shown by the 98% frequency values (1989-90 and
1991-92 heating seasons).
Nitrogen-dioxide pollution was below the limit value with one exception
(1989-90 heating season). The pollution tendency is stagnating. However, the
98% frequencies show significant concentrations with respect to average in
every half-year.
Settling dust load shows an increasing tendency, but it is still below the limit
value. Significant excess occurred only in one single half-year (1991 non-
heating season), but this was the only case.
VesZDrem (Fig. I/7.3.-6)
We calculated an average value from the measuring data of the three
measuring stations of the town, since we consider the town as a source with
respect to the impact to the region. (From this point of view it is not important
to display in detail the pollution registered by the measuring stations.)
Sulfur-dioxide pollution is on a low level, it has a stagnating tendency below
the limit value. Similar to the above cases, the 98% frequencies show higher
values in some specific half-years, which refers to local impacts.
Nitrogen-dioxide pollution shows a more steady picture, the tendency is also
stagnating, however, there are outstanding values in every half-year. In such
cases the 98% frequency values show three times higher concentrations than
the average. There was an excess by 5-10% in almost every half-year, which is
significant, and which can be attributed to the traffic.
Settling dust load is significant in the town, there is a 10% frequency of excess
values in every half-year. Settling dust load tendency has not shown any
change during the measuring period.

Condusions:
With respect to the basic pollutants, air quality conditions are favorable in the
area of Liter. Kiraiyszentistvan, BalatonfGzfo-gyfrtelep and Balatonfizfoi town
are within a 5 km distance from Liter. The air quality of these three settlements
with respect to sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-dioxide pollution can be considered
satisfactory, while the settling dust load is objectionable.
Peremarton, Balatonalmadi and Veszpr6m are at a greater distance, within
approx. 10 km from the site. These settlements are also characterized by a
greater settling dust load. In Veszpr&n town - as an impact of road traffic - in
some cases nitrogen-dioxide concentrations are over the limit value.
Further loadability of the region is problematic, primarily with respect to
settling dust.
1.7.4 Flora and fauna
1/7.4.2 Botany
The site of the projected plant and its surrounding belongs to the floristic
region of the Transdanubian Central Mountain (Bakonyicum) within the
Hungarian floral sector (Pannonicum). Within this region there are two floral
districts: the northem part belongs to the Bakony-V6rtes district(Vesprimense),
while the southern part belongs to the Balaton district (Balatonicum). The
border line of the two districts is the line of Nagyvazsony-Nemesvamos-Liter-
Vilonya-Osi settlements.
According to the map of the climatic zones of the vegetation determined by the
climatic conditions, the whole area belongs to the zone of the hilly and woody
steppe of the lowland edge. Accordingly, the potential vegetation (natural
vegetation, without human impacts) map shows Illyrian-type tomentose karstic
oakwoods (with karstic scrub forest and rock grass), Tartar maplewoods and
loess oakwoods, and, along S6d-Veszprem and at the northern-eastern shore of
the Fiizfi5 bay, floodland galleries. No Turkey oak and oakwood were found at
the climatic zones (natural occurrences of plakor position), but they may
appear extrazonally, at the northern sides and at the lower lands.

With respect to the potential vegetation, the thousand years old human cultural
effects have significantly changed the vegetation of the region. Similar to the
other parts of the country, currently there is no trace of the Tartar maple woods
and loess oakwoods. The main reasons are:
-     the soil of the loess oakwoods is good for ploughlands, therefore they
have been for centuries under agricultural cultivation;
-     due to forest clearings and agricultural cultivation the loess cover on the
hillsides were washed down and the dolomite base rock became
uncovered, thus only tomentose oakwoods can live on them;
-     due to the flood control of the creeks running to S6d-Veszpr6m and to
the Fizfo- bay the associated floodland galleries -have died.
The excessive forest clearing on the hillsides of dolomite base rock has
resulted in the washdown of the soil, therefore, due to degradation, only
inferior karstic scrub forests and rock grass can live here (open and closed
dolomite rock grass, sloping steppe with rock grass). In sloping areas it is often
difficult to determine, whether the vegetation is primary or it has formed due
to degradation. the main types of vegetation - in succession of plant
communities - are the following:
Natural or semi-cultural communities:
Open dolomite rock grass (Seseli leucospermi - Festucetum pallentis Z6lyomi
(1036) 1958, 1966). Pioneer communities of dolomite ridges and steep
dolomite slopes. The eponym species is the Hungarian seseli leucospermum
and festuca pallens. The grass cover is low (30-70%). It occupies a significant
place on the dolomite hills of Hajmneskr, Liter, S6ly and Vilonya. The
needlegrass sub-association appears at a more intensive closure. During site
walks we have found some typical sorts of it: draba lasiocarpa, paronychia
cephalotes, carex humilis, homungia petreae, dianthus plumarius ssp. regis-
stephani.

Closed dolomite rock grass (Festuco pallenti - Brometum pannonici Z6lyomi
(1942) 1958). It is a grass community which has formed on the fine dolomite
detritus of the colder northem slopes. In addition to the eponym species we
can often find another species: carex humilis. According to its exposure, it is
primarily characterized by cold-demanding species. In the region there are
groups of this species occupying smaller areas.
Dolomite slopes covered with rock grass (steppe) (Chrysopogono - Caricetum
humilis (Soo 1930, Z6lyomi 1 950). It is a closed plant community developing
parallel with the thickening topsoil. In addition to carex humilis which appears
often in dolomite grass, we can also find chrysopogon gryllus. Festuca pallens
is withdrawing, while festuca rupicola and festuca valesiaca appears in larger
quantities. Stipa capillata can also be found often. From among the protected
species of this type of vegetation we have found pulsatilla nigricans, pulsatilla
grandis and adonis vernalis. The two pulsatillas do not appear often in this
area. The above three communities may form mosaic-like complexes with
each other and with the dolomite karstic scrub forests.
Dolomite karstic scrub forest (Cotino - Quercetum pubescentis So6 1931,
Z6lyomi 1958) The small-size, separate patches of this type of vegetation forn
mosaic-line complexes with rock grasses and steppe meadows. It is a short
forest. Its foliage is characterized by tomentose oak (quercus pubescens) and
flowering ash. On the shrub level the site is characterized by sumac, which
surrounds the group of trees as a skirt On the grass level, which is rich in soft-
stalk species, several protected species may appear. A part of these are
characteristic rock grass species forming mosaic-like complexes.
Calciphilous oakwood (Omo-Quer=ettm pubescentis So6 1928) Horiszky-
Jakucs-Z6lyomi 1958). The oak forest is consisted of short, generally 15-18 m
high trees. In addition to the three drought-resistant species (tomentose, sessile
and Turkey oak) flowering ash can also often be found. The foliage of the trees
closes loose, therefore the shrub level is often impassable, on the grass level
light- and heat-demanding species can be found. The former great-size forests
have been forced back by forest clearings.

Turkey-sessile oakwood (Quercetum petreae - cenis So6 1957). The plant
community may appear extrazonally, at some places of the area. Its actual
presence can be confirned by site walks.
Cultivated plant communities
Ploughlands. It is the task of future site walks to list the plants cultivated on
the ploughlands and to determine their proportion.
Black pine plantations. The black pine plantations, prefenred so much by
foresters, occupy large areas on barren dolomite rocks and their grassy slopes
despite the fact, that by now it has become clear, that the middle-age black
pine woods die in the lack of water, and thus their plantation is neither
economical, nor favorable from nature protection point of view.
1/7.4.2 Zoology
Based on zoological geography, the area under investigation belongs partly to
the Balaton Highland, partly to Mezofdld. The site walks, the mapping of
habitats and the collection took place in the first half of April. Due to the early
spring period the activity of the fauna has not made possible to give a full
characterization of the area.
Based on the character of the habitats numerous precious species are expected
to appear. The dry dolomite rock grass and the sloping steppes dominating the
area may be the home of numerous xerotherrnic species. ardtropodal species,
while the suroundings of waters and water flows may be the habitat of rare
hygrofilic species. From among the vertebrate animals a number of species
have already appeared, thus for example four species of super-birds of prey.
From among small mammalians we have to mention squirrel.

1/7.4.3 Plant and animal indicator groups
The selection of indicator groups, both for plants and animal, can take place
only following detailed exploration. Based on the available data and
experiences the fauna shall primarily be affected by airborn emissions. With
regard to the dominating wind direction, when selecting the indicator groups,
first of all the flora and fauna of the Mogyor6 mountain can be taken into
account, which is exposed to both direct and indirect impacts. We think, that in
the other areas only moderate impacts shall appear, and they can hardly be
separated - from methodological point of view - from the other intensive
background pollution sources (pollution of Balatonffzfo, P6tfiirdo, Vhrpalota).
In order to select the animal indicator groups, the soil traps have already been
set out and data collection on the fauna has already been started.
1/7.4.4 Diversity of habitats and their changes
The short period of time at our disposal is not sufficient for the determination
of the actual and correct diversity conditions, the ecological investigations
require longer time (several years), and the changes of diversity can only be
demonstrated on the basis of these investigations. Currently only an
approximation and estimation can be given based on the explored species and
the frequency of their appearance in the area. The investigations are underway.
1/7.5 Noise emission, current noise load of the area
The area surrounding the Liter sub-station is partly agricultural area, partly
industrial area, and partly residential and administrative area of low building
density. There are several traffic roads in the vicinity (the heavy traffic main
road No. 72 and the roads between Veszprem and Kirilyszentistvan) the traffic
of which make the environment noisy.
The permissible noise load values (noise immission) originating from the
activities in the industrial plants (based on Attachment No. 1 to Decree No.
4/1984.(I.23.)EuM) are shown in Table 1/7.5.-1:

The limit values of the table hold only for residential and administrative area
of low building density (i.e. for the part of the area with dwelling houses to be
protected), since in the other parts of the area there are not buildings to be
protected, and thus noise load limit values should not be complied with.
Consult-R Enviromnent Development Partnership Company performed
measurements to determine the noise emission of the sub-station of Liter. The
measurements have been carried out on April 10, 1996 according to Hungarian
Standard Specifications MSZ-13-111-85 and MSZ 18150/1-83. The location
of the measuring points are shown in Fig. 117.5.-i, while the equivalent and
noise emission sound pressure A- levels, the calculated noise emission limit
values and the ground noise values are shown in Table 1/7.5.-2.
The noise emission sound pressure level A at the measuring points shall be
calculated with the following fonnula:
LAE=LAeq+Kl +K2+K3
wvhere:
LAeg is the equivalent sound pressure level A (dB)
K Is the correction due to ground noise (dB)
K2 is the correction relating to impulse noises (dB)
K3 is the correction due to the narrow-band character of the noise (dB)

Reasons of the day/night noise emission limit values of the table:
In the vicinity of three border lines of the Lit6r sub-station there are no
dwelling houses to be protected, thus the noise load limit values should not be
complied with. On the measuring surfaces exposed at a distance of 10 m from
these three border lines (measuring surface I - measuring points 1101-1103,
measuring surface IV - measuring points 4101-4105, and measuring surface III
- measuring points 3101-3106), according to Section 3.2 of Hungarian
Standard Specifications MSZ-13-111-85, the highest value of the permissible
noise emission limit value, i.e. 70 dB can be taken into account as noise
emission limit value.
In the direction of measuring surface II (measuring points 2101-2114), located
at a distance of d=l 0 m from the border line of the site, at a distance of 700 m
there are dwelling houses to be protected, and thus the noise emission limit
value should be determined for this measuring surface by calculation in a way,
that the noise emission limit values should be complied with at a distance of 2
m from the facade of the buildings.
In case of dwelling houses to be protected, the noise emission limit value LKH
(dB) should be calculated by the following formula:
LKH = LTH + KN + KR + KD
where:
LTH  is the noise load (noise immission) limit value permissible in the
environment of the plant, dB, which can be determined for the various
parts of the environment of the sub-station taking into consideration the
function of the specific area as indicated in Table 117.5.-. In our case
the function of the area to be taken into consideration is a residential
and administrative area of low building density.
KN   is the correction associated with the number of noise sources in the
environment (in our case 0 dB)
KR   is the correction associated with the echo (in our case 0 dB)
KD   is the correction associated with noise propagation.
48



ETV/ER6TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
The correction associated with noise propagation KD, in case of measuring the
permissible noise emission limit value in dB, should be calculated by the
following formula (according to Section 3.3.4 of Hungarian Standard
Specifications MSZ-13-l 11-85 ):
KD = L*AE - L*AM
where:
L*AE   is the noise emission sound pressure level A measured at the critical
point of the measuring surface, dB
L*AM   the highest standard sound pressure level A in the same direction,
dB
The standard sound pressure level A can be calculated by the following
formula (according to Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 18150/1-83):
LAM -LAeq+KI +K2+K3
Since, according to the measurements, the noise was not of a narrow-band and
it had not a pulsed character, (the correction value of K2 and K3 was zero),
only the correction associated with ground noise (KI) had to be taken into
consideration.
When making the calculations for measuring surface II, KD (day) could not be
calculated (since the standard sound pressure level A could not be determined
due to the heavy taffic noise), we calculated with the night values. KD
(night) = 27 dB for dwelling houses under investigation.
With the calculated KD = 27 dB the noise emission limit value shall be
equivalent to 67 dB(A) in the night period, on measuring surface II exposed at
a distance of 10 m from the border line of the site.
In the day-time period, due to the lower 50 dB(A)noise load limit value (noise
emission limit value would be 77 dB), we can apply 70 dB(A), the maximum
noise emission limit value, on measuring surface II.
At the time of the investigations the noise emission of the sub-station was
approx. 80% of the maximum possible value. At this time 4 transformers
(from the existing 5) were operated together with 12 cooling fans. This can be
considered normal working conditions.

Comparing LAE noise emission sound pressure levels A determined at the
specific measuring points and the associated LKH noise emission limit values,
we can state the following:
a) In the day-time period (6 A.M. - 10 P.M.) the noise emitted by the sub-
station was lower than the permissible noise emission limit values at the
reference measuring points. The ground noise at the dwelling houses to be
protected was higher - due to the noise load of the nearby road with heavy
traffic - than the noise load of the sub-station, it was over the noise load limit
value (50 dB(A)).
b) In the night period the ground noise in the environment of the sub-station
was lower than that of the day-time period. On the measuring surfaces exposed
at the border lines of the site no excess val.es were measured, the measured
values were lower than the relevant noise emission limit values (67 resp. 70
dB(A) ). The noise load value at the dwelling houses to be protected was max.
38 dB(A), below the limit value.

II/1 DESCRJ'TION OF THE OPERATION OF THE PROJECTED GAS
TURBINE POWER PLANT
The gas turbine power plant is one of the technologies of electric energy
production processes which causes the least environmental pollution. During its
operation only airbome emissions and noise mean a pollution load to the
environment.
The decisive technological element of the power plant is the gas tutbine, which
has three main parts: the compressor, the combustion chamber and the turbine.
The compressor compresses the suction air to the required pressure for
combustion. The fuel is burnt by special burners. The turbine is rotated by the
expansion of the high pressure and high temperature flue gas discharging from
the combustion chamber. Electric energy is generated by a generator connected to
the turbine.
The generating flue gas is discharged to the open air through a stack. The gas
turbine is mounted with a silencer both at the suction side and at the stack.
The operation scheme and the axonometric view of the gas turbine is shown in
Fig. 1111.-1, while the view and the axonometric picture of the container unit are
shown in Fig. IIL1.-2.
During combustion at a high ternperature a part of the suction air and the
nitrogen-containing compounds of the fuel form nitrogen oxides. Their amount
depends on the temperature of the flame and on the time of residence of the gases
in the combustion chaTnber. The rate of nitrogen oxide generation can be kept on
a low level by the proper formation of the combustion chamber, respectively by
water injection. The fuel also contains some sulfur, in a very small quantity (max.
0.2%). During combustion this forms sulfur dioxide. The carbon monoxide and
soot emission of the newest types of turbines is minimal.
In the present phase of planning neither the number of the required gas turbines
has not been determined, nor the type has not been selected. Based on the
received informnal proposals we have selected one from among the possible types
for demonstrating the environmental impacts of the projected power plant, which
has the most unfavorable characteristics from environmental point of view.

The power plant shall have 100-120 MW capacity generated by one or two gas
turbines. The most probable solution shall be a two-block facility, but the single-
block version cannot be excluded either. During the investigation of the
environrmental impacts the most important difference between the two solutions
is the analysis of the air pollution, since there is a significant difference between
them with respect to immission.
During the investigation of the environmental impacts the highest possible
capacity - 120 MW - shall be considered as a reference. The characteristics of the
power plant associated with this capacity (based on the received informal
proposals and the preliminary discussions with the potential suppliers) have

11/2 CONSTRUCTION AND ASSEMBLY
11/2.1 Earthworks
According to the soil mechanical tests carried out for the construction and
foundation works, the base rock under the thin topsoil is sandstone. Currently the
site is a ploughland under cultivation. The soii of the green areas has a good
water absorption, therefore no dewatering is required and the appearance of
groundwater is not expected either.
The excavated soil layer shall be stockpiled safely in order to be backfilled after
the construction. Approx. 3000 cu.m soil shall be excavated at the site of the
engineering structures, but this volume shall not be removed from the site,
because it shall be used for terrain correction after the construction.
11/2.2 Construction, assembly
The construction work associated with the main equipment is basically
foundation work, since the equipment is built from container units.
With regard to the soil mechanical characteristics, in order to prevent the
propagation of vibrations, the reinforced concrete foundation block shall be
installed in a reinforced concrete basin, it shall contact with the foundation
through a 6 cm thick vibra cork or another anti-vibration material layer.
The main transformer shall have a reinforced concrete block base placed in a
reinforced concrete oil catch basin having a closed stone bed. For the connections
to the network several reinforced concrete base structures shall be built.
For the storage of the fuel two 1000 cu.m above-ground cylindrical tanks shall
be installed in vertical position, provided with a fixed roof and an inner floating
roof. The tank shall have thermal insulation, an alumina sheet casing and a
reinforced concrete protective ring. Demi water shall be stored in two 300 cu.m
capacity containers installed on a reinforced concrete base.

The building materials and the technological equipment shall be transported to
the site by road. The construction period - approx. 8-10 months - shall be
characterized by an intensive transportation activity, therefore we have to count
with the increase of road traffic.
Transportation of building materials: in average 100 t/tday (i.e. 4-5 trucks/day,
during earthworks and concrete works 6-8 trucks/day). During the construction
period approx. 600-700 cu.m concrete resp. approx. 60 t steel shall arrive to the
site. Concrete shall be transported in mixer trucks.
Technology: main equipment (turbines, generators, transformers - machine parts,
stack parts, tanks) shall be transported pre-assemnbled, by special trailers.
Auxiliary equipment and machine parts shall be transported by normal trucks
with an average frequency of 2-3trucks/day during the 2-3 month period of
asembly.
During the construction and assembly works mobile toilets and bathroom
containers shall be installed on the site based on an agreement with the building
company. The collection and the disposal of the generating waste water shall be
the responsibility of the building company.
The conmnunal waste and the debris which is not qualified as hazardous waste
(for example offal, packing materials, etc.) shall be collected and disposed by the
contractor performing the building and assembly works. According to the
relevant regulations, possible hazardous wastes (as for example paint wastes, oily
rags, etc.) in all cases shall be collected, stored on a temporary basis and disposed
by the contractor.
11/2.3 Changes takdng place in the environmental elements
Air quality
During the construction works we have to count with a temporary dust load of the
environment due to the removal of the vegetation, the foundation work and other
earthworks. The air pollution by the exhaust smoke of the machines shall not be
significant due to the distance of the construction site from the residential area
(the closest dwelling house is at a distance of 600 m).

The pollution of the access roads of the site means a secondary pollution (the
vehicles passing through the area shall disturb the clay-mud-sand mixture on the
road from time to time), but this shall affect only the immediate vicinity of the
roads, the pollution shall decrease parallel with the distance from the construction
site. The air pollution by the exhaust smoke of the increased road traffic shall not
be significant compared with the current pollution load of the heavy traffic roads
in the area. Thus the traffic associated with the construction shall not have a
significant impact on the air quality of the area.
Soil quality and subsurface waters
The impacts of the construction works shall be manifest only in the plant site.
Since the plant site shall already be excluded from agricultural cultivation by the
time of the construction works, so-called "green damages" (treading underfoot)
during construction may not be expected. The excavated topsoil shall be stocpiled
separately and shall be backfilled after the construction, and care shall be taken,
that a humic layer shall be at the top, where it is needed.
The soil shall only be affected by physical impacts (for example compaction),
chemical impacts may not occur if technological discipline shall be respected.
The building company shall be obliged to prevent the spill of any chemicals (on
the ground), or - in case of a possible contamination - to remediate the soil;
furthermore to remove any offal from the site when demobilizing. Soil
contanination shall be prevented by full compliance with the water protection
and waste management regulations.
Subsurface waters could only be contaminated through the soil, which may not
take place with regard to the above.
Surface waters
Since there are no surface waters in the work site and its immediate vicinity,
during the construction works we do not have to count with pernicious
environmental impacts affecting surface waters.
59



ETV-ER6TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
Communal waste waters shall be collected in closed containers and shall be
transported for disposal by licensed contractors, thus no waste water shall be
discharged into the environment.
Noise load of the environment in the construction period
The construction, resp. building or demolition works are not performed on a
permnanent basis, it is an activity which shall be completed within a shorter or
longer period of time. For this reason, the permissible noise level values are
higher for such works than those prescribed for the time of operation based on
regional categories. During construction the following activities (increasing the
noise load) shall be canied out:
Transportation of materials and equipment necessary for the construction,
-noise of the construction and the assembly,
transportation of the wastes and debris generating during construction.
The permissible noise load limit values originating from the construction work
have been determined for the investigated site on the basis of Attachment No. 2
of Decree No. 4/1984.(I.23.)EMiM, for a period of time shorter than 1 year (see
Table II/2.3-1).
Table Hl/23.-I - Permissible noise load limit values originating from the
construuction work
Function of the area           Day, dB(A)    Night, dB(A)
Residential and administrative
area of low building density       60              45
The construction works shall be performed in day time, in the open air.
Considering the relevant regional categories and the distance of the dwelling
houses to be protected from the site of construction (the closest dwelling houses
to be protected are at a distance of 600 m from the site), respectively the 60
dB(A) day-time noise load limit value, excess noise load values are not expected
at the dwelling houses to be protected.
The transportation of the generating wastes from the site and the transportation of
the materials and equipment required for the construction shall be by road. Based
on
60



E1V-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineenng and
Contractor Co.
previous estimation appmx. 900 heavy truck tum-rounds shall be required for the
transportation of the various materials and equipment. Since this shall be
performed expectedly within a period of time shorter than 1 year, at least 6-8
truck tum-rounds per day (in day time) can be taken into consideration.
The equivalent noise level calculated from the traffic data can be determined by
calculation on the basis of Section Ml.1 of the Hungarian Standard
Specifications MSZ-13-183-1 (counting with a velocity of 50 km/h in the
residential area). 8 truck turn-rounds/day in the given route means the passing of
16 heavy trucks (8-8 in each direction). The reference time is 16 hours, i.e. on the
average, 1 heavy truck shall pass in each hour. The calculation with the formula
of the standard specifications (for heavy trucks) shall result, that the
transportation activity in itself shall produce 51.6 dB(A) equivalent sound
pressure level A at a distance of 7.5 m from the centre line of the road.
Cunrently the average equivalent sound pressure level A on the projected
transportation road (main road No. 72) is 60 dB(A) (i.e. it is equivalent to the
guiding value), and thus the resultant of the two sound pressure levels is 60.6
dB(A). Consequently, the transportation activity during the construction works
may cause an excess of 0.6 dB(A), which is negligible.
Impact of the construction on the flora and fauna
The projected site currently is under agricultural cultivation, thus no values can
be found in the area from the point of view of the flora and fauna. The
construction and assembly works shall not disturb natual habitats.
Air pollution and noise increasing during the construction/assembly works and
the associated transportations shall have no unfavorable impact on the flora and
fauna, partly because they shall not be significant, partly because only a few
species could find their home in the vicinity of the transportation roads due to the
strong antropogenic effect

Human impacts of the construction
Human impacts of the construction activity can be air pollution and noise. The
construction shall result in a smaller dust pollution, however, due to the distance
of the residential area from the site, this shall not cause measurable changes in the
air quality. The impact of transportations on air pollution shall not be significant
with respect to the current load of the roads with heavy traffic.
During the construction/assembly and the associated tansportation activities the
noise load shall expectedly higher in the day time, but it shall not be over the
limit values due to the distance of the dwelling houses from the site.

113 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE OPERATION
1113.1 Air pollution and air quality
11/3.1.1 Expected airborne emissions and their qualification
The expected airborne emissions of the power plant have been described in
Section 11/i. In Table IIf3.1.1.-i the emissions are compared with the
prescriptions of decree No. 4/1986.(VI.2.)OKTH, respectively with the expected
(and thus projected) technological emission limit values. Comparing the expected
maximum airborne emissions with the two emission limit values it is clearly
shown, that the emission are below the pemiissible concentrations.

I1.3.1.2 Deternination of the height of the stack
Determination of the height of the stack on the basis of the emission limit values
Based on hourly emissions we have determined the height of the stack required
according to regulations (decree 21/1986.(VI.2.)MT, 4/1986.(VI.2.)OKTH, and
Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 21854). The height of the stack shall
always be determined on the basis of the expected volume of the dominating
(most critical) pollutant. In our case the dominant pollutant is NOx.
The current air quality limit values for the site, respectively for the block to be
built are shown in Table 11/3.1.2.-4. The plant belongs to Protection category 1,
therefore, these limit values should be taken into consideration when determining
the height of the stack.

The regional emission limit value of the point source has been determined with
the following formula:
En = Ef*Kl 'K2
where:
En   is the regional emission limit value of the point source
K1   is the permissible air quality limit value of the given pollutant for 24
hours, in 1ig/m3
K2   is the official regulatory value
Ef   is the emission factor depending on the height of the stack and the number
of emission points:
Ef.i
Ef= __
n
where:
Ef.j is the regulatory value prescribed in the Decree
n    is the number of point sources
Based on the above data it can be checked, whether the projected stack meets the
official requirements. The applied height of the stack is 51 m. In this case the
permissible S02 and NOx emission shall be:
In case of the 2-stack version
Ef.i 2.0
n    2
Ef   1.0
En = 1.0 x 150 x 0.0  75 kg/h
In case of one single stack
Efi  2.0
n     I
Ef   2.0
En=2.0x 150 x0.50 = 150 kg/h
The NOx emission of the power plant (max. 149 kg/h resp. 74 kg/h) is lower than
the regional emission limit value, thus the applied height of the stack - 51 m -
meets the requirements.

The height of the stack determined in the present study differs from that of the
preliminary enviromnental impact study, since on the basis of the informative
proposals and the previous discussions with the potential suppliers it has become
clear, that, thanks to the technical development, there exist quick-start gas
turbines the NOx emission of which is significantly lower than before.
Comparing the expected S02 emissions with the regional emission limit values
belonging to the required stack heights we get a result, according to which the
quantity of S02 is 51% of the limit value.
Controlling stack height determined from the emission limit values on the basis
of air qualitv limit values
For controlling the 51 m stack height determined in the above, respectively for
determining the required basic data for the estimation of the expected air quality,
we have made propagation calculations for the environment of the power plant
For the calculations we have used the computer program developed by the
Environmental Office of ETV-EROTERV Rt.
The above program works on the basis of the methods specified in the following
Hungarian Standard Specifications:
MSZ  21457/4-80  - Transmission  parameters of air pollutants.
Determination of the measure of turbulent dispersion.
MSZ 21459/1-81 - DeteImination of the anmission of air pollutants.
Calculation of the pollution impact of the point sources.

Determination of the effective height of the emission.

During the calculation of propagation - as a result of the experience of the
preliminary environmental impact study and updating of data - we have
calculated 30-minute concentrations of nitrogen-oxides, sulfur-dioxide and
carbon-monoxide (under the axis of the smoke plume) within 20 km distance
from the plant. We have not calculated daily (24 h) and yearly immissions, since
-    due to the short and fluctuating daily respectively yearly operation times
(10 startings/year in average, 2-hour operation time per starting) the
calculated average values shall not be characteristic;
-      ithe calculated 30-ninute maximum imniissions are lower than the 24-hour
healthy limit values (for NOX: 150, resp. 70 ,ug/cu.m in the areas of
outstanding protection category) reduced by the basic load, and even than
the yearly limit value (100 gg/cu.m) for areas of protection category I,
reduced by the basic load.
We have not dealt with solid particles as air pollutants, since solid particles are
not characteristic to the emissions of gas turbines.
During the calculations we have examined the following basic situations in case
of 51 m stack height:
1.   2-stack version, various pollutants

The results of the investigations are shown in Tables IU3.1.2.-, -2, -3, -4. Based
on Figs. 11V3.1.2.-I and E113.1.2.-3 it can be stated, that, in all cases, the dominant
pollutant is NO,.
Comparing Figures Il/3.1.2.-i and II13.1.2.-3, respectively EV13.1.2.-2 and
II/3.1.2.-4 it can be stated, that the emissions of the 2-stack version are the double
of the single-stack version and the maximnu values appear closer to the emission
source. This phenomenon can be attributed to the height difference of the stacks.
The actual height of the stack is the height of the level, where the axis of the
smoke plume leaving the stack becomes horizontal, its value is the sum of the
additional and the built heights of the stack. The additional stack height is the
height of the smoke plume over the stack following discharging. The additional
stack height depends on the thernal and kinetic energy of the flue gas, as well as
on the meteorological conditions in the ascent domain of the smoke plume
As a result of the interaction of the ambient air, the flue gas emitting from the
stack shall gradually loose its energy. The time of this process depends (in
addition to the parameters of the ambient air) on the mass and the temperature of
the smoke plume (thermal energy) and on the speed of the emission (Icinetic
energy).
In the case of the projected gas turbine power plant - two-stack version - the same
volume of the flue gas shall be emitted by two stacks, and the two smoke plumes
shall not mix up with each other. Thus the total energy of the specific parts shall
only be the half of that of the single-stack version. Consequently, the additional
height of the stacks shall be lower than that of the smoke plume of the single-
stack version.

In case of the projected power plant, the additional stack height originates mainly
from the buoyancy resulting from the difference between the temperature of the
ambient air and that of the emitting flue gas. The ascending effect originating
from the kinetic energy of the flue gas is significantly smaller. Therefore, a
possible rise of the emission speed shall not mean a significant rise of the
additional stack height, at the same time, it shall have a negative influence on the
efficiency of the power plant.
Based on the analytical results of the 2-stack version of greater pollution, we can
state the following (see Fig. EU13.1.2.-2):  According to the propagation
calculations, maximum  concentrations appear within the most unfavorable
meteorological concentrations (S = 7, v = 6 m/s - frequency is less than 1%) at a
distance of approx. 1300 m from the source. In case of NOx the concentration is
12% of the 30-minute limit values for the areas of protection category 1 (200 t
g/cu.m), i.e. 25 p.glcu.m.
Within the most frequent meteorological conditions (S = 6, v = 3 m/s - frequency:
13%) the maximum concentration appears at a distance of approx. 7 km from the
source, its value is 7% of the limit value, i.e. 14 g/cu.m.
Based on the above results it can be stated (see Table II/3.13.-1) that the
immissions o the power plant are below the permissible concentrations (limit
value reduced by the basic load), and thus the 51 m stack height is satisfactory
from the point of view of immission.
Determination of the stack height on the basis of the immission limit values
The result received during the control of the 51 m stack height (there is a
significant difference between the actual immissions and the limit values) draws
the attention to the fact, that the immissions do not justify the construction of 51
m high stacks. Therefore, in the following, we shall examine the inmmissions in
case of lower stack heights. During the investigation we search for the height at
which the standard air quality values determined for the environment of the plant
shall be met in all cases (i..e. we shall not permit even short-time excess, which
can be tolerated according to the Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ 21854-
1990).

The calculation method is based on propagation models using the meteorological
data base of the region, according to MSZ 21457/4-80, as well as according to
Sheet 5-85 of MSZ 21459/1-81, calculating with various stack heights. Based on
these calculations, the stack should have a height, at which the 30-minute
maximum concentration shall never be over the limit value corrected according to
the basic load (taking into consideration, that a part of the investigation area is of
outstanding protection category).
During calculations, in order to eliminate the impacts of mechanical turbulence
generated by the facilities, we calculated with a stack height higher at least by 2.5
times than the buildings in the surrounding, i.e. we have taken 40 m as a starting
data, as the minimum acceptable stack height. At this height, in case of the
highest pollution, taking into consideration the 2-stack version and various
meteorological conditions, the result of the calculation shall be, that there shall be
no excess values in case of the stack height of 40 m (see Fig. lI/3.1.2.-5).
The explanation of the difference between the calculation of the stack height on
the basis of the immission limit values and the calculation on the basis of the
emission limit values can be, that the current Hungarian regulations for the
protection of the air quality do not take into consideration the physical
characteristics of the exhausted flue gas. In our case, the mass flow of the
discharge flue gas is 2.5-3-times more than that of a traditional boiler firing the
same quantity of fueeL and its temperature is about 500°C (while the flue gases
discharged by a traditional equipment are of a temperature of 100-200°C).
Accordingly, there are numerous stack heights (according to the propagation
calculation, in our case, in case of a 2-stack version, within normal operational
conditions Ah = 185 m, while in case of the single stack version Ah = 259 m),
which have the same impact from the point of view of the propagation of the
airbome emissions.
Comparing the results of the calculations for the two different stack heights,
within the most unfavorable meteorological conditions (S = 7, v = 6 m/s), it can
be stated, that, at a stack height of 40 m, the immission value is higher by about
10% than at a stack height of 51 m, while it is significantly below the limit values
(see Fig. 11/3.1.2.-6).

11/3.1.3 Changes of the air quality in the impact area
Operational impacts on air guality
From the point of view of air quality, a circle of a radius of 5 km around the
stack is considered as the impact area of the power plant, since in this area,
according to the presented propagation calculation, the maximum 30-minute NOx
concentration remains below 10% of the air quality limit value in the areas of
Protection category 1, within all meteorological conditions. In the areas of
Outstanding protection category of the impact area (the area between main
road No. 72 and Lake Balaton) immission remains below 20% of the relevant 30-
minute air quality limit value (in case of NOx: 85 pg/cu.m). Over the 5 km
distance inmmission shall firther reduce. Thus, on the basis of the upgraded
calculations, the iInpact area of the power plant has become smaller than a circle
of a radius of 10 kn,. which has been investigated by the Preliminary
environmental impact study. The reason is the significantly lower achievable
nitrogen-oxide emission.
The values calculated with the tansmission model are superposed to the existing
pollution level of the area, i.e. to the background pollution. These summarized
values should be compared with the prescribed air quality limit values.
The expected changes of the air quality in the concerned settlements are shown in
Table I1/3.1.3-1. Based on the data of the table it can be stated, that
Considering the periodical short-time operation, and that the immission
caused by the gas turbine, even if superposed to the basic load, shall remain
below the air quality limit values in any of the setflements, the expected
emissions of the power plant shall not result in a pernicious pollution load to the
environment.
Imnacts of tranrsportations and vehicle traffic
The majority of transportations shall be fuel and demi water transportation by
road. The frequency is, on the average, 24-24 tank trucks of a capacity of 30 cu.m
per year. The time schedule of transportations is irregular, it depends on the
operation time of the gas turbine. The air pollution caused by transportation is
insignificant with respect to the current load of the heavy traffic roads of the
region.

11.3.2 Changes in the soil quality
Soil quality may potentially be affected by the oil manipulations (transportation,
racking, storage and feeding), as well as by the contact with wastes. The normal
operation of the plant - thanks to the applied technical protective solutions - has
no negative impact on the soil.
During the racking and the storage of the oil the applied technical solutions (the
oil resistant concrete tray under the racking equipment, the pipelines and the
fittings; in case of the tanks the protective ring made of reinforced concrete) shall
prevent the oil from spilling to the ground.
In the area of the projected power plant traffic roads shall have a hard cover, and
the pavements shall have a slope towards the catch basins. Liquid materials
running down from the roads, and originating from the raclkng places and the
technological system (rainwater, spilling, leakage, etc.) shall run to the oil
separator, where these materials shall appropriately be treated and cleaned.
The applied technology and the monitoring system shall immediately detect the
leakages of the fuel and lubricating systeme, and shall ensure the corrective
measures without delay, thus minimizing the losses and the possibility of the
environmental damages.
The negative impacts caused by the wastes can be avoided by the full respect of
the relevant rules and regulations.
Soot deposit in surface waters and in the soil, originating from the flue gases
discharged from the stacks, is practically insignificant and thus negligible.

113.3 Changes in the quality of surface and subsurface waters
In the area there is no surface water, water excavation of water discharge.
The communal water demand of the power plant is 0.1 cu.m/day, maximum 1
cu.m per month. The power plant shall be provided with a 450 cu.m fire water
pool, which, according to the Hungarian standard specifications (MSZ 9779/4)
has to be filled with water within 48 hours. This quantity requires a pipeline of
2.6 l/s capacity. These water demands shall be satisfied by a branching from the
drinldng water pipeline supplying the sub-station with water. Demi water,
required for the additional water supply used for the cooling system and, if
required, for the reduction of the NOx emission of the gas turbines, shall be
transported by road, in tank-trucks.
During the provisional stay of the operating staff in the power plant approx. I
cu.m communal waste water may produce per month. It shall be collected in a
closed waste water reservoir and than transported for disposal.
A drain system shall be built for the collection of rainwater. From places where
rainwater can be contaminated with oil (for example the oil racking station)
rainwater shall be discharged to an oil separator. Thus the oil concentration of
rainwater shall be below 2 mg/l. The treated rainwater shall be infiltrated into the
soil.
The most important lake in the area of the projected power plant is Balaton
(Ffizfoi bay). For the water quality of Balaton the power plant shall only have an
impact through its airborne emissions, and, as a consequence, through the
increased immission and acidic deposits. These impacts shall not be significant,
thanks to the few emissions and the short and periodical operation of the plant, as
well as to the great volume of the water of the lake.
The closest water flow is Bendola-creek In the projected power plant no
technological waste water shall generate, the communal waste water shall be
collected in closed containers and transported from the plant for disposal,
rainwater - after treatment - shall be discharged onto the ground in the plant area.
Thus the waste waters of the plant shall not contaminate the creek. The impact of
the airborne emissions of the plant on Bendola-creek shall not be significant,
since, as a result of the actual stack height, both the immission and the deposits
shall be negligible in such a distance from the plant.

ETV-EROTERV Rt.

Thanks to the geological conditions of the area, we need not to count with the
contamination of the subsurface waters, however, the technical solutions serving
for the protection of the soil shall also serve for the protection of die subsurface
waters.
II3.4 Impacts originating from handling and storage of raw materials and
wastes
Raw materials
In the plant site we have to count only with the storage and handling of fuel oil
and demi water as raw materials. The storage and handling of demi water has no
impact on the enviromnent. Demi water shall be transported to the plant by road,
in tank-trucks, and it shall be stored in two 300 cu.m capacity tanks.
Fuel oil shall also be transported by road, in tank-trucks. Two 1000 cu.m capacity
tanks shall be built for the storage of the fuel oil. In connection with the handling
and the storage of the fuel oil, the soil shall be protected with technical solutions
as described in Section EV/3.2. Similarly, technical solutions (isolating cocks, gate
valves, floating roof) shall ensure, that the hydrocarbon emission shall be
insignificant.
Communal wastes
Communal wastes shall consist of the generating organic wastes and the packing
materials of the auxiliary materials. Their volume shall be about 2 cunm per year.
They shall be collected together with the communal wastes of the sub-station.
They shall be transported for disposal by the local company of public hygiene.
Technological wastes
The hazardous wastes generating during the operation of the power plant consist
of various used oils, oily rags, oil absorbents, used storage batteries and filter
elements. The characteristic hazardous wastes and their estimated average
volume per year (based on the data of other power plants) are shown in Table
11/3.4-1.

According to the relevant regulations (decree No. 5611981.(XI.18.)MT and
decree No. 27/1992.(I.30.)Korm modifying the above decree) the hazardous
wastes shall be collected separately, according to sorts, and they shall temporarily
be stored in a special hazardous waste storage place in the plant area. They shall
be disposed by licensed companies specialized for this activity. (Preliminary
discussions have taken place with Nitrok6mia Rt. which issued a declaration of
intent for the incineration of the oily wastes.)
The potential suppliers have been informed, that the use of asbestos-containing
thermal insulation or sealing materials, the halone gases for fire extinguishing,
and halogenated transformer oils are not permitted.
11/3.5 Impacts of noise emission originating from the operation of the plant
The immission limit values for work Dlaces are prescribed by the Hungarian
Standard Specifications MSZ 18151/2-83:
-    the equivalent sound pressure level A of the noise affecting the workers
may not exceed LAeq = 85 dB;
-    the highest sound pressure level A of the noise may not exceed, in any
case, LAI = 125 dB.
76



ETV-ER6TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
The investigation of the noise emission of industrial plants and constructions and
the determination of the noise emission limit values are included in the
Hungarian Standard Specifications MSZ-13-111-85:
The highest permissible noise emission limit value is LKH = 70 dB(A). This
value should be measured on a vertical measuring surface exposed parallel with
the border line of the plant, at a distance of "d" from the border line. d = 10 m.
The noise load caused by the new facility has been investigated at the dwelling
houses located in the concerned area. At the dwelling houses to be protected the
resultant of the noise, originating from the newly installed equipment, the
existing sub-station and the ground noise, may not exceed the currently
permissible noise load limit values. This means, that, at the investigated 5
dwelling houses 40 d13(A) noise load limit value should be met during the night
(see Table 117.5.-1).
The potential suppliers have been informed, that the sound pressure level
measured on the emission surfaces exposed in a distance of 1 m from the
container units to be installed, respectively from the buildings may not exceed 85
dB(A). We have made calculations in order to determine, whether the noise load
limit value can be met at 85 dB(A) noise emission.
When making the calculations, the damping effect of the air, the earth effect,
shielding (the dwelling houses to be protected have a free overlook to the new
plant), the damping effect of the vegetation (the height and the density of the
existing vegetation may not reduce the emitted noise), and the impact of the
meteorological conditions have not been taken into consideration.
The two gas turbines installed close to each other and the two stacks (taking into
consideration, that primarily the top of the stack shall emit noise) can be
considered point sources due to the distance of the dwelling houses to be
protected. The distance from the dwelling houses is the multiple of the largest
sizes of the new facilities. The distance-dependant damping has been calculated
with the following formula:
ALt = 20 lg(rl/r2)
where
ri    600 m (distance of the closest dwelling houses to be protected
from the projected plant)
r2    I m (distance of the emission surface from the equipment)
77



ETV-ERCTERV Rt
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
As a result of the calculation, in the case of the dwelling houses located at a
distance of 600 m from the new facility, the distance-dpendant damping is 55
dB(A).
The sound pressure level at a distance of 2 m from the facade of the dwelling
houses to be protected (taking into consideration a correction of -3 dB due to the
echo, and 4 point sources) is 38.4 dB(A). This means, that the new facilities in
themselves do not exceed the noise load limit value, not even during the night.
Calculating from the measuring data, in the night period the current effective
sound pressure level A at the dwelling houses is 35 dB(A). The sound pressure
level generated by the new facilities shall be superposed to this noise at the given
exposure points. Summarizing the two sound pressure levels at the exposure
points, the resultant shall be 40 dB(A) at the dwelling houses. Based on the
summarized levels, at the dwelling houses there shall be no excess noise load
during the night.
In day time the noise load limit value is higher (50 dB(A) ). The noise emission
of the power plant shall be identical day and night, thus it seems to be clear, that
there shall be no excess noise load during the day either.
In summaTy, it can be stated, that the noise emission of the projected plant shall
increase the noise load of the dwelling houses in the area with respect to the
cunrent values, but no excess noise load is expected neither in day time, nor
during the night.
Noise originating from traffic
For the supply of the consumed fuel - taking into consideration the storage
capacity of the available tank park - we have count with the traffic of at least one
single 40 cu.m capacity tank-truck.
78



ETV-ER1TERV Rt
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
The equivalent noise level has been calculated on the basis of the traffic data, as
follows:
the calculated equivalent sound pressure level A at a distance of d = 7.5 m from
the centre line of the road shall be:
LAeqm = 23.2 +10 Ig Qm + 16.7 Ig vm dB(A)
where:
Qm = 0.125 dB - number of passing heavy truck per hour
vm - 50 km/h - velocity of the truck in the residential area
I truck turn-round/day in the given route means the passing of 2 heavy trucks (1-
1 in each direction). The reference time is 16 hours, i.e. on the average 0,125
heavy truck shall pass in each hour. Calculating with the given formula this
means, that the transportation activity in itself shall produce 42.5 dB(A)
equivalent sound pressure level A at a distance of 7.5 m from the centre line of
the road.
Currently the average equivalent sound pressure level A on the fuel transportation
road is 60 dB(A), and thus the resultant of the two sound pressure levels shall be
60.07 dB(A). Consequently, the transportation of the fuel supply may cause an
increase of 0.07 dB(A) in the noise load, which is negligible.
11.3.6 Microclimatic impacts
Due to the operation of the projected power plant - as a result of the short
operation time (20 hours per year on the average) and the relatively small volume
of flue gases - we do not have to count with detectable changes of the
microclimate.
11/3.7 Ecological prognostics for habitats
This is the flora and the fauna on which the projected power plant may have a
more significant impact through its airbome emission. The impact of the power
plant shall superpose on the impact of the air pollution originating from the
neighboring industrial areas, and cannot be separated from it.
79



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
The changes in the ecological conditions of habitats (biocenoses) can already be
prognosticated on the basis of the available data. Based on the investigations and
the available data only reversible changes can be expected in the impact area.
Their measure depends on the meteorological conditions during operation and on
the species of the vegetation. The reversible change caused by the operation of
the plant is smalL its impact can be compensated by living creatures. No
irreversible change in the flora and fauna can be expected on the basis of the
volume of the emitted pollutants. The correctness of the prognostics can be
controlled by establishing biomonitoring areas. The rectangular control areas
should be marked out in places calculated on the basis of the dominating wind
direction and the atmospheric stability conditions, within the characteristic
vegetation types.
The determining air pollutants are nitrogen-oxides and sulfur-dioxide. With the
help of air humidity these pollutants shall form acid compounds, which shall
affect the parts of the plants above the ground. In the impact area of the plant, the
thin rendzina generating on the limy base rock shall buffer the acid effect, and
thus the changes resulting from getting sour of the soil can be excluded
(appearance of acidophilous vegetation).
The impacts on the animals living in the impact area may occur in two ways:
a)   directly, through the pollutants in the air (NOx, S02, resp. their acid
forms). Depending on the rate of pollution and on the sensitivity of the
species
- the multiplication rate,
- the number of the populations, and
- the diversity of the species in the area
may reduce;

b)   indirectly, through the vegetation. In case of the degradation of the
vegetation and the supersession of some alimentation plant species, even a
part of the phytofaguous species may disappear from the area. The lairs
indispensable for the species may also cease. By the reduction of the
density of alimentation animals, the predator populations may also be
endangered. However, the above described process is excluded by the
reversible nature of the damages which may occur to the vegetation.
Since ecosystems are quite complex systems, it is very difficult to foretell the
impacts resulting from the environmental changes. We have extended our
investigations both to the vegetation and some specific groups of the vertebrate
and invertebrate animals. From among vertebrate animals primarily the species
fixed to a place (or particularly fixed to a place) and their populations are
applicable for making prognostics. The amphibia are exclusively sensitive to
enviromnental pollution, just like reptiles, severl species of which are
bioindicators. From among invertebrate species primarily the insects and the
spiders shall be investigated, ground-beetles indicate well any unfavorable
changes of the biotopes.
In the present stage of the investigations the only thing we can do is, that we
assess the expected location and the flora and fauna of the impact area - primarily
that of the maximum pollution concentration -, and that of Sukori-mountain,
which was proposed as a control area, we estimate the size of the populations, we
select the more valuable species, we determine their position in the ecosystem, in
the food-chai,n and, later on, through the monitoring systm, we can follow with
attention the changes which have taken place. Based on the expected impacts of
the power plant and on our knowledge from literature, in the following we
descnbe the most important habitats and the associated impacts to be expected.

II/3.7.1 Natural and secondary grasses
We consider as natural grasses the open and closed dolomite rock grasses,
secondary grasses are the rock grasses on the sloping steppes (formerly there
have been calciphilous oakwood, rarely karstic scmb forests in their places), and
nitrophilous grass-lands along water flows. It is a large area, the dry grasses
which grow on a shallow soil cannot be used well, but they are valuable from the
point of view of botanical nature protection. From zoological point of view they
are the most valuable biotopes of the impact area. The area has a lot of rare
xerotherxmal insect species. As far as the vertebrate species are concerned, up to
the present two reptile species (speedy and green lizards) and some bird species
living on the soil and in bushes have been found (in a few number). In this type
of habitats only reversible changes can be expected.
11/3.7.2 Natural forests
In the investigated area, all those forests can be considered natural, which have
oakwood species (karstic scrub forest, calciphilous oakwood, sessile Turkey
oakwood and hornbeam oakwood). The economic value of the large-size
calciphilous oakwoods is small, at the same time, they play a significant role in
preserving the soil layer, and many protected plant and animal species live within
the forests. These indigenous communities are stable, the impact of the power
plant on these species shall expectedly be small and it shall possibly be
compensated (reversible) by their self-regulating system.
11/3.7.3 Planted pinewoods
On the naked dolomites primarily black pine, rarely Scotch fir was planted. Black
pine did not live up to the expectations for the afforestation of barren dolomites.
When young, it tolerates well dry conditions, but at the age of 30-40 years its
water demand shall be proportionate to its size, and the dry climate without any
82



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
formation of dew at dawn cannot satisfy this water demand, therefore it becomes
to die. According to literature data, it tolerates well air pollution compared with
other pine species.
Approx. 50% of the black pine plantations on Mogyor6s-hegy are older trees, the
other part consists of young, "brush-dense" plantations. These forests offer a
good home exclusively for birds from among vertebral animals, but especially
those forests, in which there are also other trees and bushes among the pine
woods. The homogenous pine forests were almost free of birds in the period
under investigation, and the small variety of species was especially apparent.
Mainly nightingale, greenfinch and warbler were found.
1I/3.7.4 Lakes, water flows
The most important lake in the area of the projected power plant is Balaton
(F&fdi bay), the closest water flow is Bendola-creek. As it was already
mentioned in Section I13.3, the impact of the power plant on water quality shall
not be significant, thus we do not count with a measurable impact in the
ecological system of waters.
II/3.7.5 Areas under agricultural cultivation (ploughlands)
Based on the findings of the site walks it can be stated, that on the overwhelming
part of the ploughlands mainly crop and rape are cultivated. Crop tolerates well
air pollution. In connection with rape we have no data from literature, but it is
cultivated in large quantities in the surrounding of Papkeszi: according to several
decades' experience it can be cultivated in this area despite of the heavy air
pollution. We do not count with significant impacts with respect to the
agricultural areas, and the possible reversible impacts shall be tolerated by the
cultivated plants.

Il/3.8 Impscts on human health and other human impacts
The power plant shall have an impact on the population through the air pollution
and the increase of the noise load.
Taking into consideration periodical and short-tine operation, as well as the fact,
that the immissions caused by the gas turbine shall remain, in any of the
settlements in the area, below the limit values of public health (as shown in
Section II/3.1), even if they are superposed to the basic load, the expected air
pollution shall not have a negative impact on the health of the population.
The noise emission of the projected power plant shall slightly increase the noise
load of the dwelling houses to be protected in the area with respect to the current
values, but no excess noise load is expected neither in day time, nor during the
night, as it was described in Section II/3.5.
11.3.9 Social-economical impacts
In January and February 1996, in possession of the preliminary building permit of
the Hungarian Energy Office, in cooperation with Ritky and Co. Marketing
Communication Agency, MVM Rt. organized a public information in harmony
with Government Decree No. 146/1992.(XI.4.). On April 22, 1996 a decision has
been issued by the inter-departmental committee in connection with the
information of the public, according to § 3 of the above said Government Decree.
T'he decision included the following:
1. On a preliminary basis, in its session of December 20, 1995 the Committee
was of the opinion, that the concept of the development of a secondary
reserve power plant, within the framework of the development program of
MVM Rt. - as a precondition of joining the Westem-European power system -
is in harmony with the objectives of the Hungarian energy policy and with the
viewpoints of the protection of the environment.
84

2.   The Committee states, that during the preparatory phase of making a
decision on the development the feasibility study and the preliminary
environmental impact study have been prepared. The Hungarian Energy Office
issued a preliminary building permit and, in January 1996 - based on the
approved "program for the information of the public" - MVM Rt started the
information of the great public. The technical public hearing took place in Lit6r,
on February 29, 1996, where the concerned communities could make comments
and proposals.
3.   The Committee, in order to ensure the proper control of the program,
invited -by way of competition - an Expert Organization, which performed the
following tasks based on a contract:
-    they managed the reconciliation of the interests and supervised the
procedure and the correctness of the progran,
-    they cooperated with the PR-agency selected by the investor in the
preparation and the carrying through of the public information, as well as
in the organization and the procedure of the public sessions and public
hearings,
-    they followed with attention the public relation fonrms and events taking
place between the investor and the communities of the concerned region,
they ensured an objective background for the reconciliation of the
interests and they prepared the official report of the technical public
hearing,
-    they prepared a surmary report for the Committee about the realization of
the public information program and the reconciliation of the interests, in
the framework of which they evaluated the documents prepared during the
preparation and the realization of the program,
they made comments on the activity of the PR agency with special regard
to the contents of the "program for the information of the public",
they supervised the PR-documentation prepared during the specific work
phases,
they made proposals supporting the decision-making of the Committee.

Based on the opinions voiced during the public hearing of February 29, 1996 in
Lit6r, on the data of the second follow-up public opinion poll, as well as on the
contents of the summary report of the Expert Organization, the Committee states,
that the concemed population do not refuse the investment project, at the same
time they make certain reservations from environmental point of view. The
majority of the questions referred to the noise level associated with the operation,
the quality of the fuel to be used, the emission of the pollutants, the distance from
their settlement, groundwater contamination, etc. The responses of the
representation of the investor were satisfactory for the most part.
One of the people making more than 40 comments during the technical public
heanng was of the opinion, that the decision on the investment project would be
made by referendum, but nobody else has supported the idea.
The Committee considers satisfactory the public information procedure
connected with the building of the 100 MW capacity gas turbine secondary
reserve power plant of MVM Rt. in Lit6r with the condition, that following the
preparation of a detailed environmental impact study the public should be
informed in every respect.
The Committee - with regard to the great interest of the public - is of the opinion,
that
the investor, during the licensing procedure, should keep on informing the
concemed municipalities about the most important decisions associated
with the projected power plant (for example the selection of the
technology, the fuel material, the final plant site, etc.),
the investor should ensure the access for the municipality to the public
documents in connection with the projected power plant - primarily the
detailed environmental impact study to be prepared -, and for the public
the possibility of inspection of these documents and the possibility to
make comments.
86



ETV-ER6TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
(5 VTER,>Contractor Co.
4.   At the same time, the Committee draw the attention of the investor, the
concerned municipalities and the licensing authorities to the following:
in the tender invitation for the supply of the gas turbine the new limit
values and requirements for the protection of air purity and air quality
should be indicated, which are in harmony with the regulations of the
protection against noise - in relation with the secondary reserve capacity.
These new limit values and requirements shall enter into force within the
framework of the current law on environmental protection,
the concerned municipalities - in harmony with the conmnents made
during the technical public hearing - with the involvement of the
competent environmental regulatory agencies, should initiate, that the
investor takes the responsibility of
ensuring the availability of controllable information about the quantity
(consumption) and quality (for example sulfur content) data of the energy
carriers required for the operation of the secondary reserve capacity,
collecting the oily waste waters generating in the plant in a closed
container, and having an acceptance declaration by a licensed disposal
plant,
building an appropriate monitoring system for controlling the
environmental impacts (air, waters) during operation,
-    the Hungarian Energy Office should prescribe in its license the obligation
of posterior reporting about each staring in order to control the secondary
character of the capacity.
In the opinion of the Committee it would be purposeful, that the investor and the
representatives of the concemned municipalities pursue a direct reconciliation
about the requirements voiced by the local population at the technical public
hearing of February 29, 1996, first of all in order to avoid the increase of the load
to the environment.

Taking into consideration the statements of the summary report of the Expert
Organization, and on the basis of the experiences of the technical public hearing
of February 29, 1996, the Committee is of the opinion, that the public
information process in connection with the projected 100 MW capacity gas
turbine secondary reserve power plant of MVM Rt. in Liter was satisfactory,
and considers the prescribed Commission activity as closed, with the
condition, that, parallel with the preparation of the detailed environmental impact
study, the public should be kept informed - about the details of the protection of
the environment - until the next public hearing on the environmental protection to
take place according to govemment decree No. 86/1993.(V.4.)Korm. modified
with govemment decree No. 6711994.(VA.)Korm.
With regard to the opinion of the Committee, the licensing procedure by the
regulatory agencies and the preparation for the construction of the 100 MW
capacity gas turbine secondary reserve power plant of MVM Rt. in Liter can be
continued.
11.3.10 Impacts on the landscape
The site of the new gas turbine power plant is located in the outskirts of Lit6r, to
NE from the village, in the area surrounded by the roads connecting Veszpr6m
with Balatonf;;zfo- and Veszpr6m with Kirilyszentistvan, in westem direction
from the transformer transportation road and the existing 120/35 kV power
station. The area is accessible from the transformer ransportation road.
The plant shall be built on an agricultural area (following the exclusion of the
area from agricultunal cultivation). The landscape shall not significantly
influenced by the sight of the power plant, since the neighboring sub-station
already gives an industrial character to the area. With regard to the general
appearance of the projected facility, it shall fit to the existing buildings of the
sub-station. The gas turbines shall have an 51 (40) m stack(s). After the
completion of the building works, the area shall be grassed.

11/3.11 Other expected impacts due to average and operational troubles
Due to the applied technological and technical solutions, as well as to the
character of the plant, hazardous materials may enter into the environment only in
case of average.
Such hazardous materials can be the fuel and lubricating materials, as well as the
fire extinguishing materials in case of fire, which can be qualified as case of
average.
Potential sources of danger are in connection pardy with the transportation,
movement, racking of storage of hazardous materials, respectively with the
possible failure of cables, fittings, storage means and tanks.
A case of average may occur as a result of
-    disaster (earthquake, thunderstroke)
-     fire
-    traffic accident
-    technological problem, operational trouble
-    aggressive human action (intentional damaging, terrorist action).
In this section we describe only the possible impacts, the elimination shall be
dealt with in Section II/5.7.
The greatest possible average is fire, during which both the fire and the
extinguishing may result in environmental damages.
89



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineedng and
Contractor Co.
During fire the combustion products (flue gases, smoke, soot, etc.) enter into the
air, where gases shall mix according to the current weather and wind conditions,
while heavier solid particles (soot) after a certain time shall deposit on the soil.
The propagation of the pollution can hardly be determined, since it depends on
the meteorological conditions, the dispersion processes, as well as on the natural
and artificial settling effects (for example water spraying).
A part of the water and the foam material (type: LW ATC FC 600) used for
extinguishing - mixing with the buming material - shall inevitably spread on the
soil, respectively enter into the soil, and, in such a case, it shall contaminate it.
Average - endangering the cleanliness of the soil and the waters - may caused by
operation troubles of the equipment, respectively by the hazardous materials
leaking from injured storage tanks (fuel materials, lubricating matenals). From
this point of view, the most dangerous situation is, when an operation trouble
occurs in the fuel supply system, since in such case of average oil may leak from
the system.
The operational troubles of the fuel supply system may also result in air
pollution, due to the evaporation of the fuel material hydrocarbon emission may
occur.
The environmental impacts of the aggressive human actions cannot be estimated
without knowing the motivations and the intentions.

11A EXPECTED IMPACTS OF DECOMMISSIONING
The projected life time of the power plant is 30 years. After the shut-down of the
plant the equipment shall be disassembled and transported from the site. The
dismounted machine equipment can be recycled (iron scrap). The underground
concrete structures shall remain in place. No waste shall remain on the site.
The expected impacts of decommissioning are similar to those of the construction
period, but somewhat smaller. We have to count primarily with air pollution and
noise caused by dismounting works and transportation.
1I14.1 Changes in subsurface and surface water quality
The power plant - during its normal operation - shall not have any impact on the
quality of subsurface and surface waters, therefore, likely, there shall be no
change in the quality of waters after decommissioning.
In case of a deconmnissioning performed by the contractor with the utmost care to
be expected, no negative impact or contamination may occur to the subsurface
and surface waters of the area.
1114.2 Changes in the soil quality
T*he power plant - during its normal operation - shall not have any impact on soil
quality, therefore, likely, there shall be no change in the quality of soil after
decommissioning.
In case of a decommissioning performed by the contractor with the utmost care to
be expected, no negative impact or contamination may occur to the soil in the
area.

1114.3 Ecological changes
Decommissioning and the cease of air pollution shall have a favorable influence
on the flora and fauna of the region by all means. After decommissioning only
the underground engineering structures shall remain in the site, the hollow
underground structures (fire water tank, cable ducts) shall be filled. In case of a
complete decommissioning, these structures shall not mean "traps" which may
cause damage to the ecology of the region.
II14A Landscape, land use
After decommissioning the area shall be arranged and grassed. The landscape
shall be restored, however, the current use of land (ploughland) can possibly not
be restored.

11/5 DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES
I1/5.1 Protection of the air quality
At the gas turbines, in case of oil firing, the characteristic air pollutants are:
nitrogen-dioxides, sulfur-dioxide, carbon-monoxide and soot.
Carbon-monoxide and soot emission at the gas turbines can be kept below the
emission limit values without special environmental measures.
At the gas turbines two technological solutions can be applied for meeting NOx
emission iimit values:
water injection into the combustion chamber. This shall reduce the
temperature at the places which can be considered critical from the point of
view of nitrogen-dioxide generation. With this solution the amount of the
generating nitrogen-dioxide can significantly be reduced.
an appropriate bumer construction (so-called Dry-low-NOx burners), which
keeps nitrogen-oxide generation on a low level. This solution is currently
used at the gas turbines burning gaseous fuel, but experiments are underway
with oil fired bumers, and such bumers shall expectedly appear on the market
within one or two years.
In the present study we have supposed the application of the water injection method
At the gas turbines the sulfur-dioxide emission limit values can be met by the
proper selection of the fuel material. In the power plant investigated by the present
study the sulfur contents of the fuel material is very low (max. 02%/6), and thus the
emission limit values can be met.
93



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and

11/5.2 Water protection
The generating communal waste water shall be collected and treated in a closed
waste water reservoir, and then transported for disposal.
In the projected plant site - due to its position (in the area there is no water flow) -
surface and subsurface waters could only be contaminated through the soil, and thus
the following measures to be taken for the protection of the soil shall also serve for
the protection of the waters.
11153 Soil protection
The technical solutions (oil-resistant tray at the oil racking station and under the
pipelines and fittings, a reinforced concrete protective ring for the tanks) shall
prevent the oil from spilling onto the soil.
An oil trap shall be built for the collection of oily waters rumning down from the
access road of the racking station, as well as for the collection of the oils spilling at
the gas turbine units. Oily waters shall be cleaned in an oil separator. The oil
concentration of the water discharging from the separator shall not exceed 2 mg/I.
T-he separated oil shall be pumped into a container and then tranwsported for disposal.
Wastes shall be collected separately, according to sorts, and they shall temporarily
be stored in a separate storage place in the plant. They shall be remediated by a
licensed company specialized for this activity.
94



ETV-ER6TERV Rt.

Il/5.4 Noise protection
In the pmjected power plant the noise protection shall be ensured by silencers, by
special sound insulations and by the light-structure casing.
II/5.5 Nature protection
Nature protection shall be ensured by the optimal design of the plant, taking into full
consideration the environmental requirements (selection of the fuel material, water
injection) and by the way of construction.
EU/5.6. Landscape protection
With regard to the general appearance of the projected facility, it shall fit to the
neighboing sub-station. After the completion of the construction of the plant the
area shall be arranged and gassed, the newly planted trees shall intercept the sight
of the plant..
11/5.7 Averages and the plan for their elimination
In order to prevent the pemicious impacts of accidents which may occur during
transportation and on the material movement routes, the traffic roads in the
projected plant area shall have a hard cover, and the pavements slope towards the
catch basin. Liqid materials runnig down from the road and from the racking
station, as well as originating from the technological system (rainwater, spills,
leakages, etc.) shall be collected in the oil separator, where they shall be treated and
cleaned up to a appropriate measure.
The leakages of the fuel material and lubricating material systems shall immediately
be explored by the monitoring system thus making possible to take the necessary
measures without delay, and also to minimize losses and the possibility of causing
95



EIV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
environmental damages. The technical solutions (a concrete tray at the oil racking
station and under the pipelines and the fittings, in case of the tanks a steel protective
ring with a reinforced concrete base) shall prevent oil from spilling onto the ground
in case of operational troubles.
For the case of earthquakes and thunderstrike - tacing into account their frequency
and energy - the prescriptions for designing are included in the national standard
specifications, the compliance of which shall be supervised by the regulatory
authorities tbrough the building permits and the license for use. When dimensioning
the foundations from statical point of view, former seismic activities in the region
are taken into consideration.
The greatest possible case of average which may occur is a fire. The elimination of
such averages and fire protection are prescribed in detail in the relevant official
regulations. Planned fire protection is effective against fire averages..
When extinguishing fire, the fire extinguishing material shall spread on the soil in a
relatively small part of the area, thus the extension of the contamination can easily
be delineated and the contamination can effectively be eliminated. In order to
reduce these damages, after the fire the following steps should be taken as soon as
possible:
- collection and absorption of the spilled hazardous materials and contaminated
water
- assessment of the rate of contamination
clean-up or remediation of the contaminated soil.
The protection against aggressive human actions shall be ensured by applying a
fence around the site and by guarding.
The action plan for the elimination of averages can be prepared on the basis of the
technical prescriptions provided by the suppliers. The action plan shall be prepared
in the knowledge of these technical prescriptions, after the selection of the supplier.

11/6 MAIN UNCERTAINTIES AND MISSING DATA
11/6.1 Designing conditions
The main uncertainties of the designing conditions originate from the fact, that the
type and the supplier of the equipment is not yet selected. The projected power plant
shall be of 100-120 MW capacity. During the analysis of the enviromnental impacts
the highest possible - 120 MW - capacity has been considered effective. Thus the
associated air pollution and noise emissions can be considered as the highest
estimated values, and the actual emissions shall expectedly be lower.
11.6.2 Building uncertainties
The main uncertainties of the building also originate from the fact, that the type and
the supplier has not yet been selected. Therefore, the volume of the
construction/assembly works, the number and the type of the machines and the
tansportation vehicles, as well as the material quantities to be transported have only
been estimated on the basis of earlier experiences.
11/6.3 Current environmental status and impacts
I116.3 Air quality
In connection with the air quality and the air pollution of the projected power plant
there are several uncertainties.
The first uncertainty originates from the fact, that the type of the equipment is not
yet selected, and thus the emission of the equipment has been detennined on the
basis of the data provided by the potential suppliers.
97



ETV-ER6TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
The second uncertainty is connected with the assessment of the state level. The air
quality of the area of the projected power plant has been characterized on the basis
of the measuring results of the National Immission Measuring Network. The
measuring points of the Network have not been located optimally from the point of
view of the power plant under investigation in the present study, they have been
selected from another aspects (investigation of the impacts of the industrial plants
in the region, heavily polluting the area).
The next uncertainty is the limited reliability of the propagation calculation model.
According to experiences, the difference between the calculated values and the
actual immissions can be max. 20%.
II16.3.2 Water quality
The uncertainties associated with water quality appear in the characterization of the
current status. No waste water shall be discharged from the projected power plant,
and thus we do not have to count with an impact on water quality in the area. This
was the reason why we had not performed investigations for determining the quality
of the surface and subsurface waters of the area, we only displayed the existing and
accessible data.
1116.3.3 Soil quality
In the case of soil quality the uncertainty is the lack of data necessary for the
characterization of the current status. Since the projected power plant shall have no
impact on the soil, no investigations have been performed for determining soil
quality in the area or in its surrounding.
98



ETV-E.ROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and

11/6.3.4 Ecological data
The collection and the processing of the ecological data is done on a continuous
basis. The evaluation of these data can take place only after the completion of the
assessment.
The impact of the operating power plant on the flora and the fauna shall be followed
through biomonitoring investigations. Therefore, in the following, we shall deal
with the uncertaintiy factors which can be expected during the biomonitoring
investigations, and their elimination.
The succession of quadratic sample areas: The flora and fauna and the composition
of the species in the biomonitoring quadratic sample areas are dynamically
changing, they develop in a detennined direction in a longer run. However, the
occurring impacts on succession are manifest not only in the quadratic sample areas,
but also in their control areas, and thus they can be interpreted in the course of the
investigations.
Changes im the ecological conditions of the guadratic sample areas: the following
impacts are expected to occur in the quadratic sample areas:
- changing of the use (for example grazing, afforestation, etc.)
- grie.vous disaster (for example natunal or antropogenic fires).
Uncertainty factors can be reduced by an agreement with the owner and by marking
out the quadratic sample areas on an accidental basis.

IIM7. MONITORING SYSTEM
III/7.1 Monitoring during construction
No separate monitoring system shalU be designed for the investigation of the impacts
during the construction - due to the measure of the impacts. At the same time,
during the construction/assembly works, the investor shall supervise the building
company and the other contractors on a continuous basis, and shall follow with
attention the respect of the environmental regulations.
II1.2 Monitoring during operation
Il/7.2.1 Air pollution and air quality
The following characteristic data and components of the flue gas shall be measured
in the stack during operation, on a continuous basis:
- So2,
- NOX,
- solid particles (soot),
- Co,
-   or C02,
- temperature of the flue gas,
- volume flow of the flue gas
The measuring data shall be processed by a computer program registering and
evaluating the data according to the relevant regulations.
Due to the short operating times (20 hours per year, on the average) the building of
a separate inunission measuring system is not justified.

ETV-ER(5TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
11/7.2.2 Investigation of surface and subsurface waters
'he projected power plant, in the course of its normal operation, shall not have an
impact on the surface and subsurface waters, thus there is no need to build a
monitoring system for the investigation of these environmental elements.
11/7.2.3 Investigation of soil contamination
The projected power plant shall not have an impact on the soil either, and thus there
is no need to build a monitoring system for the investigation of the soil.
The operation of the oil trap shall be controlled by sampling the soil and by
analyzing the sample for oil concentration on a monthly basis.
11/7.2.4 Biomonitoring
The decision-making on the necessity of a biomonitoring system, and its design
shall only be possible after the completion of the basic investigations. Due to the
expectedly small impact the quadratic sample areas should be marked out in the
most polluted areas. The quadratic sample areas should include the characteristic
vegetation units of the investigated area:
- open dolomite rock grass
- sloping steppes with rock grass
- calciphilous oakwood
- planted black pinewood.
It is important, that the ecological conditions of the quadratic control areas be
identical or similar - except pollution. Primarily the similar habitats of Sukori-
mountain belonging to Vilonya can be taken into account as control areas.

In the course of the present work we performed the detailed environmental impact
assessment of the projected power plant and we compiled a Detailed Environmental
Impact Study, the main topics of which are summarized in the following, in
harmony with § 13 of Government Decree No. 15211995(XU.12.):
1I/8.1 Introduction
One of the outstanding objectives of the Hungarian energy policy approved by the
National Assenbly is the diversification of the energy sources, and - in view of wire
energy - the extension of the connections. Therefore, in 1991, the Govenmment made
a decision, that the Hungarian energy system joins UCPTE, the association of the
Westem-European electric energy systems, which are on a higher technical level
and which may guarantee a more safe electric energy supply for Hungary.
One of the basic conditions of joining UCPTE is, that the Hungarian electric energy
system should have a quick-action, so-called secondary control reserve capacities of
a size determined by UCPTE recommendations. These reserve capacities should be
equivalent at least to the greatest capacity of the electric energy production unit of
the system. In the Hungarian electric energy system the greatest capacity production
units are the 460 MW blocs of the Nuclear Power Plant of Paks, thus the secondary
control reserve capacity should be of 460 MW.
In the recent years, the Hungarian Power Companies Ltd. (MVM Rt.) has performed
comprehensive investigations for analyzing the most purposeful possibilities of
ensuring the required reserve capacity. Based on the analysis, MVM has come to the
conclusion, that 200 MW of the required reserve capacity should be ensured by
establishing quick-start gas turbine power plants.

1118.2 Description of the facility
IIV8.2.1 Installation
Starting from the role of the secondary control-purpose power plants played in the
electric energy system, MVM Rt. has come to the conclusion, that it would be
purposeful to locate such power plants at the more important junction points of the
electric energy system, close to the large sub-stations of the network.
The 2.4 ha size location of the projected power plant is in the outskirts of Lit6r, in
N-E direction, in the northem part of the area surrounded by the Veszpr6m-
Balatonfiizfwo and Veszpr6m-KiralyszentistvAn roads and the so-called tansformer
transportation roads, in western direction from the existing substation, according to
site plan No. 1123.-1.
In the plant the following equipment and systems shall be installed (see installation
plan No. I/23.-2):
-     gas turbine and auxiliary equipment
-     generator and auxiliary equipment
-     electric equipment of the power plant
-     electric technology of the substation
-     control system
-     environmental monitoring system
-     fuel supply system
-    water supply systems
-     fire protection systems.

IU8.2.2 Description of the operation of the projected gas turbine power plant
It is a basic requirement, that the projected power plant units reach maximum
capacity within 10 minutes after starting by the National Electric Load Distributor
(OVT). It is owing primarily to the aeroderivative gas turbines - transformed from
airplane gear drives for industrial purposes - that the requirement of quick starting
can be met.
Based on statistical data, the expected number of starting shall be minimum 5,
maximum 60. After startng a 2-hour operation time is expected. During this period
of time the defected unit can again be put into operation, or a reserve unit can be
started.
The most probable number of working hours per year shall be: 10 x 2, i.e. 20
hours/year.
The projected power plant shall operate without permanent operating staff.
The decisive technological element of the power plant is the gas turbine, which has
three main parts: the compressor, the combustion chamber and the turbine. The
compressor compresses the suction air to the required pressure for combustion. The
fuel is burnt by special bumers. The turbine is rotated by the expansion of the high
pressure and high temperature flue gas discharging from the combustion chamber.
Electric energy is generated by a generator connected to the turbine.
The generating flue gas is discharged to the open air through a stack. The gas
turbine is mounted with a silencer both at the suction side and at the stack.
The operation scheme and the axonometric view of the gas turbine is shown in Fig.
11/1.-l, while the view and the axonometric picture of the container unit are shown
in Fig. II/1.-2.

During combustion at a high temperature a part of the suction air and the nitrogen-
containing compounds of the fuel form nitrogen oxides. Their amount depends on
the temperature of the flame and on the time of residence of the gases in the
combustion chamber. The rate of nitrogen oxide generation can be kept on a low
level by the proper formation of the combustion chamber, respectively by water
injection. The fuel also contains some sulfir, in a very small quantity (max. 0.2%).
During combustion this forms sulfur dioxide. The carbon monoxide and soot
emission of the newest types of turbines is minimal.
In the present phase of planning neither the number of the required gas turbines has
not been determined, nor the type has not been selected. Based on the received
informal proposals we have selected one from among the possible types for
demonstrating the envirommental imnpacts of the projecte-' power plant, which has
the most unfavorable characteristics from environmental point of view.
The power plant shall have 100-120 MW capacity generated by one or two gas
turbines. The most probable solution shall be a two-block faciiity, but the single-
block version cannot be excluded either. During the investigation of the
environmental impacts the most important difference between the two solutions is
the analysis of the air pollution, since there is a significant difference between them
with respect to immission.
During the investigation of the environmental impacts the highest possible capacity
- 120 MW - shall be considered as a reference. The characteristics of the power
plant associated with this capacity (based on the received informal proposals and the
preliminary discussions with the potential suppliers) are the following:
Capacity:                         120 MW
Efficiency:                       40%
Quantity:                         I or 2
Operation:
Number of startings/year
- average                         10
- maximum                         60
- minimum                         5
Expected operation time of one
single starting                   2 hours

11/8.3 Expected environmental changes and their evaluation
11/8.3.1 Investigation of the environmental impacts and the impact areas
The areas to be investigated for the current environmental status and for the impacts
of the operation of the projected power plant have been selected and presented
separately, according to the environmental elements and the investment phases (see
Table 1/6.-i and Figs. 1/6.-).
11/8.3.2 Current status of the environnent
In summary, based on the available data and the performed noise measurements, the
current environmental status of the projected power plant can be characterized as
follows:
Air quality
According to the measurements of the National Immission Measuring Network the
air quality in the area of Liter shows a favorable picture with respect to the basic
pollutants. The air quality of the neighboring settlements with respect to sulfur-
dioxide and nitrogen-dioxide pollution can be considered satisfactory, while the
settling dust load is objectionable.
Subsurface waters
The most important water resource in the area of the projected power plant is the
karstic water resource stored by the Triassic carbonate deposit constituting the base
rock of Bakony. Based on the analytical results of the water of the karstic wells
close t the site, it can be stated, that the water quality of these wells is "acceptable".
108



ETV-ERITERV Rt.
Power Engineering and

Surface waters
The closest water flow is Bendola-creek, which runs into S6d-Veszpr6m at Vilonya.
No water quality data are available with respect Bendola, the nearest water quality
measuring station is on S6d-Veszpr6m.
Based on the available data it can be stated, that the water quality of S6d-Veszpr6m
is very bad (it is of category V, heavily polluted), especially with respect to the
oxygen and nutrient supply. This significant deterioration of water quality can
clearly attributed to the fact, that along the investigated section there are large
industrial plants, which discharge their waste waters - partly treated, partly without
treatment - into S6d-Veszpr6m.
Noise
According to the results of the measurements performed in April 1996 to asses the
current noise load, the noise emission of the sub-station is below the permissible
noise limit values, both in day time and during the night.
At the dwelling houses, due to the noise load of the heavy-traffic road the ground
noise is higher than the noise load caused by the sub-station, it is over the 50 dB(A)
noise load limit value. During the night the ground noise of the environment is
lower than in day time. The noise load at the investigated dwelling houses was
below the limit value, it was max. 39 dB(A).

II/8.3.3 The construction and its impact on the environment
The building materials and the technological equipment shall be transported to the
site by road. The construction period - approx. 8-10 months - shall be characterized
by an intensive transportation activity, therefore we have to count with the increase
of the road traffic.
Transportation of building materials: in average 100 t/day (i.e. 4-5 trucks/day,
during earthworks and concrete works 6-8 trucks/day). During the construction
period approx. 600-700 cu.m concrete resp. approx. 60 t steel shall arrive to the site.
Concrete shall be tranWorted in mixer trucks.
Technology: main equipment (turbines, generators, transformers - machine parts,
stack parts, tanks) shall be transported pre-assembled, by special trailers. Auxiliary
equipment and machine parts shall be transported by normal tucks with an average
frequency of 2-3 trucks/day during the 2-3 month period of assembly.
Since the plant site shall already be excluded from agricultural cultivation by the
time of the construction works, so-called "green damages" (treading underfoot)
during construction may not be expected. The excavated topsoil shall be stockpiled
separately and shall be backfilled after the construction, and care shall be taken, that
a humic layer shall be at the top, where it is needed.
During the construction and assembly works mobile toilets and bathroom containers
shall be installed on the site based on an agreement with the building company. The
collection and the disposal of the generating waste water shall be the responsibility
of the building company.
110



ETV-ER6TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
The communal waste and the debris which is not qualified as hazardous waste (for
example offal, packing materials, etc.) shall be collected and disposed by the
contractor performing the building and assembly works. According to the relevant
regulations, possible hazardous wastes (as for example paint wastes, oily rags, etc.)
in all cases shall be collected, stored on a temporary basis and disposed by the
contractor.
During the construction and the assembly we have to count primarily with air
pollution and noise, caused by the works and the transportation activity.
Impacts on air quality
During the construction works we have to count with a temporary dust load of the
environment due to the removal of the vegetation, the foundation work and other
earthworks. The air pollution by the exhaust smoke of the machines shall not be
significant due to the distance of the construction site from the residential area (the
closest dwelling house is at a distance of 600 m).
The pollution of the access roads of the site means a secondary pollution (the
vehicles passing through the area shall disturb the clay-mud-sand mixture on the
road from time to time), but this shall affect only the immediate vicinity of the
roads, the pollution shall decrease parallel with the distance from the construction
site. The air pollution by the exhaust smoke of the increased road traffic shall not be
significant compared with the current pollution load of the heavy traffic roads in the
area. Thus the traffic associated with the construction shall not have a significant
impact on the air quality of the area.

Impacts on soil quality and on surface and subsurface waters
Possible soil and water contamination shall be prevented by full compliance with
the water protection and waste management regulations.
Noise load of the environment during the construction of the projected power
plant
During construction we have to count with the following activities (increasing the
noise load):
-    Transportation of materials and equipment necessary for the construction,
-    noise of the construction and the assembly,
-    transportation of the wastes and debris generating during construction.
The construction works shall be performed in day time, in the open air. Considering
the distance of the dwelling houses to be protected from the site of construction (the
closest dwelling houses to be protected are at a distance of 600 m from the site),
excess noise load values are not expected at the dwelling houses to be protected.
Impacts on the flora and fauna
The projected site currently is under agricultural cultivation, thus no values can be
found in the area from the point of view of the flora and fauna. The construction and
assembly works shall not disturb natural habitats.

118.3A Operation and its impacts on the environment
The gas turbine power plant is one of the currently known technologies of electric
energy production processes which causes the least environmental pollution. During
its operation only airbome emissions and noise mean a pollution load to the
environment.
Air quality
Expected emissions of the power plant polluting the air
In Table 11/3.1.1-1 we .zr:npared the expected airborne emissions of the power plant
with the penr.ni%ibie emission limit values according to regulation
4/1986.(VI.2.)OKTH, respectively with the expected technological emission limit
values, known as projected values. By comparing the expected highest airborne
emissions with the limit values we have stated, that the emissions are below the
permissible values.
Changes in the air quality caused by the power plant
From residential point of view the air quality (immission) during operation is more
important than the emissions of the plant., since air quality has an impact both on
humans and the flora and fauna. In addition to the qualitative and quantitative
characteristics of the emitted flue gas, air quality depends on numerous furtier
factors, such as: the height of the stack, the meteorological conditions (wind
velocity and its changes by height, wind direction, changes of the air temperature by
height, etc), the topography and the articulation of the soil surface (plants,
buildings). The correlation between the emissions and the air quality can be
determined by propagation calculation.
113



ETV-ER5TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
We have made propagation calculations according to the standard specifications for
the environment of the power plant, in order to determine the data required for the
estimation of the expected changes in air quality. The propagation of air pollutants
is decisively influenced by the stability of the atmosphere (mixing capability - S)
and win velocity. Therefore, we performed the propagation calculation for the
lability category (S=7) causing the highest concentration close to the soil, and for
the most characteristic, normal stability category (S6). In Hungary, the most
unfavorable air condition (S=7) occurs with a frequency of 6.5%, while the most
characteristic air condition (S=6) occurs with a frequency of 39.8%.
The results of the investigation are shown in Figs. II/3.1.2-1, -2, -3, and 4. In the
figures it is well shown, how much general increase is caused by the power plant in
the concentrations of pollutants at various distances from the stack.
The calculated values shall be added to the existing pollution level - basic load - of
the area. These aggregated values should be compared with the permissible limit
values of air quality. The expected changes in the air quality of the settlements of
the impact area are shown in Table 11/3.13.-1. Based on the data of the table it can
be stated, that, considering the periodical, short-time operation, anc; that the
imission caused by the gas turbine, even if superposed to the basic load, shall
remain below the air quality limit values in any of the settlements, the expected
emissions of the power plant shall not result in a penicious pollution load to the
environment.
Soil quality, quality of surface and subsurface waters
Soil quality may potentially be affected by the oil manipulations (transportation,
racking, storage and feeding), as well as by the contact with wastes. The normal
operation of the plant - thanks to the applied technical pru ective solutions - shall
have no negative impact on the soil.
114



ETV-ER6TERV Rt.
Power Engineering and
Contractor Co.
Thanks to the geological conditions of the area, we need not to count with the
contamination of the subsurface waters, however, the technical solutions serving for
the protection of the soil shall also serve for the protection of the subsurface waters.
In the plant area there are no surface water flow, water extraction or water
discharge. The communal and fire water demand of the plant shall be satisfied by a
branching from the drinking water pipeline supplying the sub-station with water.
Demi water, required for the additional water supply used for the cooling system
and, if required, for the reduction of the NOx emission of the gas turbines, shall be
transported by road, in tank-trucks.
During the provisional stay of the operating staff in the power plant approx. I cu.m
communal waste water may produce per month. It shall be collected in a closed
waste water reservoir and than transported for disposal.
Communal wastes shall consist of the generating organic wastes and the packing
materials of the auxiliary materials. Their volume shall be about 2 cu.m per year.
They shall be collected together with the communal wastes of the sub-station. They
shall be transported for disposal by the local company of public hygiene.
The hazardous wastes generating during the operation of the power plant consist of
various used oils, oily rags, oil absorbents, used storage batteries and filter elements.
Hazardous wastes shall be collected separately, according to sorts, and they shall
temporarily be stored in a special hazardous waste storage place in the plant area.
They shall be disposed by licensed companies specialized for this activity.

Impacts of the noise emission during the operation of the power plant
The potential suppliers have been informed, that the sound pressure level measured
at a distance of 1 m from the container units to be installed, respectively from the
buildings may not exceed 85 dB(A). By this noise emission value we have
determined the noise load caused by the projected power plant. According to
calculations, the noise emission of the power plant shall increase the noise load of
the dwelling houses to be protected with respect to the current noise load, but it shall
not cause excess values neither in day-time nor during the night.
Based on the results of the measurements carried out for the determination of the
basic noise load, it can be stated, that the noise at the dwelling houses located close
to main road No. 72 is currently high due to heavy traffic, higher than the expected
noise load of the operation of the projected power plant.
Impacts on human health in the environment
The enviromnental impacts of the projected power plant - taking into consideration
the basic loads, too - shall remain below the limit values with respect to human
health in any of the settlements of the impact area, thus the operation of the
projected power plant shall not have a pernicious impact on the health of the
residents.
Social-economicas impacts
In January 1996 - based on the approved "Public information program" - the
investors started the information of the great public. Based on the opinions voiced
during the public hearing of February 29, 1996 in Liter, and the data of the second
follow-up public opinion poll it can be stated, that the concerned population do not
refuse the investment project, at the same time, they make certain reservations from
environmental point of view.
116



ETV-EROTERV Rt.
Power Engineering and

With regard to the great interest of the public, the investor, during the licensing
procedure, shall keep informed the concerned municipalities about the most
important decisions associated with the projected power plant (for example the
selection of the technology, the fuel material, the final plant site, etc.) and shall
ensure an access for the municipality to the public documents in connection with the
projected power plant - primarily the detailed environmental impact study to be
prepared -, and for the public the possibility of inspection and making comments.
Impacts on the landscape
The landscape shall not significantly be influenced by the sight of the power plant,
since the neighboring sub-station already gives an industrial character to the area.
With regard to the general appearance of the projected facility, it shall fit to the
existing buildings of the sub-station. The gas turbines shall have an 51 (40) m
stack(s). After the completion of the building works, the area shall be grassed.

1I/8.3.5 Expected impacts of decommissioning
The projected life time of the power plant is 30 years. After the shut-down of the
plant the equipment shall be disassembled and transported from the site. The
dismounted machine equipment can be recycled (iron scrap). The underground
concrete structures shall remain in place. No waste shall remain on the site.
After decommissionmng the area shall be arranged and grassed. The landscape shall
be restored according to the original status, however, the current use of land
(ploughland) can possibly not be restored.
The expected impacts of decommissioning are similar to those of the construction
period, but somewhat smaller. We have to count prnmarily with air pollution and
noise caused by dismounting works and transportation.
During deconmnissioning no negative impact or contaniination may occur to the
waters and the soil of the area.
Decommissioning and the cease of air pollution shall have a favorable influence on
the flora and fauna of the region by all means. After decommissioning only the
underground engineering structures shall remain in the site. In case of a complete
decommissioning these structures shall not mean "traps" which may cause damage
to the ecology of the region.

1118.4 Environmental measures
Protection of air guality
In order to reduce the emission of nitrogen-oxides, water shall be injected into the
combustion chamber of the gas turbine, which shall reduce the temperature at the
critical points from the point of view of NOx generation. This solution may
significantly reduce the volume of the generating nitrogen-oxides.
The limit values of sulfur-dioxide emission can be met by the proper selection of the
fuel material.
Soil and water protection
TIhe generating communal waste water shall be collected and treated in a closed
waste water reservoir, and then transported for disposal.
The technical solutions (oil-resistant tray at the oil racking station and under the
pipelines and fittings, a reinforced concrete protective ring for the tanks) shall
prevent the oil from spilling onto the soil.
An oil trap shall be built for the collection of oily waters running down from the
access road of the racking station, as well as for the collection of the oils spilling at
the gas turbine units. Oily waters shall be cleaned in an oil separator. The oil
concentration of the water discharging from the separator shall not exceed 2 mg/I.
The separated oil shall be pumped into a container and then transported for disposal.

The applied technology and the monitoring system shall immediately detect the
leakages of the fuel and lubricating systems, and shall ensure the corrective
measures without delay, thus minimizing the losses and the possibility of the
environmental damages.
Wastes shall be collected separately, according to sorts, and they shall temporarily
be stored in a separate storage place in the plant. They shall be remediated by a
licensed company specialized for this activity.
