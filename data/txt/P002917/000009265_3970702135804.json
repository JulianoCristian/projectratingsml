Second\n            Power Project is to prevent the development of a bottleneck\n            in power supplies that will hinder economic recovery in the\n            medium term.  The project includes rehabilitation of:  (i)\n            the Owen Falls Power Station; and (ii) the transmission and\n            distribution network. The first component consists of the\n            rehabilitation of ten turbogenerator units and structural\n            repairs to the dam and power house at Owen Falls.  The\n            transmission component consists of the uprating of the\n            transmission lines between Owen Falls and Kampala and the\n            strengthening of the lines between Kampala and Nkenda, and\n            between Tororo and Lira.  (iii) The provision of vehicles,\n            tools and equipment for maintenance and repair services as\n            well as the rehabilitation of UEB's Staff Training\n            Center, operational buildings, staff housing and the\n            implementation of a training study aim to support the first\n            two components.  (iv) The project further includes studies\n            of UEB's tariff structure, level, billing and\n            collection system, and the provision of a computer for UEB.\n            In addition, the venture provides technical assistance which\n            focuses on the new Energy Department, a forest and fuelwood\n            plantation inventory, fuelwood marketing and a household\n            energy survey in major towns of Uganda."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
