the principal amount of the Credit withdrawn and outstanding from
time to time, provided that, in the judgment of the Association,
such revision shall not change the grant element obtained under the
above-mentioned repayment modification.

amounts corresponding to the outstanding amounts of the maturity or
maturities of the IDA Sub-loan so repaid.
