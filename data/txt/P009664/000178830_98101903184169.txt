REPORT ANYD RECOIVfl4ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNVIENT OF INDIA
FOR THE COCHIN II FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$20 million to
India.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Availability of finished fertilizers to India's agricultural
sector has been a subject of continued concern to the Government of India
and to the Association over a number of years. The development of a
domestic fertilizer manufacturing capacity received particular attention
in earlier economic reports and in special staff studies. Fertilizer
availability is one of the essential ingredients to sustained growth of
Indiats agricultural sector, which is in turn vital to the overall growth
of the economy. India has made a considerable effort to increase domestic
fertilizer production capacity: for the period 1964-1970 nitrogen pro-
duction increased three hundred percent and phosphate production seventy
percent.  Nevertheless, even wqith the proposed Cochin II and other planned
projects, the gap between projected demand and domestic production of
fertilizers in India will widen during this decade, and the projected
annual production shortfall for nitrogen and phosphates could reach
800-900,000 tons per year for each.
3.        This credit would be the first Bank loan or Association credit
to provide direct financing of investment in fertilizer manufacturing in
India, although recent Industrial Imports Credits have provided foreign
exchange for imports of raw materials for fertilizer manufacture. IFC
has participated in two fertilizer projects in India (Indian Explosives
in Uttar Pradesh, and Zuari Agrochemicals in Goa).
4.        The beneficiary of the proposed credit, The Fertilisers and
Chemicals, Travancore Limited (FACT), is a public sector enterprise owmed
largely by the Government of India (GOI) with small holdings by the
governments of four south Indian states (Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, 1Nysore
and Tamil Nadu) and private shareholders. This would be the Bank Group's
first project involving a direct investment in a public sector industrial
enterprise in India.
5.        The proposed project would help to finance the extension of
FACT's fertilizer manufacturing facilities. This plan was originally
conceived by FACT as an elemental phosphorus project.   An Association

and carry out a program for improving its accounting and management
information systems. The broad outlines of this program already have
been agreed. In addition, FACT will acquire the services of additional
technical personnel to help in executing the project.
11.       The units of the project will be a phosphoric acid plant, a
sulphuric acid plant, an IPK granulation plant, and the cryolite plant.
The latter offers the additional benefit of recovering fluorine from the
phosphoric acid manufacture and decreasing a potential pollution problem.
FACT Engineering and Design Organisation (FEDO), the planning and engineer-
ing arm of FACT, will be managing contractor for the project.   FACT will
have licensing arrangements with Prayon (Luxembourg) for the phosphoric
acid plant, Chemiebau (Germany) for the sulphuric acid plant and l^Wellman-
Power Gas (United States) for the NPK granulation plant. It is a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit /Section 8.01(d) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement/ that FACT obtain licensing arrangements
satisfactory to the Association. These arrangements, which are already
substantially negotiated, would include the services of personnel needed
to bolster FACT's technical and managerial capabilities.
12.       An interesting aspect of this project is an agreement between
the Association, GOI and FACT on "Critical Path Schedules" for execution
of the project. These provide a specific timetable of 33 months for com-
pletion of the project. /See Sections 1.01(j) and 3.01(d) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement and Section 2.01 of the draft Project Agree-
ment./
13.       The economic benefits of the project derive from savings of
foreign exchange achieved by manufacture, rather than import, of finished
fertilizers. The project will operate on imported sulfur, ammonia,
phosphate rock and potash (urea will be provided by Cochin I), and shows
an economic rate of return of about 1L percent in comparison with assumed
prices of similar grades of fertilizers procured internationally. The
project would realize net annual foreign exchange savings of about US$16
million at normal 90 percent production.
14.       Equipment with a total estimated value of US$15.2 million would
be procured after international competitive bidding with a level of pre-
ference for domestic suppliers of 15 percent; the prevailing customs duty
on such equipment is 27.5 percent. Other equipment with an estimated
total value of US$2.1 million would be procured from Indian suppliers and
would be financed by the Association only to the extent of imported mate-
rials and components; none of these items appear at this time to be
critical to the timely completion of the project. GOI has agreed that
if, during the course of construction, there is a critical delay in
procuring any item locally, FACT will be able to procure the item
promptly from another source under procedures satisfactory to the
Association.



15.       The appraisal report estimates that the total foreign exchange
capital cost, including contingencies and working capital, would be US$
19.6 million on the assumption that about 40 percent of items procured
under international competitive bidding would be supplied from Indian
sources. The proposed credit would be disbursed against: the delivered
cost (net of import duties) of items to be procured through international
competitive bidding (estimated at US$15.2 million); the foreign exchange
cost of imported components and raw materials for equipment reserved for
Indian manufacture (estimated at US$0.5 million); external technical
assistance (US$o.5 million); a percentage of expenditures by FEDO in
local currency for engineering and equipment erection (US$O.5 million);
and the foreign exchange costs of license arrangements (US$1.3 million).
There is an unallocated amount which can be considered equivalent to a
foreign exchange contingency allowance (US$2.0 million). Any unused
portion of this, or savings in other categories, will be reallocated by
the Association to be applied to FEDO's expenditures for engineering and
equipment erection, thereby increasing the percentage of local expendi-
tures to be financed under the credit.
16.       If the foreign exchange contingency allowance is required and
all internationally-bid items are procured externally, then about US$19.5
million of the Association credit would be used to finance expenditures in
foreign exchange. On the other hand, if the foreign exchange contingency
is not required, and if, as the appraisal report estimates, 40 percent of
internationally-bid items are won by Indian firms, then the foreign ex-
change expenditures financed under the credit (including the estimated
foreign exchange cost of internationally-bid items won by Indian suppliers)
would be about US$12.4 million, and the element of financing of local
currency expenditures would be about US$7.6 million.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and FACT,
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section I(d)
of the Articles of Agreement and thetext of the Resolution concerning the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       Three special conditions of effectiveness are included in Sec-
tion 8.01(c), (d) and (e) of the draft Development Credit Agreement. These
include the signature of FACTIs licensing agreements (paragraph 11 above),
renegotiation by GOI and FACT of FACT's arrears in payments on debts due
to GOI, and agreement by Cochin Port Trust to provide FACT with required
terminal facilities.
PART IV - THE ECONOMY
19.       A new economic report - "Economic Situation and Prospects of
India", SA-25a, is being distributed to the Executive Directors this
week. The report describes India's continuing recovery from the drought/
recession era of the mid-1960's, albeit possibly at a slightly slower pace
than in 1969/70. The shortfall of about 14 percent (or about US$245 million)



in actual, as compared with planned, foreign aid disbursements which
occurred during the last two years probably played a part in the reduction
of economic growth in the Indian fiscal year ending March 31, 1971. Net
aid disbursements fell by 35 percent in that year and regardless of the
level of new commitments in 1971/72 a further decline in net aid is like-
ly because of the mounting debt service and the drawdown of the non-project
aid pipeline that has already occurred. Therefore despite the generally
favorable progress of the last two years, India's annual requirements of
aid on concessionary terms will be substantially more than the amount
(about US$740 million) committed in 1970/71, in order to carry out its
Fourth Five-Year Plan which ends in 1973/74 and have a reasonable level
of undisbursed commitments at the start of the Fifth Plan. The report
recommends that well over half of new aid be in the form of fast disburs-
ing program aid, including debt relief, and that this be supplemented by
local cost financing. In these circumstances financing by the Association,
including financing some local expenditures, is fully justified.
PART V - COHPLIANCE NJITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
