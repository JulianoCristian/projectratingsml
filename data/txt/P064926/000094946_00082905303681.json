quality of health\n            facilities, within the health sector reform strategy. The\n            components will: 1) support the review, development, and\n            implementation of policies, which define the funding, and\n            allocation of resources to health services. Technical\n            assistance, capacity building, and extensive consultations\n            with stakeholders, will be implemented, particularly to\n            improve the Department of Health capacity, in the\n            identification, testing, and implementation of mechanisms\n            for health financing, and improve the management of public\n            expenditures for overseas care. Health care legislation and\n            regulation will be strengthened, and support will be\n            provided for communication, and introduction of policies,\n            and legislation; and, 2) support four elements of quality\n            improvement for the Samoa health sector reform: improve\n            facilities planning; improve quality of key infrastructure;\n            develop a health care waste management system; and, provide\n            grants for innovative quality improvement pilots.
