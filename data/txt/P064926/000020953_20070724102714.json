satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            included: 1) Reform is not only a technical matter. The\n            lesson seems to be that sector reform projects could benefit\n            from socio-political analysis of the implications of the\n            proposed reform and formulating a strategy to deal with\n            potential bottlenecks, besides explicitly recognizing the\n            high risk of delay or failure to take necessary decisions on\n            the part of the Government; 2) There is a need to understand\n            better institutional decision making processes. An\n            institutional analysis, which provides an understanding of\n            the way decisions are made within and across Ministries, is\n            essential to ensure that the project is supported not only\n            by champions within the Ministry, but has the backing of all\n            the relevant units within and outside the counterpart agency\n            that will be involved in authorizing or implementing project\n            activities; 3) Focus on having clear and measurable project\n            development objectives: Careful definition of the Project\n            Development Objective and the identification of appropriate\n            indicators that can be collected and which accurately\n            reflect the intended impact are crucial for project\n            evaluation purposes; 4) Coordination of donor inputs can be\n            challenging under a loosely defined mechanism such as a\n            Memorandum of Understanding; 5) Simplify and adapt\n            procurement planning to country context especially in the\n            context of a small country with a few important donors; 6)\n            Sustaining capacity building is imperative. While projects\n            typically support the building of individual capacity and\n            the capacity of units within Ministries to perform, the\n            mainstreaming and sustainability of capacity development\n            continues to pose challenges; and 7 A lesson learned is that\n            even when \"lessons learned\" are rightly identified\n            during project preparation; they can resurface as a risk\n            during project implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
