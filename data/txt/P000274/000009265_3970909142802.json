uncertain, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: agro\n            processing and post-harvest technology research was not\n            included in the first phase of the Bank involvement. Recent\n            analyses of potential agricultural sector development show\n            that the opportunities for added value and growth in the\n            agro processing sub sector may be as important as gains in\n            productivity. Although addition of agro-processing component\n            will complicate projects if more than one research\n            institution is involved, the Bank should not invest in\n            production research without investing simultaneously in\n            post-harvest research. A country with several\n            agro-ecological zones requires substantial decentralization\n            of research and development work. Also, participation by\n            farmers, local governments and community-based organizations\n            is possible only if research programs are not only carried\n            out in the field but also managed there. However, research\n            cannot be decentralized on a meaningful scale without\n            adequate incentives for senior staff to transfer to the\n            field. Particularly with the first project in a sub sector\n            such as agricultural research, the Bank should be prepared\n            to provide adequate funds for project-launching seminars and\n            for specialist services through supervision missions to\n            accelerate the start of the project and get it onto the\n            right track."}, "docdt": "1997-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
