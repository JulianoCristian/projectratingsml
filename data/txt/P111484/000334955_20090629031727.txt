I  IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.                I
  About this Report
         The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
  first, to ensure the integrity of the Banks self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producingthe
  expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
  dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
 the Banks lending operations. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
  innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
  Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
  important lessons. The operations, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger
 evaluation studies.
        A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
  Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by IEGWB. To prepare
  PPARs, IEGWB staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases
 visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with staff of the Bank and the government, other stakeholders,
 and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well
 as examine issues of special interest to broader IEGWB studies.
         Each PPAR is subject to peer review and IEGWB management approval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
 is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then sent to
 the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
 Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

 About the IEGWB Rating System
        The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEGWB are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
 The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following
 is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on the
 IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
        Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
 be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance of objectives, efficacy, and efficiency.
 Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
 development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
 (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be
 achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is
 expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to
 alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings: Highly
 Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
        Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
 expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).Possible ratings: High Significant, Moderate, Negligible to
 Low, Not Evaluable.
        Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
 operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
 transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the
 achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
 Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,
 Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
 quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with cdvenants and agreements, towards the
 achievement of development objectives and sustainability. The rating has two dimensions: government
 performance and implementing agency performance. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
 Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

         This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on two education
projects inAlbania.

         The School Rehabilitationand Capacity BuildingProject (Cr. 2633) was
approved for a credit o f US$9.6 million equivalent on June 23, 1994. The credit closed on
March 3 1,2000 after a one-year extension o f the closing date. The undisbursedbalance
of US$0.38 millionwas canceled.

         The EducationReformProject (Cr. 3343) was approved for a credit o fUS$12
million equivalent inMay 2000. The credit closed on October 31,2004 after a three-
month extension o f the closing date. The undisbursedbalance of US$1.27 million was
canceled.

         The PPAR'was conducted to assess the outcomes o f Bank educationpolicy and
investmentsinan agricultural country that embraced democracy and a free market system
after 45 years o f almost complete isolation. The document i s basedon the following
sources: ImplementationCompletion Reports (ICRs), Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),
Project Appraisal Document (PAD), Development Credit Agreements for the projects,
and project files, particularly the supervisionreports. Also, IEGconsultedthe research
literature, reports on Albania and data on schooling trends. An IEGmission visited
Albania inApril 2008 to interview officials, donors, and beneficiaries, observe
instruction inschools, and collect other pertinent information. Field visits took place in
the southern areas o fthe country, inKruje, and inShkoder. The author thanks the
government officials who receivedthe mission for their extensive cooperation.

        Following standard IEGprocedures, copies o f the draft PPAR were sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. No formal response
was received.

Summary

         This document reviewsthe performance o ftwo projects inAlbania: The School
Rehabilitation and Capacity BuildingProject (Cr. 2633-ALB, approved inFY94) and the
EducationReform Project (Cr. 3343-ALB, approved inFYOO). Overall, these aimed to
rehabilitate dilapidated schools and support institution-building interventions.

        The first project devoted 90 percent o f its resources to school rehabilitation and
the remainder was devoted to capacity buildingofkey sector institutionsto stimulate
efficient use o f fiscal resources and assure quality o f learningoutcomes. Implementation
proved challenging for the government as well as for the Bank. Ultimately, a large
number of school buildings were rehabilitated, although quality was variable. Many
institution-building activities were canceled and others were only partially completed.

        The second project aimed at assisting the Ministry o fEducation and Sciences in
planningand managing the delivery o f educational services and strengthening its
accountability to stakeholders for that delivery. Itdevoted about 59 percent o f its
resources to schools rehabilitation. Construction supervisioncapacity continued to be
limited, but about 22,000 school places were rehabilitated, although numerical targets
were not met. The project improved the delivery o f some services, such as textbooks, but
modifications to the curricular structure started late inthe project.

        Inprinciple, the development objectives ofbothprojectswere highly relevant to
the country's human resource development, but the relevance o fproject designwas
modest. School rehabilitation was greatly needed, but the rationale and timing o f some
management-oriented subobjectives were unclear. Project documents did not show a
clear line o f reasoning that would result intheir fulfillment. Project designs did not
include any plans to stop the dramatic loss o f secondary education enrollments or to
improve learning outcomes. Overall, relevance o f both projects was ratedsubstantial.

        The outcome o fthe SchoolReconstructionand CapacityBuildingProject i s
ratedmoderately unsatisfactory. The project repairedhundreds of schools under
emergency circumstances; but it suffered from questionable financial management and
modest-quality rehabilitation o f schools that created problems for future maintenance.
Riskto development outcome is ratedmoderate due inpart to financial needs created by
poor-quality construction. Bank performance i s rated moderately satisfactory. The project
was supervised diligently, but there was an insufficient rationale for choosing certain
capacity-building activities. Borrower performance i s rated moderately unsatisfactory
due to weak implementation and financial management capacity.

        The outcome o fthe EducationReformProjectis rated moderately satisfactory;
despite difficulties, the government increased its capacity to planfor andmanage
educational services, although accountability to stakeholders remained uncertain. Riskto
development outcome i s rated moderate due to continuingunderfundingof the sector.
Bank and borrower performancewere ratedmoderately satisfactory due to weak financial
management capacity.

  This assessmentprovides a number o f lessons for the education sector:

  Ina country emerging from difficult financial and social circumstances,
  emergency civil works repairs are a necessary and appropriate investment. To
  deal with the lack o f experience and limitedhuman capital available, simple
  project designs are also appropriate (paras. 3.3 and 3.13).

  Curricular structures determine numbers o f teachers, qualifications, textbooks,
  and buildinguse and may thus have long-term effects. Streamlining curricula can
  helpreduce sectoral inefficiency andimprove use of financial resources. The
  Bank should be more proactive inadvising governments about efficient curricular
  structures. (para.5.2).

  Educationprojects often finance management information systems and
  statistically complex learning assessments inexpectations o f helpinggovernment
  officials make informed decisions about the sector. However, decision-makers do
  not necessarily interpret data as expected. It i s important to provide training and
  helpgovernments understand the implications ofthe data that are already
  available before getting more or higher-quality data (para. 3.8).

0 Iftimedright,budgetsupport loansmay encourage governments to take actionin
  implementingreforms, such as obtainingparliamentary approval for laws that are
  important for various sectors. When designing these operations, the Bank must be
  careful to maximize complementarities andto establish feasible monitoring
  mechanisms (para 3.22-3.23).

0 For new Bank clients, objectives and expectations for outputs and outcomes
  should be kept simple and realistic. Intensivesupervision i s required, for which
 the Bank must appropriately assign resources (para 2.1).

    1, Background

 1.1     Albania i s a mountainous, traditionally agricultural country o f about 3.1 million
people with a per capita income o f about US$3,290. About 25 percent o f the citizens live
inpoverty.

 1.2     At the end ofthe Second World War, Albania had an illiteracy rate of 85 percent
and no higher education institutions. The communist regime, which lasted 45 years,
provided many education benefits; it offered preschool to about 56 percent o fthe
children, insisted on female enrollment, and made basic education compulsory (grades 1-
8). To shape the next generation, teachers were obliged to be present in school and to use
classroom time for instruction. Textbooks were available and used by students, although
they offered information that was antiquated and ideologically based. As a result, around
 1985, Albania had a 93 percent literacy rate, universal primary enrollment, and 99
percent survival to grade 5.

 1.3     Inthe late 1980s, the country's plannedcentral economy collapsed dueto
financial and civil rightsproblems. Inthe preceding years the condition o f the school
buildingshad deteriorated, and many were uninhabitable, particularly duringthe cold
winter months. This caused absenteeism and delays among studentsand teachers. This
problem was compoundedby a lack o f demandfor many o f these schools. Duringthe
communist regime and untilabout 1990, 78 percent o f the secondary schools (grades 9-
 12) had been agricultural vocational schools, and only 12 percent were academic
secondary schools. With the establishment o f democracy, people were allowed to migrate
internally and externally, andjob opportunities arose. Then most agricultural schools
closed due to a lack o f demandand funding. The result was a collapse o f secondary
school enrollments, particularly for the very poor (Table 1-1; Annex Table B-1). Inthe
late 1 9 8 0 the average child inAlbania could expect to complete 9.4 years o f school
              ~ ~
compared to 15.4 years for OECD countries.

1.4      As a result ofthese conditions, Albania emergedfrom the communist era with
severe budget shortages relative to needs ineducation, a deterioratingphysicalplant, lack
o f quality assurance mechanisms, lack o f a governance tradition, antiquated school
curricula, and weak ministerial leadership o f the sector. Increased labor productivity
would require a major increase inenrollment rates for secondary and higher education4

2. By 1955 school enrollment was only 13.5 percent of the population, and levels of education were still
low in 1989:22.5 percenthad 0-3 years, 18.8 percent4 years, 31.7 percent7-8 years, 1.8 percent 10years,
and 4.3 percentfor 12 years or more (World Bank 1993,p. 19-20. (On grade 5 survival see UNICEF
2006.) Enrollments intertiary educationhave traditionally beenbelow the average enrollment rate for the
Europe and CentralAsia (ECA) region (6.6 versus 16 percent; Education ReformProject Appraisal
Document (PAD), p. 6).
3 . Around 1993, the government replacedabout400 4-year agricultural schools with 20 2-year schools,
closing the rest (World Bank 1993). Albanian basic education includesgrades 1-8, 9-12 are secondary.

However, Albanian public expenditures ineducation since the early 1990s have
amounted only to about 3 percent o f the per capita GDP, an expenditure level offering
modest prospects for humancapital development and economic stabilitya5Inthe last 20
years, the ability o f the system to provide educational services has greatly improved, and
enrollments are approaching the pre-democracy levels (Table 1-1). This PPAR outlines
the unique challenges faced by the government and the Bank inthis long process.

BANKANDDONOR           SECTOR STRATEGY

1.5       The collapse ofthe Albanian economy ushered indemocracy inmid-1991, andby
1992 the country became highly dependent on donor aid and humanitarian assistance.
The most important external partners were the World Bank,the EuropeanUnion, Soros
Foundation, the EuropeanUnion(EU), and UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund).
Other partnersincluded DFID (UnitedKingdom Department for International
Development), GTZ (Gesellschaft fur Technischen Zusammenarbeit), and various
specialized UnitedNations agencies. Initially, there was limited collaboration, but
eventually the donors dividedsectors and tasks among them. USAID (United States
Agency for International Development) financed health issues and the EuropeanUnion
focused on police andjudiciary reforms but financed some school rehabilitation and
vocational education. GTZ and Swiss Cooperation similarly financed some vocational
training institutions. Until2002, the Soros foundation supported education, partly through
its Albania Education DevelopmentProject o f US$9 million. However, donor assistance
has been piecemeal, and large-scale multidonor projects were not undertaken in
education. The country is trying to align its educational system, with European Union
guidelines inpreparationfor an eventual unionwith the EU, so it has welcomed technical
assistance from bilateral Europeandonors. As the Albanianeconomic situation has
improved,donor resources have decreased.
1.6      Lendingfor education inAlbania started in 1994 (Table 1-2). Two projects have
beencompleted, and a third one i s under implementation.6 The Bank's strategy has
emphasized public-sector policy reforms that were inpart supported by a Public
Administration Reform project. The Ministry o f Education and Sciences (MOES)

6. The ongoing Education Excellence andEquity Project is a sector-wideapproach(SWAP) cofinancedby
the Council of EuropeDevelopmentBank andthe EuropeanInvestmentBank with harmonized procedures.
Every year Ministry of Education and Sciences (MOES) prepares an activity plan, obtains approval from
the three banks, andthenprepares aprocurementplan. The governmentholds meetingswith donorstwice a
year (May and October). Since the donors are not many, they undertakeseparatemissions.

became a pilot incivil service reform efforts inthe 1990s. The Bank has also supported
education policies through three Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) in2002,
2003 and 2004.     'Andthough       Albania i s now a lower-middle income country, it still
receives extensive Bank support. In2008, the Bank had 17 active projects.

  2. Project Objectivesand Implementation

2.1      The Bank hadno prior experience working ina country that hadbeenas isolated
as Albania and there was little guidance on what to finance. The sector work conducted
in 1993 hadhighlighted the shockingly poor conditionofthe schools as themostpressing
issue. Therefore, despite the Bank's growing discomfort with financing civil works, the
first project inAlbania tried to deal with that emergency. Aside from civil works, the
Bank focused on basic education and on the creation o f effective policy-making and
delivery.This was to be achieved through privatizationo f some services,
decentralization, accountability, and statistical information about the educational system.
Curricula and textbooks were to be reformed, but without specific actions to improve
instructional delivery or assure quality o f learning outcomes. For the purpose o f quality
assurance, the latter were to be measured, through sample-based learning assessments
(Table 2-1). Implementation issues are discussed extensively inthe following sections.




7. The Public Administration Project was Cr. 3328 (P069939, FY 2000 for US$8.5 million, outcome
moderatelyunsatisfactory). MOES was apilot ministry. The PRSCs were Cr. 3670 (P069935; 2002), Cr.
3811(P077739; 2003), and Cr. 4006 (P083337; 2004). This instrument is atype of Development Policy
Loan. The funds are disbursedto a country's generalbudget, like tax revenue, and are intendedto help
strengthenpublic financial management and budgeting systems so that the money which flows through the
country systemreaches endusers more efficiently. They are also usedto help resolve complex policy issues
that involve multiple agencies or require higher-order government attention.

RELEVANCE

Overall, the Bank's human development strategy for Albania was relevant to the
country's economic needs and infrastructure conditions inthe 1990s. It remained relevant
as the government became more sophisticated and financially better off and continues to
be relevant given the humandevelopment objectives o fthe most recent Country
Assistance Strategy (Report No. 24189-ALB, 2002). The National Education Strategy
2004-15 for pre-university education duringthe previous government includes inits four
priority areas issues raisedextensively by the donor community and reflected inthe two
projects: (i)   governance reforming and strengtheningmanagement capacity, (ii)
                                -
improving the quality o f the teaching and learning process, (iii)                  sufficiently financing
pre-universityeducation, and (iv) building capacity for human resource development.

2.2       The School Reconstructionproject was carefully designed to be very simple, with
a small number o f specific activities (Table 2-1). However, duringthe Reformproject,

8. The Development Credit Agreements of both projects had objectives that were worded somewhat
differently. For Cr. 2633, "The objectives o f the Project are to assist the Borrower to rehabilitate school
facilities and build institutional capacity to stimulate efficient use o f fiscal resources and assure quality of
learning outcomes." For Cr. 3343, "The objective o f the Project is to assist the Borrower to improve its
education sector and strengthen accountability." This report uses the P A D objectives, because the D C A
objectives were broader and did not easily lead to measurable outcomes.

                                                           5


the Bank overestimated capacity and created a design that was more complex than the
country could handle. Also, there was a disconnect betweenthe objective and the
components (Table 2-1) that made it difficult to determine from the achievement o f the
components and the monitoring indicators whether the objective has been attained. An
additional weakness was the limited comprehension o f curricular functions. The Bank
viewed curricular reform only as a large-scale exercise, overlooking the fact that many
curricular decisions are required for textbook publication. As a result, curricular
activities were not mapped explicitly into the objectives.

2.3       A relevance issue that repeatedly arose duringimplementation and evaluation
referred to secondary education. Bank sectoral strategy inAlbania was not focused
towards either secondary education or vocational education at the time. (Grades 7-8 are
included inthe Albanian upper basic education.) The construction program helped
increase the number o f academic schools for grades 9-12, which rose by 3,400 percent (7
to 239).     However, neither project tried to slow downthe loss insecondary education
enrollments or to prepare former vocational schools to function as general academic
institutions inrural areas. Only inthe third (ongoing) project didincreased secondary
education enrollments finally become an objective. So, while the project was being
executed, secondary education enrollments decreased and students continued to drop out.
Schooling expectancy inAlbania dropped from 11.6 years in 1989 to 9.5 years by 1998, 2
years o f schooling loss ina decade (Annex Table B-l)." It i s likely that the low number
o f schooling years affected the long-term competitiveness o f the Albanian labor market.
An international adult literacy survey showedthat to apply knowledge to solve problems
and thus function effectively inthe modern workplace, individuals needto achieve level
3 (scale 1-5). Achieving this level was associated with having completed upper secondary
education, which many Albanians do not achieve.                   l1


2.4       Increasingthe complexity o f project designs to include secondary education
would not have been wise, given the limited institutional capacity. However, studies
could have beendone with the aim o f understandingbetter how secondary vocational
education was contributing to students' general skills and what could have been done to
strengthenexisting vocational courses o f study.




9. Berryman 2000. Secondary educationwas mentioned with SchoolsRehabilitation Project Staff Appraisal
Report with respect to technical assistance for a curricular framework that was to be financed by a Swiss
grant and achievedthrough interministerial collaboration (SAR, 1994, p. 6, 37; Table A-1). However,
donors and the government were ambivalent regarding the direction to which this subsector should go.
10. According to a2007 Bank PolicyNote these patternscontinued 15 years later. In2000, rates of return
were high for basic education but low for higher secondary education. The 1996Employment and Welfare
Survey (Living StandardsMeasurementSurvey; LSMS)showedthat 35% of students aged 10-14who had
left school did so due to low family income, and 20% due to low perceivededucationalquality.
Enrollments were affectedby frequency of unqualified teachers (22% overall, 33% inlower secondary
schools; Berryman 2000, p. 19). LSMS data showedthat gender and urbanresidencedid not significantly
affect net enrollment rates inbasic education, but commuting time and parents' educationdid (Berryman
2000, p. 84). The 2005 LSMS showedthat the likelihood of enrollment is affected by greater land holdings
of rural families, distrust of local authorities, repetition rates, and higher student-teacherratios.

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

2.5      Boththe Bank andthe government officials were unprepared for the challenges at
hand. The government had looked to the Bank as a source o f funds to carry out
emergency building repairs andwas not initially prepared to deal with capacity building,
quality assurance, accountability, transparency, or governance. It also had limited
capacity to manage the work needed for technical assistance, and it repeatedly cancelled
travel funds for training and consultant use.
2.6      The Bank provided much support through its headquarters and country office
staff. But staff and management did not knowhow to deal with government staff who
knew little o fthe outside world. Project files are replete with concerns about problems,
unexpected changes, non-compliance with various agreements and officials' interest in
private gain. Persons interviewed by the mission expressed concern whether cost
overruns were legitimate. At the end o f the first project, some task managers seriously
advocated against further lending.Duringthe second project, a state audit showed that
about a million US dollars o fthe counterpart funds could not be accounted for, and the
government replaced staff who were insensitive positions.
2.7      As a result o fthe many problems, the projects accomplished little during the first
two years; by mid-termreview, they had disbursedless than expected, only12-15 percent
o f the credit proceeds. Limitedprocurement experience and technical skills along with
highstaffturnover complicatedissues; the PIUinthe first project had only one staff, the
director, until 1998. The project was also affected by civil unrest in 1997. The follow-on
project operated ina smoother political climate and implementedmore activities.


  3. Achievement of the Project Objectives

3.1      This section presents results and evidence regarding efficacy that is the extent to
which project activities and inputsmay have contributed to outputs, outcomes, and
impacts. For greater clarity, the project objectives that have multiple parts have been
disaggregated, though one rating i s given to each objective. To facilitate discussion, the
components o f the Reformproject are presentedina different order (Table 2-1).

SCHOOL REHABILITATION AND CAPACITY BUILDINGPROJECT (CR. 2633)


Objective 1: Accelerate rehabilitationof damagedand dilapidated school facilitiesin
Albania's 37 districts (substantial)

3.2     During 1993, the MOES and its district level buildingsworks unitsundertook an
assessment o f school rehabilitation requirements,with technical assistance from a
Japanese Grant. The study estimated that 60 percent o f the pre-tertiary classrooms
neededrepair or complete replacement. The base cost nationwide was estimated at about
US$SO million. The project financed US$10 million for civil works, which constituted
90 percent o f the credit proceeds, but still corresponded to only 15 percent o fthe needs.
No new buildings were to be financed, merely emergency repairs or replacements. The

                                                      7


Soros Foundation separately financed many civil works, but many unfilledneeds
remained.

3.3       The Bank underestimated the construction risk factors. Sufficient materials could
not be found locally, so they were imported, butthey were often stolen. There were no
construction guidelines for buildings and furniture, so contractors did what they thought
was best. There had beenno market research before, so some contractors were not
qualified to do the work, andthey delivered less than expected. Construction prices rose
above the appraisal amounts without a clear justification. MOES did not have the
capacity to supervise the works and at the insistence o f the Bank hired private architects,
who were also not qualified and who performed poorly. Overall, the construction
program improved conditions inrural areas. However, fewer buildingsthan expected
were rehabilitated (only 157 against 237 planned) and infewer districts (Table A-l).'*
The reduction ingeographic scope was due inpart to mass migrations to urbanareas and
the needto rehabilitate larger schools intowns. By 1998 the number ofrural classrooms
had declined to 59 percent o fthe 1989 number, but the number o f rural schools was
stable for grades 1-8.

3.4       The effort to furnish schools ran into similar problems. Without guidelines, the
furniture constructed was ofvariable quality, butalso consisted o fdesks that cannot be
easily moved into circles for student collaboration (The furniture financed by Soros
Foundation i s modular and therefore has more flexible uses than Bank-financed
furniture.)

3.5       IEG school visits. The IEGmissionvisited schools inTirana, Himara, Saranda,
Kruje, and Shkoder. l3Interviewswith teachers and principals on building conditions
revealed a mixed picture. Insome areas rehabilitation andmaintenance were satisfactory
(Figure 3.1), and schools are painted every year. Inothers maintenance is limited, and
staff often report leaking roofs that then damage the buildinginterior. The poor
workmanship o f the earlier years was evident intiles set directly on concrete that quickly
broke up (Figure 3.2). Some interviewedprincipals regretted the fact that only very basic
repairs had been made, and they had lost the opportunity to make needed changes with
little added cost.




12.Project documents did not discuss environmental safeguardissues for civil works.
13. The schools visited by the IEG mission were: EthnaDuhan (Tirana), 9-year school of Kamza, 9-year
school ofNew Kamza All-grade school of Duka (Vlora, Oricum, Vlore), 9-year school of Himara, No. 1
school inKrujes Tapiz -Komuna Nikei(Kruje),Hajdar Hoxha inLarushk, Ndremjeda school in Shkodra.
This is a convenience sample and is usedfor illustration purposesrather than for ratingthe projects.

Objective 2 (Part 1): Build capacity of the key sector institutions to stimulate
efficient use of fiscal resources (modest)

3.6      The capacity buildingobjective was to aid inthe transition to amarket economy,
but government refusalto fundtechnical assistanceresulted inthe cancellation o fmany
planned activities. Other technical assistance activities were poorly executed, such as the
installation o f a decision software program (Table A-1). Duringthe midterm-review,
capacity building was restricted to three subobjectives: (a) school mapping, (b) quality
assurance (interpreted as training for staff o f the Assessment Center), and (c) converting
the state textbook publishingand distribution enterprise into joint stock companies with
the aim of selling them at a later time. The documents do not describe indetail the
process for activity (c).

3.7      These reduced activities were largely carried out (Table A-1). The school
mapping exercise provided the data needed to identify which schools needed
rehabilitation most urgently. The textbook publishingand distribution companies
received equipment and technical assistance in order to become more competent and
marketable, and they were converted intojoint stock companies. (Duringthe second
project they were sold through means that were not transparent and were effectively
disbanded,as trained staff opened their ownpublishingcompanies.)

3.8      Overall, staff interviewedby the IEGmission believed that government officials
didnot clearly understand the rationale for the institution-building activities that were
financed. The Bank emphasized software and systems rather than demonstrate to the
government why these components were necessary. School mapping, one activity related
to institutional capacity, clearly helped school reconstruction. But ingeneral, the
activities were not clearly aimed at capacity-building to use fiscal resources more
efficiently, andthere i s no evidence that this subobjective was achieved. To the contrary,
activities increased recurrent expenditures for salaries, and arguably may have resulted in
less efficient use of fiscal resources. Staff also expressed concern about the privatization

                                                9


o f the state companies for textbook printingand distribution, for which Bank documents
give very little information. Nevertheless, the accelerated pace (according to project
documents) of privatizationwas partlyjustified by governance concerns o f those in
charge and payments to fictitious entities.

Objective2 (Part 2): Assure quality of learningoutcomes (negligible)

3.9     The Bank's 1990 Education Strategy paper hademphasized learning and
achievement monitoring. However, the project had no activities specifically aimed at
improving learning outcomes (such as making instruction more efficient) or assuring
instructional quality (such as improved supervision). Instead, the ,documents discussed
the needfor Albania to participate ininternational comparisontests and financed
capacity-building for sample-based assessments. The Pedagogical Institute established
an assessment center, and staff received some training through institutional twinningon
developing multiple-choice items for learning assessments. However, staff turnover has
been high, and the initial capacity was not sustained. Also, the government has been
reluctant to allow sample-based testing, so statistically based examinations were not used
untilabout 2005 (See also para3.29 andTable A-2.)

3.10    Likeother countries, Albania hadbeen conducting essay-basedandempirically
graded examinations, and though student grades are imperfect measures o f achievement,
much could have been learned about instructional weaknesses by analyzing grades (see
for example, para. 3.30). Statistically based examinations are needed to manage large
numbersof applicants for few positions or gross injustice inexaminations grading, but
Albania did not have these problems in 1993. Psychometrics is a useful buttechnically
challenging field. It might have been more cost effective for the government to conduct
focused training for a small number o f specialists rather than pay for 10 years salaries to
staff with little training.l4


3.11    The examination center preparedfor Albania's participation inthe 2000 PISA
(Programme for International Student Assessment), which was financed by the Soros
foundation. The country had the lowest score along with the Former Yugoslav Republic
o f Macedonia (FYROM) (Figure 3.3). The comparative outcomes o f Albanian students,
who tendedto be from better off families, created muchconcern. However, no specific
actions were taken to improve performance, such as ensuring inclusion o f all students in
class discussions (para.3.33, Box 3-1) Albania has not participated inanother
international testing event, though it plans to participate inthe 2009 PISA.




14. Worldwide, the Bankhas financed assessmenttests, but countries haverarely usedthe results (Greaney
and Kellaghan2008, Ferrer 2006).

EDUCATION       REFORM PROJECT (CR. 3343)


Objective(Part 1):To assist the Ministryof Educationand Sciences inplanningand
managingthe deliveryof educationalservices (substantial)

3.12     By 2000, the government was better able to deal with the complexities ofdonor-
financed projects, and the Reform project set expectations higher. The Reform project
continued and expanded on the activities o f the first project but ina different
configuration o f objectives and components. Some important policies and activities took
place that strengthened service delivery ineducation (Annex Table A-2). However, other
activities were cancelled, such as a special initiatives subproject of US$2 million. The
government also continued to limit technical assistance financed through lending
proceeds."

School Rehabilitation

3.13     Demographic studies showed that the population would drop (Annex Table B-4),
so the Reform project did not buildnew schools. It continued the rehabilitation work,
with 59 percent o fits disbursementsbeingdevoted to that activity. Buildingstandards
were developed, that have been used insubsequent projects as well. The problems o f the
first project continued, albeit to a smaller extent; the supervising company performed
poorly, and the Ministryo f Education had to assume greater responsibility. Due to delays
and increased unit costs, numerical targets were not met; only 22,000 studentplaces were
rehabilitated, compared to an expected 35,000.

3.14     Maintenance was a core Bank concern, particularly, because the poor quality o f
the rehabilitation would result inlarger expenses later. (Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5)

15. The IEG mission was informed that parliament will not approve projects that have more than 20 percent
o f proposed disbursements intechnical assistance, and efforts are always made to keep technical assistance
costs low.

                                                    11


 Efforts were made to plan for it, and eventually some actions were taken. With increased
 decentralization, municipalities have assumed construction, repair and maintenance
 functions with Ministry guidelines, sometimes through community contributions (such as
 salaries for cleaning staff). However, budgetshave remained limited. The municipalities
receive a lump sum, which they may spend on other activities rather than a dedicated
budgetitemfor this function; therefore, some do a betterjob than others.

Curricular Development

3.15     A large-scale curricular reform and modernizationhadbeen envisaged inthe
sector studies for the sector, but there were concerns about design complexity and the
capacity o f MOEto organize large-scale deliberation process on curriculum priority
setting. This challenge was deferred throughout the 1990s to 2004, and the project
financed few activities for'this task, such as nine days o f training for secondary curricula.
Inthe last year o fthe project, Romanianexperts providedtechnical assistancetowards
larger-scale reform activities, since their country had gone through a similar experience.
Rapid implementation didnot leave time for broader consultations and pilot-testing
duringthe project period, but wide-ranging curricular activities continued into the
ongoing project.


TextbookProvision

3.16    Duringthe reform project, the state publishinganddistribution enterprises were
sold and textbook publishingwas privatized. By 2008, about 24 local companies were
publishingbooks.


16. The development o f a curriculum framework relating general and vocational education as well as
financing implications was to be financed by a Swiss technical assistance grant (Education Reconstruction
Project PAD, 1994, p. 37). Some grant activities took place, but outcomes were not clear. Consultants
interviewed by IEG reported advising the government to create integrated courses with the essential
competencies, but the government was interested inmaintaining an "encyclopedic" knowledge.

                                                    12


3.17    The Reform project financed throughinternational competitive biddingthe
acquisition o f newtextbooks for free distribution to schools that were to be maintained
for three years. This activity was also supported by the policy content and timing o fthe
third PRSC (Cr. 4006 signed in2004). As a result, about 97 percent of students ingrades
1-7 received free textbooks (Annex A-1; rest did not receive the textbooks). Initiallythere
were problems with artificial scarcity and sale o f books at the black market for high
prices, so textbook policies have evolved over time. Since 2006, students must buy the
books personally and two months later receive a subsidy inthe mail; the subsidy amounts
to 70 percent for primary grades and 50 percent for secondary grades. (Inrural areas,
distributors send them to schools directly, or directors may pick them up, give them to
students, and earn the commission that booksellers would otherwise earn.) The well-to-do
are less likely to request the subsidy, so the applicationprocess constitutes a form o f
targeting.

3.18    Textbook provision functioned satisfactorily in2008 according to the many
students, directors, andbooksellers interviewedby the IEGmission. Average prices are
200 leke (about US$2.10) per textbook, but book costs can be significant for families.
(Primary grades have 5-9 textbooks or workbooks, grades 6-12 have 12-14 textbooks).
There is conflicting information regardingprice changes. Some o fthe persons
interviewed believedthat prices had risen inreal terms while others pointed out that the
subsidylowers them. (The 2009 Living Standards Measurement Survey will obtain cost
information from parents.) But all students visited by the IEGmission had all necessary
textbooks and had beenable to obtain them since the first day o f classes. The textbooks
are visually appealing and teachers who were interviewed stated that they are factually
correct.

3.19    Rather than a single official textbook per course, the Bank has promoted a policy
of wide choice inAlbania and elsewhere. The Ministry has established a vetting and
approval process for candidate textbooks that involves ratings by committees o fteachers
(for methodology, subject accuracy, linguistic accuracy). The system works well
according to some persons interviewed by the IEGmission. However, most textbooks are
accepted subject to a ceiling price, and the number o f alternatives i s large. For example,
there may be seven history books for grade 6, from which school teachers must choose.
This meansthat publishersmust print small numbersandtry to generate demand, so book
costs may thus be higher. Some persons interviewedexpressed a concern that some
publishersmay be pressuring certain schools into buyingtheir own. The benefits o f
textbook choice remain unclear, so it would be useful to conduct an evaluation.

3.20    Officials interviewed by the IEGmission believe that textbook availability has
improved school attendance and reduced dropout rates. Infour non-randomly selected
secondary schools o f the Tirana school district, pass rate increased from 53 to 59 percent
among all studentsand from 59 to 66 percent among girls, while dropout decreased from
7.6 to 3.6 percent. Internationalresearch would support the government's conclusion."



17. Education Reform Project, 2006, p. 8 and p. 38 (Borrower's contribution). Researchin other parts of
the world has demonstratedthe effects of textbook and building conditions on learning outcomes (OED
2004).

Policy Design and Management of theSystem

3.21    The project financed various activities aimed at decentralization, some ofwhich
were implemented after its completion, in2005. "Boards o f trustees" were established in
every school. Boards may make some decisions, such as subjects to study inthe
curricular hours devoted to local content, learning standards, and financing needs." Inall
schools visitedby the IEGmission boards had beenestablished, meetings were held
every 2-3 months, and participation was satisfactory. However, the Boards' contributions
thus far have beenunclear. Inquiriesduringthe mission revealed varying levels of
interest by the citizens.

3.22    A key goal ofmanagingthe deliveryof educational services was to rationalize
resource use. Since only about 3.1 percent o f the per capita GDP was devoted to
education, teacher salaries eroded inthe 1990s, and the quality o f the services was
undermined.        For this reason three PRSCs in2002-2004 attempted to increase the
spending on education through conditionalities and policy interventions. The PRSCshave
been successful inpromoting some important policies (for example see section on
textbooks), such as obtaining parliamentary approval for laws that are important for
various sectors. However, the PRSCsmay have had a limited effect on sectoral
expenditures. The effect has been hard to ascertain because verification o f expenditures
has been difficult. Staff who were interviewed reported a limited capacity to monitor
budgetary changes; disbursement conditions are multiple and complex, while the
announced and executed budgetsdiffer.

3.23    The per capita GDP o f Albania has increased rapidly, from US$1,340 in2001 to
US$2,590 in2005 (Annex Table B-1). However, education expenditures as a percentage
o fthe budget showed a small improvement in2001-2004, and as a percentage ofthe per
capita GDP they were reduced (Figure 3.6). Thus, education continues to remain
severely underfunded,particularly at the secondary level and for non-wage recurrent
spending.20One optionwould beto use curriculum revisions as an opportunity to reduce
teacher numbers and rationalize unit costs (Section 5).

Educational Management Information System

3.24      The project aimed to enhance the decision-making skills o fpolicymakers through
data collection and analysis. Several activities took place, such as a data collection and a
query system for administrative and analytical software. It was to link the Ministry with
two pilot districts, but the link did not become functional, and data were not collected or
analyzed. Key documentswere developedonly toward the end o f the project (Annex
Table A-2). Nevertheless, a "report card" with various student statistics was developed
andpublished in2004-2006.2' Though the publication was very useful for donor staff, it
had little demand by citizens, and further editions have beendelayed.

3.25      As inthe previous project, decision-makers continued to be ambivalent regarding
the uses o fthe EMIS. The ICR reports, for example, that duringthe project period, staff
were unsure whether the system shouldcollect student-based information (attendance,
performance) or school-based information. The Bank put more emphasis on software
issues, but the quality o f the technical assistance provided was reported as deficient to the
IEGmission. Consultants could have explained more and demonstrated data use inorder
to convince policymakers o f their utility. Many government staff have become since
convinced o f the utility o fthe information with the passage o f time, but for several years,
the Ministry spent money to collect data that were rarely used for decision-making."

capacity to make sense o f data than by inadequate or inaccurate data. Highperformance was related more
to interpretation than marginal data quality and accuracy. Thus, it may be more efficient to enhance

QualityAssurance

3.26     As with the Reconstructionproject, this subcomponent did not include activities
to ensure quality o f instruction. The 2000 sector study again underlinedthe importance o f
producing fair tests for entrance inthe university, so the project continued to support
training inpsychometric competencies and research design. The examinations department
has taken several years to develop the technical background necessary for conducting
statistically valid and reliable assessments.23 Over time, it has expanded from 5 to 26
staff and i s incharge of administering tests o f various kinds country-wide. Towards the
end o f the project, the activity level increased. Recent tests include the secondary school-
leaving and entrance examination (matura) and preparations for a PISA examination in
2009.

Objective (part 2): Strengthen accountability to stakeholders for that delivery
(modest)

3.27     Fewspecific actions were implemented to fulfill the accountability subobjective.
The activities financed by the project pertained to provision of information, that i s
considered a necessary but only an initial stage o f improving accountability. 24 A
statistical annual was produced o f enrolments and pass rates. Also, some information
kiosks were reported to the IEGmission as having been opened, but their frequency and
utility were unclear. A public expenditure tracking survey was carried out. It found a
lack of transparency inthe use o f funds by district offices, but actions were not taken
duringthe Reformproject.

3.28     Insistence by the donor community on transparency and accountability may have
paid off inthe long run. Some district staff reported to the IEGmission that the central
authorities are now vigilant on how funds are spent and request feedback on performance.
District staff are now empoweredto select new teachers competitively, on the basis o f
their credentials.

DIDLEARNING OUTCOMESIMPROVE DURINGTHE EDUCATION                              REFORMPROJECT?

3.29     Improvement i s uncertain. Few assessments were conducted over the years, so the
project documents show little information regarding learning outcomes. Graduation rates
inbasic and secondary educationare very high, 95-98 percent,               25 and it i s unclear whether
they have improved over time (Table 3-1). Nominally, at least the vast majority o f


23. The ICR ofthe project incorrectly statesthat in 1999 the TIMSS examination was given inAlbania, and
that grade 4 and grade 8 sample based assessment were given (for the latter in2003,2004). IEG was
informed that this was not done during the project period. A grade 4 test was reportedly conductedand a
workshop was held, but the mission couldnot obtain areport.

24. Accountability functions consist ofreporting on progresstoward program goals to key constituent
groups (Newmann et a1 1997,Carnoy and Loeb 2002). The prerequisites for accountability inaprincipal-
agent relationship are delegationoftasks, finance oftasks, performanceof duties, information about
performance, and enforceability (Reinikka and Smith 2004).

3.30           These highpass rates seem to contradict the 2000 PISA results, which show
Albanian students scoring poorly (Figure 3-3). However, the majority of students obtain
barely passing grades (Figure 3.8). Systematic and more rigorous testing conducted in
2004 at the end of grade 8 shows that between a quarter to a third of all studentsreceived
barely passing scores inlanguage and math (Figure 3.7). On average only 34-39 percent
o f the questions were answered correctly inlanguage and mathrespectively. Performance
was particularly poor inlanguage (whereurban-rural disparities are also significant;
Figure 3.9). Students' grades had a similar distribution, but about 5 percent fewer
students would pass if only the test were usedas a criterion. Classroom research
confirmed teachers often give barely passingscores to failing students (Box 3-1). 26

3.32    Gender disparities were also notable, with girls ingeneral performing better than
boys. Inthe anonymously scored regions, 36 percent of the male gthgraders failed in
math compared to 18 percent o f the girls. Inreading only 3 and 5 percent respectively
failed (Figure 3.10). These low scores suggest that some students, particularly boys, lack
sufficient prior knowledge to follow the subject matter o f higher grades and may drop
out. Therefore the low enrollment rates o f secondary educationmay be to some extent
due to low performance inbasic education.

3.33    The IEGmission observed instruction inclasses and intervieweddistrict
inspectors. Inthe schools visited, teachers were present, and inalmost all classrooms
studentswere found to be engaged inlearning tasks. Thus, instructional time was used
well. Furthermore all first graders who were asked to readdid so and knewhow to
decode two months before the end o f the school year, and no second graders were found
who were illiterate. This small convenience sample would suggest that Albanian students
learnbasic skills early on and ought to progress to more complex material. However, the
teaching methods usedmay prevent students from consolidating the information and
connecting it inways leading to complex knowledge. A Bank-financed study showed that
in2006 teachers lectured53.5 percent o fthe time and gave students limitedopportunities
to contemplate the material and encode it appropriately for future                   A UNICEF-
financed study elucidated ingreater detail the issues related to low performance (Box
3-1). The IEGmission observed several instances o f extensive teacher lecturing and
interactiononly with those who volunteered to answer. Insome of the more advanced
grades the involved students were only 2-3,

  4. Ratings

PROJECTOUTCOMES

4.1      The objectives ofthe School Reconstruction project were highly relevant to the
needs o fthe country, particularly the extensive school rehabilitation needed. The
relevance o f the design was substantial. There,was a need for more civil works, so the
resources were allocated correctly and on the issue o f the highest priority. O fthe
capacity-building priorities, the Bank emphasized items o f unclear linkage to efficient use
o f fiscal resources or to learning outcomes. The rationale was less clear for statistically
constructed examinations that requiremuchtechnical sophistication. On the other hand,
no direct investments were planned for sustaining secondary education enrollments or
improvingthe quality of learning at that level.
4.2     The objective o f the Education Reform project (which consists o f multiple
parts) was inprinciple highly relevant to country needs. Design relevance was modest.
Resources were correctly allocated to the priority need for civil works. But the non-
construction activities were peripheral to improved accountability and service delivery
(e.g. instruction and learning outcomes). Furthermore, the wording o f the objective
(Table 2-1) made difficult to determine from the achievement o fthe components and the
monitoring indicators whether the objective has beenattained. For both projects, the
documents (such as the 1993 and 2000 sector studies) failed to demonstrate a chain of

causality and show how accountability or learning outcomes were to be obtained from the
various activities that were chosen for financing.

4.3      For the School Reconstruction project, eficacy i s rated modest (Table A-3). The
project faced serious implementationdifficulties, but it improved school infrastructure. It
also encouraged the ministryto develop some institutional policies, although institutional
development outcomes were limited.Efficiency i s also rated modest. The project suffered
from questionable cost overruns andmodest-quality rehabilitation o f schools that created
problems for the future (para. 2.6). Overall, outcome i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

4.4      For the Education Reform project, eficacy i s rated substantial (Table A-3). A
large number o f schools were rehabilitated, and important education policies were
conceived and partly implemented, such as the decentralization strategy. The policy and
construction activities showed improved government capacity to planand deliver
educational services. However, more could have beendone to rationalize expenditures
through curricular revisions and to strengthen accountability to stakeholder^.^^ EfJiciency
is rated modest. Wastage was reduced incomparison to the first project; design
standards for schools may have helpedkeep costs under control. Textbook prices were
reduced, at least inthe short term. However, questions o f financial management arose,
and the government replaced staff insensitive positions (see para. 2.6). Overall, outcome
i s rated moderately satisfactory.

RISKTODEVELOPMENT             OUTCOME

4.5      Overall, risk to development outcome for bothprojects i s rated moderate. The
underfundingo fthe systemmay underminethe gains that havebeen made upto the end
o f the Education Reform Project. Textbook prices may increase, and the government
may be unable to maintainthe aging buildings. Finally, the degree to which these
investmentswill sustain student performance inthe long runis uncertain. However, the
planning and monitoring capacity o f the government continues to improve, and better use
o f monitoring information i s likely to mitigate risks.

BANKPERFORMANCE

4.6     School Reconstruction Project. Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory;
civil works were correctly identifiedas a priority, but implementation guidelineswere not
provided, and some o fthe activities financed were not o fthe highestpriority. However,
the Bank had a limitedexperience with a country like Albania and a limited choice o f
simple investments to make. Implementationperformance i s ratedsatisfactory. Task
managers spent muchtime and effort to help implement the project and find solutions for
problems with which they were unfamiliar. Overall, Bank performance i s rated
moderately satisfactory.

4.7     Education Reform Project. Quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory, because there
was a limitedcorrespondence betweenobjectives and components, a lack o f measurable

29. An example would be apublic display of financial information on school notice boardsso that all
beneficiariescould see, monitor, and question.

indicators, unclear priorities, and no attention to learning inputs or outcomes.
Implementation i s ratedsatisfactory. The project was diligently supervised,and the Bank
dealt constructively with the many challenges that arose. Overall, Bank performance i s
ratedmoderately satisfactory.

4.8      The donor and government staff interviewed by the IEGmission expressed a high
regard for the Bank's policy orientation and advice. Local staff also provided good
support, which government appreciated. However, sometimes staff usedeconomic jargon
excessively, and government officials found it hard to understand what Bank staff meant.

BORROWER       PERFORMANCE

4.9      Borrower performance is ratedmoderately unsatisfactory for the Reconstruction
project and moderately satisfactory for the Reformproject. The government was weak in
the early 1990s and agreed to a number o fproject components and covenants without a
clear idea o f the outcomes to be obtained. Some activities involving lower-priority items
created recurrent expenditures, such as staff to monitor decision software that remained
unused.

4.10     The performanceo fthe implementingagency is ratedmoderately unsatisfactory
for the Reconstruction project and moderately satisfactory for the Reformproject.
Government weaknesses were reflected inweak project implementation units and staff.
During the execution o f bothprojects the PIU had difficulty supervising civil works, and
many staff and consultants lacked qualifications for the positions they held. Lack o f
experience made it hard to deal with procurement issues and also with the extensive
governance problems that arose. Duringmost o f the first project implementation, the
PIUstaff consisted o f a single person. To staff the unit and stem the turnover, the
salaries that were paid were double the Ministry salaries. This caused some resentment
among Ministry staff, so during the second project, the Ministry o f Finance equalized the
salaries of the PIU and ministrystaff. Through the difficulties o f these two projects,
however, the government learned a great deal and became muchmore capable o f
managing its education system and the follow-on project.

MONITORINGEVALUATIONDESIGN,
                 AND                         IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILIZATION

4.11     The School Reconstructionproject was carried out before monitoring indicators
were required inthe Bank. No systematic means was put inplace for data collection, or
evenfeedback on the condition o frehabilitated schools. Monitoringand evaluation are
rated negligible.

4.12     The monitoring and evaluation function o fthe reform project is also rated
negligible. Although some indicators were developed, they were not easily measurable,
and the project did not have explicit enrollment or learning outcomes. Measuring the
impact of institutional development can be difficult, but project documents show a
limitedeffort. The ImplementationCompletionReport (ICR) ofthe project (p. 18)
mentioned a monitoring and evaluation study, which reportedly showedthat the majority
o f the citizens who were polled were aware o fproject activities and expressed
satisfaction. However, the IEGmission could not locate the study. Some statistical

                                                    21


analyses insubsequent work were conducted through the use o f two Living Standards
Measurement Surveys (LSMS), financed by the Bank in 1996 and 2005. However, no
evidence was found that the information produced inthese analyses was used to improve
implementation.


5. Issues in Sectoral Strategy

FUTURE     CONSIDERATIONSFOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT

5.1      Interviewswith staff and curricular samples reviewed by the IEGmission
revealedthat the new curricula focus on competencies and use insome cases the "spiral"
approach, whereby students are gradually and repeatedly introduced to complex concepts
andthrough various courses.3oHowever, some staffthought that the curricula are still too
academic and subject to political influence inhumanities courses. Subjects are too many,
narrowly defined, and not always essential (e.g. astronomy, philosophy). These issues
result inscheduling conflicts and inefficient use o f teachers.

5.2      The curricular structure determines the number andtypes ofteachers and
textbooks. To improve resource use, the Bank could have emphasized simple curricular
development activities since the first project. There was a needto think inshorter-term
frames and finance fewer courses and more integrated content that use resources
economically. However, project documents show that curricula were viewed as a time-
consumingand complex undertaking, inwhich the Bank had little in~olvement.~~a                     As
result, opportunities were lost to rationalize expenses that have long-term effects such as
number o f courses, textbooks, teacher qualifications, and the rationalization o f
expenditures.In2008 grades 6-12 had 12-14 courses each, every one needing a textbook
and teacher cadre with limitedcrossover. Many teachers are very specialized, e.g.
teaching only geography and civics, and multipleteachers are used ingrades 5-6 which in
many countries are taught by a single teacher. The complexity and multiplicity create
financial pressure. So, despite class size increases and a drop inthe absolute number of
studentssince 1989, student-teacher ratios have remained flat or have dropped; inbasic
educationthe ratio has remained constant at 19 studentsper teacher and in secondary
education it has dropped from 21 to 17.32

5.3      With the advice o f Europeanexperts and the efforts to align with the European
Union,curricular designs and instructionalmethods are becomingmore complex. The
government has received much advice towards making classwork more varied and

30. For spiral curricula see Bruner 1966.
3 1. The 2000 sector study merely promoted the inclusion of learning standards, foreign languages and
"more modern courses" (Berryman 2000). Subsequentlythe ICR recommended"consolidating narrowly
defined subjects and continuing to integratenew pedagogicalmethodsfocusing on skills rather than factual
information" (Education ReformProject ICR, p. 16, 2004).
32. The number of studentsper class in 1990/91was 21inbasic education and 31insecondary, but in
2003104 it was 24 inbasic and 34 insecondary (MOES 2003-2004). Inhigher-income OECD countries
primary-level class size was 22 and secondary 23.6. Student-teacherratios in OECD countries are 15 and
13 respectively (MOES 2003-2004, p. 47, 58, 121)

"active" (see example inFigure 5.1 and Figure 5.2. There are plans to change the current
two-track curriculum (humanities and sciences) to a scheme that includes core curricula,
electives, and special studies (e.g., Greek language for the Greek minority schools, art,
computers, and local content). The wage and non-wage expenses that may arise from
these choices have not beenclearly estimated.

5.4      To teach effectively the textbooks and underlying new curricula teachers should
receive training. Duringthe Reform project, the Pedagogical Institute developed a
training strategy with twinning from a Scottish institution, which i s being implemented
under the current project. Duringthe IEGmission, school directors were beingtrained in
standards and construction o f school plans. A session was observed, which taught
directors to develop measurable indicators that reflect student achievement.

5.5      Unlike most countries, Albanian teachers often get tested on the content o f
training and also get tested before promotion. Those applicants for promotion have high
pass rates; 70 percent had "good" or "very good" performance and only 1.5-3 percent fail
the examinations (Table (2-2). The results suggest that teachers overall meet mastery
criteria for the subjects they teach and the associated methodology.

5.6      Teacher trainers interviewed by the mission expressed preoccupation about how
to teach specific concepts, such as polynomials. However, the highpass rates on
promotion suggest that teachers may need large-scale training not on subject matter but
on classroom management. Research by UNICEF (2006; see Text Box 1) focused on the
causes o f student disengagement and the "hidden dropout" that often precedes actual
dropout. The research suggests that teachers stop interacting with students who are falling
behind; they need training on how to maintain student attention and how to provide
activities that help organize and consolidate the information, so that it can be retrievable
whenneeded. A large coriference was organized by UNICEF in2006 on the causes o f
hiddendropout, andthe Ministryissuedan order to monitor student outcomes. NGOs
like Soros have responded with a methodology called "step by step" (hap pas hapi).

Training modules have been developed, but until2008, MOES had not yet done
extensive training on the techniques o f keeping all studentsinvolved.

THEIMPORTANCE OFEXPLICIT,RESEARCH-BASED                           CHAINS OF CAUSALITY

5.7      TheNational Education Strategy 2004-15 has educational quality improvement as
its maingoal. It i s supported by the ongoing operation, the Educational Excellence and
EquityProject. The objective refers to improved learning conditions, but few activities
are directed at achieving this goal. As with the two completed projects, learning
outcomes are expected to arise from indirect actions aimed at building capacity. Project
designis based on a "holistic and systemic" approach, notably Annual reform Programs
guidedby principles such as: (i)         maximizing support to teachers and school principals;
(ii)increasing opportunities o f good education for all; (iii)           targeting support to the
poorest populations; (iv) recognizing and encouraging local and regional initiatives to
improvethe quality o f schools; and (v) raising efficiency by participatory and transparent
review o f                   However, the P A D shows no line o f reasoning as to how or why
the activities to be financed will meet the above criteria and will build capacity. N o
findings o fpertinent management research were shown nor were lessons learned from
Bank-financedprojects inAlbania and elsewhere.34

5.8      On learning outcomes, the specifics are also sparse. The subobjectives o f the
project specify that "teachers use new methods o f teaching and wider variety o f learning
aids inschools". However, these teaching methods are not defined at all. The monitoring
indicator for new teaching methods and tools actually refers to "number o f schools and
clusters o f schools engaged inschool improvement activities" (PAD p. 30). Also, the
PAD has no specific proposals about how to improve education other than encouraging
local initiatives and does not specify how staff will recognize "good education for all".
There are no references to existing research or to research that could be conducted to find
out. By contrast, the document has muchdetail on economic projections and civil works
(p. 79-85).

5.9      This project designraises the concern that despite muchinvestment, outcomes
may again be unclear or disappointing. However, this can be modified during
implementation. For example, "good education" can be specified through cognitive
science research as efficient learning that maximizes recall o f pertinent information. The
criteria can also be usedto evaluate `modern' activities, which do not always make
efficient use o f time.35 Teacher training could focus on the lessons of studies such as the


33. The objective of EducationExcellence and Equity Project (Cr. 4180) i s improved quality of learning
conditions for all students and increasedenrollment ingeneral secondary education, especially for the poor.
The intermediategoals are that leadership,management and governanceofthe education systemare
improved, teachers use new methods ofteaching and wider variety of learning aids inschools, the quality
of school infrastructure and the efficiency of its use are improved, and the initial steps of higher education
reform are taken (Education Excellence and Equity Project, PAD, 2006, p. 6)
34. The hypothesisthat improved management and capacity building activities will result inimproved
learning outcomeshas producedsome disappointing outcomes in Bank projects, such as the Northeast
Brazil projects (Ln.n.3375,3663,3603) and the BahiaEducational Program(P070827).

"hidden dropout" study and its implications: keeping all studentsengaged inlearning
tasks all the time, ensuring their attention, contemplating the content, reorganizing
memorized information items to answer higher-order questions. School grants could aim
specifically at improving these features, particularly inpoorly performing schools. Many
unanswered questions could be investigatedthrough targeted research (Figure 5.3 and
Figure 5.4). Thus, the experiences o f the completed projects can be usedto improve
future performance.

6. Lessons

6.1      This assessmentprovides a number oflessons for the educationsector:

        Ina country emerging from difficult financial and social circumstances,
         emergency civil works repairs are a necessary and appropriate investment. To
        deal with the lack o f experience and limitedhuman capital available, simple
        project designs are'also appropriate (paras. 3.3 and 3.13)

        Curricular structures determine numberso f teachers, qualifications, textbooks,
        and building use and may thus have long-term effects. Streamlining curricula can
        helpreduce sectoral inefiiciency and improve use of financial resources. The
        Bank should be more proactive inadvising governments about efficient curricular
        structures. (para.5.2).

        Education projects'often finance management information systems and
        statistically complex learning assessments inexpectations o f helping government
        officials make informed decisions about the sector. However, decision-makers do

                                       25


  not necessarily interpret data as expected. It i s important to provide training and
 help governmentsunderstandthe implications ofthe datathat are already
  available before getting more or higher-quality data (para. 3.8).

  Iftimedright, budgetsupport loansmay encouragegovernments to take actionin
  implementingreforms, such as obtaining parliamentary approval for laws that are
  important for various sectors. When designing these operations, the Bank must be
  careful to maximize complementarities andto establish feasible monitoring
  mechanisms(para 3.22-3-23).

0 For new Bank clients, objectives and expectations for outputs and outcomes
  should be kept simple and realistic. Intensive supervision is required, for which
 the Bank must appropriately assignresources(para 2.1).
