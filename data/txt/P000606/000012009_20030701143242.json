unsatisfactory, sustainability unlikely, with modest\n            institutional development impacts. Lessons convey that\n            broadly defined projects allow for flexibility in\n            implementation, particularly important in high risk\n            countries. When economic and political conditions\n            deteriorated, the Bank reoriented the project to focus on\n            legal reform, business support services, and private\n            provision of infrastructure services, and stopped the line\n            of credit. These activities were part of the Bank's\n            Transitional Support Strategy, which had been defined with\n            the Government. However, politically-sensitive reforms\n            require strong government commitment, and are best\n            implemented in the context of a policy-based operation. As\n            the political situation deteriorated, the pace of the reform\n            program decelerated, and difficult reforms, such as\n            divestiture, were delayed, and, a follow-up operation, that\n            would have focused on divestiture of infrastructure\n            enterprises did not materialize. In high risk countries\n            particularly, it would be helpful to have most\n            politically-sensitive measures introduced up-front.\n            Nonetheless, institutional and legal reforms which are\n            principally technical in nature, can be effectively\n            introduced in spite of political problems: implementation of\n            this type of program helps maintain the dialogue with the\n            country. Work on the legal and judicial component, which\n            involved largely technical activities such as compilation,\n            and updating of legislation, was able to proceed,\n            notwithstanding a very difficult political climate. Most\n            importantly, in high risk countries it would be useful to\n            define an exit strategy, since there is an increasing\n            recognition of the need to define such exit strategy in\n            specific projects, to be discussed with Government, which\n            would define triggers that would lead to suspension, and\n            cancellation of the project. However, it is not obvious that\n            a predefined exit strategy would have resulted in a\n            different outcome, in terms of Bank response in this\n            particular project, but it should be useful to identify\n            triggers in future programs."}, "docdt": "2003-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
