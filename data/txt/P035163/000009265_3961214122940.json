           Project is a pilot and demonstration effort that aims to:\n            (1) support and enable private initiative to improve\n            residential energy efficiency; (2) support public initiative\n            in improving energy efficiency in schools; and (3) support\n            the implementation of Government policies to sustain the\n            privatization of housing, enabling increased private\n            initiative in housing maintenance in general. The project\n            will consist of the following three components: (1) credit\n            for residential energy efficiency rehabilitation, with\n            incentives for homeowners to encourage participation; (2)\n            energy efficiency rehabilitation of schools in selected\n            municipalities; and (3) institutional development and\n            strengthening, to be achieved through technical assistance\n            that will: (a) facilitate project implementation, including\n            setting up advisory centers for homeowners and homeowners\n            associations, and (b) support further policy reform in\n            demand side energy use and the energy and housing sectors in general."}, "docdt": "1996-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
