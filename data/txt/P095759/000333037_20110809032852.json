{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third and Fourth Public\n            Administration Reform Development Policy Loan Project for\n            the Kingdom of Morocco were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. A lesson learned\n            included the government following a traditional and cautious\n            reform approach focused on the development of new\n            instruments and their pilot-testing in a growing number of\n            ministries. The reform was pursued without changing the\n            legal and regulatory framework, a part from the reform on\n            internal controls. While limiting risks, this approach has\n            led to a reform fatigue, with many ministries now in a\n            waiting mode. The visibility of the reform needs to be\n            strengthened both within the administration and with members\n            of the public, taxpayers, and users of public services. The\n            time scale for this kind of complex structural reforms (ten\n            years on average) makes it hard to achieve visible results\n            in the short to medium term. The crosscutting and very\n            technical nature of these reforms make it difficult to\n            establish a link with visible government services. It is\n            therefore necessary to increase information and\n            communication on the reform, based on clear short-term\n            results and planned according to the rapid results approach.\n            Giving increased attention to public service provision and\n            providers and strengthening synergies with related reforms,\n            such as the quality of public services approach and the\n            fight against corruption, will increase the reform's\n            visibility and short-term benefits."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
