F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The proposed loan is the second of the second series of programmatic loans designed to
support the implementation of the Government's public administration reform support
program (PARAP) whose objectives are fully shared. The objectives of the series aim at :
(a) improving Government efficiency in the management of budget resources through
greater transparency and accountability, and by introducing performance measurement;
(b) improving government efficiency in the management of human resources through the
preparation of a new management system for staffing and remuneration with performance
measurement, while streamlining current human resources management; (c)




                                                iv
consolidating and controlling public payroll; and (d) improving public services and
simplifying procedures through e-government.

  The proposed loan is complemented and strengthened by an ongoing multiyear
Programmatic Economic Sector Work activity through which the Bank is providing the
Government with advice, training, and technical assistance as required in the areas of
public finance management, civil service reform, and wage bill containment. A new
technical assistance activity has just been approved for the e-government component.
Other donors supporting this program provide complementary technical assistance.

  Support to the public administration reform program is a key component of the new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (FY10-FY13). PARL IV contributes to the
achievement of the first and second CPS pillars: (i) promoting macro-economic stability
and private sector development as an engine of growth and (ii) support to the
improvement in access to, and quality of services. In addition the operation is fully
aligned with the CPS cross cutting theme of enhancing governance.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal economic conditions were favorable, with sustained growth rates and a balanced
macroeconomic policy. The Government was pursuing a structural reform program that aimed at
increasingly diversifying and integrating the Moroccan economy into the global and Euro-Mediterranean
economies, among other things. Over the previous decade, real GDP rose at the rate of 5.1% on average.
Per capita income practically doubled and reached USD 2,800 in 2007. Moreover, the government
continued a proactive trade liberalization and integration policy following the signing of a free trade
agreement with the Unites States (US), the implementation of the Association Agreement with the
European Union (EU), and the signing of a regional free trade agreement (the Agadir Agreement) with
Tunisia, Egypt, and Jordan. This context made it all the more crucial to transform the administration into
an effective and efficient institution, with the capacity to drive private sector development and provide
citizens with better services.

As regards public finance, the government focused on consolidating its budget and adopted a
cautious debt strategy, which reduced the central government’s debt from 62 to 47.2% of GDP in 2005
and 2008, respectively. Although prudent budget management resulted in a surplus in 2007 and 2008, the
global financial crisis and the spike in international prices of heavily subsidized oil and food, gave rise to
increased pressure on public finances. Consequently, greater priority was given to improving public
expenditure efficiency as a way of addressing the dilemma of increased demand for public services and
growing budget constraints, and avoiding the adverse effects of increased budget regulation in 2011.

On the political front, the reform program was strengthened by the new government, which took
office after the elections held in October 2007. To fulfill the electorate's expectations and meet the
needs of an increasingly open economy, the government submitted its Economic and Social Plan (Plan
Economique et Social – PES)2 to Parliament. This plan aimed at consolidating public finances and the
macroeconomic framework. It further aimed at accelerating and deepening reforms undertaken to
improve Morocco’s economic competitiveness, human capital, social indicators, and governance. Special
attention was thus given to administration and public management reform and modernization, launched in
2002 and supported by the World Bank, the EU and the African Development Bank (AfDB), including a
first series of programmatic loans. The reform was extended to fiscal reform, public expenditure, wage
bill rationalization and deconcentration in order to achieve a more sustainable macroeconomic framework
by improving public expenditure efficiency and ensuring optimal budget resource allocations.

To achieve the plan’s objectives, the government’s reform strategy focused on: (i) modernizing the
administration and the civil service; (ii) developing a new results-oriented budget mechanism, which
includes public policy evaluation mechanisms; (iii) enhancing public sector governance and transparency;
(iv) improving human resource management; (v) improving the quality of public services by introducing
community-based management and implementing the deconcentration process; and (vi) simplifying
administrative procedures by introducing e-government.

The second series of programmatic loans for the Public Administration Reform Loans (PARL III and IV)
and the World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), adopted in 2005, are fully aligned with the

new government’s reform strategy and support the six previously mentioned priority reforms. As a key
component of the new 2010-2013 CPS, PARL IV contributes to two major strategic pillars: driving
growth and competitiveness, and improving public service quality and accessibility. Moreover, the
program contributes to the strategy’s cross-cutting governance enhancement theme.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Result Indicators (approved)

Supported by the PARL series, the objective of the public administration reform program was to improve
the public administration’s efficiency, transparency, and accountability. To this end, PARL III and IV
retained the overall objectives of the series:

        a. Improving government efficiency in budget management;
        b. Improving government efficiency in human resources management;
        c. Further consolidating management and control of the payroll; and
        d. Improving public services and simplifying procedures through e-government.

The key result indicators related to the second series of PARL include:

Efficient budget management by (i) integrating multi-annual budget planning into the budget bill
preparation process; (ii) increasing public investment execution rates; (iii) building performance audit
capacity; and (iv) making accounting information reliable and more transparent.

Efficient human resources management by (i) harmonizing civil service laws, which cover 90% of civil
servants, and (ii) implementing reforms to develop a more equitable and transparent compensation
system.

Public wage bill consolidation and control by reducing the wage bill from 11.8% of GDP in 2005 to 10.4
% in 2009.

E-Government and Simplification of Procedures: (i) higher productivity resulting from e-government
measured by the increased number of public services on line and (ii) greater transparency in public
bidding processes.

        2. Key Factors Affecting Program Implementation and Outcomes

        2.1 Program Performance (based on a table from the policy matrix)

        The second series of PARL is a continuation of the first. It retains the same components and reforms and
        aims at consolidating intermediate results. The sole difference lies in the new e-government component
        introduced in 2008.

        Given that most triggers relating to the two operations were achieved within the prescribed
        deadline, second series performance can be rated as satisfactory. Of a total of 10 triggers identified
        for PARL IV, only two had to be revised. The first one is a PARL IV’s trigger envisaging expanding
        Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) to five new ministries, covering the period 2009 to
        2011 and based on a revised approach that draws lessons from the first phase. Implementation of the
        trigger benefited from technical assistance financed by a World Bank grant. Due to delays in mobilizing
        the expertise needed to revise the methodology, the final prior action foresaw 5 new MTEFs for the
        period 2010-2012. This prior action was met and by the end of 2010, five ministries (Agriculture, Justice,
        Youth and Sports, Modernization of the Public Sector (MMSP), and New Technologies) had developed
        their MTEFs based on a more strategic approach that is better suited to the new budget approach. These
        MTEFs are now awaiting formal approval.

        The second revised trigger involves online procurement planned in PARL IV. In addition to being too
        ambitious, the measure providing for the introduction of online tenders met with technical and legal
        difficulties related to securely providing corporate signatures online when submitting such tenders.
        Although online tendering was excluded, the revision provided an opportunity to better define and
        strengthen the trigger, and extend its scope to include 80% and 25% of local governments and public
        institutions, respectively.

        Table 1 outlines the detailed outcomes achieved by PARL III and IV. (Revised triggers and detailed
        revisions are shown in italics)

2.2 Key factors influencing implementation

Program implementation has not been affected by any key factors, given that: (i) the operation is
significantly in alignment with the administrative reform strategy and program; and (ii) the government
implemented a cautious macroeconomic management strategy that enabled the country to mitigate the
impacts of major external shocks such as the food crisis, oil price hikes, and the global economic and
financial crisis of 2009. These crises only gave added relevance to the reform program’s objectives and
underlined the need to modernize public finance and human resources management, and control the wage
bill. Although its impact on Morocco was limited due to the low international integration level of its
banking sector, the impact of the crisis in Europe, Morocco’s major export market, emphasized the need
for governments to be proactive and investment-oriented.

Factors that positively contributed to implementing the second series of PARL include:

Alignment: The program’s alignment with administrative reform priorities constituted an advantage.
Administrative reform is a significant pillar of the economic and social reform program adopted by the
new government in October 2007. Both MEF and MMSP were fully committed to implementing budget
and civil service reforms. These ministries worked together with sector ministries to efficiently undertake
reforms aimed at improving payroll management and control. The National e-Government Committee
(CNeGov) managed reforms under the e-government and simplification of procedures component.
Appropriation was less with respect to MTEFs.

Coordination: At the government’s request, the program was jointly prepared and monitored by
Morocco’s three major development partners (The EU, the AfDB and the WB). Identification and
appraisal were conducted jointly, resulting in a single activity matrix, strong dialogue, and joint
supervision missions and reports. The World Bank is endeavoring to maintain this approach, which is
especially suitable for such complex and extensive administrative reforms. In compliance with the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, this joint effort has strengthened the reform program’s credibility and
reduced the country’s transaction costs.

Analytical work: Preparation related to the second series of PARL drew from lessons learned during the
first phase, which focused on developing concepts of reform components and instruments, and from
experience by a significant number of ministries (9 for MTEFs, 10 for deconcentration and 32 for
globalization of appropriations). This series further benefited from substantial analytical work (see Table
2) and from a good coordination of donors’ technical assistance, including World Bank support to the
MTEF approach and EU support to the preparation of the new organic law. The Bank’s Programmatic
Economic and Sector Work (P-ESW) was crucial in supporting and informing this especially complex
and extensive reform process.

Consultation : the reform design and implementation could have benefitted from a greater stakeholder
and civil society consultation. This is particularly the case for the budget reform and the pilot testing of
the performance management approach. The regional administrations were insufficiently associated to the
establishment of the Ministries’ performance indicators and targets, which in turn were only partially
taken into account in the performance contracts with the center. Likewise, performance objectives and
indicators could have been more focused on taxpayers and users’ expectations. Such consultation could
have increased the internal and external visibility of the reform and enhanced appropriation at the
operational level.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) design, implementation, and utilization

Reforms were continuously monitored through regular policy dialogue with the authorities in
compliance with development policy support program procedures. This dialogue and monitoring
were facilitated by stationing most program team members in the Bank’s country office.

The series result and impact indicators were aligned with administrative reform program
objectives, although some were too ambitious considering the conceptual and pilot testing phase of the
reform. This is notably the case for performance indicators pertaining to the budget and the human
resources reforms. While the program was focused on the development and pilot testing of medium term
expenditure frameworks, the indicator was measuring the integration of multi-annual budget planning into
the budget bill preparation process, which would have required the adoption of a multi annual budget
perspective and a global MTEF. Likewise, one key performance indicator of the human resource
component measured the implementation of reforms to develop a more equitable and transparent
compensation system, while the program focused the preliminary study. Both these ambitious indicators
thus weight negatively on the rating of these two components.

From an institutional perspective, there was no formal central steering and monitoring system.
Reform specific steering committees were set up to monitor progress. Their effectiveness was uneven. For
instance the inter-ministerial high committee set up at the beginning of the program for the budget reform,
barely convened and thus did not play its steering role. The e-government reforms benefited from the
strengthening of its institutional governance under the program. The set up in May 2009 of the National
Council for ITC and of the e-government inter-ministerial committee came close to a monitoring and
evaluation system.

The reforms supported by the series contributed to strengthening the government’s monitoring and
evaluation system. The development of an integrated expenditure management (GID) system improved
real-time budget execution monitoring. The development of wage bill monitoring and control tools and
the greater involvement of line ministries further strengthened public finance management and
monitoring. Finally, the program helped build performance audit capacity through the development of a
methodological guide and the emphasis on performance audits, which were carried out in 20 ministries.


                                                                                                          8
2.4 Next Phase and Operation

Following a government request, provision was made for a new programmatic series that supports
implementation of new budget and administrative management approaches. Recent events in the
region and the country confirm that population is eager to see good governance, transparency and
efficiency with respect to public finances and services, all key objectives of the budget and administrative
reform. To meet the citizens’expectations in a tangible and visible way, the new series would focus on
institutionalizing and scaling up these reforms, and on implementing the new regionalization strategy.
Government authorities and development partners are currently discussing the following strategic pillars:
(i) improving transparency and accountability in public finance management by adopting and
implementing performance-based budget management; and (ii) improving public service management and
efficiency. Discussions related to tax reform consolidation are currently underway to identify available
tax revenue that may be allocated to (re)deploying development priorities. Finally, regionalization, as a
cross-cutting priority, will strengthen the two strategic pillars mentioned above by bringing decision
making closer to service delivery.

3. Assessment of outcomes

3.1 Relevance of objectives, design, and implementation

Objectives, Design, and Implementation of the Second Series of PARL are considered relevant.

The four objectives of the program were well aligned with the government’s reform strategy for the
implementation of its economic and social program. The objectives of improving effectiveness of
budget and human resources management, of consolidating and controlling the public wage bill, of
developing e-government, and of simplifying procedures closely matche the government’s reform
priorities. These priorities are to: (i) modernize public administration and the civil service; (ii) develop a
new system of results-based budgeting, including mechanisms for assessing public policy; (iii) strengthen
governance and transparency in the public sector through reform of public financial controls; (iv) improve
human resources management; (v) enhance the quality of public services through the introduction of
proximity management; (vi) pursue the deconcentration process; and (vii) simplify administrative
procedures by developing e-government.

These objectives take into account the sequencing of these reforms and aim at deepening reforms
supported by the first series of PARL, including (i) multi-year budget planning, (ii) developing
program budgets with performance indicators, (iii) modernizing internal controls, (iv) reducing the wage
bill through the voluntary retirement program, and (v) modernizing human resources management
through the introduction of the Staffing and Competencies Registry (REC).

The design of the series took into consideration trends in policy priorities and was adapted to the
gradual implementation of these structural reforms. The first PARL series initially foresaw three
loans. A decision was taken to suspend this series after the second loan and to begin a new series of two
loans (PARL III & IV). This helped take into account the priorities of the reforms initiated by the
government, which took over after the October 2007 election. E-administration and the simplification of
procedures were added as a fourth component. The second series was approved on May 15, 2008.

The choice of a new programmatic series responded to the need for flexibility in an reform
approach based on experimentation in pilot ministries. Programmatic lending allows for lessons to be
learned from experience. For example, the initial methodology for preparing MTEF based on programs
corresponding to budget items proved inadequate for an effective performance approach. The latter

                                                                                                            9
requires major programs and more strategic indicators. PARL IV’s corresponding trigger was revised to
reflect the new MTEF methodology. Similarly, the public procurement transparency trigger was
strengthened, taking into account progress made in this area.

The Development Policy Loan instrument proved to be an appropriate instrument to support the reform
process by enhancing attention to key reform benchmarks and triggers and by formalizing the reform
phasing, in the absence of a reform blueprint.

The implementation of the series relied on solid ownership of reforms by the government and on the
steering structures it had put in place. An inter-ministerial steering committee for administrative reform
headed by a Permanent Coordinator was established through a decision of the Prime Minister aiming to
ensure the coordination and monitoring of the program. However, steering these complex reforms would
have been facilitated by more frequent meetings and the adoption of a master plan, especially for budget
reform, as was the case for the e-government component.

As indicated in Sub-section 2.2 above, the implementation of the series benefited from good coordination
and harmonization between the major partners supporting these reforms (WB, EU and AfDB). This
coordination resulted in increased leverage and credibility of complex and sensitive reforms, which
significantly modified the mode of operation of the administration and of civil servants. This approach
helped to reduce the risks associated with both institutional and individual resistance to reforms.
However, it is appropriate to reinforce the visibility of these reforms and of their short term results in
order to enhance ownership at scaling-up stage. Particular attention should be paid to change management
as well as to internal and external communication.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The definition of results and impact indicators is difficult for any public sector reform. This is particularly
true in the case of complex and long term reforms such as those supported by the PARL programs. While
the second programmatic series (PARL III and IV) helped raise budget and human resources reforms to a
higher level, they remained at a preparation and experimentation phase. In the absence of a generalization
of reforms as well as of institutional and legal backing for the new modes of management, results in terms
of effective public management (financial, human resources, budget balances, and e-administration) will
remain limited. Results achieved by the second programmatic series, as specified below, must therefore
be analyzed primarily within the context of overall objectives and then in relation to the specific
objectives of each component.

The overall objective of PARL – to improve effectiveness, transparency, and accountability in
public administration – has been partially achieved and can be considered moderately satisfactory.

1. Effectiveness of the administration

The development of new instruments for planning and budget projections, such as MTEFs in the 16
ministries, helped in some cases to improve efficiency in their actions by reinforcing the link between
their strategy, their programs, and their budget. The adoption of a new methodology for preparing MTEFs
from 2009 helped assess the allocation of financial and human resources on the basis of strategic areas
and programs. Once institutionalized, these instruments will contribute to improving intra-ministerial
allocations, identifying asymmetries and waste, and reinforcing budget dialogue with MEF. In some
cases, information contained in the MTEFs was used in budget negotiations. However, the impact would
have been more significant if (i) sector MTEFs were part of a general MTEF and were well integrated
into the budget preparation and negotiation process, and (ii) a program budget nomenclature had been

                                                                                                            10
adopted. Similarly, the management of human resources within the government is benefiting from the
development of an REC as well as from the introduction of Jobs and Skills Management Planning tools
(GPEEC) in all the ministries. The impact of these new instruments on government effectiveness depends,
among other factors, on the extent to which they are taken into account in recruitment, transfers, mobility,
and human resources training policies both at the central and deconcentrated levels. Taking RECs into
account in reinforcing and modernizing the initial and in-service training of public servants would also
help strengthen efficiency in the government's operations as well as in the services it provides. In the
absence of reliable information on newly recruited or transferred personnel based on RECs and job
descriptions, it is difficult to assess the impact of these reforms on the administration’s effectiveness.
Such an assessment should also take into account demand in public services as well as user satisfaction.
Current studies underway in the health sector (PER/PETS) will provide valuable information on means of
reinforcing the impact of these reforms. However, the recruitment of unemployed graduates launched at
the beginning of 2011 in response to pressing social demands does not appear to have taken into account
the new instruments (REC and GPEEC).

2. Government’s Transparency

Several components of this program helped improve government’s internal and external transparency. For
instance, the development of MTEFs by most ministries improved the visibility of their budgetary choices
and their use. The development of performance indicators even on an experimental basis also contributed
to greater transparency in government toward citizens and their representatives. The conduct of
performance audits in 22 ministries and the publication in 2010 of a summary of their findings and
recommendations also enhanced transparency of the administration’s management. Extending the e-
procurement portal (where 80% of bidding documents are published) to all ministerial departments has
further reinforced transparency in the management of public finances. The adoption of a general MTEF
and future presentation of the budget on a program basis along with objectives and corresponding
performance indicators will strengthen clarity and transparency in government actions. The publication of
contracts awarded as a result of the bidding process and contract amendments further improve
transparency.

3. Government’s Accountability

The impact is less visible in this area, due to the preparatory and experimental nature of the reforms.
Achieving this PARL objective requires adopting new methods of budget, public finances, and human
resources management, which are beyond this programmatic series. Performance-based budget
management involves empowering leaders and managers through greater autonomy and accountability
with respect to results achieved. A number of components of the program contributed to this preparatory
work. For example, the development of an MTEF for each ministry along with performance indicators is
a first step towards a programmatic budget structure and performance projects to be presented together
with the budget appropriation, once the organic budget law has been changed. A decree specifying the
roles and functions of program managers will help clarify and reinforce their responsibility. Even if
limited to budget headings, during the experimentation phase, the globalization of appropriations
empowers managers and prepares them for an extension of globalization at program level. The signing of
performance contracts with deconcentrated services, especially in sectors such as education, health,
agriculture, water, and forestry along with increased deconcentration of appropriations also contribute to
enhanced accountability. The new integrated financial management information system (GID) facilitates
the deconcentration of appropriations, by automating transfers at the start of the budget year and
improving their monitoring. The reform of internal public financial controls, when completed, will also
enhance managerial flexibility and responsibility in the public sector. The combination of commitment
and accounting controls at Treasury (TGR) is a first step in that direction. The managerial capacity of
authorizing officers and assistant authorizing officers is currently being assessed by IGF and TGR and

                                                                                                         11
based on the results, prior controls can become lighter. Similarly, the development of performance audits
within IGF as well as inspection units in the ministries that have signed cooperation protocols is
contributing to the empowerment of authorizing officers. Finally, the greater involvement of line
ministries in the planning and management of their personnel costs and the prohibition to carrying
forward non used appropriations has helped further empower these ministries and to ensure a better
control over the wage bill.

Assessment of the Series’ Strategic Objectives, by component (Sub-section 1.2)

Component A: Improving the administrations’ efficiency in budget resource management

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The specific objective of this component, i.e. improving the administration’s efficiency in budget
management, can be considered broadly met in view of program achievements. It is difficult to
accurately evaluate improvements in the government’s budget management as well as the contribution to
such improvements by program measures. However, the following are signs of improvement: (i) better
visibility of short-term budget policies through the preparation of a Medium Term Budget Framework
and MTEFs; (ii) reinforcement of the responsibility for deconcentrated services in the preparation and
execution of results-based budgets by simplifying the procedure for deconcentrating appropriations; and
(iii) the modernization of internal controls resulting from merging and simplifying commitment and
accounting controls, introducing performance audits, and establishing a new public accounting system.

MTEF and multi-year budget planning
This PARL series consolidated past government efforts in developing an MTEF methodology as well as
instruments aimed at reinforcing transparency and effectiveness in budget allocations. During the course
of the program, significant progress was made, including in the extension of the experiment to nine
ministries under PARL III and to five more under PARL IV, using the new methodology. By the end of
2010, a total of 16 ministries had developed and tested over 19 sector or sub-sector MTEFs or were in the
process of doing so. Thus, most departments are now acquainted with multi-annual budgeting methods
and the MTEF instrument, and prepared for its implementation, as soon as the organic budget law is
adopted. Furthermore, the results of pilot testing helped improve the methodology for preparing MTEFs
by making them more strategic and more focused on program budgets, less numerous, and more relevant.
Pilot testing also resulted in a revision of objectives and performance indicators, which were too
numerous and largely centered on inputs and outputs.
As the program focused on the design and testing of these programmatic and performance based
budgeting instruments, the MTEFs have not yet been integrated into the budget preparation process. In
the absence of a general MTEF to align sector MTEFs with, these cover different periods and durations
(from three to six years) and remain experimental.
While the program prior- action and triggers have been met the corresponding key performance indicator
is only partially met. This indicator – which foresaw the integration of multi-annual budget planning into
the budget bill preparation process – is however too ambitious as it requires the change of the legal
framework and thus goes beyond the series scope.
The multi-year forecast and the MTEF approach will be consolidated and institutionalized by integrating
it into the legal and regulatory framework, through a new organic law, a specific law on public finance
policy, or the introduction of a parliamentary debate on the government’s Medium Term Budget
Framework (MTBF) and MTEF. The circular on budget preparation will then be revised accordingly and
integrate multi-annual budget planning.

Empowerment and deconcentration
As part of the pilot testing, ministries were requested to prepare program budgets for specific budget
headings, with objectives and performance indicators. In return, they benefited from the “globalization”
of investment and operating expenditure appropriations under these budget headings. At the end of the
program, all 34 eligible ministries had adopted this approach, and the globalization of appropriations
accounted for nearly 98% of expenditures in 2008 as against 77% in 2007 (safe debt service and
transfers). More than 1,900 performance indicators were developed and presented to Parliament as an
appendix to the budgets of 25 ministries in 2009. This helped the main stakeholders become more
conversant with the approach and draw useful lessons for the consolidation stage. This shows that the
budget paragraph level is not sufficiently meaningful to offer the necessary flexibility and visibility for a
genuine performance-based budgeting approach. The program must be of a critical size to reflect the
government’s key priorities. Furthermore, public policies must be strategic and limited in number and
have a wider scope. Globalization of budget appropriations needs to be at a level high enough to
guarantee effective empowerment and flexibility in management, both at the central level (program head
and managers) and in deconcentrated services. Objectives and performance indicators must be
rationalized, strategic, and results-oriented, and must reflect the priorities of users and tax payers in terms
of public policies and programs. Finally, reports on the management of globalized allocations,
performance indicators, and MTEFs from the sector ministries did not receive the required attention, as
evidenced by the absence of feedback and validation.
The reform supported by this program also facilitated the extension of pilot testing responsibilities to
deconcentrated services. In 2010, after an initial delay, the Ministries of Health and Higher Education
developed and signed respectively six and 17 program contracts, with their regional directorates,
universities, and other deconcentrated services. The High Commission on Water and Forestry also
adopted this approach. The purely quantitative results exceeded the targets set by the government.
However, they could not be institutionalized and the level of ownership varies. The initially planned
national deconcentration strategy was not adopted due to the government’s desire to include it in broader
regionalization strategy, which would include decentralization. In this regard, a Royal Commission was
set up in August 2009 and presented its report in March 2011. This change in approach and associated
delays resulted in suspending the adoption of ministerial deconcentration master plans initially envisaged.
This lack of policy and budget framework for program contracts had a negative impact on their ownership
and use by the services. For instance, the Ministry of Health did not update these contracts after the 2009
financial year. However, the various elements of the budget reform, such as the globalization of
investment appropriations and greater attention to the performance of services, seem to have been
reflected in an improvement in the public investment execution rate, as indicated in Table 3.

Performance audit
The government’s capacity in performance audits was strengthened at the central level, notably at the
Inspectorate General of Finance (IGF) and the Inspectorate General of Ministries (IGM). This was the
result of 22 performance audits performed by the above mentioned inspections, of five training sessions
covering all the ministries, as well as of the signature of IGF-IGM cooperation agreements. The published
summary of these performance audits indicates a grasp over this new methodology that is closer to
evaluation than control. It also shows the limits of pilot testing the reform without adjusting the legal and
regulatory framework. These relationships are especially rich in lessons in how to reinforce the
performance approach and improve corresponding objectives and indicators. It would be beneficial to
publish these indicators to improve the visibility of the reform and enrich the debate on performance.

Accuracy and increased transparency of accounting information
This last result indicator for component A was largely achieved thanks to the generalization of the
integrated financial management information system (GID) system from January 1, 2010. Since then,
GID has covered all authorizing officers and managers both at the central and deconcentrated levels and
counted over 10,000 users in 2010. It permits a follow-up of expenditure implementation in real time and
facilitates the assignment and transfer of budget allocations. Finally, GID facilitated the establishment and
day-to-day budget management reports to top civil servants in their ministries. Its expansion to all public
institutions, including at local government level, would further improve the management and transparency
of financial information.
The preparation of a comprehensive public accounting reform, on an accrual basis, including budgeting
accounting, and fixed assets accounting, contributes to greater financial and accounting transparency. It is
currently at the State assets inventory phase.


Component B: Improving government efficiency in human resources management

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The specific objective of this component, which is to improve the administration’s efficiency in
human resources management, can be considered partially met.
The major instruments for modern human resources management were developed through: (i) the
establishment of a Staffing and Competencies Registry (REC) in all the ministries; (ii) the launching of
Jobs and Skills Management Planning tools (GPEEC) in 21 ministries, representing more than 90% of the
State's workforce,3 and iii) the finalization of a unified job classification. However, there is no conclusive
evidence that these instruments were systematized within the government or used for recruiting or
allocating human resources. For instance, the recruitment campaign of young graduates in 2011 did not
seem to have taken into account the needs and profiles established under the RECs and GPEECs of the
administrations concerned. The ownership of these instruments seems to be particularly limited at the
level of deconcentrated services, which are less involved in human resources management at this stage.
The new remuneration system for civil servants is still at the study stage. The third and final phase of the
study on restructuring the remuneration system focuses on a range of scenario with financial simulations
and should be validated shortly. The principle of consolidation of major allowances into the basic salary,
which seems to have been accepted, would increase the fixed part of the remuneration, on average from

29,2% to 72,2% and thus “decompress” the salary scale and offer greater scope for promotion in the civil
service. Other items, such as whether or not to introduce a variable component of 10% in the
remuneration as well as its implementation modalities, remain topics for discussion. The new system has
not yet been adopted.

The planned merger and rationalization of the different civil servant statutes also seems to have lagged
behind. It was subject to resistance by different constituencies even though it has no impact on their
remuneration. Since the beginning of the reform, the number of statutes had been reduced from 68 to 48
by the end of 2010 through the adoption of three decrees at the beginning of 2011, merging 22 statutes
into three. The objective to reduce the number of statutes to 20 remains a medium-term aim. In addition,
on October 29, 2010, the government adopted four decrees aimed at merging the statutes of four major
civil servant categories, namely Administrators, Technical Assistants, Administrative Assistants, and
Editors. This permitted the merger of 52 statutes into four.

With regard to in-service training, important efforts have been made. These include the adoption of a
national training strategy in 2009, the development of sector-specific training plans and the increase of
resources for training. As a result, the average training budget amounted up to 1% of the wage bill and the
average training days per employee reached four per year. However, this average conceals substantial
disparities between departments (from 1 to 13 training days per employee per year). Similarly, training
remains too general and rarely matches the REC’s specifications. In-service training remains
insufficiently integrated into the evaluation, promotion, and human resources management system. The
development of job descriptions and the integration of training and evaluation modules into the
information systems of human resources management should help strengthen the link between supply and
demand for training. The expansion and harmonization of human resources information systems (HRIS),
covering 37 departments at the end of 2010, with 16 being integrated into GPEEC, is an important step
forward.

Finally, the Senate (Chambre des Conseillers) adopted on February 18, 2011 the bill amending the
general status of civil servants as regards: (i) redeployment; (ii) leave of absence; (iii) secondment; (iv)
contractual recruitments; and (v) access to the civil service through competitive examinations. The
adoption of this bill pending for five years is an important breakthrough.

In sum and considering the program’s key indicators, the aims of this component were partially achieved:
(i) although the unified job classification covered 90% of civil servants, the harmonization of the civil
servant statutes, on the basis of this classification, is still in progress; and (ii) reform toward the
establishment of more equitable and transparent remuneration systems remain at the study stage, and the
final phase – the choice of a restructuring pattern – is yet to be validated and implemented.


Component C: Consolidation and Control of the Public Wage Bill


Rating: Satisfactory
The specific objective of the third component, i.e. consolidating the management and control of the
public wage bill, was achieved. Assessment of this component was considered satisfactory
considering the results obtained in terms of wage bill reduction to 10.2% GDP in 2010 and
strengthened monitoring and control mechanisms.
The government’s consolidation and control efforts resulted in a steady reduction of the wage bill from
11.8% of GDP in 2005 to 10.2% in 2010, beyond the envisaged target of 10.4% in 2009.

                                                                                                         15
This positive result permitted the consolidation of the early retirement program (ERP)’s achievements and
the significant savings (about 1% of GDP) generated by the early retirement of nearly 7.5% of the total
number of civil servants. The fiscal space generated and strengthening of controls on civil service
positions helped also to redefine the profile of skills in the civil service to better respond to the needs of
priority sectors such as education, health, security, and justice and to improve their geographical
distribution. These results are due to the good fiscal discipline during the period as well as to the
strengthening of wage bill controls and monitoring through the introduction of a number of key reform
measures, supported by the program.
Monitoring improvements included monthly reports to the ministries on the situation of their personnel
appropriations and starting January 1, 2010, rationalized and simplified procedures for the management of
corresponding budget items. Significant progress was made in the control of the wage bill at both the
regulatory and the management level by sector ministries. They became much more involved in personnel
planning and management of the wage bill, which before was largely considered to be the exclusive
competence of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
In the 2010 budget bill (Article 22), the government introduced the principle of canceling unused
personnel budget items from previous years. This provision extends to jobs vacated by staff going on
retirement, which is now subject to negotiation in the same way as new budget items. This measure
helped to strengthen restrictions on personnel appropriations, which were still evaluative, and to urge
ministries to engage in more active management of personnel items. Finally, some monitoring
instruments and monthly reporting on the use of personnel appropriations were introduced, thus making
sector authorizing officers more accountable. Table 4 below shows positive initial results in terms of
control of personnel appropriations, with overspending of nearly 20% in 2005 falling to a slight overrun
from 2008 onwards. However, it is advisable that these experiences be consolidated by transferring the
responsibility for the management of personnel appropriation to the sector ministries and by limiting
personnel appropriations in the same way as other budget allocations as part of the review of the organic
budget bill.

Source: MEF, May 2011, (1) 2005, including a total amount of MAD 10,713 as allowance for voluntary retirement.

The key result indicator of this component is the reduction in the wage bill from 11.8% of GDP in 2005 to
10.4% in 2009. This objective was achieved since the wage bill fell to 10.2% of GDP in 2008 and 2009.
However, a risk of reversal in trend exists given strong current social protests coupled with pressing
demands from unemployed graduates. Indeed, the government introduced general increases in the salaries
of all civil servants and military personnel from May 2011. A total increase of MAD 600 for each civil
servant will raise the wage bill to 11% of GDP in 2011. However, expansion in the wage bill does not
seem to have been caused by slack budgetary discipline or by the mismanagement of human resources
and salaries. Rather, it is the result of a specific situation prevailing in the region and in Morocco in
particular, which called for these increases in response to the crisis among unemployed young graduates
and the social tensions that it caused. However, it is too early to assess if this trend reversal is structural.

                                                                                                                           16

Component D: Simplification of Procedures and e-administration

Rating: Satisfactory


The specific objective of the fourth component, aimed at improving public service and simplifying
procedures through e-administration (or e-government) seems to have been globally achieved.
E-administration governance was improved, in particular through: (i) the creation of a National
Information Technology and Digital Economy Council on May 21, 2009. The National e-Government
Committee (CNeGov) played a catalyst role and was the driving force behind this initiative, as is evident
in its half-yearly meetings and the results shown in Table 6 below; and (ii) simplification of procedures
and improvement in online public services through the establishment of a regulatory framework for online
procurement, the widening of the online publication of calls for tenders, and the operation of the online
Automatic Customs Network Database (BADR).
The key result indicators for this component confirm this assessment:
   E-administration productivity improved, as evidenced by the increased number of public services
    online. The strengthening of the governance framework and political support for these reforms
    enabled a strong development of online services. In total, 12 public services went online as part of the
    2013 national digital strategy for Morocco. Furthermore, 283 online tele-services devoted exclusively
    to the general public are now operational. These tele-services were developed by ministerial
    departments (143) and public enterprises (140). The services of the latter were published recently by
    MMSP as part of a study on online tele-services provided by the Moroccan administration.
   Transparency of public procurement seems to have increased. The scope of the administration using
    the common online procurement portal, www.marchespublics.ma increased considerably, exceeding
    the targets set by the program. At the end of 2010, coverage was 100% for State and local
    government public buyers and 60% (an increase of 30%) for buyers in public agencies.
   The number of tenders published almost doubled, increasing from 14,493 in 2008 to 27,565 in 2010
    and contributing significantly to transparency in the management of public funds. This reform clearly
    meets businesses demand given the increase in the number of visits to this new website. The number
    of pages visited expanded by 150%, from 1 million in 2008 to 2.5 million in 2009.
   Finally, significant progress was also made on finalizing the e-procurement platform. This platform
    now includes a database of suppliers, reverse electronic auctions, and the management of group

                                                                                                         17
    purchases as well as of electronic tenders. The platform was rolled-out on a pilot basis between
    February and March 2011 in five ministries, one local government, and one state-owned company as
    well as among several private bidders.

                             servants helped reduce the number of statutes from 68 to 48, thanks especially to the

                             underway and must be integrated into functional positions and classification

3.3 Justification of overall outcome rating

Moderately satisfactory

This overall rating is justified by the fact that out of the four components in this series, two (C and D) had
fully met key performance indicators and two (A and B) had one sub-component for which the results
indicators were only partially met. This is the case of sub-component A(i) on multi annual budgeting and
of sub-component B(ii) on the compensation system reform. These two key performance indicators,
which have not been revised, weight negatively on the overall outcome rating. However, it has to be noted
that these two indicators were too ambitious as they implied a change of the regulatory and legal
framework (OBL and compensation regulation). They thus went beyond the scope of the PARL series,
which were mainly focused on the conceptual and pilot testing phase of the reforms, as evidenced by the
prior-actions.

For component A, the rating “Moderately satisfactory” is based on the fact that important efforts have
been made in terms of designing a methodology for MTEFs and pilot testing it across a large part of the
administration. It takes into account the fact that government multi-year budgeting and MTEFs were not
yet included in the budget preparation process, as foreseen by the program outcome indicators. The
adoption of a deconcentration strategy and master plans, would have enhanced the ownership and success
of the deconcentrated entities performance contracts.

For component B, the rating “Moderately satisfactory” is explained by the fact that modern human
resource management instruments (REC, GPEEC) have been developed and tested across the


                                                                                                                    20
administration. While the joint nomenclature and job classification covers 90% of the Government’s civil
servants, the harmonization of civil service statutes based on this classification is ongoing. Similarly,
reforms meant to establish a fair and more equitable compensation system remains at the study level, and
the final phase – the choice of restructuring scenario – has yet to be validated and implemented. Thus the
corresponding key performance indicator is only partially met.

For component C, the rating “Satisfactory” is explained by the substantial progress made in monitoring
and controlling the wage bill and by the achievement of the result indicators at the end of the program.
However, the wage bill increased in the context of social tensions and claims since February 2011.

Component D is considered satisfactory as results indicators selected were largely achieved. The reform’s
governance and steering framework has been strengthened, thus enhancing its sustainability. New online
services and applications have been created and contribute to improve transparency and the business
environment.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

a. Impacts on poverty, gender aspects, and social development
The PARL series focused on public administration reforms and had no significant distributive effect. The
conduct of a Poverty and Social Impact Assessment was therefore not considered necessary. However, a
positive impact for tax payers, public service users, and businesses is expected from these efforts aimed at
improving the management of human and budget resources, controlling the wage bill, and developing e-
government.

Although it is difficult to measure and to establish precise causal links between the reform program and
poverty reduction, gender improvement or social development, it is reasonable to assume that the program
contributed to these objectives through the following factors:

(i)     The business environment benefitted from the simplification of administrative procedures,
        the development of e-government, including customs, and greater transparency in public
        procurement. Likewise, citizens at large and public service users benefitted from the 283 new
        online tele-services devoted exclusively to the general public, by reducing their transaction costs,
        reducing potential petty corruption.

(ii)    The reform program contributed to poverty alleviation, notably by promoting growth while
        keeping a stable macroeconomic framework and by controlling inflation, which supported private
        investments and job creation. For example, a smaller and better controlled wage bill allows for an
        increase in social expenditures. This was witnessed by the priority given to social sectors in the
        allocation of new personnel positions. The development of MTEF and personnel planning tools
        (REC and GPEEC) has been beneficial for the most advanced ministries, namely Health and
        Education, in their negotiations with MEF as well as with devolved entities. This has been
        demonstrated through the allocation of additional budgets and human resources.

(iii)   Gender condition: The gender dimension is not directly and explicitly integrated into the program.
        However, progress was achieved as the gender approach has now been integrated into all sector
        policies. Moreover, within the framework of improving effectiveness in human resources
        management, accompanying measures devoted to the promotion of female civil servants are
        planned. In addition, the Ministry responsible for public service modernization is preparing an
        ambitious program to engender recruitment, communication, and leadership along with a directory
        of female civil servants and an inter-ministerial committee for the promotion of women.

                                                                                                         21
(iv)   Equity and access to public services: the development of on-line applications and the
       simplification of administrative procedures improved access to public services and transparency.
       For example, the following operations can be mentioned:
          The BADR system manages 90% of customs declarations. The remaining 10% are those
            involving litigations, drawback, and changes. The average response time is very short (0.2
            seconds);
          The new e-procurement portal and the online submission of tenders will ensure transparency
            and increase competition.
           On-line public service and e-transactions are becoming widespread

The impact of these reforms is expected to increase in the forthcoming implementation phase, when they
will translate into new modes of public service management with the revision of the legal and regulatory
framework for budget and human resource management. The public expenditure reviews currently
underway in the health and education sectors will provide important information and data for the
assessment of the supported administration reforms’ impact on poverty reduction and social development.
They will notably provide insights on the impact of MTEFs and globalization of appropriations on intra
ministerial budget reallocations and its correlation with sector output and outcomes. They will facilitate
the assessment to what extent the human resource reforms (REC, more flexible civil service law) had an
impact on staff allocation and service delivery.


b. Institutional change/ strengthening

The involvement of all government ministries in the budget and human resources management reforms
and related instruments (REC, GPEEC, MTEFs), and in the pilot testing of performance budgeting have
helped develop managerial capacity and create a pro-reform community that should be built on. The
institutionalization of these reforms is necessary to avoid reform fatigue in the administration.

The development of a new Integrated Financial Management Information System (GID) offers significant
opportunities in terms of deconcentration and increased globalization of appropriations while mitigating
the related fiduciary risk, especially through detailed financial information in real time.

The wide scope of this program, which included e-government in 2008, has required significant inter-
ministerial coordination efforts. Lessons from this experience can guide the piloting and management of
these complex and sensitive reforms during the scaling-up phase.


c. Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)
The regionalization strategy probably built upon the government’s earlier deconcentration reforms and the
pilot testing of performance contracts, supported by the program.
The initial pilot testing of globalized appropriations and performance indicators at the level of budget
headings confirms the urgent need to review the budget classification and introduce a programmatic
nomenclature with strategic budget programs. In addition to this program, MEF has made significant
progress in preparatory work for a new budget nomenclature.

       4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

       Rating: Moderate

            The risks identified in the project document are relevant. The potential impact on reforms of external
             economic and financial shocks could have been foreseen earlier, although they proved to have had a
             positive influence on the government’s will to consolidate public finances and improve public
             service efficiency. The increase in frequency and volatility of these shocks however, made the
             administration more reluctant to develop a global MTEF.
            The risk of reform fatigue for such long and complex reforms could have been given more attention
             and addressed by building in measures fostering visibility and participation.
            The main risk lies in the political will to adopt and implement the new form of budget management,
             should a revised organic budget law not be presented soon. Although the impact of such a risk is
             significant, its probability can be considered low in view of the strong demand by civil society for
             more transparency and accountability, two key objectives of the reform.
            Risk that the reform of human resources management stall, in the context of a difficult social
             dialogue marked by the resistance of the main civil service constituencies reluctant to any
             consolidation of their own statutes. This risk is considered high in terms of both impact and its
             probability.
            Risk of slippage in controlling the wage bill. Although the total wage bill/GDP ratio remained on a
             declining path until the end of 2010, the trend was reversed in 2011, in a context of strong social
             demands for wage increases and public employment. This risk is considered high in terms of both
             impact and probability.

        Rating: Satisfactory

        The operation was designed as a series of programs to: (i) align the timetable and the time frames required
        by the design and implementation of a long and complex reform, (ii) allow the necessary flexibility to
        adjust measures as these reforms develop and (iii) integrate lessons learned from the pilot testing. It has
        thus been possible to further refine and adjust PARL IV’s measures (cf. Subsection 2.1).

        Instead of continuing with a third operation in the first series of programs, as initially planned, it was
        deemed preferable to end the series on December 31, 2007 and to start a new series consisting of two
        operations. PARL III, which was initially to cover 2006 and 2007, was thus delayed and the new series
        was negotiated with the new government after the October 2007 election, taking account of the new
        reform program. PARL III was approved on May 15, 2008. This approach was appropriate due to the still
        largely conceptual and experimental stage of the reforms. In hindsight, further attention could have been
        paid to reform steering and inter-ministerial coordination structures as well as to change management, all
        of which were shown to be weak.

        This second PARL series benefited from a large analytical base (see Table 2) and from the expertise
        accumulated during the first series. It also built on the main lessons learned from the first phase of the
        reform, such as the need for a more strategic and contractual performance approach and the revision of
        the MTEF methodology. This series has been able to integrate the experimentation in a growing number
        of ministries (up to 32 for the globalization of appropriations), including, for example, the increased
        accountability of authorizing officers and the establishment of modulated expenditure controls.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The second PARL series was supervised jointly with the European Union, covering all supported reforms,
prior actions and other additional measures in the matrix. There was no formal supervision mission for
PARL IV between program approval and the first ICR mission in December 2010, eight months later. No
Implementation Supervision report (ISR) was found in the system for PARL III and an ISR was produced
for PARL IV, dated 6/04/2010. Its rating was satisfactory. The PARL IV’s e-gov component was
supervised in December in parallel with a technical assistance mission. The EU carried out a formal
monitoring mission in July 2010, with which the Bank was associated.

The supervision mission aide memoire brought the strengths and weaknesses of the reforms to the
Government’s attention along with recommendations, in particular, for strengthening ownership of the
reforms by government services as well as their long-term sustainability. Furthermore, the partners
provided technical assistance for the implementation of these recommendations, such as, for example, the
preparation of MTEFs and the development of a new organic budget law and budget nomenclature. As
mentioned above, greater attention could have been paid to inter-ministerial reform steering and
monitoring as well as to change management.

These supervision missions were supplemented by continuous dialogue with the main counterparts in the
Ministries of Economy and Finance and of Public Sector Modernization, as well as with the services
responsible for e-government reforms. The policy dialogue and program monitoring were well
coordinated with the two co-financiers, the European Union and the African Development Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

This rating is based on the Bank’s satisfactory performance both in terms of the quality of the new series,
sequencing of operations and their supervision, for the reasons given above. The World Bank’s
commitment to these complex reforms over time resulted in building trust and a sense of partnership with
the Government, which has promoted dialogue and program implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Government ownership of the reforms and the support program is very strong, as attested by their
integration in the Economic and Social Program and its implementation strategy, adopted by the Prime
Minister after the October 2007 election. The report on the decade of reforms (1999-2009) published in
2010 by the Ministry of Economy and Finance confirms the importance of the reforms included in the
program as well as the continuing political commitment. The modernization of budget management,
improved public finance control and evaluation systems and a better management of human resources are
three pillars of the program and feature prominently in the Government program. The e-government
reforms, the program’s fourth component, has also been given particular attention, as attested by the
establishment of a high-level steering committee under the aegis of the Prime Minister in May 2009.

                                                                                                        25
Although an inter-ministerial committee has been set up at the beginning of the budget reform, it has not
been as active and has therefore not been able to play the driving and steering role required. The
presentation of the new organic budget law to Parliament would be a strong and clear signal of the
Government’s political will and commitment to adopt performance-based budgeting.

The government has fully fulfilled its steering and coordination role as regards support from the various
development partners. It has requested that the support be carried out jointly with the European Union and
the African Development Bank, and that missions and dialogue be held in common, in the spirit of the
Paris Declaration for aid effectiveness. The government has also ensured the complementarity of the
technical assistance provided by the partners as well as their alignment with the requirements of the
reforms and the services concerned. This has led to better ownership and effectiveness of the technical
assistance, as shown by the adoption of the reports and the good implementation of the recommendations,
notably from the CFAA and PEFA public finance diagnostics and the MTEF methodological assistance.
The involvement of line ministries in reform coordination and dialogue could have been stronger and
would have enabled better synergies between the various program components.

(b) Implementation Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Beside the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which is responsible for coordinating the operation, the
three main ministries directly involved with the reforms supported in the series were fully committed to
their implementation and have thus enabled the program to perform well.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance was strongly committed to the budget and public finance
management reforms, as shown by the strong involvement of its senior civil servants despite their heavy
workload. The budget directorate has been made the lead department and has set up a small team
dedicated to the reform. This approach is recommended to ensure that the new performance-based budget
management methodology and instruments are well integrated into the Ministry’s procedures and
practices. Overall, however, staff devoted to the reforms has proved insufficient considering the
complexity and increasing thematic and ministerial scope of these reforms. The involvement of sector
experts within the budget directorate, who are the link with line ministries, could have been strengthened
and systematized. If these reforms are to be institutionalized and generalized, it will certainly require a
considerable strengthening of the staff devoted to the steering of these reforms and the support to line
ministries for their implementation.

The Ministry of Public Sector Modernization (MMSP) has more particularly led the reform on human
resources, both through the revision of the regulatory framework and the development of new
instruments, such as the REC and GPEEC. It was also fully committed to the strategic study on reform of
civil service compensation. This commitment has enabled this complex and sensitive study to come to
fruition. Its implementation in the entire administration will require a strong political signal and concerted
action in all the Ministries and services concerned.

The Ministry of Industry, Trade, and New Technologies has been responsible for steering the e-
government reform and has taken up the role of President of the National Coordination Council for the
2013 e-Morocco strategy. The commitment both of this Ministry and the MMSP to implementing the
strategy and their involvement in the new governance structure have resulted in a substantial increase in
online public services. By the end of 2010, 12 public services and 283 online tele-services were devoted
exclusively to the general public.


                                                                                                           26
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Government’s ownership of these reforms, its active role in coordinating partners, and the continuing
commitment of the ministries concerned to achieving the program’s reforms and measures despite their
difficulty justify the satisfactory rating.
6. Lessons learned and Recommendations

The following lessons can be learned from the reform’s preparatory and experimental phase, supported by
this programmatic series:

a. The long and incremental preparation phase and its extended pilot testing have led to reform
   fatigue in line ministries. The government followed a traditional and cautious reform approach
   focused on the development of new instruments and their pilot-testing in a growing number of
   ministries. The reform was pursued without changing the legal and regulatory framework, a part from
   the reform on internal controls. While limiting risks, this approach has led to a reform fatigue, with
   many ministries now in a waiting mode. It is thus important to give a strong signal, such as the
   submission of the new organic budget law to Parliament, to confirm the political will and the change
   of management methods. It is recommended to foresee a short implementation phase (2 to 3 years)
   and to adopt a participatory platform approach in order to fully mobilize the administration for reform
   implementation, as it is notably done in public sector reforms in Latin America.

b. The reforms are now ripe and need to be institutionalized and generalized. Testing the reforms in
   a growing number of ministries has disseminated the reform throughout the government. The actors
   are now familiar with the methodologies and instruments developed. Lessons learned from pilot
   testing can now inform the reform and adapt the processes, as it was the case with MTEF preparation.
   These reforms now need to be generalized throughout the government and consolidated legally (by
   adopting a new organic budget law), institutionally (by strengthening steering and coordination
   structures and procedures), and organizationally (by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the
   various actors, with a particular attention to budget program heads and managers. Training needs to
   be substantially scaled up and rolled out, to include deconcentrated services.

c. The visibility of the reform needs to be strengthened both within the administration and with
   members of the public, taxpayers, and users of public services. The time scale for this kind of
   complex structural reforms (ten years on average) makes it hard to achieve visible results in the short
   to medium term. The crosscutting and very technical nature of these reforms make it difficult to
   establish a link with visible government services. It is therefore necessary to increase information and
   communication on the reform, based on clear short-term results and planned according to the “rapid
   results approach.” Giving increased attention to public service provision and providers and
   strengthening synergies with related reforms, such as the quality of public services approach and the
   fight against corruption, would increase the reform’s visibility and short-term benefits.

d. The steering of the reforms needs to be strengthened and scaled up. The lessons learned from the
   steering of the preparatory and experimental phase confirm the need to strengthen and formalize the
   steering of the reform on three levels. This would include establishing: (i) a specific, temporary, and
   adequately funded coordination unit within the Ministry of Finance and dedicated temporary units,
   which are directly attached to sector ministries and have both budget and operational expertise. This
   would create a core reform network to guide the services during the implementation phase; (ii) senior-
   level (Director or General Manager) thematic inter-ministerial committees for consolidating and


                                                                                                        27
     broadening the working groups created to revise the organic budget law; and (iii) a political inter-
     ministerial committee (a Council of Ministers devoted to this reform) that would meet regularly to
     steer the reform, arbitrate and to monitor its implementation. The establishment of a detailed
     implementation plan, specifying the timetable and responsibilities is highly recommended.

e. The importance of an overall budget reform blueprint to address the growing challenge of
   sequencing and coordination with the government’s other horizontal and sector reforms. A
   number of prerequisites for changing budget management, especially in terms of financial
   information systems, have been achieved or are on the verge of being achieved (through new accrual
   accounting). However, in the absence of an overall blueprint, other elements of the reform have not
   been adequately sequenced, such as the sector MTEFs. The latter were developed without a global
   MTEF or initial globalization of appropriations at budget item level before genuine budget program
   and heads were defined. Since items were thus considered programs with no real restructuring and/or
   resources consolidation, the benefits from testing the performance approach were limited.
   Coordination must be strengthened with a number of connected reforms, including payroll and human
   resources management as well as the deconcentration charter, two essential pillars of government
   modernization and of the performance approach. Similarly, synergies between these central reforms
   and sector strategies seem to have been underutilized. The new performance and deconcentration
   approach provides an opportunity for greater coordination between these reforms by specifying
   objectives, responsibilities, and triggers for each mission and program. The ensuing greater
   consistency in the allocation and management of human and financial resources (whether current or
   resulting from these strategies) at central and deconcentrated level would maximize the impact and
   visibility of these reforms.

f.   The development of a government wide monitoring and evaluation mechanism would be
     important for the scaling up of the reform process. Performance-based budget management
     implies that program managers will be more accountable for results achieved. This involves adapting
     information and control systems. While initial steps have been taken, the following core elements of
     performance-based management requires strengthening : (i) program, objective, indicator, and target
     validation and certification processes (to be carried out by an inter-ministerial committee) within the
     executive branch; (ii) performance-based information systems that are sustained by sector operational
     information systems; (iii) a government performance monitoring and evaluation system; and (iv)
     external performance audits. In this respect, it will be necessary to further define stakeholder
     functions and roles. Finally, performance audits could be developed and strengthened based on
     lessons learned.

g. Ownership of the reform by the administration is uneven and must be strengthened, notably by
   enhanced consultation and participation of stakeholders and users. The large reform pilot testing
   (MTEFs, performance approach) involved most ministries to various degrees. Many departments and
   (central) civil servants were sensitized, trained, and involved, and are now potential advocates of
   reform. Nevertheless, ownership remains uneven among ministries, departments (general and
   operational) and levels (central and deconcentrated). It is strongest among the ministries’ general
   services (budget, administrative, human resources, and computer departments), which were the most
   involved. It is weaker in operational departments, especially at deconcentrated levels. Ownership also
   varies between the different elements of the reform. It is greater as regards its financial aspects, such
   as the globalization of appropriations, financial controls, and the new Integrated Financial
   management Information System, which are now integrated into daily management. Ownership is
   less over multi-annual budget planning, the MTEFs, and performance approach, which remain largely
   experimental. This can be explained in particular by the various degrees of formalization of these
   reforms, the first three elements having been the subject of regulatory texts and are now part of
   management procedures. The following measures would strengthen and homogenize reform

                                                                                                         28
    ownership: (i) enhanced consultation of users and stakeholders, notably in the definition of
    performance objectives and indicators; (ii) creating a reform community (through an Internet/Intranet
    website and topical seminars) aimed at networking experts and disseminating knowledge and
    experience; (iii) intensifying and institutionalizing information and training (ENA, management
    training organizations, etc.).

h. The importance of supporting the scaling up and implementation of these reforms with
   analytical work (PESW) that is flexible, appropriate, and coordinated with the European Union. In
   addition to having a federating role in linking the various government services, PESW’s technical and
   conceptual contribution has proved essential for implementing the two PARL series.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementation Agencies, and Partners

(a) Borrower and Implementation Agencies

The two main implementing agencies, MEF and MMSP, reviewed this report and indicated that they
shared its findings and assessment. The specific comments have been integrated in the text. They
confirmed their commitment to these reforms and particularly to the revision of the organic budget law.
They further signaled their willingness to incorporate the lessons learned from the PARL series and this
report in the implementation phase, as evidenced by the discussion note prepared by MEF for the next
series.

(b) Co-financiers

The EU and AfDB evaluations and completion reports for this series are in broad agreement with the
positive assessment of the program’s achievements as well as with the main lessons learned, i.e., the need
to institutionalize and scale up the budget reform by adopting a new organic budget law and the need for
greater empowerment of service providers, particularly in the regions.
