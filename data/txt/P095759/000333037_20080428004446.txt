PROPOSEDTHIRD PUBLICADMINISTRATION REFORMDEVELOPMENTPOLICY LOAN
                                          (PARL-IIr)

                               LOAN PROGRAMSUMMARY
                                     AND

Borrower:      Kingdom o f Morocco.

Amount:        66 Million (US$lOO million equivalent).

Terms:         LIBOR-Based Fixed Spread Loan, repayable in 26 years, including four years o f
               grace.

Description:   The Government's public administrationreform program, initiated in 2003, aims at:
               (a) improving government efficiency in the management o f budget resources
               through greater transparency and accountability, and by introducing performance
               measurement; (b) improving government efficiency in the management o f human
               resources through the preparation o f a new management system for staffing and
               remuneration with performance measurement, while streamlining current human
               resources management; and (c) consolidating and controlling public payroll
               decrease. Per the Government's request, PARL-I11introduces as new objective to
               (d) improve public services and simplifyprocedures through e-government.

               Fromthe World Bank perspective and in agreement with its internal procedures, the
               proposed loan will be the first o f a new series o f annual programmatic loans
               supporting the implementation o f the reform program. However, the name PARL-
               I11will be kept to show the continuity with the previous series of loans (PARL-I and
               11). The proposed loan is complemented and strengthenedby an ongoing multiyear
               Programmatic Economic Sector Work activity through which the Bank i s providing
               the Government with advice, training, and technical assistance as required in the
               areas o f public finance management, civil service reform, and wage bill
               containment.

Benefits:      Benefits would result from the increased effectiveness o f public resources
               management in many complementary ways.             First, it would increase both the
                efficiency o f public spending and the civil service efficiency, which in turn should
               have a positive impact on economic growth. Second, the loan would contribute to
                improving governance and the delivery o f public services through upgrading audit
               procedures, promoting a performance culture and broadening online government.
               And   m,the      operation would indirectly support macro-economic stability and the
                creation o f fiscal space which could be devoted to increased social spending and
               infrastructures.

Risks:         There are three risks associated with the program. Institutional fatigue to meserve
               the momentum o f reform. As the new public management tools are in the process
               of being mainstreamed by the two leading ministries (Ministry o f Economy and
               Finance and Ministry o f Public Sector Modernization), some degree o f institutional
               fatigue to preserve the momentum o f reform by sectoral ministries might develop.
               The likelihood o fthis riskis low. However, this risk is mitigatedthrough the multi-
               annual technical assistance provided by the World Bank P-ESW and the European
               Union, by the strengthening of human and financial resources devoted to implement


                                               i

                  the reform in ministries, massive in-service continuous training, and closer and
                  more effective mechanisms o f interministerial monitoring and dissemination o f the
                  Public Administration ReformProgram (PARP). Imulementation delays. Delays in
                  the passing o f critical laws for consolidating the PARP inthe medium term, like the
                  new Organic Budget Law or the law modifying the general civil service personnel
                  regulations and allowing redeployment o f civil servants-    which reduces the need
                  for new hiring-release     for assignment, secondment and recruitment per contract,
                  may slow or impede the momentum for reform. The likelihood o f this risk i s low.
                  To mitigate this, the Government expects that gradual and participatory preparation
                  and validation o f the draft laws should obtain the required endorsement from
                  Parliament for passing required legislation. Furthermore, international experience
                  indicates that the consultation process leading to a revised Organic Budget Law
                  normally takes many years to materialize and can be an important tool to build
                  consensus around reforms. Social pressure. The Government could still be subject
                  to pressures to further increase salaries for some categories o f civil servants, and to
                  accelerate promotions and continue with sizable unplanned hiring. This might
                  undermine its efforts to continue curbing the payroll ratio. The likelihood o f this
                  riskis high, even though the new Government has already engaged inits first Social
                  Dialogue with Unions with the decision to keep tight control o f the declining trend
                  in the wage bill (as a share o f gross domestic product, GDP). This risk is also
                  mitigated by the new promotion system which limits the number o f promotions in
                  the medium term, the increasing number of civil servants retiring in the coming
                  years, and new measures to improve wage bill control and management to be
                  introducedunder t h s operation.

1. This memorandumdescribes the first Public Administration ReformLoan (PARL-III) for 66
million (US$lOO million equivalent) to the Kingdom of Morocco. From the Bank perspective and
because o f its internal procedures, the proposed loan will be the first o f a new series of annual
programmatic loans. However, the name PARL-I11will be kept to show the continuity with the previous
series o f loans (PARL-I and 11) supporting the Public Administration Reform Program (PARP) initiated
in2003. A PARL-I loan (82.5 million) was approved by the Board inJuly 2004, and a PARL-I1loan
(98.7 million) was approved in February 2006. The original reform program had three medium-term
objectives: (a) to improve government efficiency in budget management, (b) to improve government
efficiency in human resources management, and (c) to consolidate and control the decrease o f the wage
bill (as a share o f GDP). PARL-I11will continue supporting these three objectives, while addinga fourth
one: (d) to improve service delivery and simplifypublic procedures through e-government.

I.OVERVIEW

RECENT    EVENTS

2. Since 2003, the Government has preserved price stability, raised growth, and improved the
confidence of investorsin the Moroccan economy. It thus lifted the country from the fiscal, real, and
external imbalances that negatively affected the economy at the end o f the 1990s.              As a result,
unemployment rates are at record-low levels and poverty rates are also low. The country i s definitely
engaged in the fiscal consolidationprocess required by a transition toward inflation targeting, a flexible
exchange rate regime, and a gradual opening o f the capital account. This strategy consists o f five clear
courses o f action: (a) tax reform, (b) reducing wage bill growth, (c) reducing energy subsidies, (d)
phasing out inefficient food subsidies and replacing them with well-targeted programs focused on
vulnerable groups, and (e) performance-based budgeting based on medium-term expenditure frameworks
as part o f an overall effort to modernize public administration. Two o f these actions, inparticular (b) and
(e), are directly supported by the P a s . As a share o f GDP, the fiscal consolidation strategy aims at a
sustainable fiscal deficit below 3 percent, a public debt below 60 percent, and a payroll share below 10.4
percent in2009. The first two targets were reached in2006 and 2007, and the payroll share i s on track to
meet its target. Buildingon such achievements, the Government intends to achieve fiscal consolidationin
the medium term.

3. In his first speech to the Parliament,when he took office in October 2007, new PrimeMinister
Abbas El Fassi presented the guiding directives of his Social and Economic Program(SEP). The
SEP seeks continuity o f reforms, while accelerating and deepening their content. It seeks to improve
economic productivity, efficiency, and human capital indicators with a view to enhancing Morocco's
growth potential. To this end, the SEP aims at completing reforms launched by the previous government,
while starting new ones on tax reform; modernization o f agriculture; social protection to rationalize and
better target the onerous food and petroleum subsidy program; judicial reform and deconcentration
supporting nascent regionalization.

4. The SEP proposes to consolidate previous achievements under the ongoing public
administration reformagenda, but with a strengthened vision. The SEP mentions the following four
priorities:

         Strengthening o f the strategic role o f the State, through a comprehensive use o f the Medium-
         Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and performance budgeting tools, and enhanced
         efficiency through budget allocations and better delivery o f public services. For the first time, all
         ministries are currently preparingtheir 2008-12 Action Plans; and the priorities o f those Plans are
         intended to guide the elaboration o f sectoral MTEFs to be prepared from 2008 onward.

         Strengthening deconcentration as a key pre-requirement                 for nascent regionalization.
         Regionalization consists o f the creation o f regional economic development poles. The region
         becomes the third geographic layer for local participation, after districts and provinces. Sound
         regionalization requires, however, that the functional implementation o f sectoral policies be
         deconcentrated, as well as that functions and responsibilities by local players be decentralized.

         Simplification o fpublic procedures through a generalization o f e-government and accelerated use
         o f electronic tools that fit the needs o f the administration. Online access to public procedures will
         bringmore continuous, efficient and transparent communication processes with citizens.

         Renewed efforts to improve public sector governance and prevent corruption through enhanced
         auditing, more transparent budget reporting, and simplified procedures.

PROGRAM      STATUS

5. Five prior actions agreed for PA=-111                  were met:      On budget management, ministerial
departments had (a) introduced budget flexibility norms that facilitated transfers among resources in 30
Ministries (well above the 20 required) that represent above 77 percent o f non-wage expenditures; (b)
completed sector Medium-Term ExpenditureFrameworks (MTEFs) in 9 ministries (above 5 required); (c)
completed a study to reform control o f public expenditure, which led to the elimination o f a priori control
and the merging o f two directorates involved, thereby contributing to cutting paperwork time by about
half and making public expenditure processing more efficient.             On human resources management;
ministerial departments had (d) developed Strategic Staffing Frameworks (RECs) in six key ministries
(above two required), while (e) launchingRECs in four other ministries, thus reachingabout 80 percent o f
the civil service; and (f) launched the preparation o f a new job classification (nomenclature).          Prior
actions (d) and (e) were unified into a single one inthe definite version o f the matrix.

6. Two prior actions were experiencing delays, but were replaced by satisfactory complementary
actions. First, in December 2006, deconcentration was designated by King Mohammed VI as one o f the
priorities for Morocco, and asked for a national deconcentration strategy, which has yet to be developed.
As a result, only two out o f four deconcentration master plansrequired as prior action have beenprepared
and implementedon an ad hoc basis. The new Government i s now concluding the review o f its approach
to deconcentration, which should reinvigorate the process in the near term.                In the meantime, a
substitutive action was found: the approval o f a circular by the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF)
simplifyingthe process o fbudgetary credits deconcentration. Such measure will contribute to reduce the
time needed to transfer delegated credits to deconcentrated units, and ultimately to higher budget
deconcentration rates. The second prior action, completion of the study to propose options for a new
compensation system, has not been met. However, as the Authorities are on solid track to completing all
steps leading to the hiring o f the firm that will carry on the study, they agreed that the designation o f the
firmin charge o f the study is a prior condition. This action has beenmet and the study will be achieved
bybeginning 2010.

7. Finally, the proposed operation added two new prior actions to strengthen control and
consolidation of the wage bill decrease (as a percent of GDP). These refer to the creation o f two
groups. The first action will create a Commission incharge o f the regular monitoring o f the wage bill; and
(b) the second action will create an interministerial Group in charge o f introducing best practices in


                                                          4

monitoring, forecasting and personnel expenditure management by line ministries. The latter group will
involve the four pilot major ministries o f Education, Health, Housing and Finance that together combine
for more than two-thirds o f total civil service. Finally, and despite the Government's change, it is worth
noticing that no backtraclunq has been observed inactions adopted prior to PARL-111.

RATIONALE FORCONTINUED SUPPORT

8. Building on PARL-I and 11, the move toward a third operation is justified by the excellent
dialogue with successive Governments, the overall success of previous operations and the need to
consolidate medium-termreforms. Inits original design, the PARL series was expected to conclude
with the consolidation o fpublic administration reforms duringthe implementation o f PARL-111. As seen
above, progress in implementing the reform program has been broadly on track, but in the absence o f a
modem budgetary legal framework, it remains fragile.             In some reform areas, such as quality
improvements in the introduction o f performance budgeting within pilot Ministries is taking longer than
expected. Momentum for reform in two highly sensitive areas where progress has been considerably
slower than expected-central Government deconcentration and reform o f public remunerations-is         also
expected to be recovered.

9. The recent update of a Country FinancialAccountability Assessment(CFAA) has stressed the
importance of PARP elements for consolidating past reform gains, in agreement with the
Government. Good examples are a new Organic Budget Law, and the strengthening o f auditing
capabilities. The CFAA has also highlighted the need to adopt wage bill ceilings per Ministry in the
mediumterm.

10. The Government intendsto enhance its budgettransparency and anticorruptionpolicies,while
improving its accountability in delivering services, through the introduction of a new loan
component on online government (e-government) and simplification of procedures. This new
component will not only be an additional tool o f modernization (computerizatiodautomation), but more
fundamentally, an instrument for removing bureaucratic obstacles and improving the delivery o f public
services for citizens and businesses.

11. The proposed PARL-111 has greatly benefited from highly participatory analytical work
internally and in the context of strong close collaboration and coordination with the African
DevelopmentBank (AfDB) and the EuropeanUnion (EU). The design of the program has benefited
from the 2003 Public Expenditure Review (PER) and the 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
Implementation o f the PARL-I and I1loans, and the updates and design o f measures under PARL-111,
have been supported by ensuing Programmatic Economic and Sector Work (P-ESW) and a 2003 CFAA,
updated in 2006. Other World Bank Development Policy Loans (DPLs) in energy and water, and an
investment loan in education, have also contributed to indirectly address institutional issues-like     the
elaboration o f a sectoral MTEF-similar to those addressed by PARL components, thus strengthening the
consistency o f the program with sector policies. With respect to donors, joint supervision missions with
the Afncan Development Bank (AfDB) and the European Union (EU) and ongoing knowledge-sharing
activities have taken place regularly. Implementation o f PARL-I was successful overall, as described in
the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) reviewed on June 21,2005.

11.COUNTRYPOLITICALAND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

BACKGROUND

12. Morocco i s a lower-middle-income country with a population of about 31 million and a gross
national income per capita estimated at US$2,300 in 2007.               Agnculture retains a key, although
decreasing, role inthe economy, with a share o f gross domestic product (GDP) at around 15 percent over
the last 10 years, and employing some 40 percent o f the labor force, compared to 25 percent and 35
percent for industryand services, respectively. The economy i s relatively open, with exports and imports
amounting to about 70 percent o f GDP. Europe remains Morocco's major trading partner, and main
exports include phosphates and phosphate derivatives, textiles, fresh and processed food, electrical wires
and electronic components, and tourism.

RECENTDEVELOPMENTS

       1. PoliticalDevelopments

13. The last elections, held in September 2007, consolidated the reality of a nascent democracy.
They were qualified as transparent and free by many countries and international organizations. Elections
were also an opportunity for the population to freely express some degree o f dissatisfaction about the
outcomes o f social and economic policies, despite steady reform efforts made by the previous
government.       This perception may have been one o f the reasons for the low turnout at 37 percent
(compared to 52 percent in 2002) and a highnumber o f invalidated ballots (19 percent). Many believe
that this i s a clear signal for accelerating ongoing reforms, such as the ones addressed by the PARP, and
for including actions with a real impact on improving service delivery to the population.

       2. Economic Developments

14. Morocco features sound macroeconomic fundamentals.                  The economy i s characterized by
macroeconomic stability, rising growth, low inflation and declining unemployment, a strong external
position, and a decisive move toward fiscal consolidation (Figure 1). As a consequence, Morocco's
public debt earned investment grade in 2007. And despite the traditional political instability that any
electoral process entails, the Emerging Market Index Bonds (EMBI+) spreads for Morocco's sovereign
debt have fallen to historically low levels below 70 basis points by end 2007.

15. In 2006, economic growth reached its highest rate (8 percent) since 1998 (Table 1). However,
rapid growth was short lived; a low 2.3 percent i s estimated for 2007, due to a severe decline in
agricultural output (Figure 1). Affected by a tough drought, the agricultural sector registered one o f its
worst outputs o f the decade, with the volume o f cereal production equivalent to less than a fourth o f the
2006 volume.

16. The economy shows a structural shift featuring faster growth in nonagricultural output. Its
average growth rate o f over 5 percent in the last three years performs better than the average rate o f the
last five years. This new trend i s mostly dnven by the positive performance o f sectors with steady
structural reforms under implementation.         In 2007, tourism increased by 9 percent, reflecting a
comprehensive growth strategy undertaken since 2001, and its baclung by reforms in air transportation
(open-sky policy) and multiple public-private partnerships signed. Construction (up by 8 percent) i s also
contributing to growth performance through important housing and tourism facility programs, and big
infrastructure works in highways and the Euro-Med port, opened last September. The communications
sector i s growing rapidly (up by 8 percent), mainly reflecting increased competition following
privatization and featuring the introduction o f a third cell phone company, which has led to lower prices
o f telecommunication services.

17. In 2007, despite a more uncertain external environment, inflation slowed down to 2 percent,
while unemployment has stabilized.                                                                     The unemployment rate reached 9.8 percent of the active
population, the same rate as in2006. This result is outstanding inview of the sluggishgrowth in2007.

18. On the external front, in 2007 the trade deficit continued to worsen, largely because of lagging
export growth, whereas the current account was in balance. The trade deficit increased to 17 percent
of GDP, above the 14.4 percent of 2006 level. Despite the worsening trade deficit, the current account
was in balance, thanks to rising workers' remittances and tourism receipts. Furthermore, the level of
international reserves edged down to 9.5 months of imports compared to 10.5 months in2006.

   19. On the fiscal front, the government's strategy for fiscal consolidation is progressing steadily.
  Data on budget execution show a declining budget deficit o f around 0.5 percent o f GDP for 2007, the
  lowest deficit never recorded before and below the explicit ceiling target o f 3 percent o f GDP. Success in
  fiscal consolidation i s partly due to the revenue side. In2007, total revenues were 28 percent o f GDP,
  almost 3 percentage points more than in 2006, and almost 4 percentage points above the average o f the
  last five years. All gains stem from tax revenues that reached 25.4 percent o f GDP, despite the reduction
  o f the top rate o f the personal income tax from 44.5 percent to 42 percent, with an estimated loss o f half a
  percentage point o f GDP. Both personnel income taxes and profit taxes have contributed to the good
  stance o f tax receipts. The former benefited from a dynamic stock market while the latter was the result
  o f growing housing and public work sectors. On the expenditure side, whereas the wage bill continues to
  decrease, subsidies are rising. In 2007, the wage bill declined for the second year in a row and reached
   10.8 percent o f GDP. In 2008, it should edge down to 10.4 percent of GDP. Inexchange, energy and
  food subsidies now become the primary budgetary concern for the Government, because their fiscal
  impact i s heavy, while their effectiveness in alleviating poverty i s low.      The total fiscal burden of
  subsidies was equivalent to 3.8 percent of GDP in2007.

new academic programs to increase the supply o f highly skilled professionals, especially engineers and
physicians. The new Government i s buildingon these measures.
MEDIUM-TERM        OUTLOOK AND FINANCING                    NEEDS

21. Over the medium term, and under a conservative base-case scenario, Morocco is expected to
preserve macroeconomic stability and high growth (Table 2). GDP growth rate i s projectedto recover


                                                                      9

to at least 6.0 percent in2008 and stay around the same rate level afterward, with dynamic nonagncultural
output as its main driving force, but still relying on the performance o f agncultural output.
Nonagncultural output growth should continue to grow at 6 percent a year, driven by construction, new
industrial sectors and service activities with export potential, and tourism. Unemployment is likely to
remain in single digits, in view o f the moderate dynamism o f the economy in general. Inflation should
remain contained as long as tight fiscal and monetarypolicies are preserved, and despite expected subsidy
reform could ignite some inflationary pressures.

22. The externalposition is expectedto be resilient to externalshocksand remainslightly in deficit
thanks to high workers' remittances and rising tourism receipts that will offset most o f the high trade
deficits. With an average low current account deficit around 0.7 percent o f GDP and steady inflows o f
FDI, the level o f gross international reserves will remain at a comfortable level-above       9 months o f
imports. In addition, no major constraints should affect access to external financing. Lower debt and
lower country risk will reduce interest payments, allowing additional fiscal space for higher public
investment. Investment and national savings ratios should remain high at above 31 percent o f GDP.
Structural refoms should contribute to raising productivity. Productivity gains and additional FDI
inflows, in the context o f the various FTAs and the policies supported by the Emergence and Envol
(Take-off) programs, should lead to further improvements in growth, and in current account surpluses,
though remittance flows are expected to decrease over time.

23. The fiscal stance should remain sustainable. The fiscal accounts project two main outcomes
during 2008-1 1. First, the fiscal deficit should marginally decline from about 2.6 percent to about 2
percent o f GDP. Second, the public debt should stay below 58 percent o f GDP. Under a base case
scenario, reaching both outcomes implies, first, success in ongoing tax reform to broaden the tax base,
improve the efficiency o f the value-added tax (VAT), strengthen tax administration, and remove tax
exemptions in order to reduce tax expenditure. These measures would offset the negative impact o f the
reduced marginal rates on corporate and personal income taxes. If so, tax revenues are projected to
stabilize around 25 percent o f GDP despite declining customs duties, resulting from compensating higher
direct and indirect taxes (0.4 percentage point o f GDP) o f the revenue losses arising from lower customs
duties (down 0.5 percentage points) committed under the Free Trade Agreements. Second, the base case
scenario implies at least three critical expenditure measures: sustaining the declining trend o f the wage
bill; reforming oil and food subsidies; andpreserving active debt management.

24. A comprehensive public debt sustainability analysis shows that the base-case scenario is
sustainableinthe mediumterm (seeAnnex 8). Insum, slightly lower fiscal deficits wouldrequire less
annual net domestic financing needs from 2.3 percent in 2008 to 1.4 percent in 2011, while external


                                                        10

financing would stay stable at 0.2 percent o f GDP over the period. The sustainability o f the fiscal
framework is also robust to shocks: Under alternative scenarios, several shocks to the baseline scenario
are simulated, and public debt sustainability i s preserved in all of them. In the medium term, the
performance o f the external accounts is also expected to remain strong, with a declining surplus in the
current account over 2008-10.        The external debt repayment would amount to 4 percent o f GDP on
average. Overall, these factors would make external outstanding debt fall from 26.7 percent o f GDP in
2007 to 22.2 percent in 2010, o f which public and publicly guaranteed debt would decline from 19
percent o f GDP to 16.5 percent.

25. However, the higher fiscal deficit arising from the 2008 Budget Law will increase budgetary
financing needs, even though the deficit will remain below 3 percent of GDP and in the medium
term, it is expected to decline. Projected disbursements o f PARL-I11would then also help meet the
Government's objective o f diversifyingfinancing sources as well as provide financing on more favorable
terms than alternative sources on its 2008 budget. This, in turn, would support the Government's fiscal
consolidation strategy.    The Government continues to diversify sources since obtaining access to
international financing, but it can, however, smooth access conditions by the expected inflows from
multilateral sources, o f which the World Bank will cover a financing gap o f between US$300 million to
US$350 million per year over the projectionperiod (Table 3).

26. In the medium term, the Moroccan economy remains vulnerable to adverse domestic and
external shocks. On the domestic front, risks arise from the possibility o f severe droughts. If the
business environment worsens because of an increase interrorist attacks either inMorocco or throughout
the region, this could affect both tourism and FDI flows. On the external front, possible main external
shocks are: (i) persistently high international oil prices, which would create inflationary pressures; (ii)
rising international interest rates, which would be reflected inrising debt service and would put pressure
on the cost o f domestic credit; (iii)   falln main export commoditv prices which would have a negative
impact on the current account, as the export structure remains concentrated in a few key exports and the
prices o f phosphate rock or phosphate derivatives could deteriorate; and (iv) tougher migration policies
and possible decline inworkers' remittances. Labor recipient countries, like Belgium, France, Spain, and
Italy are enforcing tougher regulations on migration. Inaddition, the per worker remittances sent by the
current, so-called third generation o f migrant workers i s much less than the remittances sent by the
previous generation.      Combined, both factors could contribute to dampening the overall level o f
remittances, even though so far they have shown a remarkable degree o fresilience.

111. THE PUBLICADMINISTRATIONREFORMPROGRAM
OVERVIEWOFTHE PROGRAM

27. The PARPincludes a number of reforms and policy actions over the period2003-08 leading to
important achievement (Table 4). These actions aim at (a) improving government efficiency in the
management o f budget resources through greater transparency, accountability, and by introducing
performance measurement; (b) improving government efficiency in the management o f human resources
through the preparation o f a new management system for staffing and remuneration with performance
measurement, while streamlining current human resources management; (c) consolidating and controlling
public payroll decrease; and (d) improving public services and simplifying procedures through e-
government All components o f this program are now well under way, and their objectives remain valid.

REFORM STATUSAND PENDINGACTIONS

29. Significant progress has indeed been achieved, but an important set of reforms lies ahead.
Besides materializing initial results, and heading in the right direction, the PARP i s at a crossroads in
facing the following challenges: (a) generalizing pilot experiences in budgetary management throughout
the central administration, deconcentrating public services and introducing a new Organic Budget Law;
(b) completing the implementation o f a new human resource management system, which now requires to
approve a new standardjob classification and the reform o f the remuneration system; (c) preserving the
declining trend o f the wage bill, so as to reach its target; and (d) introducing e-government as a priority.
All these reforms should produce expected results by end-2009. For all these reasons, the Government
asked for the continuation o f World Bank support beyond PARL-111. Hence, the present description o f
the project contains progress accomplished so far and the elements identified as prior actions for an
eventual PARL-IV operation (see section N).

SUBPROGRAM A: IMPROVEBUDGETMANAGEMENT
                                EFFICIENCYIN
30. This subprogram aims at strengtheningbudget management to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of public spending. Key goals are:

        A multiyear budgeting perspective. This would allow for policies and strategies to be reflected
        fully by the budget while sustaining a sound macroeconomic stance and a multiyear viability o f
        existing and proposed programs and projects.
        Increased managerial autonomy of line ministries and their branch offices. They would have
        greater autonomy and accountability indesigning, and executing sector policies.

        Performance budgeting and reinforced auditing capacities.            The central administration and
        ministry branch offices would improve investment execution and generalize a culture o f
        contractual arrangements.
31. Overall, the programhas achieved good results, thanks to the strong Government ownership
(Table 5). Reforms initiated as pilot experiments have now significantly expanded to all ministries and
the new budget management techniques are in the process of being generated ffom pilot to common
practice. The PARL-I11 aims at continuing this transformation, while focusing on consolidation and
entrenchment o f the MTEF, more flexible budgeting, and deconcentration. Inaddition, the creation o f a
High Level Committee for preparing and studying revisions to the Organic Budget Law (OBL) should
help identify neededchanges to allow these reforms to become fully operational. The ensuing:paramaphs
describe progress ineach subcomponent and actions after Board presentation o f PARL-11.

Component A.1: Greater visibility of policies and their medium-term budgetary implications by
placingbudgetaryallocationdecisionsina multiyear framework

32. The objective of this component is to design and implement an aggregateMTEF. The MTEF i s
expected to set multiyear sector budget ceilings, while takmg into account sector MTEFs derived from
explicit intra- and intersector priorities. Thus, these ceilings are consistent with the Medium Term Fiscal
Framework (Tableau des Opirations Financizres de 1'Etat,MTFF), helping to ensure a more predictable
and transparent fiscal policy. In their pilot exercises, Government has decided to adopt a three-year
rolling MTEF(regularly updated), and to start development o f sector MTEFs.

33. PARL-I and 11. The original objectives supported by the PARLs are to introduce a multiyear
budgetingperspective, for sectors as well as at a consolidated level, and to ensure that sectoral MTEFs are
consistent with the overall medium term fiscal framework (MTFF). Programmatic Economic and Sector
Work (P-ESW) provided Moroccan authorities with perspectives on MTEF best practices abroad, and
helped Morocco adapt these methodologies to its unique needs in a Methodological Guide. Through a
ministerial instruction, the Government created an Interministerial Budget Commission in charge o f
defining the MTEFformat and selecting ministries incharge o fpreparingpilot sectoral MTEFs.

34. PARL-III. A MTEFwas prepared for the 2007 and 2008 budgets by pilot ministries. Two P-ESW-
supported seminars were organized in April 2006 and in April 2007, providing an opportunity to
disseminate the MTEF methodology to all ministries. The Ministries o f National Education, Housing,
Health, and Equipment were the pilots for draft sectoral MTEFs for 2007-09 (a trigger for PARL-111);
and a total o f 12 ministries prepared draft sectoral MTEFs for 2008-10 (of which 9 required by the prior
action o f PARL-111). Itremains to gradually extend the number o fparticipatingministries, to entrench the
multi-year budget perspective for sectors as well as at consolidated level, and to make sure that MTEFs
are consistent with the fiscal framework (MTFF). Thus, the government i s gradually adopting the MTEF
as a regular budgetary procedure.

Component A.2: Greater responsibility inbudgetary programming and execution for regionaland
provincialbranch offices.

1.       Generalizing budgetjlexibility andperformance indicators

35. Flexible budgeting (globalization) aims at increasing budget management autonomy for line
ministries and their branch offices through increased aggregation of budget allocations-by
grouping, first, items or "paragraphs" (paragraphes) for investment; and second, some non-salary current
expenditures. Managers (ordonnateurs) are thus allowed to reallocate within groups o f items without
having to request ex ante authorization from the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF). Ministries
engaged inthis new approach are required to prepare yearly performance reports. Performance budgeting
indicators nicely complement the budgeting tools introduced under flexible budgeting, and also reinforce
and improve the effects o f sector MTEFs.

36. PARL-I and II.A flexible budgeting procedure was adopted by 12 pilot ministries. Twenty-five
pilot ministries were included in the 2007 budget, representing about 70 percent o f the government's
capital investment budget.

37. PARL-III. The PARL-I11trigger required at least 20 ministries and it was met for 30 eligible
departments.     In light of CFAA recommendations, flexible budgeting could be deepened through a
budgetary reclassification. This implies regrouping a broader set o f budget items, which would further
increase branch offices autonomy. The budget nomenclature and accounting classifications have to be
reviewed and eventually revised in line with this new itemization o f expenditures, and without loss o f
information to remain compatible with standard GFS 2001. Amending the OBL is also critical to allow
for a reformulated presentation o f the budget by programs and sub-programs and formally instate
programs as the proper aggregation level for budget expenditure authorization.            This would lead to
institutionalizing, as part o fthe budget, sector objectives, performance indicators (intermediate and final),
and their expected targets.

38. Regarding monitoring and evaluation (M&E), as o f now, all ministries are publishing performance
indicators, together with their budget. The preliminary performance indicators are too numerous (more
than 1,400) and often fail to provide a strategic vision o f performance and achievement o f objectives.
Closer consultation between MEF and line ministries i s critical for converting them into a manageable,
clear and monitorable set o f performance indicators for the major expenditure programs, with
participation from frontline staff and users, and a clear division o f responsibilities on who does what to
support the M&E system. There i s also a need to improve performance reports. The Government has
decided to put together a worlung group to work in-depth on improving the selection and choice o f
indicators, establish the standards for their information systems, and improve the quality of performance
reports.   This group will also be in charge o f updating and adopting the methodological guide o f
performance monitoring.

2.       Increasing branch offices responsibilityfor budget management

39. Budget deconcentration i s part of a process to change an over-centralized environment, by devolving
more responsibilities to branch offices of Ministries. The approach to this objective has been twofold:
setting deconcentration as a Government priority policy, by adopting a decree setting a deconcentration
policy framework, reinforced by a royal speech inDecember 2006, and creating deconcentration tools in
every Ministry. Performance contracts between central and branch offices are to specify responsibilities
and budget allocations, and are to become standard features o f the budget system.

40. PARL-I and 11. A decree has been adopted in 2005, which gives guidelines for the organization o f
Ministries, and the allocation o f units, responsibilities, and staff between the centre and the field. It states
as a general principle that implementation functions should be carried out in field offices while central

                                                        15

administrations should keep only conceptual, strategic, and regulatory functions. A national strategy i s
under preparation, upon the King's request, by a Committee for Administrative Deconcentration. This
has delayed the development o f deconcentration master plans (Schkrnus directeurs de dbconcentrution,
SDD), requested to provide a detailed description o f the responsibilitiesto be devolved to branch offices:
the national strategy i s a prerequisite to the SDDs. Meanwhile, the engagement in the deconcentration
process i s already yielding encouraging results in terms o f increasing shares o f budget that i s
deconcentrated. During 2005-07, the rate o f deconcentrated budget has improved by two percentage
points inaverage, reaching 38.3 percent compared to 36.4 percent in2001-04.

41. PARL-III. The World Bank was asked to support the preparation o f a Methodological Guide
through its P-ESW, which was delivered on December 1, 2006. However, completion o f the trigger
"development and implementation o f SDDs by four ministries" has been postponed, and the
Methodological Guide i s yet to be endorsed, albeit it is currently used on an ad hoc basis inthe ministries
o f Health and Public Works. Similarly, performance contracting between central and branch offices i s
lagging in most Ministries. These contracts are to specify in detail objectives, means, and outcomes;
reporting on contract implementation has only recently been initiated (when the contracts exist).         On
performance contracts, only the Ministry o f Health fully formalized objectives/means/outcomes contracts
with its regional offices. The process o f adopting and approving the budgets o f the Regional Education
and Training Offices (AREFs) in the Ministry o f National Education i s close to this method, but not yet
formalized. Accordingly, the trigger o f concluding objectives/resources/results-based contracts for 2007-
09 has not been met yet. Inthe meantime, a substitutive prior action was met: the approval o f a circular
by the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF) simplifying the process o f budgetary credits
deconcentration. Such measure will contribute to reduce the time needed to transfer delegated credits to
deconcentratedunits, and ultimately to higher budget deconcentration rates.

42. Deconcentration should regain momentum in 2008. Once the announced national deconcentration
strategy i s adopted, it i s expected that the planned regionalization (giving more importance to the region)
will reinvigorate this process. As a result more powers will be delegated to regional and provincial
offices, including the management o fbudgetary and human resources. This will trigger a development of
Performance objectives/means/outcomescontracts betweencentral and deconcentrated units.

Component A.3:         Improving public performance through internal auditing, evaluation, and
performancecontrol

43. The objectives o f this component are to (a) strengthen a results-oriented budget management process
in central and deconcentrated units by introducing performance auditing tools and (b) upgrade basic
financial management procedures including internal auditing, evaluation, and controls. This will take
place as the traditional ex-ante control i s progressively replaced or complemented by a newly defined ex-
post control.

1.       Introducing performance auditing

44. PARL-I and 11. A performance audit manual that follows international standards was prepared and
adopted in December 2006.          Inspectors from both the General Inspectorate o f Finance (Inspection
Gknirale des Finances, IGF) and 14 General Inspectorate o f Ministries (IGMs) have been trained using
this manual, and about 50 IGM inspectors have been trained in the basics o f performance auditing.
However, the weakness o f the technical capacities o f the IGMs constrains their immediate autonomous
development (though this remains a long-term objective), which i s why joint IGF/IGMs performance
audit missions have been conducted in 13 ministries that adopted flexible budgeting to audit the 2004,
2005, and 2006 budgets.

45. PARL-HI. In light o f CFAA recommendations, the IGMs need to be strengthened through an
institutionalized, though temporary, partnership with the IGF. The IGF will play a leading role by

                                                        16

providing, at the IGM level, better dissemination, coordination, and standardization o f audit
methodologies. Additional efforts are also to be made in the areas o f training, skills development, and
monitoring o f audit methodologies, primarily on issues related to government finance, accounting, and
financial analysis. Inthis direction, further training and joint performance audits o f the 2007 budget are
scheduled to be started for 20 pilot ministries in July 2008, Internal audit also needs a legal support to
acknowledge inspectorates' additional role as performance auditors (whereas for the IGF, the ongoing
draft law will need to pass, for the IGMs a single decree would suffice). Finally, emphasis should be
placed on training related to government contracting, in particular by the General Treasurer o f the
Kingdom (TGR), so that IGMs are better positioned to meet their legal obligation to perform annual
audits o f all contracts inexcess o f MADS million.

2.      Improving basicfinancial managementprocedures

46. PARL-I and 11. On budget accounting, two draft decrees revise the modalities o f controls by the
accountant, and lay out a new Chart o f Accounts buthave yet to be adopted. The new methodology, still
based on the cash basis, introduces some elements o f accrual accounting. On expenditure control, new
manuals for procurement and expenditure controls have also been prepared and disseminated by the
Comptroller General o f Expenditures Commitments (ContrGle Gen&ral des Engagements de Depenses,
CGED), now organically linkedto the TGR and still in charge o f ex ante internal controls. As a result,
5,200 agents have been trained in both control offices and line ministries.            The TGR has also
implementedreforms that resulted ina sharp decrease inpayment delays.

47. PARL-III. A study launched by the MEF on expenditure control was completed in April 2006 (a
trigger for PARL-111). Following on the recommendations o f the above-mentioned study, an incoming
decree gradually reorganizes ex ante expenditure control (transferred to TGR) and facilitates
deconcentration. The number o f procedures required from the ordonnateurs has been reduced by half.
Another decree, which establishes graduated expenditure control by IGF, ranks deconcentrated ministries'
budget units on a scale o f 1 to 3 for their management capacity. This rating conditions the degree o f ex
ante control to be retained. The account manager certification procedure (certzjkation des ordonnateurs)
i s scheduled to be introduced in 2008 over a three-year period (more than 1,700 certifications are
required, o f which 159 are by the IGF and some 1,500 are by the TGR). It i s important to continue and to
strengthen the training o f certifiers and to train instructors within the IGF and the TGR. For account
managers, an interministerial training plan i s also necessary. Financial management reforms will be
complemented by continued deployment o f the Integrated Budget Management (Gestion Intf?gr&e des
Depenses, GID) computerized systems.

ComponentA.4: Reformingthe Organic BudgetLaw

48. The consolidationof severalactions conductedunderthe PARPnow requiresthe revisionof the
OBL, with PARL-111support. Not originally included inthe PARP, this measure, as recommended by
the CFAA 2007, i s now considered essential for the followingreasons:
        Budget management reform has been carried out thus far through pilot testing and by limiting
    regulatory changes to a strict minimum (mostly by decree), which is now insufficient for further
     expansion o f budget management reforms. Indeed, it requires important changes (but not solely) in
     areas regulated by the organic law, such as budget nomenclature (programmatic nomenclature),
    accounting classification and chart o f accounts, accounting methodology, auditing o f public financial
    accounts, staffing appropriation management system, and the budget expenditure authorization
    process.
        The new Government considers the new OBL as critical not only for its intention to deepen
    budget management reform, but to promote a deconcentrated, decentralized, and regionalized
    results-oriented budgetingprocess.


                                                      17

         The overall consistency o f the pilot tests conducted to date should be strengthened in a
    comprehensive legal framework that defines the general architecture o f budget reform and reflects the
    Government's political commitment to it, thus sending national actors and the international
    community a clear sign o f Morocco's willingness to modernize its system o f government finance.
49. The new Prime Minister, in his inaugural speech, has clearly indicated the Government's
intention to initiate preparatory work toward the approval of a revised OBL. The World Bank will
provide the groundwork support to it. Intotal, an initial period o f roughly 24 to 30 months o f work
appears realistic. If a high-level workmg committee is rapidly set up by early 2008, a draft could be
submitted in 2009 and adoption o f the new OBL could thus be expected for 2010.'                      Inthe meantime,
preparatory work toward a new budget nomenclature and chart of accounts shouldbe concluded.

SUBPROGRAMB: IMPROVEEFFICIENCY HUMAN                   IN           RESOURCESMANAGEMENT             (HRM)

50. The objectives of the program are to modernize the current civil service by putting competences
and performance at the core o f the new system while keeping a career system. It also creates modern
HRMtools to adapt civil service to key public sector missions and to manage staff in a more efficient
manner. The new remuneration system, together with the mainstreaming o f the RECs, will be a key
achievement in the overall HR reform program. It i s an in-depth structural reform that transforms civil
service architecture inthe medium term, while inthe short term it eases current management constraints:

     0   Structural reform. It will improve consistency between staffing and its mission and salary, by the
     creation o f a newjob classification, which will in turn also serve as the basis for a new remuneration
     system.

     0   Current HRM reform.                It improves recruitment and mobility procedures, changes rules for
     evaluation and promotion, and strengthens professional in-service training.

51. International experience suggests that the scope and depth of the reform commands care and
consensus building: no civil service reform of similar content has ever been completed in half a
decade (in a civil peace context). Moreover, Morocco i s a precursor o f this lundo f HRMreform within
the French tradition administrative system, and therefore lacks reference to lessons from other countries'
success or failure stories. The World Bank P-ESW together with technical assistance from the EU i s
therefore instrumental both interms of technical support and o fpolicy dialogue and advisory capacity.

Component B.l: HRMstructural reform

I.       StrategicStaffing Frameworks (RECs) and related tools

52. The RECs provide basic tools to (a) adapt structures and staff to each ministry's mission, (b)
identify the existingjob families to replace the existing staffing structures (corps and cadres d 'emplois),
(c) evaluate individual performance more accurately, (d) design training plans so that staff can adapt to
changing demands, (e) organize redeployment o f staff as a complement to deconcentration and as a tool
for service delivery improvement. Major management tools generated by the RECs are rolling jobs and
skills management scorecards (GPEECs), HR computerised databases, and rolling in-service training
plans.

53. PARL-I and 11. The MEF and the Ministry o f Public Sector Modernization (MMSP) started their
Strategic Staffing Frameworks (RECs). The first ministries to complete their RECs have developed tools
for GPEECs, such as performance charts and slulls assessments, rolling staff management scorecards, HR
computerized databases, and in-service training plans.

' An important factor in supporting this outcome would be finalization o f the GID system, which implies satisfactory
implementation o f the first stage o f deployment o f the new information systemb y the end of 2008.

                                                                  18

54. PARL-III. Completion o f the REC process in the first four Ministries in 2006 and initiation in an
additional four Ministries in 2006 were original triggers for PARL-111and have been met. These are the
biggest Ministries in terms o f variety o fjobs and staff numbers. A total o f 6 ministries have finished their
RECs, representing at least 80 percent o f total civil service (Agriculture, Economic and General Affairs,
Transport and Equipment, Economy and Finance, National Education, and Public Sector Modernization).
Other Ministries have started their REC in2007, bringingthe number o f participants to 21 (out o f 34). In
2008, the plan i s for some 24 ministries and other public entities (a total o f 32) to be involved in the REC
process.

2.      Newjob classification

55. The corps and cadres system i s expectedto be deeply changedwith the new job family system.
Currently, 70 or so statutes affect job classification. This proliferation imposes constraints that impede
mobility and fuel intercorps competition for pay raises. It i s the new job classificationthat should allow
authorities to address the present constraints and negative effects o f the corps system.

56. PARL-I and II.An action plan for harmonizing personnel regulations and drafting o f decrees on
administrative employment was concluded by end-2005. New jobs families were identified from the
REC process. The Ministry o f Public Sector Modernization (MMSP) has also worked to merge 22
statutes for all administrative jobs into three, but draft decrees have not yet made their way to government
councils.

57. PARL-III. The MMSP launched the study on the job classification in a standard classification in
December 2006 (a trigger for PARI,-111). It i s expected that, with technical assistance from the EU and
support from the P-ESW, the new job classification will be completed by end-2008. It i s expected that
the three unified statutes for administrative jobs will be finalized by end-2008.

3.      New remuneration system

58. A new remunerationsystemthat will result in a morepredictableand slow growingwage bill is
a priority, and is needed by HRM reforms described above. The current remuneration system in
Morocco has been distorted by ad hoc pay raises in the form o f bonuses to each and every corps
successively, a process initiated in 1996 and concluded in2005, which reached its full wage bill impact in
2006. As a result, today payroll consists o f a low base salary, and up to 80 percent o f the overall
remuneration inbonuses insome instances.

59. PARL-I and II.Supported by P-ESW, the Government finalized terms o f reference for a one-year
study on reforming the remuneration system in2006. The study will be informed by preliminary results
o f the RECs, and by the new classification for job families and positions. The study will consists o f three
sections: (a) first, the Government i s to be provided with best practices in remunerations reform; (b)
second, it will benefit from an updated diagnosis o f current distortions; and (b) thrd, proposals will be
submitted to create a new remunerationsystem inline with the newjob classification.

60. PARL-III. This study has been launched end-March 2008. Delays are partially attributable to
lengthy administrative procedures to secure financing for the study from donors and institutional
resistance. Thus, the trigger as originally set was not hlly met, and reformulation o f the measure was
needed. However, despite the lengthy process, the study i s now taking off. It i s expected that building on
the study, the government will come up with a more transparent and equitable remunerationsystem.

ComponentB.2: CurrentHRMsystemreform

61. The above-mentioned structural reforms are far reaching, and their implementation requires time. In
the short term, however, the HRM system i s also being improved to ease current bottlenecks. Proposed

                                                       19

reforms would affect mobility, locally based competitive recruitment exams, wage bill appropriations,
and HRMdeconcentration at the sector level (and inthe distant future, the branch offices). However, for
the time being, importantreformactions are stalling, for lack o f legal endorsement.

1.       Recruitment and mobility

62. PARL-I and 11. A bill was prepared modifying the general civil service statutes reforming
recruitment, mobility, secondment, and external assignment.              The bill opens the possibility o f
redeployment, making competitive examination the sole hiring mode and creating contract employment
by the State. Ithas been voted by the Lower Chamber, but is now held up the Upper Chamber to explore
at length financial incentives for redeployed employees.           Draft implementation decrees have been
prepared, but they cannot be implemented without the law. Although a highpriority for the MMSP and
the new Government, redeployment cannot be fully launched for lack o f incentives for candidates. A job
exchange website has been developed, with limited success for the time being.

2.       Evaluation andpromotion

63. PAW-I and 11. Two decrees were adopted in early December 2005 reforming promotions and
establishing new and transparent procedures for performance evaluation. The first decree set quotas on
promotion opportunities and retroactively confirmed the special promotions that took place between 1996
and 2004. The second decree amplified the traditional procedure o f annual rating with an evaluation
procedure that must take place at least once every two years and which i s presented as a prerequisite for
any new appointment or promotion. Performance evaluation plays a determining role in employees'
eligibility for future promotions (half o f the quota i s for best performance). However, since quotas were
not put in place in the evaluation process, a survey conducted by the MMSP has shown that Ministries
tended to pushratings to the higher levels, thus malung it necessary to revise the evaluation procedure to
introduce quotas inthe ratings as well.

3.       In-service training

64. PARL-I and II.A decree adopted in early December 2005 focuses on in-service training for civil
servants and government employees. A national strategy has been finalized and the MMSP has identified
the engineering needs of in-service training, and disseminated a methodology for developing both an in-
service training plan and the specifications for acquiring in-service training. The overall training budget
should increase by progressive steps to about 1percent o f the wage bill (it i s usually about 3 percent in
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) counties).

SUBPROGRAM       c:  CONSOLIDATE AND CONTROL PUBLICPAYROLL DECREASE

65. The key challenge inthis component remainsthe high, albeit decreasing,share of the wage bill
with respect to the country's income. After being one o f the highest inthe world, Morocco's wage bill
i s declining to a target ratio o f 10 percent o f GDP by 2010, which still i s highper international standards
(Figure 2). The wage bill also accounts for a very large share o f the Central Government's budget: In
2007, the wage bill accounted for 44 percent o f current expenditures and absorbed 47 percent o f tax
revenues. Highsalaries rather than excessive employment explain these ratios. InMorocco, on average,
public wages are more than twice as high, and have grown faster, than private wages in the last decade.
Incontrast, with respect to total population, the Government's size is smaller than similar ratios inLAC,
ECA, and the MENA regions: whereas Moroccan Central Government employees represent less than 3
percent o f total population, this ratio stands between 5 and 8 percent in all three regions. Assessed as a
share o f total employment, Morocco's Central government size also stands at less than 8 percent, while it
i s more than 14percent inthe three regions (Figure 3).

66. Despite the decreasing trend in wage bill growth i s encouraging, the Government's goal to
control public payroll in the medium term is complicated by the lack of budgetary ceilings on wage
bill appropriations by line ministries. This task is complicated by the lack o f a single administrative
entity in Morocco in charge o f its timely monitoring and management. The MEF makes projections
under the Budget Law, the Kingdom's Principal Paymaster (Paierie Principale des Re'munerations PPR)
pays salaries every month after due diligence, and sector ministries maintain day-to-day responsibility for
administrative management o f hiring and promotions.           However, the ministries are only indirectly
accountable for the budgetary implications o f their decisions in the wage bill. Indeed, wage bill
appropriations have no ceiling (cre'dits e'valuatifs), contrary to most o f the other budgetary appropriations,
which have a ceiling (cre'dits limitatif). As a result, the Government's attempts to control payroll growth
are limitedto its control over recruitments and, more recently, over future promotions.

67. While acknowledging that revision of the OBL is needed to formally introduce budget
appropriation ceilings (cridits Zimitutifi) to ministries, PARL-I11supports two types of preparatory
actions on this subprogram.             On one hand, it supports structural reforms o f the civil service
management system. The new civil service management system should consolidate control o f the wage
bill through a combination o f the gradual introduction o f tools leading to the introduction o f budget
ceilings in the medium term with enhanced monitoring, redeployment, and control o f staff numbers. On
the other hand, inthe short term the PARL also supports measures to mitigate the negative impact o fpast
arrears in granting promotions and filling o f vacant posts on wage bill growth. Together, those actions
should not only bring the wage bill to reach its target 10 percent o f GDP by 2012 or earlier, but to also
make it sustainable inthe medium term, while accommodating an "optimal" size o fpublic servants.

Component C.l: Consolidation of the monitoring and control of the wage bill

68. Solid and accurate forecasting and monitoring capacity i s a fundamental prerequisite for
controlling the wage bill. A recent study supported by the P-ESW concluded that the Government's
model for forecasting the wage bill is adequate, buthas room for improvement.

69. PARL-I and II. rolling projections of the wage bill were developed for 2005-08. These
                          Three-year
projections have been annually updated; however, deviations are registered ex post. A comparison o f
appropriations listed in the budget (projection) with actual expenditure (execution) yields the following
positive deviations: 2.6 percent for 2003, 3.2 percent for 2004, 2.0 percent for 2005, and 6.0 percent for



                                                       21

2006. Both the CFAA update and ongoing P-ESW analytical work have identified the main reasons for
forecasting deviations: The system shows weaknesses inthe following areas:

     0   High back payments, mainly resulting from a significant stock o f approved but unenforced
         (arrears) past promotions, and to a lower extent from regularization o f past recruitments and
         dismissals. Overall, they amounted respectively to 11.3 and 12.3 percent o f the wage bill in2005
         and 2006, but the large bulk stem from promotions in arrears that represented about 8.7 and 8.3
         percent of the wage bill in 2005 and 2006 (that i s about two thirds o f total back pay). Data on
         back pay per ministry show that about 75 percent o f the back payments in2006 were generatedat
         the Ministryo f Education.
         To a lesser extent, newhiring. Innet terms, the number ofnew persons hiredhas decreased from
         14,181 in 2006 to 10,520 in 2007, but above former Prime Minister's ceiling of 7,000 positions.
         Bypassing the ceiling took place through the filling o f vacant budgetedpositions (a total o f 7,300
         positions filled in 2006). However, the number of persons hired through this mechanism will
         decrease as, first, the stock of vacant positions has become very small (now representing 14,335
         by end-2007 or less than 2 percent of the total civil service), especially at the ministry of
         education which has made most use of this hiringprocedure (4,918 positions filled in2006 only);
         and, second, a good share of new hiring regularized persons already worlung under a different
         contractual arrangement, with their regularization only having a marginal impact on the wage bill.

70. PARL-III. Mainly as a result o f the ERP, the Government has reducedthe payrollto 10.8 percent of
GDP in2007, and it projects a payroll ratio of 10.4 percent o f GDP in2008, all in line with a 10 percent
of GDP target by 2010. In addition, a Prime Ministerial circular was issued in 2007 to speed up the
regularization of past promotion of civil servants and government employees, and set new deadlines for
processing of requests. Its impact already appears to be significant inreducingthe volume of back pay
over 20072 and thus reducing forecasting errors of the wage bill to 4 percent. Consequently, back pay
receded to 8.5 percent o f the wage bill in 2007, almost 4 percentage points less than that of 2005-06.
Most of the gain came from a streamlined promotion process, combined with better monitoring o f the
hiringand the use of vacant positions. Ministries didnot use all the 2007 budgeted positions, except for
those of education, health and security, reflecting the priority given by the government to fill the gaps in
the social sectors.

71. With PESW support, the Government intends to improve its forecasting and monitoring capacity with
a strengthened payroll model and the creation of a wage bill monitoring body. The latter will develop
quarterly ex ante monitoring of actual promotions, recruitment, and uses of vacant positions and their
provisional impact on the wage bill. Based on the payrollmodel and its monitoring, the Government will
produce a corresponding quarterly report exposing, among other things, the evolution o f sectoral
personnel expenditures and their main determinants.                      In-year corrective measures would also be
introduced, following quarterly reviewso fpersonnel expenditures. This would also lead sector ministries
to monitor their promotion and hiring levels more often, thus diminishingtheir stock o f the promotions
backlog.

ComponentC.2: Qualitative re-profiling of the civil service

72. The age pyramid and the staff profile have been modified by the Early Retirement Program
(ERP). Inthe next five years, the number of annual public servantsretiringwill double from about 5000
public servants retiring under normal conditions in2007, to about 11,500 in 2012. The profile of civil


 The purpose of the Prime Minister's circular of March 22,2007, is to simplify the administrative procedures inhumanresources
management. In particular, it states that, before actually recruiting a civil servant, the government must make sure that all
required documents for his or her integration at grade level have been provided. The circular lays out simplifications of certain
instruments that often slow the regularization process. In this regard, the circular calls on the Government to regularize within
two months the status ofrecruitedcivil servants.

                                                               22

service has also been affected by marginal personnel redeployment from overstaffed to understaffed
regions and deconcentrateddirectorates, inline with the changingneeds o fpublic administration.

73. PARL-I and 11. The ERP was completed in 2005. Retirement was voluntary, although ministries
had the right to refuse applications where positions were considered crucial. The operation was very
successful. More than 52,500 applications were received; about 38,600 were accepted (approximately 8
percent o f the civil service).      The ERP has produced a relative improvement in the qualitative
characteristics o f civil servants, especially by malung the civil service younger due to the age structure o f
ERPbeneficiaries, the majority o fwhom are over 50 years of age. The ERPhas also resultedina partial
reduction o f the disparities in the regional distribution of civil servants at the expense o f the central
regions (Casablanca, Fez, Rabat).       However, the ERP has not led to a significant reduction in the
proportion o f employees ranked at the bottom o f the scale. Still, it should be noted that the measure taken
to prohibit recruitment at wage levels 1to 4 should, over time, help improve the ratio o f managerial staff
inthe civil service.

74. PARL-III. Authorities have indicated that they intend to take advantage o f the RECs and the
adoption o f new legislation to significantly redeploy personnel from overstaffed to less-served areas.
Deconcentration o f recruitment should also guide redeployment policies. Positions liberated through
regular retirement inoverstaffed areas to be identified shouldbe eliminated. Within the hiringceilings set
by the authorities, recruitment should be reallocated to priority sectors such as education, health, security,
and justice, and to underserved regions and prohibition o f hiringstaff at the lower scales (1 to 4) o f civil
service needs to be continued.

Component C.3: Introduction of best practices in the monitoring, forecast and payroll credit
managementinlineministriesand stabilizationof the number of civilservants

75. Line ministries manage recruitment and promotions without due regard to their impact on
personnel expenditures. Personnel credits are not constrained by any ceiling. In general, the actual
wage bill exceeds the budgeted figure, malung control o f the wage bill problematic. Inthe medium term,
developing line ministries' capacity for managing personnel credits, supported by ceilings, would lead to
an efficient control o f the wage bill. At present, ministries that do have MTEFs and performance
budgeting do not manage salaries. Inthe extreme case o f education, this means that about 94 percent o f
their recurrent expenditure budget i s excluded.

76. Keepingthe number of new hiring low would contribute to meetingthe payrollratio target set
for 2009. The Government intends to maintain a ceiling on yearly recruitments. Past agreed ceilings of
7,000 positions freed annually through normal retirement and contained in the 2006 and 2007 budgetary
laws have failed. The ceiling set contrasts with a higher number o f people actually hired in 2006 and
2007. And the creation o f 16,000 posts (9,000 innet terms) approved in the 2008 Budget L a w points to
an enlarged ceiling. Authorities argue that additional recruitments are exceptionally needed this year to
reformthe military pension system, fill the exceptional needs o f security services, and regularize teachers
and health workers that are already working under a temporary status, which actually reduces their impact
on the wage bill. Inthe future, however, Authorities are proposing to stabilize public servants growth at
some "optimal" size that takes into account increasing departures o f public servants, geographic priorities
for personnel redeployment, and new priorities, like increased security needs. Figure 4 depicts three
possible scenarios for the wage bill growth trends under three alternative public sector employment
scenarios in the near term: (a) zero net recruitment, (b) keeping the wage bill constant at 10 percent o f
GDP, and (c) keepingthe ratio public servants to populationconstant. It i s important to notice that intwo
out o f the three scenarios, the wage bill declines; and only in the second one, it remains constant by
assumption.

the ceiling by filling the stock of vacant posts. According
to the Authorities, the stock of vacant posts now appears        I 8
considerably reduced to about 14,000 positions down from
20,500 positions in2005.

78. PARL-III. The Government is committed to a gradual introduction o f best practices in personnel
expenditure management in line ministries, thus preparing them to the gradual introduction o f budget
appropriation ceilings (crddits limitatif) to personnel expenditures. Four pilot ministries-Finance,
Education, Health, and Housing) would take the lead, followed by others in a later stage. Once the new
OBL i s approved, all ministries would follow. Best practices also involve good monitoring and
forecasting capacity, developed by. To this end, the Government issued a circular creating an
interministerial Group. The group would also set clear goals in the area of recruitment control, revising
explicit prohibitions, and once agreed, made their enforcement more effective through regular monitoring
of new hiring and the stock o f vacant posts. Last, but not least, line ministries would gradually move to
manage their wage bill appropriations. PARL-I11 would support the development o f a three-year action
plan on personnel expenditure management as follows: (a) training the four pilot ministries during the
first year (2008), (b) test management and accounting procedures in the four pilot ministries during the
second year (2009), and (c) progressive generalization of these procedures to other ministries during the
third year (2010). At the end of this process, and in combination with the projected approval of the new
OBL, newpayroll managementprocedures can be accompanied byrestrictive payroll appropriations.

SUBPROGRAMD:E-GOVERNMENT SIMPLIFICATION OF PROCEDURES
                                      AND

79. This new subprogrampromotesthe development of e-government as a key complementarytool
for Morocco's public administrationreforms. It focuses on e-government to simplify procedures and
thus improve the efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability of the administrations. In
addition, it uses e-government as an enabler of changes in behaviors, processes, and organization to
transformthese public entities.

80. The new Government has made the inclusion of e-government a key priority in its intentionto
simplify public procedures and achieve efficiency gains in public administration management
(Annex 5).    The PARAP takes into account the current e-government program in the country, and
includesthree key components identified as critical for the success o fthe programaiming at:

       Improving the institutional structure to enhance e-government program coordination, facilitation,
       and leadership across the administration;

       Ensuring that the vertical applications have high quality and depth, provide accelerated service
       benefits to citizens andbusinesses, and deliver demonstrative results to the public; and

       Strengthening horizontal foundations in order to provide a stronger "backbone" for the e-
       government program, and to minimize back-office issues across multiplelayers o f government and
       sectors.



                                                    24

ComponentD.l: Improvethe institutionalframework and governmentleadership

81. E-government cuts across all public departments and sectors of the economy to deliver
innovative services and transform administrations. E-government provides opportunities for sharing
resources and processes, and integrating services and delivery platforms. Therefore, it presents unique
challenges for traditionally "silo"-driven administrations, because it requires institutional arrangements
and coordinationmechanisms that ensure the coherence o f policies and investments across all sectors. In
addition, it requires change leaders to help other government officials see the possibilities offered, and to
drive the vision o f transformation through administrations.

82. The current institutionalframework in Morocco is complex. This i s an obstacle to the rapid
implementation o f e-government strategies at the operational level, and limits the use o f e-government as
a tool for public administration reforms. Moreover, the e-government program lacks a unique change
leader to marshal program support, drive shared services, and to be the visible "face" o f the e-government
program.

83. PARL-III. To set up a clearly identified governance structure for e-government leadership,
coordination, and facilitation in Morocco, a Pnme Minister's letter should create a governance structure
with the authority, credibility, funding, and visibility to guide public sector action in the e-government
program. The responsibility in the e-government area should be clearly attributed to this governance
structure, which would involve different Ministerial departments, assisted by a strong and competent
secretariat. In addition, this governance structure should have cross-cutting oversight and be able to
coordinate the design and deployment o f e-government services across agencies, in alignment with
ongoing public sector reforms. The governance structure would cut across different themes, such as
identification and dissemination o f technical standards and processes, harmonization o f record
management, backup and storage, security, privacy, and authentication.

ComponentD.2: Improvementof public services and simplificationof proceduresby meansof
administrationonline (e-government)

1.e-Customs

84. An efficient and effective customs system improves the public administration in terms of
revenue collection, combating fraud and illegal trafficking, encouraging internationaltrade, and
providingstatisticalinformationonforeigntrade for economicplanning. InMorocco, the e-Customs
system i s migrating toward an improved system dubbed Automatic Customs Network Database (Base
Automatisbe des Douanes en Rbseau, BADR). This new system provides businesses, shippers, and
customs agents ready access to declarations through the Internet. It consists o f several online services
such as custom guarantees, clearance o f vehicles or motorcycles, and status and progress check in real
time. As a result, clearance time has been reduced from five days to less than an hour, and electronic
payments are currently available. BADR i s also connected to the integrated budget information system,
the tax system, and the Direction Gdndrale des Imp&.       However, the migration has not been completed,
and the system i s undergoinga final audit o f the quality o f the system.

85. PARL-III. The objective i s to increase transparency, accountability, and access by providing
comprehensive customs procedures online, and to expand the use o f this system in order to accelerate the
realization o f benefits across the country. Therefore, the migration to the online BADR platform should
be completed so that the public administration can improve this critical service and provide better access
to businesses.




                                                     25

2. E-Procurement

86. E-Procurement has proven to be a highly effective tool for public administration reforms, with
significant economic benefits. It increases procurement transparency, leading to lower prices, waste,
and corruption, and increases the speed andprocess efficiency o f public procurement, thereby minimizing
delays inbringingthe benefits o fthe procurement to the public.

87. The implementation of an e-Procurement system is ongoing in Morocco, and the website went
"live" in January 2007. The Parliament in October 2007 voted for mandatory use o f e-Procurement for
all government purchases, and the Prime Minister's Office i s expected to mandate its use to all agencies.
However, current usage o f the system is limited to the central level and it i s not used by local
governments, even though more than 50 percent o f total government procurement i s conducted by
municipalities. Moreover, not all o f the tender procedures are available online, including the submission
o f technical and financial offers by bidders.

88. PARL-III. The objective i s to expand the use system for government procurement so that its benefits
can be realized across the country. Hence, the e-Procurement system should be generalized at all levels
o f the administration, initially at the central level, and in second stage in local administration, starting
perhaps with major cities, and public entities. The functionalities included in this generalization should
include all functions related to a wide range o f phases o f the procurement process, including the
downloading o f offers, terms o f references, and tender results. The only phase which i s presently not
covered by the system i s the on-line submission o f offers. There are plans to introduce this feature in the
future. Training should also be provided to all stakeholders involved in central procurement for all
ministries, and the Government o f Morocco should provide a secure Internet platform that permits
interested businesses to submit tenders containing technical and financial offers electronically.

Component D.3: Strengthen horizontal measures in support of e-government: externalization,
normalization, and enterprise architecture

1.      Externalization

89. Externalization may bring multiple benefits. It can help relieve public administrations o f the
financial and administrative burden o f providing services. If placed within a Public-Private Partnership
framework, externalization also facilitates the sharing o f risks with the private sector, enable faster
deployment o f better services to constituents, and facilitate transfer o f know-how, best practices, and
methodology. Concurrently, governments can still retain an important role in regulating and monitoring
the performance o fprivate partners.

90. Morocco's e-government committee encourages the use of PPPs for new services. In addition,
Morocco has a good software/IT        private sector and existing programs that appear to be feasible for
outsourcing, such as e-Procurement, government portals and networks, and e-Human resources.
However, this approach had not been implemented for any e-government service to date, and there has
not been any feasibility study to assess the general viability and affordability o f PPP for these services.

91. PARL-III. The objective i s to realize the benefits o f externalization by implementing a study on the
externalization o f certain functions o f the Ministry o f Finance, and to assess the general viability of the
approach for e-government applications across the administrations.

2.      Interoperabilityframework and standard norms

92. A coherent interoperability framework is vital for a coordinated and integrated rollout of e-
government services.         Standard norms are needed to provide clear guidelines for achieving
interoperability across public administrations with regard to management o f information, and have to be

                                                       26

elaborated for the technologies involved. The use o f standard norms can also contribute to making web
services truly citizen-centric.       User-friendly technologies help to ensure universal access, and
standardized layout and navigation improves accessibility and usability for citizens with special needs or
low schooling, or to users o f different technological platforms.

93. Currently, there are no interoperability frameworks or standards for e-government in
Morocco. Concerns have been expressed in the Informatisation des Dipartements Administrat$s et leur
Mise en Riseau Adiquate via les Technologies de I'lnformation (IDARATI) program documents. In
addition, the current websites o f the public administrations inMorocco have substantially different layout,
functions, colors, information, and so forth; are not regularly updated; and do not offer basic content such
as contact information. The e-government Committee has recognizedthe importance o f such norms and
therefore identified several domains for normalization that relate to issues o f accessibility, content, and
navigation and formats, but the norms have not been developed to date.

94. PARL-III. This component aims to develop basic interoperability framework and standard norms, in
order for the e-government program to have the basic technical grounding for expansion. The framework
should cover technical standards, semantics, and organizational interoperability, with an emphasis on
flexibility, modular design, functionality, and support. Norms also need to be developed and embodied in
visuals, prepare manuals and technical guidelines covering issues related to usability, accessibility,
service uptime, graphic elements, content management, layout and basic functionalities, and so forth. Ina
first phase, a feasibility study will be conducted.

IV. THELOAN

RATIONALEFORBANKINVOLVEMENT

95. The Bank has valuable experience in supporting Morocco's public administration reform.
Despite delays in the implementation of two triggers, the Government ownership of the program
has been strong and the collaboration with the World Bank and other partners is excellent. The
Government has adopted a responsible fiscal policy to preserve macro stability and comprehensive public
administration reform to improve the efficiency o f public expenditure, while supporting quality public
services and enhancing budget transparency.        It is also proposing to extend reforms to introduce e-
government.

96. Building on PARL-I and 11, the proposed third operation i s justified by the need to preserve
momentum for consolidating medium-term reforms, while opening new areas of interest for the
Authorities, especially on e-government and its associated simplificationof procedures.InMorocco,
like inother countries, reforming the public administrationhas beenpolitically difficult. The Government
recognizes that the support and rigorous scrutiny o f the Bank through analytical and lending instruments
has been very useful in strengthening the hands o f the reformers in the face o f opposition elsewhere. As
discussed above, progress inimplementingthe reformprogram has been broadly on track, but it i s partial,
and in the absence o f a modem budgetary legal framework, it remains fragile.             Some actions or
components o f the reformhave experienced some delays, but all major elements o f the program are under
way, and most o f the detailed original actions agreed with the Government are still valid, as documented
by supervision missions bythe Bank and the EuropeanUnion, bythe PARL-IICR, andbythe ongoing P-
ESW. In addition, the Government expects that adding a component on e-Government will allow the
population to perceive early benefits inpublic service delivery, while enhancing the transparency o f some
o f its operations, especially public procurement.

97. The matrix revisedfor PARL-I11providesguidancefor actions on a future operation PARL-IV
relatedto this program. As was done for PARL-Iand 11,specific actions, singled out inthe new matrix
(see Annex 2), provide prior actions and benchmarks for the supervision o f this PARL-I11and for the
preparation o f PARL-IV.

The medium-term objectives o f PARL-I11 are to: (a) improve efficiency in government budget
management; (b) improve efficiency in government Human Resources Management; (c) continue to
decrease the public payroll; and (d) improve public services and simplify procedures through e-
government. The grant o f a new loan i s well justified by steady progress achieved inthe implementation
o f prior actions and expected further actions agreed with the Bank in the comprehensive matrix o f policy
reforms o f the Public Administration ReformProgram (PARP). From the Bank perspective and because
o f its internal procedures, the proposed loan will be the first o f a new series o f annual programmatic
loans. However, the name PARL-I11will be kept to show the continuity with the previous series o f loans
(PARL-I and 11) supporting implementation o f the reform program. The need for a fourth loan has been
identified. Key prior actions for PARL-I11and proposedprior actions for PARL-IV are described below.
FUTURE     PROSPECTS

99. The support of the PARLAto the implementation of the PAW has gonethrough several related
stages. The first phase o f the government program emphasized its overall design and internal
consistency, while implementing critical prior actions. The second phase o f the government program
introducednew management tools, sometimes on a pilot basis, while focusing on measures to contain the
wage bill. PARL-I11sets the stage for consolidating not only the pilot cases, but for introducing new
elements o f reform.

100. Two main reasons justify the continuation of Bank's support through a possible PARL-IV
operation. First, the proposed operation would allow the generalization and conclusion o f all o f the
reforms that were envisioned inthe PARP in key areas such as MTEF, performance budgeting, HRM, de
concentration, and payroll control; second, a PARL-JY operation would permit a smooth accommodation
o f new and important complementary elements o f reform that will contribute to its consolidation.
Overall, a follow-on operation would not only allow close monitoring along the path toward
consolidation, but it would permit the introduction o f complementary technical assistance required by
reforms in areas like the Organic Budget Law, auditing, and e-government.

PRIORACTIONSFORP m - I v

101.      The consolidation and deepening o f ongoing reforms justify the prior actions identified for
P A R L - N that follow:

         MTEFs generalization:       Extending the MTEF to 5 new ministries will allow its gradual
          generalization, enhanced linkage with the preparation o f the annual budget law, and a major
          contribution to define target indicators o f sectoral policies, while reorienting budget funds
          accordingly.

         Budget deconcentration.      While waiting for approval o f the deconcentration strategy, the
          Government intends to implement several actions that will facilitate its future implementation
          under the fi-amework o f results-oriented budgeting. The signing o f 3 pilot performance contracts
         between the two key social ministries-health   and education-is  key inthis direction.

        Production of performance audits and the consolidated report by the IGF. This measure will
        contribute to the development o f results-oriented budgeting in line ministries. It is a central
        requirement for the improvement o f performance indicators and for achieving a consensus
        between donors and the Government on policy orientations.           The present indicators are too
        numerous and need to be drastically reduced and their quality improved. The consolidated report
        will summarize such efforts.

        New control system of public expenditure. This major measure completes the reform o f the a
        priori control o f public expenditure. Initiated in 2006, this measure merges the former
        organization incharge o f it with Treasury. Hence, it simplifies the a priori control, without losing
        its efficiency and reliability.

        New standard job classzjkation. This i s a central tool derived from the strategic staffing
        frameworks and i s a major contribution to the modernization o f public administration. It will

        Completion of the study of the new remuneration system. According to the expected schedule,
        completion o f the diagnostic and the technical adjustments are the central inputs for the future
        dialogue and preparation o fthe critical reform scenarios o f the new system.

        Quarterly monitoring of the wage bill.        Good forecasting and monitoring are needed to
        consolidate payroll decrease (as a percentage to GDP). The Commission created will monitor
        payroll trends while improving forecasting tools and proposing corrective measures when
        deviations appear. The requiredreport will be the major regular output o f such efforts.

        Generalization of best practices in monitoring,forecast, and management of personnel credits by
        line ministries.    In the medium term, a sound control of the wage bill requires active
        administrative management by each ministry within limited allocations o f the initial budget law.
        The useful lessons collected from the experience o f the 4 pilot ministries during2008 will ensure
        that the process could be deepened and consolidated.

        Setting aframework for the information society and e-government. This major effort i s essential

        Generalization of the e-procurement system. This improvement will have a major impact on the
        system's users that participate in online transactions.    It will also allow a bigger number of
        transactions and lower costs. International experience in countries like Chile and Estonia show
        that savings equivalent to 10 to 20 percent are obtained from the use o f online procurement
        services as markets become more competitive and the number o fbids increase. So, as the number
        o f firms participating in the e-procurement website increases, it will allow a more transparent
        procurement system, less prone to the risk o f corruption, and facilitating universal access to
        public bidsonline.

efficiency o f public administration, and with the CAS Progress Report submitted to the Board on
November 13, 2007. The proposed loan i s part of the CAS base case and high case scenarios, and the
decline in the wage bill as a share o f GDP is a trigger for fast-disbursing adjustment lending. The
proposed loan complements and strengthens the ongoing multiyear Programmatic Economic Sector Work

(P-ESW) activity through which the World Bank i s providing the Government with advice, training, and
technical assistance as required inthe areas o f budgetary management, civil service reform, and wage bill
containment. A related Memorandum o f Understanding on Programmatic Economic and Sector Work i s
updated and agreed on an annual basis.          The proposed loan also complements other World Bank
operations benefiting from MTEF work, like those ongoing in education and water, or completed
analytical studies inareas like health.

POVERTYAND ENVIRONMENT             ASPECTS

103.      Public administration reforms aiming at improving the internal efficiency o f the public sector are
difficult to evaluate using Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) tools.          The social impact o f
reforms, such as those supported by PARL-111, can be approached through its indirect effects on welfare
o f different groups. These are:


     0     Direct welfare effects of the ERPwere positive and equity-enhancing. The program resulted
     in an overall net positive increase in savings, wealth and welfare, particularly o f ERP participants,
     because o f the severance payments granted, thus broadly offsetting the negative consumption effect
     o f their wage lost (see Annex 6 for details).      At the macro level, aggregate GDP should have
     increased as a result not only o f higher savings (and related investment, especially inhousing), but o f
     additional wages resulting from private sector employment o f many retired civil servants. And at the
     micro level, as public servants are not located at the bottom part o f poverty and vulnerability indexes,
     any eventual decrease in their welfare should have had nil effects on poverty. Finally, as most ERP
     participants were senior staff, the program moved up younger staff to higher positions; thus
     increasing their revenues as well.


     0     Fiscal savings from the ERP-equivalent to about one percent of GDP-were              positive and
     have the potentialto increase the fiscal space to be reallocated to social programs. Strengthening
     social protection i s one o f the main objectives o f the current Government, which i s takmg steps to
     improve targeting and coverage o f the social protection system.


     0     Service delivery resulting from the ERP has improved, despite minor concerns on service
     coverage in the rural areas. Initially, the departure o f teachers and health workers could have
     temporarily worsen the shortage o f the supply o f public servants, especially teachers and health
     workers in the rural areas. However, studies show that understaffing in those areas existed long
     before the ERP and that overstaffing was rather concentrated in administrative staff located in urban
     areas-mainly    Rabat and Casablanca-with      very low poverty incidence and relatively good access to
     services. In addition, the refusal rates o f ERP applications were higher in these two ministries-
     Education (41 percent) and Health (32 percent), showing action to retain staff critically needed to
     deliver services. Inany event, inthe last two years, these two ministries have hadpriority to combine
     new hiringwith limitedredeployment focused on remote areas.

           The gender bias of the ERP was minimal, as it resulted in a slightly higher incidence in
     women than inmen: 8.3 percent o f total female civil servants departed versus 7.2 percent among male
     employees. Therefore, gender balance inthe public administrationhas not been affected.

104.      Overall, there are more gainers than losers from the implementation of the PARL reforms.
Table 7 summarizes the impact o f PART, based on the existing knowledge o f transmission channels,
groups or institutions be affected (see also Annex 6). It shows what are impacts' expected direction and
order o f magnitude on the groups likely to be most affected. Overall, the effects are not likely to be large.
Butthere arebothpositive and negative effects. The table also provides a list o fstakeholderswhich are

likely to be affected by the reform, positively or negatively. For the poor, especially rural children and
rural women, the risk o f negative impacts comes from the localized effects on public services (health and
education) from ERP discussed above. Against this positive effects include improved financing o f key
programs, accountability and motivation for improving quality o f public services, and direct effects on
employment and earnings o f the poor. The negative effects on the non-poor have been contained and have
not led to any serious opposition to the reform efforts. The Government is very keen to mitigate the
negative social impacts. These two ministries were allowed to hire new junior staff in numbers far
exceeding hires by any other ministry inview to deploy them inunderserved rural areas. The program o f
reforms itself was aiming at generating productivity gains in the delivery o f public services, increase
accountability and improve quality o f services, thus mitigating temporary effects coming fi-om the
reduction o f the personnel. The further progress in the reform will be accompanied by systematic
monitoring o f the delivery o f public services through existing the M I S of sectoral ministries and through
the additional work initiated under the technical assistance. Hence, the loan has many elements with
potentially very positive effects on the Moroccan poor in the medium term. Materializing these effects
can also benefit from technical assistance and P- ESW additional support through the implementation o f
the reforms. Close monitoring o f the program and analysis o f its effects can also help to substantially
improve the poverty reduction effectiveness o f this operation inthe future. This will be done through the
use o f integrated household surveys (supported under the poverty work) and by piloting and
mainstreaming the use o f report cards o f the public service beneficiaries fi-om different socioeconomic
groups.

LESSONSLEARNED       FROMP m - 1AND P m - 1 1

105.    The 2007 Quality at Entry (QAE) assessment for PARI,-I1 emphasizes the need for
including a more explicit link between the technical actions supported by the program and how
these would actually impact and improve outcomes. It says that the indicators o f the PARL-I and I1
program documents were essentially outputs that reduce the perception o f PARLs impact, inparticular on
better service delivery (or eventually poverty reduction indicators related to the initial MTEFs). In
response, the present project document includes more explicit outcomes o f the PARLs, while better
summarizing what has been achieved so far, and clarifying what remains to be done under PARL-111. A
specific annex i s dedicated to the PARLs outcomes (see Annex 4). In addition, the PARL team also
verified that work under the pilot sector MTEFs i s barely at its starting point, and besides being helpful in
the preliminary design o f the set o f performance indicators, it would, however, be premature to expect
any early impact on outcomes.

 106.   The QAE assessmentpointsout the absenceof a socialandpovertyimpact assessment. This
has been taken into consideration and a Project Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) has been engaged to
better evaluate the distributional impacts o fthe program(see Annex 6).

 107.   The QAE also indicates that PARI,-I and I1did not identify clearly enough the key issue
justifying the reduction of the civil service wage bill. The QAE finds two explanations referring to
(a) a too-high civil service wage level, and @) an inappropriately high number of civil servants. To
follow up on this, the present document clearly specifies the former as the major wealmesses o f the
current system, and the main reasons explaining it, while setting a clear target outcome expected from the
PARP.

 108.   Finally, the QAE says that PARL-I and I1 did not adequately emphasize the need for
greater transparency and government accountability. PARL-I11rectifies this by including explicit
measures that should achieve desired outcomes andby adding a new component on e-government.

109.       Those lessons learned have allowed the team to develop best practices on conditionality
(Box 2).


                                 Box 2. How PAlU-111Reflects GoodPracticeson Conditionality

  Principle 1: Reinforced Ownership. The Program has been strengthened under the new Administration. A whole new
  component was added (on e-Government) and previously identified critical actions anticipated, like the startup o f the process
  leading to the revision o f the organic Budget Law, which will involve the Parliament. The program has an excellent track
  record. Delays in completing prior actions have been due to justified reasons, either to allow the design o f the
  deconcentration strategy by her Majesty Mohamed VI, or to make room to political economy considerations, like perceived
  institutional resistance that turned into delays for developing the study to unifyremunerations. Continuous analytical work,
  technical capacity building and communication with the media and Parliament facilitate public awareness and ownership on
  the content o f the program.

  Principle2: Agreement up front with the Governmentand other partners on a coordinatedaccountabilityframework.
  The program is jointly prepared with the European Union and the African Development Bank in, perhaps, one o f the best
  examples o f close collaboration among these three institutions in this field. All institutions have actively contributed to the
  design o f a single policy matrix, while continuously participating on joint missions.

  Principle 3: Customized the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances.
  Despite the highly sensitive areas this loan covers, the Program fully reflects country's circumstances and priorities as
  indicated by the Government. More complex policy reforms, like those affecting MTEFs' and result-oriented budgeting, HR
  management, payroll decrease and e-government have been supported by a programmatic ESW on areas agreed in a
  Memorandum o f Understanding annually reviewed with the Government.

  Principle 4: Choosing only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The numbers o f prior
  actions is adequate-less    than 10-and     the number o f benchmarks has been considerably reduced with respect to those
  contained in PARL-I and PARL-11. However, some prior actions refer to needed process measures (for example, study
  leading to a new remuneration system, Commissions leading to the introduction o f budgetary ceilings in payroll management
  byline ministries) that only later will materialize inthe final expected actions.

  Principle 5: Conducted transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
  support. Since 2007, there are regular performance reviews and sectoral MTEF becoming integrated with the budget cycle.
  There is, however, considerable room for improvement in the monitoring and evaluation o f the performance framework.
  PARL-I11 also introduces numerous actions to improve transparency o f budget reporting, HR management and payroll
  control. In addition, the introduction o f e-government tools will allow Morocco to make major inroads in terms o f increased
  simplification and accountability o f public services.


FIDUCIARY INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSWITHGOVERNMENT
                AND

110.       A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was conducted in2007. The CFAA
was about the assessment o f the various ongoing reforms o f the Moroccan Public Financial Management
System (PFMS), rated as a low fiduciary risk in 2003. The main conclusion i s that these reforms are
going to increase the level o f transparency and accuracy o f the PFMS under a strong baclung o f the MEF
(which has an extensive treasury network in the country). Hence, the l o w fiduciary risk o f the system i s
confirmed.

111.       Foreign exchange. The review o f a country's control environment for foreign exchange i s
generally made through a safeguard assessment o f the country's Central Bank by the IMF. As part o f this
assessment, the IMFreviews the published annual audit reports and the financial statements o f the Central
Bank. Because Morocco has not had an IMF program for several years, the IMF has not issued a
safeguard assessment. The new organization rule o f the Central Bank (Decree of November 23, 2005-
Dahir N" 1-05-38 du 20 Chaoual 1426 o f Bank Al-Maghrib) states that the financial statements o f the
Bank must be audited by an independent external auditor, or Commissaire aux Comptes (Article 52). In
addition, the new rule establishes the principle o f the control o f the financial statements o f the Central
Bank by the Court o f Accounts. The first audit report and financial statements o f the Central Bank were
issued inlate 2006 following these provisions. The auditor has expressed an unqualified opinion.

                                                                 34

112.    Disbursement arrangements. The proposed loan will follow the World Bank's simplified
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. The approved loan will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and will not be linked to any specific
purchases, and no procurement requirements will be needed. As stated, Morocco has not been under an
IMFprogram for several years, andno safeguardassessment o f the Central Bank has beenundertaken by
the IMF. Against this background, once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the
proceeds o f the loan in the amount o f US$lOO million equivalent will be deposited by IBRD in an
account designatedby the Borrower and acceptable to the World Bank at the Central Bank o f Morocco at
the request o f the Borrower.    An amount equivalent to the Loan is credited to the account o f the
Government to finance budgeted expenditures at the General Treasury o f the Kingdom. Ifthe proceeds o f
the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement, IBRD will
require the Borrower to promptly upon notice refund an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to
IBRD. Amounts refundedto the WorldBankupon suchrequest shallbe cancelled.

113.    The loan's administration will be the responsibility of the MEF. Coordination and
monitoring o f the implementation o f the reform will be supported by the Interministerial Steering
Committee for the administrative reform. This Committee was created in early 2003 by a decision o f the
Prime Minister.
114.    EnvironmentalAssessment. This operation is a DPL and the OPBP 8/60 applies. The loan
supports fiscal and regulatory changes that are unlikely to have significant impact on the environmental,
natural resources and forests. In addition, there are no indications that the ERP affected staff in public
administration in charge o f the monitoring and enforcement o f environmental regulations and policies.
However, taking advantage o f the ongoing MTEFs and HR reforms, the Government could consider
devoting additional resources to preserve the environment and to recruit more qualified specialists in the
environmental agencies.

COORDINATION WITH OTHER DONORS

115.    The PAIU-I ICR stressed, among lessons for future operations, that donor coordination
plays a major role in program success, and the Bank should make great efforts to preserve this
unifieddialogue. The World Bank's lending operation and the EU Structural Adjustment Grants, and in
some respects AfDB support o f the Moroccan Government, are based on the same programmatic
framework. This has benefited the client by buildingcredibility for the reforms, but also by focusing the
attention and expertise fi-om multilateral donors on a complex program o f reform. For the World Bank
and donors it has helped to mitigate the reputational risk o f this type o f reform and has reduced the
supervisory burden on each donor.
116.    Hence, at the request of the Government, this third operation is again being prepared
jointly with the EU and AfDB. Thus, PARL-I, 11, and 111have been developed jointly with the EU,
which provided a structural adjustment grant o f 79 million to be disbursed in four tranches over the
program period. Based on the same program matrix, the AfDB Board also approved structural adjustment
loans of, respectively, SDRlOO million in 2004 and SDR85 million in 2006. Both donors continue to
support the reform program in cooperation with the Bank, with the intention o f expanding their support
until at least 2009.   The PARL-111 matrix serves both the World Bank and the EU as a guide for
supervision o f the program, technical assistance, and policy dialogue. AfDB's policy matrix i s also very
similar.

117.    IMP staff is satisfied with the macro framework underlyingthe proposed operation. An
Assessment Letter has been provided to that effect (see Annex 7). Inaddition, in the context o f Article
IV, the IMF continues advocatingthat the Authorities' fiscal consolidation efforts have been successful,
but need to continue. The recent declines inthe government debt-to-GDP ratio, the drop inthe wage bill
burden, and the strong revenue performance have no doubt contributed to heighten private sector


                                                    35

confidence. Continued fiscal discipline will also help contain inflationary pressures and further improve
the investment climate. Looking forward, the Government's success will depend crucially on its ability
to, among other things; keep the growth o fthe wage billunder check.


CONSULTATIONSWITH STAKEHOLDERS

118.     Through the multiple sessions the World Bank organized in-country for the approval o f the CAS
in June 2005, and its ensuing Progress Report in November 2007, World Bank staff collected many
insights and suggestions from civil society on the topics considered for this operation.       Finally, the
consultations on the status o f governance in Morocco, developed in 2006, also brought to the forefront
many suggestions for program improvements. All these opinions and reactions provided many valuable
contributions to the refinement and additions o fthe agenda o f reforms.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, EVALUATIONAND

119.     The World Bankwill monitor the overall status of the Government's PARPto ensure that it
i s well on track. Regular World Bank missions will interact closely with staff o f the two ministries-
MEFand MMSP-the          two entities responsible for the overall implementation o fthe reformprogram, and
for reporting progress and coordinating activities among other concerned ministries. World Bank staff
will also continue the policy dialogue fkom the field with the institutions involved inthe implementation
o f the operation, as well as to coordinate effectively with donors. World Bank missions will review
government progress inthe implementation o fphase IV o f the program, monitor actions, ensuring that the
expected project output and outcomes materializes.

120.     Monitorable - o u t p u t and outcomeindicators were developed with Authorities to assess
programimplementationof this operation. Whereas policy goals are naturally long term, outcomes are
o f an intermediate time frame (one to three years). Outcomes are defined as the short- or medium-term
results that reflect partial or total attainment o f the policy goals; in this case, an improvement in (a)
government's efficiency in providing public services, (b) human resources management, (c) controlling
the wage bill, or (d) simplifyingprocedures through e-government. As outcomes are often not directly
measurable, measurable targets are needed as proxy for assessing progress. For their part, outputs are
intermediate indicators closely associated to the inputs o f the program. Outputs are defined as the direct
product or activities that result from government intervention (inputs). They may also include targeted
changes resulting from the interventionthat are relevant to the achievement o f the program's outcomes.

121.     Table 8 reflects the preliminary main expected outputs and outcomes of PARL-111.

BENEFITSANDRISKS

122.    Benefits.Benefitswould result from the increased effectiveness o f public resources management
in many complementary ways. First, it would increase both the efficiency o f public spending and the
civil service efficiency, which in turn should have a positive impact on economic growth. Second, the
loan would indirectly contribute to improving governance and the delivery o f public services through
upgrading audit procedures, promoting a performance culture and broadening online government. And
M,theoperationwouldindirectlysupportmacro-economic stabilityandthecreationoffiscalspace
which could be devoted to increased social spending and infrastructures

123.    Risks.There are three risks associated with the program.
    Institutional fatigue to preserve the momentum o freform. As the new public management tools are in
    the process o f being mainstreamed by the two leading ministries (Ministry o f Economy and Finance
    and Ministry o f Public Sector Modernization), some degree o f institutional fatigue to preserve the
    momentum o f reform by sectoral ministries might develop.         The likelihood o f this risk i s low.
    However, this risk i s mitigated through the multi-annual technical assistance provided by the World
    Bank P-ESW and the European Union, by the strengthening o f human and financial resources
    devoted to implement the reform inministries, massive in-service continuous training, and closer and
    more effective mechanisms o f interministerial monitoring and dissemination o f the Public
    Administration ReformProgram.

    Implementation delays. Delays in the passing o f critical laws for consolidating the PARP in the
    medium term, like the new Organic Budget Law, or the law modifying the general civil service
    personnel regulations and allowing redeployment o f civil servants-   which reduces the need for new
    hiring-release    for assignment, secondment and recruitment per contract may slow or impede the
    momentum for reform. The likelihood o f this risk i s low. To mitigate this, the Government expects
    that gradual and broadly participatory preparation and validation o f the draft laws should obtain the
    required endorsement from Parliament for passing required legislation. Furthermore, international
    experience indicates that the consultation process leading to a revised Organic Budget Law normally
    takes many years to materialize and canbe an important tool to buildconsensus around reforms.

    Social pressure. The Government could still be subject to pressures to further increase salaries for
    some categories o f civil servants, and to accelerate promotions and continue with sizable unplanned
    hiring. This mightundermine its efforts to continue curbing the payroll ratio. The likelihood o f this
    risk is high, even though the new Government has already engaged inhis first Social Dialogue with
    Unions with the decision to keep tight control o f the declining trend in the wage bill (as a share o f
    gross domestic product, GDP). This risk i s also mitigatedby the new promotion system which limits
    the number of promotions in the medium term, the increasing number of civil servants retiring in the
    coming years, and new measures to improve wage bill control and management to be introduced
    under this operation.

II. Bilandes rialisations :

Le Rayaurne du Maroc a enregistre des avancCes significarives au niveau des difftirentes
actions entreprises dans le cadre de la mise en ceuvre de son programme de reforme de
i'administration publique. Les principales realisationspar axe se prCsententcornme suit

2.1, L'amklioration de l`efflcacitb de i'administration dans la gestion des ressources
     budgdtaires travers :

@    I'institutionde la programmation budgdtaire pluriannuelie par la mise en place d`un
Cadre de Dtkpenses B Noyen Term triennal glissant [COMT) visant A assurer une
meitleure wisibilitk et flexibilite dans I'allocation des ressources publiques et une meilleure
maltrise de l'evolution des depenses publiques et leur compatibilite avec t'objectif de
preservation du deficit bu        take dans un niveau soutenable. Ainsi, le CDMT permettra le
renforcernent d'une part de la cohdrence et la convergence des programmes d'action
sectoriels et d*autre part de la discipline budgezaire globale et I'amtlioratian de la
performance des realisations budgdtaires en faworisant fa mise en Oeuvre du disposltif de
contractualisation des objectifs et des moyens dans un cadre budgeraire triennal et
partant, renforcer le processus de deconcentration des credits. Pour rnettre en place ledit
Cadre, les Ctapes suivantes ant CtC rdalisdes :
     P I'dlaboration d'un guide mCthadobgique de preparation du CDMT par une
         commission interministtrieiie et son test par des ddpanements pilotes;
     F la diffusion dudit guide a \`ensemble des dhparternents ministtiriels par circulaire
         de Monsieur le Prernler Ministre ;
     b I'organisatian d`une journee sur la thhmatique du CDMT au profit de I'ensemble
         des ddipartements ministdiricls en vue de leur permettre de s'approprier la
         mkthodotogie retenue pour I'elaboration dudit cadre.

Ainsi et au titre de t'annee &coulee, 9 ddpartementr ministCriels ont dlabod leurs CDMT
secroriefs.

D   Le deploiernent du dispositifdeglobalisation des crddits qui constitue UR axe majeur
dans la mise en place d'une gestion axbe sur le5 resultats, la recherchede la performance
et la reddition des comptes. Ce dispositif vise notarnment f'octroi d'une plus grande
autonornie aux gestionnairies dans I'uriltsation de leurs dotations budgetaires en
contrepartie de la realisation de leur engagement A atteindre des objectifs prfidltfinis
mesurks par des indicateurs de performance et & rendre compte des progrhs realistls au
regard des rnoyens utifisk

                                                                                        ANNEX I
                                                                                       Page 3 of I1
Les efforts menCs dans ce cadre ont permis, a fin 2007, l'adhtision a ce dispositrf de 32
dlpartements minlstirrels gPrant pr&sde 77%du budget d'investissement, En outre, un
recueil des indicateurs de performance est tStabfi annuellement et accbmpagne les prolets
de budgets sectorielstransmis au Parlement.

Par adleurs, et en vue d'assister les dtpartements ministkriels a construire et a ameliorer
leur systerne de suivi de la performance, un guide methodologique a et6 dlaborC a cet
effct.

b     le renforcement de la dhconcentration administrative en application des Haute5
Directives Royales objet du discours du 12 decembre 2006 prononci a Agadir b I'occasion
de la rencontre nationale des collectivitCs locales qui a trace les grandes lignes pour une
nouvellestrategiede dkconcentrazion administrative reposantsur une approche territoriate
par te renforcernent des services dCconcentres et la mise en place des pdles r4gionaux
homogenes.

II s'agit en particulier de dkvelopper une veritable gestion de proximire et de rapprocher
I'administratron de ses usagers A travers la rivision de I'organisation des structures
administrativeset en rehabilitant le r61e des services dCconcentres dans la mise en oeuvre
des politiques publiques,

Dans ce cadre, il y a lieu de signaler que la mise en aeuvre du decret n"2-05-1369
du 2 dPcembre2005 fixant les rPlglesd'organisationdes dPpartements rninist4rielset de la
deconcentrationadministrativeest de nature d renforcier la dkconcentration et confoner le
dispositif de contracrualisation des relations entre les administrations centrales et leurs
services d4concentres. En effet, ce dCcret adopte notamment le principe de subsidiartte
pour la repartition des attributions entre les services centraux et les services deconcentrks.

De rngrne, le dlicret prkcitk a pr&u f'elabaration par les departernents ministbrieis des
schemas directeurs de dhconcentration administrative a mettre en Oeuvre durant une
periodeallant de deux a clnq an5. Ces sch4mas comprennent notammentles attributionsa
transfhrer aux services dCconcentr6, I'effectif des fonctionnalres et agents faisant I'objet
de redepfoiement au proflt des services dbconcentrhs, les moyens materiels et financiers
alloues aux services deconcentres et ceux qu'elle compte mettre a leur dispasrtion, le$
dCcisions administratives individuelles devant continuer A relever des cornpCtences des
administrations centrales et Ics donnCes opkrationnelles et les moyens dont disposent le
secteur concern6 ainsi que les mesures et d4lais ndcessaircs a 'la rdalisation desdits
schemas.

B     La reforme du contrdte de la dCpense publique virant a confkrer plus de souplesse,
de fluidit4 et d'efficxite aux dtlpenses publiques, Cexte riforme s'inshre dans la logique
de la nouvetle approche budgktaire axbe sur les resuftats consistant B responsabiliserres
gestionnaires quant aux rksultats de leur action en contrepartie des fkxibilitCs dont lfs
beneficient dans I'utilisation des moyens mis a leur disposition, I'ObjeCtlf &ant de
remplacer progressivement le contrble a             priori en vigueur par un contrale

SUBJECT: Letter of Development Policyon the public administration reform strategy
REF.: My letter No. 819/E of 21 February, 2006

Dear Mr. Zoellick,

The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the public administration reform strategy that
the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco has undertaken to carry out as part of its
program submitted to Parliament on October 24 and 25, 2007, and of the actions taken to
ensure that its implementation will receive technical and financial support from the World
Bank, the European Union, and the African Development Bank.

Unquestionably, public administration reform is a core component of improving
governance and is central to the economic and social reforms that the Government intends
to carry out with a view to improving the performance of the national economy and
enhancing its capacity to achieve sustained growth in a rapidly changing regional and
international context characterized predominantly by the globalization of trade.

The reform of public administration is further aimed at ensuring the viability of the
macroeconomic framework by improving the efficiency of public expenditure and optimally
allocating budgetary resources.

I.   Objectives of public administration reform


The public administration reform strategy, which builds upon actions already undertaken,
is aimed at achieving the following objectives:


     b Developing a modern administration that is able to contribute to enhancing the
         competitiveness of the national economy and the sustainable development of the
         country while promoting investment in keeping with the new sectoral strategies
         while ensuring the medium-term viability of the macroeconomic framework;

                                                                                ANNEX 1
                                                                                Page 2 of 12

      b Improving the quality of the services rendered by the administration by
          introducing localized management, further pursuing the deconcentration process
          as advances are made in the area of decentralization, controlling payroll costs,
          and searching for performance-based public activities;

      b Simplifying administrative procedures and developing e-government so as to
          improve the public services rendered and ensure the integrity and transparency of
          relations between the administration and users.


II.   Achievements to date

The Kingdom of Morocco has made significant progress in respect of the various actions
taken in the context of implementing its public administration reform program. The main
achievements by program focal point are as follows:

2.1. Improving the efficiency of the administration in managing budgetary resources by:

B     Introducing multiyear budget programming through the introduction of a revolving
three-year Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) aimed at achieving greater
visibility and flexibility in the allocation of public resources and improved control over the
growth of public expenditure and its compatibility with the objective of maintaining the
fiscal deficit at a sustainable level. Accordingly, the MTEF will make it possible both to
improve the cohesiveness and convergence of the sectoral action plans and to enhance
overall fiscal discipline, improving the performance of the budgeting effort by emphasizing
the contractualization of objectives and resources in a three-year budgetary framework
while at the same time building on the process of deconcentrating appropriations. The
following steps have been taken toward introducing such a framework:

      b Production by an interministerial committee of a methodological guide on MTEF
          preparation, and testing of the guide by pilot departments;

      b Dissemination of the guide to all ministerial departments under cover of a circular
          from the Prime Minister:

      b Organization of an MTEF Day for all ministerial departments to enable them to
          assume ownership of the methodology adopted for preparing that framework.

In consequence, over the past year nine ministerial departments prepared their own
sectoral MTEFs.

                                                                                ANNEX 1
                                                                               Page 3 of 12

B   Deploying the mechanism for globalizing appropriations, a major focus in respect of
introducing results-based management, targeting performance and the rendering of
accounts.   This mechanism is aimed in particular at granting greater autonomy to
managers in the use of their budgetary allocations in exchange for their commitment to
achieve predefined objectives measured by performance indicators and to report on the
progress made with the resources utilized.

Efforts along these lines have resulted, by end-2007, in the adoption of this mechanism by
32 ministerial departments managing almost 77 percent of the investment budget. In
addition, a compendium of performance indicators is drawn up each year and submitted to
Parliament along with the draft sectoral budgets.

Furthermore, to assist the ministerial departments with building and improving their
performance monitoring systems, a methodological guide has been prepared on this
subject.

B     Moving forward with administrative deconcentration in implementation of the
Supreme Royal Decrees referred to in the speech delivered on December 12, 2006 in
Agadir on the occasion of the national meeting of subregional governments. This speech
set out the main lines of a new administrative deconcentration strategy based on a
territorial approach toward strengthening deconcentrated services and introducing
homogeneous regional poles.

The emphasis is placed in particular on developing genuine localized management and
bringing the administration and its users closer together by revising the organization of
administrative structures and rehabilitating the role of deconcentrated services in the
implementation of public policies.

Noteworthy in this context is the implementation of Decree No. 2-05-1 369 of December 2,
2005, laying down the rules for organizing the ministerial departments and administrative
deconcentration.    It is aimed at strengthening deconcentration and buttressing the
mechanism for the contractualization of relations between the central administrations and
their deconcentrated services. In particular, this decree adopts the principle of subsidiarity
for the allocation of functions between the central services and the deconcentrated
services.

Furthermore, the aforementioned decree called for the ministerial departments to draw up
master plans for administrative deconcentration, to be implemented over a period of two to
five years.   These plans include in particular the powers to be transferred to the

                                                                                 ANNEX 1
                                                                                Page 4 of 12

deconcentrated services, the officers and employees to be redeployed to the
deconcentrated services, the material and financial             resources allocated to the
deconcentrated services and those that the administration intends to make available to
them, the individual administrative decisions aimed at continuing to improve the skill sets
of the central administrations, and the operational data and resources available to the
sector concerned, as well as the measures and deadlines required for implementing the
plans in question.

B     Reforming the control of public expenditure, aimed at imparting greater flexibility,
fluidity, and efficiency to public expenditure. This reform is consistent with the logic of the
new performance-based budgeting approach aimed at making managers accountable for
the results of their activities in exchange for the flexibility they have been granted in the
use of the resources made available to them, the objective being gradually to replace a
priori control as presently implemented by ongoing and ex post control based on the
assessment of performance.


In this perspective, and as a first stage, work began in early 2006 to merge the General
Office for the Control of State Commitments and Expenditures with the General Treasury of
the Kingdom so as to shorten the control circuit and reduce its time requirements and
costs.


In addition, work is nearing completion on easing a priori control through the introduction
of modulated expenditure control (CMD) aimed at refocusing control on risk management
and sharing that function with managers who meet the eligibility criteria. In this
connection, a draft decree on State expenditure control has been approved by the Council
of Government.

Moreover, a Performance Forum gathering together the representatives of a number of
different payment authorization officers was launched on September 20, 2007, in order to
share ministerial good practices in the area of budgetary management and public
expenditures through the organization of workshops to address various topics selected by
the payment authorization officers themselves.

B     Introducing performance auditing for the implementation of results-based
management, based on improved coordination in terms of the exchange of experiences
and information among the control bodies, in particular the General Inspectorate of
Finance (IGF) and the General lnspectorates of the Ministries (IGMs).


To this end, the efforts made have been focused on:

                                                                             ANNEX 1
                                                                             Page 5 of 12

     b Preparation of a performance audit manual consistent with the rules and
         international auditing practices and adapted to the context of Moroccan
         legislation and regulations;

     b Training activities on performance auditing based on the above-mentioned
         manual for inspectors from the ICF and the IGMs;

     b Launching, during 2007, of 13 joint performance audit missions mobilizing a
        team of 60 inspectors from the ICF and the IGMs.


B    Ongoing development of the Integrated Expenditure Management System(CID),which
will make it possible to improve communications between the computer systems of the
various stakeholders involved in the execution of public expenditure (payment
authorization officers, their subordinates, and programming and control bodies) and
ensure the automation of the monitoring of budget appropriations with a view to
optimizing the use of budgetary data.

This system will thus make it possible to simplify procedures and achieve greater fluidity in
public expenditure execution while meeting the deadlines established for preparing draft
budget closure laws. The gradual implementation of this system is planned beginning in
2009.

2.2  Improving the efficiency of public administration in the management of human
     resources, by:



B    Introducing tools for managing the prospective need for human resources by:

         Preparing Strategic Staffing Frameworks (RECs), specialized tools for ensuring
         short- and medium-term visibility in the human resources area and permitting the
        qualitative and quantitative delimitation of employment needs. Thus, by end-
         February 2008, six departments completed the preparation of their RECs, while
        those of most of the departments are currently being finalized;

         Developing and implementing information systems devoted to human resource
         management;

         Providing incentives to ministerial departments for engaging in the modernization
        of human resource management tools through the mobilization of financial
        support funds.     To this end, the Public Administration Modernization Fund
        (FOMAP) was established by the 2005 Budget Law to contribute to financing the
        various projects proposed by the ministerial departments relating to operations to

                                                                                 ANNEX 1
                                                                                Page 6 of 12
UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATED TEXT

         modernize public administration.       It has participated in the financing of 33
         projects basically involving the preparation of RECs, the forward management of
         staffing, jobs, and skills (CPEEC), and the development of e-government.


B    Establishing a new Human Resource Management culture based on skills and merit,
doing so in particular through the introduction of new systems concerning:

     b Rating and assessing the employees of public administrations: this new system,
         introduced in 2006, is based on evaluation of the output and performance of
         employees through the establishment of individual interviews and expansion of
         the rating grid (20 points maximum instead of the previous 3).

         In addition, a circular and appraisal guide have been prepared for the
         administrative heads of the ministerial departments, who have also been able to
         receive training on this subject;

     b Adaptation of the system for promoting State officials and employees through the
         introduction of promotion paths that involve testing professional aptitude and
         selection based on compensating merit and competence.


B    Institutionalizing continuing training in the public administrations, which will serve as
a key instrument for filling the gaps identified by the RECs between existing skill sets and
the skills required for carrying out the new missions of the administration. Accordingly, a
decree on the continuing training of the officers and staff of the State was published in
2005, aimed primarily at introducing a cohesive policy on continuing training that will be
based on a global strategy as well as sectoral plans drawn up in accordance with that
strategy. To this end, seminars were held on the engineering of continuing training, the
preparation of a continuing training plan, and purchasing training in order to assist the
ministerial departments in preparing their sectoral plans.

2.3 Controlling the evolution of the wage bill

The actions carried out within this framework relate primarily to continuing the efforts to
control civil service staffing levels and improve the management of human resources. The
primary aims are to:

     b Implement a voluntary departure program for civil servants, benefiting 39,000
         officials of whom 69 percent were age 50 or over. This operation, which has been
         assessed, made it possible to reduce civil service staffing by 7.6 percent, lower the
         wage bill buy more than 1 percentage point of CDP, improve the quality profile of
         the civil service, and improve the supervision and age profile of the civil service;

                                                                              ANNEX 1
                                                                              Page 7 of I 2
UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATED TEXT

      b Freeze hiring at levels 1 to 4 while properly documenting occasional staff and
         outsourcing a number of the tasks carried out by this staff category;

      b Limiting civil service hiring to what is strictly necessary in the priority sectors,
         namely Education, Health, and Security;

      b Eliminating positions that have become vacant following the retirement of
         incumbents for age reasons.

Accordingly, and thanks to the efforts in this area, the weight of the wage bill in terms of
GDP has shown a downward trend, from 11.9 percent in 2005 to 10.8 percent in 2007.

Furthermore, and to improve the monitoring of wage bill developments, two commissions
have been established. The first is responsible in particular for the regular monitoring of
wage bill execution and the preparation and updating of a chart of the major monitoring
indicators associated with this aspect of budget execution and the proposal of measures
aimed at improving the methods for wage bill forecasting.               The second is an
interministerial commission which draws together the pilot ministerial departments with
primary responsibility for putting forward measures to establish close ties between the
management of personnel appropriations and human resource management at the level of
said departments, and identifying best practices for human resource management in terms
of the new instruments available for that purpose.

Ill.  Action plan and pursuit of the reform program

The measures selected for completing the public administration reform program relate to
continuing the actions already under way and introducing new complementary measures
aimed in particular at simplifying procedures and further advancing e-government.
Furthermore, and in addition to performance indicators, impact indicators are associated
with the measures selected for gauging the effects of the reform, in particular as regards
administrative management and performance achieved.

The measures thus adopted revolve around the four following focal points:

3.1. Improvement of the administration's efficiency in the management of budgetary
      resources

As the budget is an essential instrument whereby the Government can implement its
policies in various areas, efforts should be pursued in respect of fiscal management in
order to ensure an optimal allocation of resources and enhanced efficiency in public
expenditure, as well as improved capacities for evaluating public policies. Such efforts will

                                                                               ANNEX 1
                                                                              Page 8 of 12

contribute to modernizing public administration and improving the quality of the services
rendered, while continuing the efforts to gain mastery over the macroeconomic framework
and the preservation of fundamentals. The actions taken in this context are:

B    Improving multiyear budget programming through the preparation and dissemination
of the Table of Treasury Financial Operations (TOFT) and the generalization of sectoral
MTEFs to five new ministerial departments that will receive technical assistance to this end,
the objective being to broaden the use of MTEFs gradually to all ministries and thereby
make it possible to enhance fiscal discipline and establish the conditions needed for
improving resource allocation in accordance with the priorities determined by the
Covernment.

B    Generalizing the new performance-based budgetary approach, the drive for results,
and accounts rendering through:


     b Generalizing and globalizing appropriations throughout all eligible ministerial
        departments, and the signature of at least three pilot performance contracts
         between the Ministries of Education and Health and their corresponding
        deconcentrated staffs units.      This will make it possible to enhance good
        governance and introduce mechanisms for the new results-based budgetary
        approach aimed at achieving performance and accountability;

     b Preparing a deconcentration strategy, adopting a deconcentration manual, and
         making way for the implementation of the Deconcentration Master Plans of five
         ministerial departments.        These actions    are   aimed     at  strengthening
        deconcentration with a view to establishing the conditions necessary for improved
        interventions on the part of the administration, thereby providing localized
        management meeting the expectations of citizens.
B    Reforming the control of public expenditure and strengthening performance
assessment and auditing capacities by:


     b The introduction by decree of a new public expenditure control system aimed at
        easing a priori control by instituting modulated expenditure control (CMD) based
        on the management of risks and the strengthening of internal control at the
        expenditure manager level;

     b Dissemination of the ministerial reports and the consolidated report on the
        performance audits of budgets for 2007, prepared by joint missions involving the
        Inspectorate Generals of the Ministries (IGMs) and the Inspectorate General of

                                                                                ANNEX I
                                                                                Page9 of 12

         Finance (ICF) in at least 20 ministries. Along these lines, a performance
         monitoring manual will be adopted and an excellence group instituted for
         improving performance monitoring, which will bring together the ICF and three
         pilot ministries. Moreover, the partnership between the ICF and the ICMs will be
         bolstered by means of a circular from the Minister of Economy and Finance aimed
         at improving the performance monitoring system through building the capacities
         of the control bodies in the area of performance auditing, thereby further
         developing the transparency and efficiency of public activities;

     b Preparation by an independent expert of a progress report on the implementation
         of the CID system even before its general implementation. This action is aimed at
         providing reasonable assurance that the GID system will properly function and
         provide greater fluidity in the execution of public expenditure while speeding the
         process of drawing up budget closure laws.

b    Reform of the organic budget law through the preparation of a brainstorming
platform for considering ways to improve that law, carrying out international benchmarking
on recent developments in respect of best practices for the modification of organic budget
laws, more intense thinking on approaches to reform, and the preparation of a timetable
for implementing that reform. This reform of the organic budget law, which is tantamount
to a rounding out of the process of budgetary and control reform initiated in 2001, is
aimed at consolidating the gains in the areas of fiscal reform and solidifying the
mechanisms associated with the new results-based budgetary approach focused on
achieving results and accountabiIity.

3.2. Improving the effectiveness of the administration in human resource management

Human resource management plays a strategic role in achieving a modern, efficient,
responsible, and citizen-oriented administration, and hence is a decisive factor in
successfully carrying out the reforms initiated. The measures to be taken along these lines
relate to:


     b Implementing the Forward Management of Staffing, Jobs, and Skills (CPEEC), in
         particular through the development of RECs in all eligible ministerial departments
         and adapting the HR management indicators to achieve greater medium-term
         visibility in terms of recruitment, mobility, and continuing training.

     b Improving the mobility of civil servants in order to optimize the use of human
         resources in the administration, in particular through:

                   o Harmonization of civil service personnel regulations;

                                                                                  ANNEX 1
                                                                                 Page 10of 12
UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATEDTEXT

                   o Adoption of implementing decrees with respect to redeployment,
                      release for assignment, and secondment, after the adoption and
                      publication of the law amending the General Civil Service Personnel
                      Regulations.

                   o Introduction of financial incentives for redeployment.

     b Preparation of the draft law amending the General Civil Service Personnel
         Regulations aimed at guaranteeing, in particular, the highest possible degree of
         equity and transparency for access to civil service employment through the
         organization of competitive examinations and the introduction of contractual
         hiring for contributing to the completion of specific projects.

      b Completion of the study on classifyingjobs under a common nomenclature aimed
         at ranking all civilian jobs in the administration in accordance with a common
         nomenclature so as to improve the match between human resources and jobs.
         This study, to be assigned in early 2008, will make it possible to stress merit and
         facilitate the harmonization and grouping of personnel regulations, mobility, and
         staff redeployment, as well as to introduce an equitable and transparent
         compensation system.

      b Completion of the study on designing a new compensation system based on the
         new classification of jobs under a common nomenclature aimed at reinforcing the
         principles of equity and transparency while setting compensation levels in keeping
         with skill levels, the nature of responsibilities, job complexity, and performance.


3.3. Consolidation and control of the civil service wage bill

This involves strengthening the monitoring and control of the wage bill, the adoption of
best practices for the management of wage bill appropriations by the ministries, and the
stabilization of civil service staffing levels. To this end, the following actions will be
undertaken:

      b Publication by the Ministry of Economy and Finance of a quarterly report on the
         changes in the wage bill by ministerial department and the factors explaining such
         changes;

      b General application of best practices for the management of wage and salary
         appropriations throughout all ministerial departments following their introduction
         in four pilot departments.

These actions are aimed at improving control of changes in the wage bill, the weight of
which in terms of CDP is expected to be reduced to about 10 percent of GDP by 2012.

                                                                              ANNEX 1
                                                                            Page 11of 12

3.4. Simplification of electronic government procedures

Procedural simplification and e-government are at the core of the strategy for modernizing
public administration, and constitute a vector for improving governance and the quality of
the public services provided to users.

The actions to be taken in this connection relate especially to:


     b Introducing a global governance framework for the development of the
         information society and e-government           with a view to achieving greater
         coordination between ministries and the common utilization of resources in this
         area:

     b Simplification of procedures and improvement of public services by means of e-
           ..
         government in the customs and procurement areas, involving:

             Stabilization of the BADR system and quality certification of its IT program
             code;
             Implementation of the decision-making database for government contracts in
             all ministries, and expansion to selected public establishments and
             subregional governments of the on-line government procurement tools
             (electronic submission of bids, provision of terms of reference, and on-line
             availability of the results of bid submission);


     b Initiation of a study on implementing technical norms and standards for the
         information systems of the public administration;

     b Launch of a study on the development of a common set of rules on HR
         management in the public administration (E-HR          Program: Harmonization of
         Human Resource Information Systems, SIRHs).


IV.  Steering and monitoring of Public Administration reform measures

The steering and monitoring of reform implementation are provided by an interministerial
commission chaired by the Minister Delegate in the Office of the Prime Minister in charge
of Economic and General Affairs and made up of representatives from the ministries in
charge of Public Sector Modernization, Economy and Finance, the Interior, National
Education, Equipment, and Health. This commission is tasked in particular with the
coordination, monitoring, and appraisal of actions taken in the context of the Public

                                                                             ANNEX 1
                                                                           Page 12of 12

Administration reform, using performance and impact indicators designed to improve the
performance and output of the Administration.


In addition, regular monitoring of progress with the reform program will be performed in
the ministries of Economic and General Affairs, Public Sector Modernization, and Economy
and Finance, and progress reports will be drawn up and submitted to the commission
referred to above.


Moreover, the communication strategy previously established for the reform will be
implemented with a view to ensuring the mobilization and active involvement of the
various stakeholders, thereby guaranteeing the conditions necessary for the success of the
public administration reform program.


In conclusion, I wish to thank you for your support for this important program to reform
the Public Administration of Morocco.

    ANNEX 4. WHAT THE PARLsHAVE ACHIEVED: MAJORINTERMEDIATEAND OUTCOME
                                                      INDICATORS


While it i s generally difficult to identify proper outcome indicators for public administration management, it i s
even more difficult when it comes to a program in progress where true outcomes are expected far in the future.
Correctly, the matrixes in PARL-I and 11 mostly addressed results in terms o f reforms implemented and
modernized tools adopted by the various public entities, mostly on a pilot basis. As the reform now evolves
from build-upto mainstreaming, it will be useful to build a solid outcomes monitoring framework to capture the
results o f future progress. At this point, it i s useful to look ex post at a number o f indicatorsthat may give some
insight into how well the reforms have succeeded.

During 2004-06, the Government o f Morocco undertook reforms on a vast front including budget
modernization, deconcentration, simplifjmg the expenditure control system, strategic staffing, remuneration
reforms, and payroll control. To do that, the Government has mostly proceeded on a voluntary/pilot basis. Ina
sense, the growing number o f pilots for each new instrument has been an indicator o f reform internalization.
Some reforms have taken longer than others to start, mostly due to political or bureaucratic reservations. This
was the case for the MTEF or performance auditing, which went against administrative traditions;
administrative decentralization has been put on hold, while the higher authorities look for the best formula;
officials are taking their time with remunerationcontrol, the most sensitive reform; and payroll control has been
jeopardized by "exceptional promotions" meant to appease categories o fpublic servants.

Before loolung at outcomes for each component o f the program, it i s worth looking at existing global
comparative indicators and see if they offer some insight into how public administration management has
progressed during this decade. To this end, the Index o f the Quality of Government Bureaucracy o f the World
Bank's Economic Development Prospects presents country ranlungs since 2000. According to this source,
Morocco appears as a solid reformer inthis field. Its index, as a percentile rank relative to other countries o f the
world i s 74 in 2007 (100 meaning best environment), which i s a significant (and steady) improvement over its
rating o f 58 in2000. This index also contrasts with the deterioration o f MENA regional index from 48 to 45 in
the same period. The index combines findings from three different sources: The Political Risk Services, the
Heritage Foundation, and the Bank's DoingBusiness indicators.

SubprogramA: ImproveGovernmentalEfficiencyinBudgetResourcesManagement

ComponentA.l: Greatervisibility of policiesandtheir medium-termbudgetaryimplications, placing
budgetaryallocationdecisionsinamultiyearframework

A methodology for preparing MTEFs has been adopted on a participatory basis. A methodological guide has
been disseminated by a Prime Ministerial circular. A dozen departments have prepared three-year MTEFs.
However, MTEFs need to be more closely associated to budget preparation. Their consistency with future
budgets should be measured by indicators to be put inplace. Inparallel, the Ministry o f Finance now prepares
three-year projections o f public finance aggregates. The quality o f the forecasts is very good, with actual
implementationbeing 114 percent inthe case o frevenue and 107 percent for expenditures.

ComponentA.2: Greaterresponsibilityfor deconcentratedoffices inbudgetaryprogrammingand
execution,with afocuson resultsand accountability

On the one hand, starting on a pilot basis in 2002 with the Ministry o f Health, the use o f budget flexibility
(globalization des crkdits) together with performance indicators has now been adoptedby 30 departments and will
be generalized in 2008. The use o f the flexible mechanism has rapidly increased among departments entitled to
use it (from 10 percent o f eligible appropriations in 2003 to 34 percent in 2006). And in a limited number o f
cases, a remarkable impact interms o f increased absorptive capacity has been observed (from 34 percent in 2003

                                                                                                   ANNEX4
                                                                                                 Page 2 of 2
to 40 percent in 2005 for the Ministry o f Health, and from 56 percent in 2003 to 68 percent in 2005 for the
Ministry of Equipment).     On the other hand, for reasons presented above, deconcentration has been lagging
behind, with very few departments having prepared master plans for deconcentration or practicing internal
contracting. N o w 30 departments present indicators together with their budget requests. The quality of those
indicators cannot yet be judged adequately because the performance audits have not yet started, but are to
commence during 2007.        In the future, it will be possible to: (a) have indicators of the quality of sector
performance; and (b) use some sector outcome indicators as indicators o f progress o f effectiveness o f the public
administration.

ComponentA.3: Improvingthe performanceof public administrationthrough the introductionof internal
auditing, evaluation, andperformancecontrol

Although the engineering o f an Integrated Budget Management System i s long term, the priority has recently been
put on trimmingthe expenditure circuit and simplifyingthe ex ante controls system. Controllers ofcommitments
and payments have been regrouped, with a new methodology intended to further simplify and shorten the control
circuit. As a result, public expenditure should be expedited more swiftly, and procurement and payment lags
should diminish. Those indicators have not been collected yet, but will be for the next operation. On budget
reporting, progress can be seen on the delays for preparing the final accounts: it took the Ministry o f Finance 4.5
years to prepare the draft 2000 final accounts; this delay has regularly declined to become 2 years for the 2005
accounts. Finally, progress i s also visible on the transparency front, where the annual budget and annexes are
now publishedonline, as are all information on plannedprocurement and the results o fbids.

SubprogramB: ImproveGovernmentalEfficiencyinHumanResourcesManagement

To deal with this sensitive area, the Government decided to proceed with the adoption o f modernized tools for
Human Resources Management.           The first one was the development o f SSFs, which opens the case for
prospective management and reform in recruitment, promotion, and mobility. A manual has been prepared. As
o f today, seven departments among the largest have prepared SSFs, with many others starting the development.
Other reforms include the reform o f promotions, which has unblocked promotions (goulot d'dtrunglement) and
should prevent the massive political promotions o f the past. Recruitment on a competitive basis has been instated
by decree. The outcome indicators put inplace inthat component should capture improvements inperformance
and management. It i s too early at this stage, however, to expect such outcomes while the tools are still under
construction.

SubprogramC:Consolidate and ControlPublicPayroll

To control the public payroll and the related fiscal deficit, the Government has resorted in the first instance to
control the number o f staff. The first action has been a voluntary Early Retirement Program (ERP) in2005. The
ERP achieved most o f its quantitative and financial objectives. The number o f participants and beneficiaries
exceeded expectations, with more than 50,500 o f the former (or 10 percent o f the central government civil
service) and almost 38,600 for the latter (7.6 percent o f civil servants). Savings on the wage bill have been
estimated at 1 percentage point o f GDP. Tahng into account all the positive and negative financial impacts,
especially the one-off severance payment (2.3 percent of GDP) and the effect on the pension fund, the ERP yields
a positive result estimated at 5.9 percent o f GDP (3.7 percent o f GDP ifdiscounted usinga 5 percent rate). Onthe
budget, starting from 2006, the net total impact i s an annual savings o f 0.6 percent o f GDP. In addition, the
qualitative outcome o f the ERP i s positive: all mangers sampled say that it has allowed staff rotation in the
administrations and permitted younger people to take new responsibilities. As a result a gain in administrative
efficiency should be achieved.      The composition o f departures has been virtuous, especially for Health and
Education: in those departments, most departures come from regions that were overstaffed, while in the poorest
places, teachers and physicians were not permittedto leave under the ERP.

CURRENT SITUATION: STRATEGYAND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

E-government i s a powerful tool for public administration reforms. It enables more efficient, effective, and
participatory government; facilitates convenient government services and greater public access to information;
increases transparency; and makes government more accountable to citizens. On a deeper level, e-government
opens up predominantly inward-looking structures o f administrations toward a focus on services rendered and
on delivery o f results, fundamentally affecting the very processes by which these services are produced and
delivered. Inthis way, e-government allows administrative reform efforts to make dramatic, fundamental, and
radical changes to streamline back-office processes and increase administrative efficiency and effectiveness.
These changes may further reinforce other reforms, helping countries to better compete in the global economy
by strengthening markets and individual choice, which inturnpromote economic growth andpoverty reduction.

The Government o f the Kingdom o f Morocco (GoM) has recognized the importance o f e-government as a tool
for its larger public administration reform efforts. It has already articulated a national strategy for ICT in a
document entitled Stratkgie e-Maroc 2010, launched in 2005 under the authority o f H i s Majesty King
Mohammed VI. E-government i s a key component o f this strategy. The strategy i s complemented by an action
program known as Informatization and Networkmg o f Public Administration via ICT in 2003 (Informatisation
des Dkpartements Administratfs et leur Mise en Rkseau Adkquate via les Technologies de 1'Information,
IDARATI). As suggested bythe name, this programaims at modernizingbothnational andlocal administration
by the gradual diffusion ofICT. The top objectives o fthisplan are to create improved Governmentto Business
(G2B) and Government to Citizens (G2C) interactions, improve effectiveness o f government administration,
reduce costs, and transform the public administration. To achieve these objectives, the IDARATI program
published a number o f documents pertaining to the national e-government program for 2005-08. These include
the ProgrammeNational e-Gouvernement 2005-08; the Plan deMise en Oeuvre e-government; and the Plan de
Ddmate'rialisation des Services.

INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

In the previous Moroccan government, e-government responsibilities were shared between the Economic and
General Affairs Ministry(Ministzre des Agaires Economiques et Gknkrales, MAEG), and source o f the e-Maroc
Strategy) and the Ministry o f Public Sector Modernization (Ministere de la Modernisation des SecteursPublics,
MMSP), source o f IDARATI). This complex institutional framework as a source o f potential delays in the
implementationo f e-government services.

Within the e-Maroc Strategy, a Committee for the Development o f Information and Communication
Technologies (Comitk Stratkgique pour le dkveloppement des Technologies de 1'Information et de la
Communication, CSTI) was created.        It was intended to increase widespread usage o f ICT, along with
deployment o f the required ICT infrastructure, and comprised five major groups, one o f which is the e-
Government Committee (Comiti National eGov, NeGC). This entity was created in February 2003, chaired by
the Minister for Public Sector Modernization, and composed o f representatives o f several ministries and the
private sector. The Committee was responsible for the coordination and development o f online government
services to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of administrative procedures. Inaddition, the Department o f
Postal, Telecommunications and Information Technologies (Dkpartement de la Poste, des Tklkcommunications
et de Technologies de l'lnformation, DEPTTI) had implemented a number o f cross-cutting projects and
supported certain ministries in launching new services. DEPTTIwas placed as a department under the Ministry
o f Economic and General Affairs, MAEG. The e-government strategy also includes a particular emphasis on
the need to address horizontal issues, such as e-Security, interoperability, and norms for services, through the
same institutional decision center.

Institutional fragmentation and the lack o f a unique leadership in the area o f e-government have slowed the
progress o f reform in this area.      In particular, the institutional fragmentation has resulted in overlapping
responsibilities, unclear mandates, and insufficient implementation capability.

VERTICAL E-GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS

Vertical applications are systems that largely benefit a single agency's mission (such as Ministry o f Educationor
o f Health). This section outlines a few strategc vertical applications inMorocco interms o f their public utility,
maturity, scalability, and potential for impact on the reformo f Morocco's public administration.

E-Procurement(Passation de rnarchb en ligne)

E-Procurement i s a highly effective tool for public administrationreforms and has significant economic benefits.
It contributes to transparency o f government procurement by bringingknowledge o f the tender process into the
public domain, leading to less waste and corruption; lower prices; resulting from increased competition due to
the increased number o f bidders per tender; and faster processing o f tenders, thereby minimizing delays in
bringingthe benefits o fthe procurement to the public.

InMorocco, the implementationof an e-Procurement system with procurement management functions and a
national public tender website has been ongoing, with the website going live inJanuary 2007. The Parliament,
on October 1,2007, voted for mandatory use o f an e-Procurement website for all government purchases, and the
Prime Minister's Office i s expected to mandate all agencies to use the e-Procurement portal. The project's aim
i s to reduce government contracting costs and help small to medium-size Moroccan firms gain access to
procurement opportunities. The system i s managed by the General Treasurer o f the Kingdom (Trksorerie
Gknkrale du Royaume [TGR], a unit under the MEF), and its functionalities include supplier registration,
publication, and downloading o f tenders and terms o f references, submission of tenders by vendors, results o f
bidevaluations, contracting o ftenders, and online payment. This marketplace is expectedto allow each supplier
to save an average o fMAD120,OOO annually on various documentation fees and deposits.

The first phase o f this project involves the creation o f a database consisting o f all registered suppliers and public
procurements. However, the TGR had to create its own classification o f suppliers and procurements due to the
absence o f common standards, codification and data sets, and so forth. In the future, this database can be
consolidated with the business registry, customs systems, and taxpayer registration databases for small and
medium enterprises and large taxpayer units. Inthe second project phase, the system will be adapted and rolled
out to the municipalities to allow for local government e-Procurement. This i s because fighting corruption and
enhancing transparency in public procurement i s essential at all levels o f public administration, and more than
50 percent o ftotal government procurement i s conducted by municipalities.

Inthethirdphase, amonitoringandevaluation (M&E)systemwillbedevelopedtomonitortheprogressandthe
costs o f public procurement as captured in the e-Procurement system. The M&E component will contribute to
increased understanding o f the impact o f transparency on costs, productivity gains, and the quality o f process
and contracting mechanisms. Inthe medium to long term, it i s estimated that more than 80 percent o f the central
administration's offers, terms o f reference, and results o f bidding will be available online, with 50 percent
availability for the local administration.

It the final fourth phase the e-Procurement platformcould be outsourced to the private sector in order for it be
maintained, updated, and transformed into a world-class application.           This i s because o f the inability o f
government agencies to retain information technology (IT) talent based on low civil service salary levels, and
the outsourcing o f the platform through a public-private partnership (PPP) will serve as test o f the Government
and the private sector's aptitude and performance.

Based on the above, several challenges remain for the government. These may include: (a) scaling-up of the
system to local communities; (b) hand-holding, change management training for all ministry staff to adopt and
use the system, with a 100 percent compliance rate in all agencies by 2009; (c) monitoring the results and
improvements; (d) allowing the system to exchange data with other systems based on common standards and an
enterprise architecture for government information systems; and (e) outsourcing the system to a private sector
entity under a PPP agreement to maintain it at a world-class level in terms of usability, reliability, privacy,
security, and interoperability.

E-Customs(BaseAutomatisCe des DouanesenRBseau)

An efficient and effective customs administrationi s essential to the welfare o f any country. e-Customs systems
implementedas part o f an entire trade facilitation process also bringbenefits to countries interms o f export and
GDP growth andjob creation, decreasedtransactions costs, and higher competitiveness.

A key service inIDARATIis the e-Customs system dubbedBaseAutomatiske des Douanes en Rkseau (BADR),
launched in 2003. BADR provides businesses, shippers, and customs agents ready access to declarations
through the Internet, and it consists o f several online services such as customs guarantees, clearance o f vehicles
or motorcycles, and status and progress check in real time. As a result, clearance time has been reduced from
five days to less than an hour, and electronic payments are current (currently through only one partneringbank).
BADRis also connected to the Integrated Budget Information system (Gestion Integrke de la Dkpense), the tax
system, and the Direction Gknkrale des Imp&           all o f which are managed by MEF. The system has not
undergone standard international certification and quality assurance processes that off-the-shelf systems go
through. Hence, additional effort i s required for quality assurance, mass deployment o f BADR to all the major
ports, and for its integration into a full-functioned, completely web-based platform accessible via the Internet.
Inaddition, capacity building, change management, andcommittedlocal and central leadershipare critical to its
success. Inthe long run, BADR and its users would also benefit from being outsourced to the private sector
under a PPP arrangement to take care o f its maintenance, update, and quality assurance.


IntegratedBudgetManagementSystem(GestionIntCgrCede laDCpense)

The GID system i s an exchange platform among ministries for processing payments, commitments, and debits
and credits o f public moneys, and it currently connects 40 percent o f the decentralized Treasury offices across
the country. The system i s developed by the Ministryo f Finance's TGR group and i s based on an off-the-shelf
treasury system built on a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA).            Additional resources are needed for
completing the rollout and the capacity building for MEF staff, and the integration o f GID with other
government systems (the human resource system, for example) i s o f critical importance for the Government to
fully benefit from this application.

E-RH:HumanResourcesManagement System

The Ministryo f Finance (MEF) i s currently implementingthe e-RH system based on an off-the-shelf Enterprise
Resource Planning solution from Systems Applications Programs (SAP).                 This application is already
implemented inthe MEF and Ministryo f Interior for more than 95 percent o f their staff, and is to be rolled out
inthe Tourism, Commerce andIndustry,Health, andHabbous ministries. The projectrepresents apositive step
for the public administration because it cross-leverages on each organization's resources, builds process
consistency, and realizes cost economies of scale. Inthe longer term, it i s imperative for the human resources
systems o f various ministries to interoperate as administrations are reorganized or as staff are transferred
between agencies, and so forth. However, there i s no single system for all the Moroccan administrations to date.

E-Sante: e-Heath Assurance Maladie pour tous

The Ministry o f Health (MoH) has embarked on a major national insurance reform project, which aims to
provide coverage, online health insurance services, and information for public and private-sector employees, and
the poor and unemployed. For this purpose, an e-Health system would link stakeholders and supply chain
members in a single portal-including        the insured population, insurances (under MoH), medical suppliers,
pharmacies, doctors, hospitals, and clinics. It i s estimated that 10 million people will be able to access their
health insurance records online, and the services would include health and insurance tips, drug prices and
availability information, and lists o f doctors and providers. Concurrently, the system would also allow M o H to
monitor diseases and illnesses based on insurance records and to create proactive, preventive health care
programs for the populace. Inaddition, the system will ensure transparency in drug prices and locations, and
eliminate existing arbitrage opportunities among different retail locations. The largest challenges lie in the
rollout o f the portal and its integrationwith other access programs (Genie, ElMourchid, existing Cyber cafks, la
Poste, and so forth).

CROSS-SECTORAL STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

The attention to cross-sectoral issues i s important to ensure that government policy in this area follows a
coordinated and common approach that i s aimed at maximizing synergies and disseminating good practices
across ministerial departments. These cross-sectoral strategic priorities affect those elements that are common
to all e-government initiatives (these elements are often referred to as horizontal measures).

Interoperability Framework, Norms, And Prioritization Of Services

A coherent interoperability framework is vital for a coordinated and integratedrollout o fe-government services.
These standards are needed to provide clear guidelines for achieving interoperability across various organs o f
the Government and across various agencies with regard to management o f information, and have to be
elaborated not only for the technologies involved but also for issues as basic as the naming o f websites to
creating e-mail addresses. Interoperability covers: (a) Technical-concerned with networking, interfaces, data
formats, and so forth; (b) Semantic-implies         a common ontology for exchanged information to achieve
common understanding; and (c) Organizational-concerned with such things as modeling business processes
and aligning information architectures.

Currently, there are no interoperability frameworks or standards for e-government in Morocco, and concerns
have been expressed in the IDARATI program documents. Therefore, there i s a need for expansion o f the
program to (a) map and assess the number o f entities, existing record systems, workflow/process, and so forth,
to identify the first-tier administrative units for possible implementation; (b) develop an interoperability
framework that covers technical standards, semantics, and organizational interoperability, with an emphasis on
flexibility, modular design, functionality, and support, tahng into account the information gained from the
mapping and assessment activity; and (c) conduct a thorough review o f national interoperability frameworks
from other countries, taking into account experiences from these and other similar frameworks.

The current websites o f the public administrations in Morocco have substantially different layout, functions,
colors, information, and so forth, or they are not regularly updated or offer basic content such as contact
information.     The e-government Committee has recognized the importance o f such norms and therefore
identified several domains for normalization that relate to issues o f accessibility, content, navigation, and
formats. Among these issues it appears particularly important to underlinethe needto:

         Develop norms to be embodied in visuals, identify manuals and technical guidelines covering issues
         related to usability, accessibility, service uptime, graphic elements, content management, layout, and
         basic functionalities; and

                                                                                                        AM\rEXS
                                                                                                      Page 5 of 6
     0   Disseminate the finalized manuals and guidelines to the public administrations, and set up an internal
         website dedicated to these norms for ready access.

A service prioritization process is also essential for e-government programs because it enables appropriate
resource allocation, creates linkages between expected project outputs and program-level objectives, and bases
project plans onrealistic assumptions.

Benchmarking,EvaluationFrameworks, And PerformanceIndicators

The development o f the benchmarks, evaluation frameworks, and indicators i s required for multiple purposes
such as measuring comparative global performance, assessing impact, project management, risk assessment and
management, reporting, and as a means o f communication o f project status among different actors. At present
there are a number o f impact assessment frameworks to measure e-government benefits. A comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation framework has not been developed yet inMorocco. The e-Maroc strategy mentions
the intention to develop, by November 2007, a national ICT observatory, to keep track o f all I C T policy
initiatives, including those for e-government. Given the lack o f a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework,
it is particularly important to conduct global benchmarking o f e-government (central and local) inrelation with
the overall economic and social performance o f Morocco.

Public-PrivatePartnerships

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can help relieve governments o f the financial and administrative burden o f
providing the service, while enabling them to retain an important role in regulating and monitoring the
performance o f the private partner. In addition, risks are shared between the public and private parties, and
these partnerships can enable faster deployment o f better services from governments to its constituents. PPPs
also facilitate the transfer o f know-how, best practices, and methodology fkom the private to the public sector.
The Moroccan e-government Committee strongly encourages the use o f PPPs for new e-government projects.
However, no feasibility study had been conducted to assess the viability and affordability o f the PPP approach
and there are no laws that specifically deal with this matter inthe country. Hence an emerging policy need i s to
ensure that the use o f PPPs i s viable for e-government services inMorocc-that       is, that it is economically and
financial viable for the public sector, with appropriate risk and reward balance for the public and private sectors,
and i s value for money for the public sector.

Based on the strength o f Morocco's software/IT      industry,the private sector is thought to have the capacity to
support these PPPs. The initial assessments may indicate that several existing programs inMorocco are feasible
for outsourcing, including e-Procurement, government portals and networks, end-user support, e-mail and
archive management, e-Human Resources, and el-Mourchid. Therefore, the eventual outsourcing o f some o f
these programs would contribute significantly to the sustainability o f the Government's public administration
reformand modernizationefforts, and to the country's e-government programs.

E-Security

E-Security i s a crucial horizontal element for safe and trusted online transactions.      It enables the electronic
authentication o f users and protects data such that transactions have legal standing.           Without e-Security,
applications in such areas as e-commerce, civil registries, and business registries cannot be feasibly
implemented. Morocco has highlighted the importance o f e-Security in its policy and implementation papers.
The IDARATI document outlines the need for the G o M to work toward guaranteeing (a) data authenticity, (b)
data privacy and confidentiality, (c) data integrity, and (d) and non-repudiation o f data. It also discusses the
necessity o f proper fkameworks in the legal and regulatory and technical and institutional realms, noting
especially the need for (a) a legal framework on electronic security, (b) a certification policy, (c) certification
service providers, and (d) certification authorities.

                                                                                                     ANNEX5
                                                                                                    Page 6 of 6
In addition, the Moroccan E-government Implementation Plan (Plan de Mise en Oeuvre e-Government)
identifies specific activities such as (a) creating an e-Security Policy, including securing e-transactions through
e-signatures and authentication, (b) awareness-raising on e-Security topics in the public and private sectors
through seminars and training, (c) creating an e-government platform for hosting secure e-government
applications, and (d) establishing a certification authority. Against the backdrop o f these ongoing efforts, inpart
with other donors (for example, efforts to create a certifying authority with American support), the remaining
priorities are in the areas of legal and regulatory framework, security methods, and compliance with
international norms and standards.

ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES

EstablishingA Coordination BodyAndA Government Cio

As discussed, E-government services and use e-government as a tool for administrative reform would benefit
significantly from the creation o f a clearly identified governance structure for coordination, facilitation, and
capacity building. It i s imperative that this governance structure have the support at the highest institutional
level (the endorsement o f the Prime Minister i s necessary), and both the authority and financial means for its
operation. Inaddition, this body should be entrusted with the mission to accelerate the use o f e-government as a
tool for administrative reforminorder to achieve increased transparency, public sector efficiency, and improved
services to businesses and citizens. Hence, the creation o f a Government Chief Information Officer (CIO)
would provide much-needed leadership and impetus for the e-government program and be a strong element o f
the governance structure.      T h i s CIO's role i s to enable public service transformation through the strategic
deployment o f technology, drive the development o f shared services, and act as the "face" o f Morocco's e-
government program. Fundamentally, the CIO will be a change leader who helps other government leaders see
the possibilities, then drive that vision o f transformation through administrations where the bureaucracy and
culture make it difficult to change.

IncorporatingGlobalBestPractices

Morocco has produced outstanding e-government strategies. It now faces the challenge o f implementation,
transforming broad strategic orientations into practical services to citizens, and achieving measurable
improvements in the functioning o f the public sector. It has to recognize relevant international best practices,
and identifyways to use them most productively. The following areas would be o f particular importance inthis
process: (a) "Back-office'' functions; (b) multichannel delivery, and Web 2.0 approaches; (c) optimizing
decentralizatioddeconcentration objectives           through   online  delivery   o f public   services;   and   (e)
externalizatiodoutsourcing, andprivate-public partnerships.

ImplementingA DemonstrativeService

Morocco's e-government program will benefit significantly from the rapid implementation o f at least one major,
highly visible, and transformative e-government service.          This key service will help to communicate the
viability o f the e-government program by allowing citizens and businesses to see, experience, and measure the
contribution o f e-government to improvements in their daily lives, which in turn will contribute to increased
demand and speed o f deployment. Moreover, this will be a quick win that accelerates benefits to the citizens
and businesses inthe most effective and efficient manner, and the process will enable knowledge transfer to the
ministries, agencies, and personnel involved. The intentional selection o f a transformative service will also
catalyze a radical change inthe public administration's processes, contribute to simplification o f procedures, and
herald in-depth changes to the Government's back-office functions.

                  ANNEX 6. NOTE ONTHE POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTANALYSIS


This annex takes stock of what is known about the social effects of the Bank-supported program and
informs the design of the PARL-III. It starts with short definitions o f the PSIA tools used in this Project
Appraisal Document, then discusses the priorities concerning distributional effects o f key supported reforrns,
and proceeds to a list o f possible areas of positive and negative impacts on material and non-income poverty,
tahng stock o fthe existing evidence to identify gaps.

                                  BoxA7.1. ExperienceofPSIAsinother Countries

Reforms entailing restructuring the public sector in view to improve its efficiency are increasingly popular around the
world. However, there are no examples o f comprehensive assessment o f their poverty and social impacts. Instead available
PSIAs focus o n issues related to a key component o f suchprograms: public sector retrenchment.

*Adverse selection to public sector downsizing programs. This issue arises when the retrenched workers are essential
for the operation o f a unit producing a socially valuable service, and their contribution to society is greater than their wages.
Ifthey leave, public sector downsizing may show negative economic returns.

*Direct impact on workers. There are several findings o f several studies o n the determinants o f welfare losses from job
displacements in developing countries and transition economies. Welfare losses tend to vary depending on the design o f
reform. A most recent example i s the case o f Vietnam, where downsizing o f state enterprises included compensation
packages addressing gender specific labor market outcomes o f displaced workers.

*Overall effects.     Downsizing may affect the welfare o f other stakeholders than retired public sector employees.
Remaining workers constitute the most visible case. Other affected stakeholders include caterers and providers o f services
to public agencies and state-owned enterprises.        Taxpayers, taken as a group, are also among the stakeholders in a
downsizing operation.

4. Rama(1999).

In Morocco's case, the emphasisof "PSIA" type work was on managingcarefullythe consensus building
needed for the reform. PARP reforms that are carried out are gradual. They mainly affect how different
public sector agents work. With the new job classification and remuneration systems, the corps and cadres
system are deeply changing.            To build consensus around the reforrns and overcome possible institutional
resistance by sectoral ministries and social pressure by some groups o f civil servants for salary increases, the
Government undertook a number o f steps. However, the design o f the each component: HR reforms, new job
classification system, new remuneration system all include the analysis o f implementation, interest groups
affected and the steps to overcome likely resistance. Rather than doing a stand alone PSIA, these tools are fully
internalized into each component o f the program. The participation and consultation process was specific to
each component and was aimed at consensus building. A good example o f such an approach is ERP. It
combined careful design o f compensation package with a communication campaign. Itresultedina massive yet
smoothmanaged departure o f civil servants (more than seven percent o f the workforce over a period o f only one
year). The program was voluntary by design, and it met with no opposition.

PSIAsare prepared(OP 8.60) inorder to have abetterunderstandingofthe potentialimpactof a specific
reformon differentsocial groups,with a particular focus on the poor. A PSIA identifies potential winners
and losers o f a policy reform to facilitate decisions about the design, sequencing, timing, and appropriateness o f
proposed reforms, and to better define compensatory and complementary measures. Any PSIA starts with this
question: "Whether speciJic country policies supported by the operation are likelv to have significant povertv
and social consequences, especially onpoor people and vulnerable groups.               "
TheERP

                                                                                                    ANNEX 6
                                                                                                  Page 2 of 3

Direct welfare effects of the ERP. The program resulted in an overall increase o f savings and wealth. The
average compensation package amounted to 290,000 dirhams per worker (as opposed to the average annual
wage o f 80,000 and a poverty line o f about 15,000 dirhams annually per average family). It i s obvious that
public servants as a group are not at the bottom levels o f poverty incidence and vulnerability indices (World
Bank 2004). Hence, the ERP unlikely did not result in an increase inpoverty. Moreover, since most o f those
who departed were highly paid senior servants, there was some reduction in the excessively high earning
inequalities inthe state sector. The government later promoted or hired less senior staff with lower salaries.

Poverty impact of the early retirement program: opportunities. The voluntary departure program overall
resulted in budgetary savings o f about 1 percent o f GDP. Such savings exceed the budget o f several nation-
wide social assistance programs. Hence, the ERP created potential fiscal space to be reallocated to the social
protection system.

Poverty impact of the early retirement program: service delivery. Initially, there were concerns with the
departure o f teachers and health care providers. In fact, the understaffing o f some local centers and schools in
remote areas was a condition which preceded the PARL (for example, in the health sector a deficit o f 9,000
nurses as documented in a Bank Poverty Assessment (World Bank 2004). However, the detailed analysis o f
departures show that majority o f them were concentrated in Grand Casablanca and Rabat - Salk - Zemmour -
Zaer region, characterized by the lowest poverty incidence and best access to services.         The program also
affected senior staff aged over 50 years old occupying management positions, and not teachers or nurses
providing services to the poor. Finally, recent staff hires have been assigned there where needs are more
important. Thus, the overall effects on provision o f services to the poor are not negative. The work i s on-going
under the public administration PESW to collect more sectoral data to quantify the overall effects and identify
areas where it was negative. Based on these efforts recommendations will be developed on how to mainstream
such data collection into the sectoral MIS to avoid any negative effects on service delivery in the future and
monitor the effects o fimproved service quality.

Gender analysis. InMorocco, the ERP resulted in a slightly higher incidence among women: 8.3 percent o f
female civil servants as opposed to 7.2 percent among male public employees left the service (KPMG). Given
overall low employment rate o f females inMorocco, this had marginal negative effects on the gender balance in
employment opportunities as retired women barely represented only 0.4 percent o f the total female labor force
in Morocco in 2005 (World Bank 2007). Morocco uses gender-disaggregated reporting system on staffing,
which i s usedto monitor all changes inthe public service.

Other PARP reforms

PARP reforms affect employment, service delivery, and changes in governance. Employment is a channel
for impact that i s directly observable. PARL affected labor market structure and labor demand by reducing
distortions and by generating new labor demand in the public sector and through indirect effects-in           other
sectors. KPMGreport estimates for example that some job creation took place inthe construction and services
spurred by the investments activated by early retirementpayments (16,000 newjobs).

Most detailed analysis of gainers and loser from PARL reforms are included in Table 7 (see main text).
Based on such Table, PARI,-I11has many elements that may potentially lead to very positive effects on the
Moroccan poor in the medium term.         Close monitoring o f the program and its effects can also help to
substantially improve the poverty reduction effectiveness o f this operation. Hence, continued effort i s needed to
monitor and analyze the loan social impact. This will be done through three avenues. First, the integrated
household survey (2006-07 and its follow-up) will be used to assess the baseline level quality o f service
delivery and coverage o f the poor and their changes over time. This work will be carried out as part ofjoint
activities under the programmatic poverty assessment.           Second, reporting cards will be piloted and

                                                                                                  ANNEX6
                                                                                                Page 3 of 3
mainstreamed to measure the quality o f public services for different socioeconomic groups and provide feed-
back to policy makers.      The same objective o f enhancing public administration's efficiency as well as
accountability could also be achieved by adopting pevance mechanisms such as ombudsman mechanisms or
local administration services (for example, community scorecards). This would allow not only to reinforce
efficiency and accountability o f the public administration, but would also capture accountability and
responsiveness o f deconcentrated services.    This will be part o f the TA under the programmatic public

This noteprovides IMF staffs current assessment o fMorocco's macroeconomic conditions and outlook for the
coming period, after the last Article N Consultation heldon August 2007.

MacroeconomicPerformanceandPolicies

Macroeconomic conditions remain generally strong. Real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen from 8
percent in 2006 to 2.2 percent in 2007 due to a sharp fall in cereal production. However, nonagricultural GDP
growth remainedclose to 6 percent, dnven by robust activity inboththe manufacturing and service sectors.

The externalpositionremains comfortable. Strongdemand coupled with higher food imports and fuel prices
has eroded the external current account surplus, which i s now close to balance. However, the weakening current
account was more than offset by rising capital inflows, notably o f foreign direct investment, and as a result,
foreign reserves rose by $4 billion to $24.1 billion at end-2007, equivalent to 7.3 months o f imports. External
debt continued to decline and a recent debt sustainability analysis indicates that external vulnerabilities are
limited. Recent analysis also suggests that the Moroccan dirham, which i s pegged to a basket o f currencies
dominated by the Euro, i s inline with fundamentals.

Major stridesinthe consolidation of public finances were achievedin 2007. The deficit narrowedto almost
zero in 2007-down from 2 percent o f GDP in 2006 and against a 2007 budget deficit target o f 3.4 percent o f
GDP-due in particular to surgingtax receipts. Revenue improved by 2.5 percent o f GDP compared to 2006
due to the elimination o f exemptions, improved tax administration, and high tax buoyancy in key sectors.
Higher revenue was only partly offset by increased spending, in particular on subsidies for petroleum products
and capital spending. The stock o f public debt fell to about 55 percent o f GDP, down from 58 percent in2006.

Inflationfell in2007, despite a surge increditto the privatesector. End-of-period inflation fell to 2 percent
from 3.3 percent in 2006, although inflation would likely have been several points higher if there had been full
pass-through o f world oil and commodity prices on administered prices. Asset prices have risen sharply in the
past year and credit growth has been very rapid on the back o f strong nonagncultural growth, suggesting that
demand pressures remain strong. Inthis setting, the central bank has left its key policy rate unchanged at 3.25
percent but indicatedits determination to act quickly should inflationary pressures emerge.

The medium-termoutlook is favorable. Real GDP growth in2008 is expected to be above 6 percent, dnven
by a rebound in the agriculture sector, strong private sector investment, and construction. Over the medium
term, nonagncultural GDP i s projected to remain well above 5 percent on average, with inflation at about 2
percent. Despite very large tourism and remittance flows, strong economic activity with continued robust
investment i s expected to keep the external current account balance mildly negative in the coming years.
Nonetheless, continued capital inflows-notably         foreign direct investment-should    help keep official reserves
at a comfortable level. Fiscal consolidation would strengthen public savings.

Morocco's main challenge i s to sustain and improve upon its good economic performance to further
reduce unemploymentand ensure that growthbenefits all. The authorities have already strengthened their
efforts to reduce the impediments to accelerated growth. The dialogue between the Moroccan authorities and
Fund staff has focused on three key areas: fiscal consolidation, financial sector reform, and increasing
Morocco's integrationinto the world economy.


  This assessmentreflects informationdrawn from a March2008 staff visit to Morocco as well as other information
provided by the authorities. The last Article IV consultation for Morocco was completed inAugust 2007.

                                                                                                     ANNEX 7
                                                                                                    Page 2 of 2
The authorities have made important strides on their medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy, although
fiscal risks remain. At current world prices, subsidies will weigh much more heavily on the budget in2008 if
policies remain unchanged. And inthe face o f renewed pressures to boost public sector wages, the authorities
will need to weigh carefully the impact o f wage increases on public finances in the medium term. Despite
expected continued buoyant public revenue, these factors could crowd out other public spending, constraining
the authorities in their aim to gradually increase expenditure on public investment and education. The 2008
budget deficit target o f 3.5 percent o f GDP is broadly consistent with the authorities' medium-term fiscal
consolidation objectives, but does not appear ambitious in view o f the favorable deficit outcome in 2007. In
particular, the outturn for the 2008 deficit will most likely be lower if, as expected, the strong revenue
performance continues, and the authorities successfully contain current spending. A key step will be for the
authorities to carry out their intention o f better targeting subsidies to lower-income groups.

Morocco's banking sector is sound and the country to date has been little affected by the international
financial market turmoil and slowdown in the developed economies. The recent FSAP update mission
concluded that the banlung sector was adequately stable and resilient to shocks. The write-off o f a substantial
amount o f nonperforming loans has strengthened the balance sheet o f the banking sector, and the restructuring
o f the two troubled state-owned banks i s complete.

The authorities continue with actions to further integrate Morocco in the global economy. Recent free-
trade agreements-notably       with the U.S. and Turkey, and regional partners in the context o f the Agadir
agreement-will     help boost trade. Further multilateral tariff reductions as well as liberalization o f trade in
services are appropriate next steps inthe trade liberalization strategy. Inthe same spirit, the authorities' gradual
efforts to liberalize capital account transactions should serve Morocco well by boosting investment, and the
authorities intend to accompany these efforts with steps to limit financial sector vulnerabilities and susceptibility
to sudden shifts in flows. The authorities' intention to move gradually to a more flexible exchange rate regime
inthe mediumtermcouldhelpto ensure the successfulintegrationofMorocco inthe global economy.
