project consists of: (i)\n            construction of 5 coaxial cable links between transit\n            exchanges in ten wilayas (provinces) and their linking to\n            the main east-west and north-south trunk routes; (ii) the\n            automation of regional cable and transmission systems in 22\n            wilayas, including the automation of small capacity\n            exchanges and the connection of some 42,000 new distant\n            subscribers; (iii) construction and rehabilitation of local\n            cable networks in about 450 large medium towns in order to\n            connect approximately 310,000 new telephone subscribers;\n            (iv) setting up of about 600 public telephone call offices\n            in isolated rural areas and communities now without access\n            to telecommunications services; (v) provision of equipment\n            and materials for large regional centers and stores, tools\n            and machinery for network construction, power supply and\n            testing equipment; and (vi) technical assistance and\n            training in management and organization of\n            telecommunications development and operations, development\n            planning and engineering, financial management, accounting\n            and cost accounting. The project would be carried out from\n            1983 to 1988."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
