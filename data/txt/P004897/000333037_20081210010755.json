The project aimed at: (i) supporting the expansion\n            of Algeria's telecommunication network through the\n            financing of a time-slice of Ministry of Posts and\n            Telecommunications (P&T's) investment program, and\n            (ii) improving the sectors institutional and policy\n            framework. Network expansion was much slower than expected\n            (the original program target of a million subscriber lines\n            was achieved with a four-year delay), as a result of the\n            worsening of the country's economic situation and of\n            procurement problems. Furthermore, the project failed to\n            achieve its institutional objectives of improving P&T\n            planning and management systems as well as tariff policies,\n            due primarily to weak Government commitment. At project\n            completion, sector development and efficiency remained\n            hampered by an inadequate institutional and policy framework\n            (with the state retaining a monopoly on most\n            telecommunications services in contrast with changes which\n            have taken place in most other countries); accordingly, the\n            long-term sustainability of the Bank financed investments\n            can only be assessed as uncertain. Overall, the project\n            outcome is rated unsatisfactory, its institutional impact\n            negligible, and its sustainability uncertain."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
