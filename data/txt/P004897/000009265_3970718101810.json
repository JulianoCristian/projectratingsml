(i)\n            construction of 5 coaxial cable links between transit\n            exchanges in ten wilayas (provinces) and their linking to\n            the main east-west and north-south trunk routes; (ii) the\n            automation of regional cable and transmission systems in 22\n            wilayas, including the automation of small capacity\n            exchanges and the connection of some 42,000 new distant\n            subscribers; (iii) construction and rehabilitation of local\n            cable networks in about 450 large medium towns in order to\n            connect approximately 310,000 new telephone subscribers;\n            (iv) setting up of about 600 public telephone call offices\n            in isolated rural areas and communities now without access\n            to telecommunications services; (v) provision of equipment\n            and materials for large regional centers and stores, tools\n            and machinery for network construction, power supply and\n            testing equipment; and (vi) technical assistance and\n            training in management and organization of\n            telecommunications development and operations, development\n            planning and engineering, financial management, accounting\n            and cost accounting.
