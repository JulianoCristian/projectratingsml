I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Background and Organization
1.01      Algeria is a large country covering slightly less than 2.4
million square kilometers bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The population
in January 1983 was estimated to be about 20.6 million. About 95% of the
population occupies the coastal 18% of Algeria's land surface at a density
of 39 people per square kilometer. The other 5% occupy the remaining 82%
of the land surface in the arid south at a density of 0.4 people per square
kilometer. The population of Algeria's urban centers is growing rapidly at
an average 6.8% per year, compared to 3.1% per year for the country as a
whole. Agriculture, services, governnent and industry are concentrated in
the north, while the economy of the south is mainly dependent on gas, oil,
minerals, tourism and seminomadic subsistence. Algeria has a centrally
planned economy, operating via representative and administrative centers at
the national level and in 31 regions (wilayas), 160 subdistricts (daira)
and 704 communes, into which the national territory is divided.
1.02      The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T) is in charge
of the government monopolies of postal and public telecommunications
services in the country. Its responsibilities and organization are
governed by presidential ordinances and decrees, which also define its
administration and operation as a government department in charge of major
public services (see paras 4.01 to 4.04). P&T's Director General of
Telecommunications (DGT) is in charge of the telecommunications branch (see
para 4.03). DGT provides and operates the public domestic and
international telephone, telegraph, telex and data transmission services.
It also operates special telecommunications services such as maritime radio
and provides circuits for the Algerian Radio and Television (RTA), the
Ministry of the Interior, and the Army. Other organizations operate their
own specialized telecommunications systems with P&T's authorization. These
include SONATRACH (hydrocarbons), SONELGAZ (electricity and gas), SNTF
(railways), Air and Sea Navigation and Ports Authorities, Air Algerie,
meteorological services, and others. The use of DGT's network by other
agencies is supervised and regulated by an interministerial committee,
which also establishes the fees to be paid to P&T.
1.03      In accordance with the government's policy of progressive
national self-sufficiency in important sectors, a manufacturing industry
for the production and installation of telecommunications equipment was
established in 1974. Under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the electronic
branch of SONELEC in Algiers produces some small-capacity pair cables and
one type of small diameter coaxial cable, and lays and joints them for P&T;
since 1980 it also produces crossbar switching equipment and telephone sets
in Tlemcen, where current levels of production are about 60,000 exchange
lines and 80,000 telephone sets per year. In January 1983, the Tlemcen
manufacturing complex was transferred to a newly created National
Telecommunications Enterprise (ENTC). SONELEC/ENTC's production of
telecommunications equipment is entirely absorbed by P&T. Under P&T's



- 2 -
supervision, SONATITE is in charge of the country's private branch
telephony. It installs, connects and maintains private branch exchanges
and subscriber terminal installations, and also installs for P&T switching
equipment from Tlemcen. Under the Third Plan, SONATITE has established a
civil works branch for the construction of P&T's local networks and
buildings, and is expanding its cable laying and jointing branch.
1.04      As of December 31, 1982, P&T employed 27,870 personnel, of which
15,800 are for telecommunications services, representing 39 staff per 1,000
direct exchange lines in service (see para 4.07). With 2,300 SONELEC/ENTC
personnel for production of telecommunications equipment, 900 SONATITE
personnel for telecommunications installations and maintenance, and an
estimated 1,000 staff for operation and installation of specialized
telecommunications systems in SONATRACH, SONELGAZ, SNTF, air and sea
navigation services and Radio Television Algerienne (RTA), this represents
a total employment of about 20,000 in the telecommunications sector, or
approximately 2% of the country's work force.
B. Access to Service
1.05      As of December 31, 1982, there were 410,209 telephone direct
exchange lines in service (DELs) in Algeria, a telephone density of 2.0
DELs per 100 population. While slightly above average compared to
neighboring countries, this density was two to three times lower than in
countries with a similar GNP per capita, such as Turkey and Mexico.
Annex 1 sets out international telephone statistics. As shown in the table
below, existing telephone service is substantially concentrated in the
metropolitan centers of Algiers, Oran, Constantine and Annaba, which had an
average telephone density of 4.7 DELs per 100 population at the end of
1982, while telephone density in the rest of the country was only 1.4 DELs
per 100 population.

1.06      All regions (wilayas), districts (daira) and most communes have
some telephone service. Annex 2 gives the distribution by wilaya of
telephone exchange capacity, DELs in service and outstanding applications,
and Annex 3 shows the distribution of access to telephone service in urban



- 3 -
centers of various population size. All places with more that 5,000
inhabitants and 290 of the 322 places with 2,500 to 5,000 inhabitants have
some local and/or long distance telephone facilities. However, in many of
these places, service is limited to only one or a few telephones;
furthermore, a large proportion of the places with less than 2,500
inhabitants which account for a substantial portion of the country's
population have no telephone service at all. Telegraph service is
available at 1,500 post offices across the country. Telex service on
average meets about 78% of the registered demand in Algiers, Oran,
Constantine and Annaba, and is being introduced in 18 other wilayas; the
telex density of 1.1 DELs per 1,000 employed persons is comparable to that
of other countries of similar levels of economic activity.
1.07      In order to obtain a telephone, applicants must register on a
waiting list. Connections are made according to the date of application
and the priority assigned to the applicant. Applicants with high priority
include those involved in health care, government and security. The
waiting list totaled 263,760 at the end of 1982. Thus only 61% of
registered demand for telephone line connections is being met on average
for the whole country (70% in the main metropolitan centers, 50%
elsewhere). New applications in areas currently served often take several
years before they are met. On average, the 1982 waiting list would take
five years to clear if new DELs continued to be added at the rate achieved
in that year.
C. Telephone Service Usage
1.08      According to P&T's classification of subscribers, at the end of
1978, 39% of the DELs were installed in business premises (9% nationalized
industries, 12% administration, 18% private business) and 61% were
installed in residential premises. However, the ratio of business
telephones to total number of telephones is considerably higher (about
57%); given the widespread use of private branch exchanges this is a better
indicator of the business subscribers' share of access to telephone
service.
1.09      Traffic generated in automatic exchange areas by business and
government connections accounts for almost 75% of the total. The Algiers
region generates more than 55% of all telecommunications revenues, though
it accounts for only 28% of the DELs in service. It is estimated that
approximately 48% of the revenue from call charges corresponds to local
traffic, 38% to interurban traffic and 14% to international traffic. The
pattern of long distance traffic reflects the distribution of the economic
activity between Algiers and the three principal northern regions of Oran,
Constantine and Annaba. However, completion of the ongoing works under
P&T's current development program is expected to gradually improve
telephone access and usage in other regional centers.

D. Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
1.10      As of December 31, 1982, Algeria had 410,209 DELs in service and
a total of about 660,000 telephones. Only about 63% of the exchanges'
capacity had been connected to subscribers, due to delays in expanding the
local cable networks and subscribers' plant. This situation is improving
and exchange fill has been growing steadily since 1979 under P&T's
program. Long distance services between the main northern cities along the
coast are provided by coaxial cable and microwave systems. From this main
axis there are southern spurs to Bechar, Ouargla and Touggourt, and
branches to other regional centers, using coaxial and carrier pair cables
and microwave systems. Other parts of the country are served by a domestic
satellite system comprising 16 small earth stations for telephone and TV
channels, complemented by open wire and HF radio systems. International
services are provided by six submarine cables to Europe of low to large
capacity depending upon their age (4,180 circuits in total), by microwave
and cable systems to neighboring countries and by satellite relays using
both Atlantic and Indian Ocean satellites.  Some HF radio circuits are also
still in use for communication over low traffic routes where modern
facilities are not available. Basic data on existing telecommunications
facilities are given in Annex 4. Annex 5 shows the past growth of
telephone exchange capacity and DELs in service for the 1970-82 period.
Further details on existing services and on their growth during recent
years are available in the project file.
1.11      Lack of timely and adequately planned investment coupled with
rapid growth in demand in the past have caused the telephone network to
exhibit a number of deficiencies which have led to poor service. Although
the dial tone is obtained relatively quickly, about 5% of local calls, 20%
of long distance calls within regional areas, and 50% of other long
distance calls fail due to equipment congestion at busy hours, or
malfunction. Equipment congestion partly arises from far above normal
traffic intensity per DEL, which reflects heavy usage of an insufficient
number of telephones. Equipment congestion in subscriber dialed long
distance service (a facility available in most large automatic exchanges,
which account for about 88% of DELs; rural and semiurban subscribers have
operator-assisted long distance service) is further aggravated by lack of
timely provision of transmission and trunk switching equipment. In
addition, there is subscriber lines congestion, i.e., telephone lines being
engaged an excessively high proportion of time. Repeat call attempts to
reach occupied telephones further compounds congestion of both equipment
and subscribers' lines. The overall proportion of initial call attempts
failed is thus likely to be even higher than the above figures.
Observations of equipment malfunction indicate that, on average, each DEL
experiences one breakdown per year (0.9 in Algiers, 1.2 in the rest of the
country) and only about 74% of the faults are cleared within two days of
being reported. These figures are poorer than what is considered
acceptable practice.
1.12      Access to international service is available to all subscribers.
Over half the traffic is subscriber dialed, a facility which is available



- 5 -
to Il European and 2 African countries. Operator-dialed international
service is available with ten other countries, including the USA, Canada,
Japan, countries in northern Europe, Saudi Arabia and Syria. These 23
countries account for about 80% of the world's telephones. Although the
quality of service is generally good, especially in Algiers, at times
severe congestion occurs on subscriber dialed routes, leading users to
prefer booking calls via the international operator at a higher cost to the
DGT. In the rest of the country access to, and quality of, international
services are limited by the inadequate domestic trunk network capability.
E. Demand for Service
1.13      As of December 31, 1982, there was a registered waiting list of
263,800 (64% of existing DELs). Past evolution of registered demand and
existing service is given in Annex 6, and regional distribution of this
demand as at end 1982 is shown in Annex 7. Since 1979, the yearly growth
rate of the waiting list averaged about 29%, which compares with yearly
average growth rates in DELs and in total expressed demand of 16% and 20%
respectively. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to forecast the
total demand for the telephone service as many would-be applicants are put
off by the long delays they expect before obtaining connection to the
service and the poor quality of service. Based on rough estimates, it is
estimated that, at the end of the year 1990, there will be a potential
market for one million business lines and two million residential lines.
This projection takes into account present available sectoral information
as well as prevailing economic and population growth assumptions.
1.14      Current registered demand varies greatly according to the type of
place, ranging from 5 DELs per 100 population in Algiers, to 4 in the other
metropolitan centers, 0.8 to 3.7 in the chief towns, and 0.3 in the rural
areas. It is also difficult to forecast traffic as there have been no
observations for some years and access to service is recent in many areas,
still changing rapidly and subject to considerable further growth as
congestion is overcome. Very intense use is noted in the business centers
of Algiers and Oran where high congestion is observed at busy hours
(para 1.11).
1.15      DGT's present development projections under their current program
for the period 1983 to 1988, forecast an annual growth rate in DELs
increasing from the current 16% average since 1979 to about 22% in 1988,
which would be on the high side among the growth rates obtained in
developing countries. This is expected to increase the proportion of
registered demand met, from the current 64% to about 80% at the end of
1988. However, despite such a major effort, the forecast growth of demand
would result in some 170,000 still outstanding applications by the end of
the ongoing program, i.e., about the same number as at its start in 1979.
F. Sector Objectives
1.16      The government is aware of the need to develop telecommunications
services. The national charter of 1976 states that adequate



- 6 -
telecommunications are a requisite to the economic expansion and activities
of Algeria. To this end, and following the directives of the government
for the preparation of the third national five year plan (TFYP)(1980-84),
P&T was committed to a program which will significantly improve the present
availability and quality of telephone service. This will be done using the
latest available techniques, so that over the next 10 to 15 years the
expansion will result in reasonably good quality, widely available
telephone service. During the first three years of the plan, DGT made
major decisions in this respect, in particular concerning the rapid
introduction, from 1984 on, of electronic digital techniques in the
switching and transmission systems (para 3.13). In line with these
decisions, the government authorized P&T to plan and engage its development
and to expand its program over an extended three-year period after the
current TFYP, i.e., until early 1988. P&T intends to move toward those
sector objectives under the proposed project by: (a) significantly
expanding the local networks at rates of 20% to 25% per annum, with
proportionately more resources being directed outside the main urban areas,
thus moving from the present level of 2 DELs per 100 inhabitants to 4 DELs
per 100 inhabitants over the project period; (b) changing the present
manual system in the rural areas to automatic equipment and providing new
exchanges at all government administrative centers; (c) providing telephone
service for the first time at over 900 isolated locations; (d) improving
the quality of local and long distance service through the installation of
additional equipment and better system planning and maintenance procedures;
(e) upgrading, restructuring and expanding the long distance network to
handle the forecast increase in traffic, with the particular goal of
incorporating the new development region on the High Plateau; (f) improving
DGT's management, planning and accounting procedures, and overall
productivity; (g) completing the investment program from the second plan;
and (h) increasing tariffs so as to free resources for use in sectoral
development, or elsewhere in the economy. Changes in selected parameters
over the program period and forecasts of installed exchange capacity,
connected lines, telephone demand and telex subscribers from 1979 to 1988
ar set out in Annex 8.
G. Sector Constraints
1.17      Until 1973-74, P&T's investment program was highly restricted due
mainly to a shortage of qualified manpower. The slow rate of network
growth resulted in a rapidly growing waiting list. Attempts to improve the
situation between 1975-80 included a large investment program. However,
despite P&T's efforts, network expansion has been slower than at the
planned rate. Investments under the second plan (1975-78) and its
additions were completed in 1982. At the same time, a relatively weak
financial performance has kept net internal cash generation at below
average levels despite a tariff increase in 1975 (para 5.04). The recent
tariff measures, which are applied since February 1983, should
significantly increase the proportion of investments financed from net
internal cash generation, thus reducing the borrowing requirements (para
5.11).



1.18      The major constraint remains the rate at which P&T can improve
its planning and management capabilities and, in particular, its ability to
construct local networks and buildings. It is vital that substantial
progress be made in these areas in order that bottlenecks, which hold up
utilization of other investments, can be overcome. Improvements are also
needed in productivity in general, and in the quality of the service
offered. In early 1983, the government reorganized P&T's structure and
functions to this effect (para 4.02). Such improvement and progress,
however, require timely and adequate technical assistance and staff
training, as included in the proposed project, to complement and reinforce
P&T's organization and management, and DGT's development planning and
implementation capability (para 4.21).
1.19      These constraints, together with the long lead time before the
effect of the improvements in planning and management procedures are felt,
mean that the proposed first project should be viewed as a first step in a
long-term process of catching up so that, ultimately, the basis for a good
quality, widely available network can be provided. To ensure this, and
considering the size of DGT's current and future development programs, a
subsequent second project might help consolidate long-term sectoral
development.
H. The Bank's Role
1.20      A contribution by the Bank to Algeria's telecommunications
development has been discussed for several years with P&T. Two previous
attempts to develop a Bank-financed project (1974 and 1978) failed,
principally because of inadequate project preparation. In April 1979, a
preinvestment study financed under a UNDP project for which the Bank was
executing agency, was undertaken to analyze the present situation and to
outline a program of service expansion and institution building over the
period 1980-86. The report was submitted in December 1979 (see project
file).  It forms the basis for the Bank's project as updated within the
context of DGT's expanded development program (para 1.16).
1.21      The improvement and the expansion of services are both of great
importance for the telecommunications sector and, in order to achieve its
ambitious objectives in this regard (para 1.16), P&T would have to
successfully implement the managerial and organizational measures which
were recently taken by government (paras 4.01 and 4.19), and increase its
productivity in general. The project would enable the Bank, in focussing
on institution building by providing funding for experts in the technical,
managerial, accounting, financial and economic fields, to assist the public
telecommunications sector of Algeria at a critical stage of its
development, when DGT is confronted with the responsibility of operating
and developing services which will change from the present level of 410,000
lines in service to levels of approxmately 1 million lines in 1988 at the
end of the project period, and 1.5 million lines by 1990.

II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. The Plan and the Program
2.01      In 1979 P&T had drawn up a comprehensive telecommunications
investment program of works which were initially included under the Third
Five-Year Plan (TFYP, 1980-84). This program had been designed to meet
important sector objectives (para 1.16). It covered the addition of about
570,000 lines in telephone exchanges, including 200,000 lines of ongoing
installation works from the previous plans. In 1982, P&T decided to
rapidly introduce the modern electronic digital techniques in networks on
account of the cost advantages of using such techniques and of the limited
capacity of the local suppliers of switching equipment and cables which was
experienced during the first three years of the plan. Based on this, the
government authorized P&T to plan and commit its development for
implementation until 1988 and expand its program accordingly.
2.02      The revised program includes the addition of about 800,000 lines
from 1980 to 1988, of which about 150,000 were installed since 1980 and
650,000 are planned to be installed from 1983 to 1988. DGT implements all
works under its program, which is made up of the following components: (a)
ongoing works from previous plans to be completed between 1980 and 1984 at
a total cost of about DA 1,232 million (US$268 million) with a foreign
exchange component of DA 644 million (US$140 million); (b) expanded works
under the Third Plan for construction until 1988, at an estimated total
cost of DA 9.2 billion (US$2.0 billion), including a foreign exchange
component of DA 4.4 billion (US$958 million) (see detail in para 2.04).
The proposed Bank project is an essential part of these works for
construction of specific items from 1983 to 1987 (paras 2.05 to 2.09); (c)
other works to be executed during the plan period for the government's
special development program for the southern territories at a total cost of
about DA 632 million (US$137.5 million) including foreign costs of DA 403
million (USD$87.7 million); and (d) preinvestment for future development
works to be undertaken in 1988, estimated at DA 130 million (US$28.2
million) with foreign costs of DA 50 million (US$10.9 million).
2.03      The estimated total cost of DGT's 1980-88 investment plan,
excluding future program, is DA 11.1 billion (US$2.4 billion) with foreign
costs of DA 5.4 billion (US$1.2 billion). The local and foreign costs of
the different components and the planned investments for each year are
given in Annex 9. A more detailed description of the exchange capacities
to be installed and of their planned implementation schedule are given in
Annex 10. Details of all works in DGT's development plan are available in
the project file.
B. Program of Works Under the Expanded Third Plan Program
2.04      This program, as expanded in 1982, is the most important element
in DGT's plan. It includes about 650,000 telephone exchange lines and
corresponding expansion, modernization and improvement of all components of



- 9 -
the network, as well as essential improvements of DGT's organizational,
operational and development capabilities to be implemented between 1980 and
1988. Since 1980, during a first three-year segment of its program which
had been authorized in P&T's 1980 budget, DGT initiated a large part of the
works for the local and national transmission systems throughout the
country and installed about 70,000 lines of locally produced exchange
equipment together with 80,000 of imported equipment ordered from previous
plans. In 1982, it was decided that the remaining 650,000 lines of the
program for construction until 1988, would consist of about 400,000 lines
locally manufactured for small and medium size exchanges and 250,000 lines
of imported digital equipment. Local and long distance networks would be
planned and expanded accordingly. The corresponding works were authorized
under P&T's 1983 budget and the proposed project is a part of the remaining
works under DGT's program. Details of the revised program, as now
proposed, and of its implementation schedule are in the project file. Past
and future growth of local exchange lines installed and in service (DELs)
and the evolution of the waiting list since 1970 and as forecast during the
program period are charted in Annex 11. The local and foreign costs of the
expanded program's main components, and the estimated annual expenditures
from 1983 to 1989 are given in Annex 12.
C. The Project
2.05      The project covers a time slice of DGT's current development
program and consists of high priority works to be realized during the
1983-87 period. It includes principally the construction and extension of
local and regional networks in rural and urban areas of 22 important
wilayas, as well as the extension of local cable networks in the remaining
9 wilayas. The works correspond to a demand that must and can be satisfied
rapidly. This represents construction of urban and rural distribution
networks for about 350,000 of the new subscriber connections to be added
during the project period, or about 60% of the total new connections
planned by DGT during this four-year period. The project also includes
priority trunk links from the 22 above mentioned wilayas to the national
network and between themselves, and first connection for 600 isolated
communities in 18 wilayas. Its components were chosen in order to help DGT
in its efforts to expand local and regional systems and their access to the
trunk network in pace with the installation of exchange equipment where
demand is high. The project includes works in most of those wilayas which
are in charge of monitoring development and operations on a pilot basis at
the regional level of DGT's organization. Staff in charge of network
construction in other wilayas would be trained under the project and
benefit from it.
2.06      Simultaneously, the technical assistance included in the project
will enable P&T to implement the managerial and organizational changes
which were initiated by the government in early 1983 and are urgently
required in order to cope with the problems and responsibilities of
operating and developing a large telecommunications network. The Bank's
association with P&T in this management and organizational change effort
would be an essential objective of the project (para 1.21).



- 10 -
2.07      The project is expected to achieve the following:
(a) construction of about 550 km of new coaxial cable links,
and expansion to 2,000 channel capacity of an existing
600 km coaxial cable, all cables linking transit exchanges
in ten important wilayas, also linking them with the main
east-west and north-south long distance routes; this would
represent addition and redistribution of about 4,000 trunk
circuits;
(b) construction of about 1,000 km of medium capacity regional
cable and transmission systems in 22 wilayas, enabling
automatization of about 400 small-capacity exchanges in
rural areas and connecting them to the national automatic
network, and installation of about 400 line concentrators
servicing about 42,000 distant subscribers;
(c) construction and rehabilitation of local cable networks in
about 450 medium and large towns, where about 310,000 new
subscribers are planned to be connected under the project;
(d) establishment of about 600 public telephone call offices
in isolated rural areas and communities of 18 wilayas now
without access to telecommunications services;
(e)  provision of transport and handling equipment, power
equipment and tools for network construction at large
regional centers; and
(f) technical assistance and staff training in: management
and organization of telecommunications development and
operations, development planning and engineering,
financial management, accounting and tariffs.  About 170
manmonths of consultants/experts and 100 manmonths of
staff training will be provided (para 4.20).
A more detailed description of the project is included in Annex 13.
D. Project Costs
2.08      The total project cost is estimated at DA 1,437.0 million
(US$312.4 million), including a foreign exchange component of DA 588.8
million (US$128 million). Project cost details are shown in Annex 14. The
schedule below summarizes the estimated cost of the major components of the
project.

The Bank would finance 100% of the foreign cost of imported goods and
services totaling US$127.7 million equivalent. The proposed Bank loan of
US$128 million would also finance the capitalized "front-end" fee of US$0.3
million. The local currency costs of DA 848.2 million (US$184.4 million)



- 12 -
would be financed from net internal cash generation and from treasury
borrowings. DGT's total investments under the expanded third plan period,
excluding ongoing, special and future works, over the 1983-88 project
period would amount to about DA 7.6 billion (US$1.65 billion) with a
foreign exchange component of DA 3.5 billion (US$750 million). The
proposed Bank project represents about 19% of this total investment and the
Bank loan about 17% of its foreign exchange component.
2.09      Project costs reflect the estimated 1983 prices based on DGT's
experience with recent contracts and correspond to international prices
under similar conditions and allowing for some economies of scale on DGT's
base costs for large grouped purchases, as DGT plans and it will be
possible to order under the project. The local costs include customs
duties on imported goods and production taxes which P&T is required to pay
(para 3.09), and which represent about 20% of the estimated project costs.
Technical assistance costs are estimated at manmonth costs of up to
US$12,000 for high-level short- and medium-term consultants and of up to
US$9,500 for longer-term experts, resulting in an average manmonth cost of
US$10,500 for consultants/experts and US$3,000 for trainees. This includes
the manmonth rates as applicable, reimbursable items such as travel, and
subsistence and other allowances in country of service or stay.
E. Contingencies
2.10      An allowance averaging 4% for physical contingencies has been
added to the estimated base cost to cover possible increases in plant
requirements which might be found necessary on completion of detailed
designs in later years. Price contingencies are based on annual
escalations of 7.7% in 1984 and 7.0% in 1985 and 1986 for foreign costs,
and of 10% in 1984 and 9% in 1985-87 for local costs. The price escalation
has been calculated on a compounded basis up to the dates at which orders
would be placed. Import duties and local taxes, which are included in the
local costs, have been escalated at the same rates as the costs to which
they relate. Overall price escalations represent about 18% of project base
cost. This is made up of about 11% on foreign and 25% on local base costs.
F. Procurement
2.11      All materials or equipment to be financed from the Bank loan
would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines. To meet some specific or urgent needs, such as for
special transport and handling facilities, cable laying, and sundry testing
and measuring equipment or tools required under the project, all being
expected to be imported equipment, DGT would be permitted to purchase items
under government purchase procedures, as normally followed by P&T, which
require obtaining quotations from at least three manufacturers or suppliers
and are acceptable to the Bank, with the provision that the foreign cost of
each item should not exceed US$75,000 equivalent and that all contracts so
awarded would not exceed US$900,000 equivalent. If either cables,
switching or transmission equipment is procured under ICB from the local
factories, preference for local manufacturing would apply in accordance
with Bank guidelines.



- 13 -
2.12      For contracts expected to amount to US$250,000 or more,
procurement documentation will be submitted to the Bank for prior review
resulting in a coverage of about 90% of the estimated value of the
contracts for goods and services. For contracts under US$250,000, the
borrower's procurement decisions and ICB procedure would be submitted to
the Bank for post-review and approval, before initiating withdrawal
application. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with Bank
guidelines.
G. Project Implementation
2.13      The project will be implemented by DGT.  Its proposed
implementation schedule is set out in Annex 15 and is realistic. DGT's
management has enough general experience to manage the works under the
project. Improved planning and construction methodologies and more
effective control of the implementation would be introduced with the
assistance of consultants and specialists in local networks and
transmission systems as provided under the project. DGT's engineers have
prepared or are preparing engineering designs and technical specifications
for all equipment. DGT's staff will install most of the equipment except
for coaxial cable line and carrier systems which would be installed by the
suppliers. SONATITE would lay and commission most of the cables and
install part of the cable ducts. DGT would supervise most of the civil
works done by local contractors. Acceptance and commissioning tests would
be carried out by DGT. Bidding documents are being prepared by DGT for its
program and for the proposed Bank project. Calling for tenders concerning
complex transmission systems was made in 1982/83 and is expected to be
completed by mid 1985 for most items. Tender documents for important items
are presently being reviewed by the Bank. Most of the contracts would be
awarded by end 1985. The project is expected to be completed by June 30,
1988 including the time required for supervision of (and training in)
operation and maintenance of complex transmission systems during the
initial operation and guarantee periods of the systems.
H. Disbursements
2.14      Disbursement would be made on 100% of foreign expenditures or
100% of ex-factory cost of local expenditures for goods and services under
the project, and 100% of foreign expenditures for consultants and overseas
fellowships. P&T intends to start implementing the technical assistance
program as early as possible. Field work of three senior consultants in
organization, planning and financial management and of the experts in basic
technical guidelines and operation of the networks would begin early in
1984. So far, P&T has awarded, under ICB procedures in accordance with
Bank guidelines and under Bank supervision, six contracts for goods under
the proposed project, essentially with regard to coaxial cable and rural
systems. Total value of these contracts is about US$12.0 million
equivalent. Based on a tentative schedule of loan processing and on the
assumptions of loan signature in January 1984, there would be a need for
retroactive financing from June 1, 1983 of about US$4.0 million,



- 14 -
representing the initial payment under the contracts. The estimated
schedule of disbursements is set out in Annex 16. The loan is expected to
be fully disbursed by June 30, 1989, which would be the closing date of the
proposed loan.
I. Performance Indicators
2.15      A set of indicators which will help monitor DGT's performance on
project implementation and its operational and financial performance during
the project period are set out in Annex 17. These indicators have been
discussed during negotiations and will be included in DGT's project
progress reporting requirements.
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis relates primarily to the Algerian P&T's
telecommunications investment program, of which the proposed Bank project
is an integral part. The part of P&T's program on which the analysis was
made covers the period 1983-88.
A.  Telecommunications and Development
3.02      In Algeria there is a large and rapidly growing demand for
telephone service, and call traffic congestion of parts of the network is
severe during peak hours (paras 1.07 and 1.11). The proposed program will
contribute to better meet forecast demand by the end of 1988 (para 1.15).
3.03      The National Third Five-year Plan, of which P&T's program is a
part, was designed to redress the imbalances which rapid industrialization
has generated in the economy during the 1970s. Emphasis is put on social
sectors such as housing, education and health, on equitable regional
development, and on productivity in agriculture and industry. The recent
move towards conserving oil reserves may be seen as part of a general trend
towards consolidation and the improved use of all resources. An integral
part of this process over the next few years will be the decentralization
of planning and management, and the better integration of all regions into
national economic development. There is also a growing orientation towards
self-sufficiency in the productive industrial and service sectors.
3.04      The current level of telecommunications access and usage is low
compared to the level and complexity of economic activity in such a large
country (para 1.05). The need for an efficient means of communication will
grow rapidly as economic consolidation and integration proceed. Specific
benefits from the expansion of telecommunications services under the third
program will include:  (a) fuller use of existing telecommunications
installations by better planning and management; (b) improved quality of
service and alleviation of congestion, and reducing subscribers' wasted
time at peak hours, thereby considerably reducing for both subscribers and
P&T the average cost per completed call; (c) provision of service to a



- 15 -
large number of new subscribers currently waiting for telephone service;
(d) increased ability of the Algerian P&T to finance its own expansion,
thus freeing resources otherwise provided by the government for use
elsewhere in the national economy; (e) enlarged market areas for goods and
services; (f) savings in transport and energy arising from the partial
substitution of low-cost telecommunications, an important factor in such a
large country; and (g) facilitating participation of remote or isolated
communities in regional and national economic and social activities.
3.05      A sample analysis made at the time of project appraisal showed
that currently the overall penetration of telephone service related
strongly to urbanization, literacy and emphasis on industrial employment.
Such relationships are being examined by P&T in the light of the ongoing
development in the high plateau region.
B. Distribution of Benefits
3.06      There are both economic efficiency and social equity aspects to
the distribution of benefits from the proposed telecommunications
investment program. Algeria has a centrally planned economy, and the exact
level at which a service should be priced for maximum economic efficiency
relates to the mix of prices charged for the myriad other goods and
services. However, it may be reasonably assumed that in general in urban
areas, those who obtain the greatest benefits from telephone service are
willing to pay the highest price. Thus, increases in revenues obtained
from restructuring and/or increasing the tariffs should help to ensure
that, in areas where service is available, telephone access and use will be
better allocated.
3.07      It has been estimated that the proportion of business telephones
to the total number of telephones is about 57% (para 1.08), and that the
proportion of waiting business subscribers is about 49%. However, the
proportion of business telephone stations out of the total number of
stations added over the project period will probably be greater than either
of these figures, because: (a) the preference is for expansion in the
semi-urban and rural areas where nonresidential business demand
predominates; (b) the drive for management efficiency in the economy will
require better communications, resulting in increased business demand; (c)
residential demand is typically more price elastic than business demand,
and the tariff increase may cause a shift towards proportionately higher
business use; and (d) refusal rates when offered service are typically
higher among residential subscribers. Furthermore, experience in other
developing countries suggests that residential telephones are utilized to a
significant extent for work-related communication and other forms of
participation in the economy.
3.08      There are also strong social equity aspects to the program.  In
Algeria it is felt that there are particular social aspects to public
utilities such as telecommunications, and policies pertaining to the
distribution of benefits have to take such aspects into account. To
examine the distributional aspects, an index of the level of development of



- 16 -
each of the 31 wilayas in Algeria was developed (see project file). The
index measures the relation of the use of telecommunications services in
the urban centers to use in the rest of the wilaya, and reveals that the
proposed rate of growth in telecommunications access is significantly
higher for the less developed wilayas. This shows an emphasis on a more
equitable distribution of development, thus tending to avoid reinforcement
of higher urban use. The telephone expansion in rural and provincial areas
aims primarily at providing service for all administrative entities at
those levels. In addition, publicly available telephone call offices will
be introduced for the first time into approximately 800 small communities.
This increased access into rural and provincial areas, together with
suitable tariff measures, should ensure a more even distribution of the
telephone service in the long run, and thus better opportunity for the
rural and provincial areas to participate in the economy.
3.09      Finally, DGT's development program will have a favorable fiscal
impact. P&T pays a uniform global production tax, equivalent to 11% (25%
in some cases) of the net value of all equipment it purchases. This
includes imports and local goods and works. Customs duties on imported
goods range from 10% to 70%, the latter for items that compete with locally
manufactured goods, and average about 24% for DGT's imports. In addition,
there is a 6.4% tax on installation charges locally contracted and a 10%
tax on installation by foreign suppliers. Estimited taxes and duties on
the foreign exchange component of the 1983-88 tejecommunications investment
program would be about DA 600 million, and taxes on the local cost
component would be about DA 700 million; thus, DGT would generate about
DA 1,300 million in funds for the treasury during the third plan. In
addition, revenues brought about by increased tariffs and improved
utilization of existing and future investments over the period 1983-1988
will produce net internal cash generation of about DA 5.1 billion
(US$1,109 million); DGT's needs for Treasury advances will be this much
less and corresponding amounts could be used for development projects in
other sectors. The proportion of total investments financed by net
internal cash generation will be about 59% during the project period,
rising to about 62% by the end of the project. This is up from 33% over
the 1979-82 period.
C. Tariff Policies
3.10      A summary of tariffs as of February 1, 1983 is set out in
Annex 18. Telecommunications tariffs were increased in 1965, 1975 and
1983; the most recent increase averaged about 55%, effective February 1,
1983. Past tariff increases have not had a noticeable impact on telephone
traffic and new subscriber demand. As a result of the recent tariff
increase, P&T increased the base call charge by 50% from DA 0.40 to DA 0.60
and restructured national tariffs by generally increasing the cost of long
distance calls and virtually doubling the connection charge from DA 490
(average) to DA 900 (US$196). Algeria's telephone tariffs are in the
middle range compared to those of other countries, as shown in Annex 19
where an indicative comparison is made of the yearly cost to subscribers of
sample telephone usage in Algeria with that of other countries. Beginning



- 17 -
in 1984, a six-minute limit to the duration of local calls will be
progressively introduced in large cities where digital exchanges will be
installed under DGT's program. The rate for automatic long distance calls
is reduced by 40% between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. These lower off-peak rates
reflect the lower marginal cost of carrying traffic outside the peak
periods.
3.11      The tariff structure leans towards providing somewhat less costly
telephone service for subscribers outside the main urban areas, the size of
the monthly rentals being set according to the size of the subscribers'
network, with charges ranging from DA 19.20 (US$4.17) for a network of less
than 2,000 lines, up to DA 42 (US$9.10) for a network larger than 50,000
lines. This is common practice in other countries and has some
justification in terms of value-of-use rationale. However, since in
telecommunications the production costs decrease with scale and density,
this means that there are probably some non cost-based tariff elements in
provincial and rural areas in comparison with the urban areas, in
particular Algiers and Oran. A similar arrangement applies to the call
charges for which a duration limit will be introduced in large cities.
3.12      During the project period the tariff structure should be examined
in order to establish the extent to which tariffs diverge from the
incremental costs of providing the services, and thus assess the
implications on economic efficiency in the use of existing plant and new
investment. In order that this examination may relate the tariff policies
to the country's economie and social goals, it should also address the
identification of the user groups charged at more, or less, favorable
rates, and analyze the use which they are making of the telephone. The
analysis would compare tariffs with the cost of services, in the context of
government development and social objectives and in consideration of DGT's
goals of efficient operations and development. P&T will carry out such a
tariff study as part of the project, following the introduction of a cost
accounting system (para 4.12) by December 31, 1986, and in accordance with
terms of reference agreed to by the Bank (para 4.21). The conclusions from
this study would be taken into account in future tariff action as required
for DGT's operations and development.
D. Least Cost Solution
3.13      The configuration of the existing network and the development
targets proposed under P&T's program do not give much scope for viable
alternative technical solutions. The Bank-financed project is based on
standard engineering and economic techniques, with appropriate provisioning
periods for various plants, and studies designed to determine the
least-cost solution for each project component. Since 1980, under SFYP,
P&T has been studying the most adequate switching equipment to use at
transit and international and at local exchange levels in its network. In
1982, P&T decided, with government's agreement, that: (a) the digital
technology should and will be rapidly introduced for the transit and large
exchanges, as well as in the long-distance network, where justified; and
(b) switching equipment of electromechanical crossbar type manufactured for



- 18 -
P&T by ENTC in its Tlemcen factory will continue to be used for small and
medium-size exchanges under the program. Digital equipment is, at present,
cheaper than mechanical equipment for transit and large exchanges and it
better fulfills operational requirements of such exchanges for now and in
future. P&T's decision is appropriate. It is in line with those being
made worldwide, and will result in a decreased average cost per line under
its program. Tlemcen production, including private branch exchanges, would
be maintained at about 60,000 equivalent lines per year. It will also
enable to complete to full capacity existing crossbar exchanges and to
rapidly install smaller exchanges where required under the program. P&T
buys ENTC's production at costs commensurating with prices of imported
equipment of the same type. In general, the technologies adopted in the
project and program are effective in promoting low installation and
maintenance costs. The technical assistance included in the project
(para 4.20) will enable P&T to have suitable detailed definitions of the
equipment and works, efficient use and operation of the facilities, as well
as proper development planning and execution.
E. Return on Investment
3.14       The internal financial rate of return, defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the present value of the cost and revenue streams (in
1983 prices) attributable to the program, is about 15%. Details of the
calculation of the rate of return are given in Annex 20.
3.15       It is difficult to estimate the real benefits of the program for
the following reasons: (a) the tariff structure probably produces some
imbalances in that prices charged for specific services may not always
accurately reflect costs; (b) the response of subscribers to this distorted
tariff structure is expressed in terms of preference for other goods and
services, which are centrally priced, and thus willingness to pay may not
be a good indication of relative benefit; and (c) demand exceeds supply by
over 60%.
3.16       Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that the internal
financial rate of return underestimates the real benefits to be derived
from the investment program. For example, the 33% tariff increase in May
1975 produced no noticeable decline in traffic or demand for service in
either the short or the long run, indicating that at that time the users
and applicants believed that the benefits they received from service
outweighed the additional cost. Considering that unsatisfied demand
throughout Algeria is very high, and that previous tariff increases
produced no measurable change in consumer behavior, it appears likely that
a substantial consumer surplus exists even after the most recent tariff
increase.
3.17       Adjusting for taxes and duties, and estimating a portion of the
consumer surplus by tabulating prices in real terms (1983 level) over the
program period, an estimate of the quantifiable economic rate of return
would be 38%. In estimating this potential consumer surplus, it is assumed
that existing and new subscribers over the project period will be prepared



- 19 -
to pay the prices in real terms that existing subscribers and applicants
have shown to be willing to pay (Annex 20). This is considered to be a
reasonable assumption.
F. Risk
3.18      The program and the project offer limited risk.  The principal
risk is the possibility of delayed physical implementation and the
resulting slowing down of investment expenditures and disbursements. In
telecommunications projects, which comprise a large number of relatively
independent activities, delay in the completion of some works does not
generally prevent the use of other assets. A sensitivity analysis on the
economic rate of return indicates that a 10% increase in capital
expenditures would result in an economic rate of return of about 35%, while
a 10% decrease in operating revenues would result in a rate of return of
about 34%. A combination of these factors plus a 10% increase in operating
expenses would result in an economic rate of return of about 31%. A
further sensitivity analysis for the program shows that one and two year
delays of all benefits (but not of costs) would result in minimum economic
rates of return of 29% and 24% respectively, which is satisfactory.
G. Environmental and Health Aspects
3.19      The program is not expected to adversely affect the environment
or public health in any way. On the contrary, it is likely to lead to more
efficient utilization of vehicles and fuel, and facilitate delivery of
health services as well as emergency interventions. As the project will
provide better telephone and telex services, a reduction in vehicle use for
personal travel could be achieved, thus improving the present level of
efficiency of business communications, particularly in Algiers and Oran.
This will result in some energy conservation and reduction of environmental
pollution.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
A. Organization and Management
4.01      The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T) will be the
beneficiary and implementing agency of the proposed project. P&T was
constituted by, and functions in accordance with, Presidential Ordinance
75-89 of December 30, 1975, which confirms and codifies the powers and
responsibilities vested in the Ministry to administer and operate the state
monopolies for postal and telecommunications services. The Ordinance also
defines the financial services entrusted to P&T, such as postal checking
accounts, savings accounts, money orders, etc. The Ordinance provides that
P&T will have a separate budget annexed to the government budget. For each
branch of service, the budget details operating and investment expenditures
under separate sections. The investment section needs to be approved by
the Ministry of Planning. P&T is required to cover all operating expenses,



- 20 -
including depreciation and debt service, from operating revenues.  Tariffs
are proposed by P&T and set by the Ministry of Finance. Under the
authority of the Minister, P&T is basically organized into a central
administration in Algiers and directorates in the wilayas. These
directorates have basic responsibility for the service to the public in the
wilayas (prefectures) and to the "Walis" (Prefects) who represent the
government at the regional level.
4.02      Effective January 1, 1983, three Presidential Decrees were
promulgated to redefine the functions and responsibilities and the
organization of P&T at the Ministry's Central Administration level. Under
the Minister's authority, P&T's organization provides for a secretary
general and five directorates general (DG) for the Telecommunications
Branch (DGT), for the Postal/Financial Branch (DGP), for common services
(buildings, transport, and procurement), for general administration, human
and financial resources and training, and for programming, planning,
organization and information systems. The new organization aims at
improving P&T's efficiency and programming/planning capability and at
streamlining the Ministry's various branches of activities. The accounting
department (Agence Comptable) reports directly to the Minister. There is
also a general inspectorate for the Ministry. P&T's current organization
chart is shown in Annex 21.
B. Telecommunications Branch
4.03      DGT administers the telecommunications monopoly, provides
services to the public and defines general policy in regard to
telecommunications. Important internal support services, such as
personnel, accounting, budget, buildings and transport are provided to DGT
by the two other directorates general in charge of these common services.
DGT comprises four directorates: for programming/planning and industrial
relations, for switching, for transmission (covering development, technical
operation and maintenance in each field), and for operations, commercial
action and tariffs. In addition, DGT has some operational units or
"centers" providing common services to P&T, such as for procurement of
telecommunications equipment, central stores, research, testing and
inspection, etc. At regional level, since 1979, there are seven
operational directorates for telecommunications (DOT) charged with the
technical function in about four wilayas each. The DOTs coordinate and
monitor telecommunications development and operations within the wilayas.
Also, two divisions reporting to the DGs for planning and information
systems and for financial resources are providing services for the
telecommunications branch, viz., the data processing division and the
accounting division respectively (paras 4.05 and 4.09). Annex 21 shows
DGT's basic internal organization; its organization, functioning,
responsibilities and staffing are outlined in detail in the Decree of
January 1983 on the organization of P&T's Central Administration and in the
UNDP/World Bank Study Volume B, Chapter 2 (see project file).



- 21 -
C. Postal/Financial Branch
4.04      P&T's postal/financial branch is operated by DGP.  In addition to
providing postal services, DGP operates a nationwide checking account
system and collects funds on behalf of the National Savings Bank.
Postal/financial services in Algeria are generally reliable, accurate and
timely.
D. Data Processing
4.05      P&T's data processing division, under the DG for planning and
information systems, has five medium-power computers and eight
mini-computers which are being used primarily for checking and savings
accounts transactions, payroll processing, and billing of the 425,000
telephone subscribers in Algeria. The growth of demand on computer
capacity for existing and future applications has prompted P&T to
reconsider the scope and contents of its data processing requirements. A
well-designed data processing plan was drawn up and has been partially
implemented. New applications of P&T's computer capacity in areas such as
accounting, inventory management, directory assistance, preparation of the
telephone directory, management of the telephone network, personnel
management, management information and accounting, are under consideration.
E. Management Information System
4.06      P&T's management is currently presented with large quantities of
statistics and administrative data; however, presentation is unstructured
and does not facilitate decision making. A management information system
based on the expanded data processing capacity of P&T would be established
through the management improvement program (para 4.19). The system would
define the responsibilities for data gathering and decision making at
different levels in the organization, and the contents and frequency of
management reports. For each branch of activity, the system should meet
the managerial and operational requirements at the different levels of
decision making. In particular, it should incorporate the revised
accounting system (para 4.12). Two consultants would be recruited,
financed from the proceeds of the proposed loan (para 4.20), to assist in
preparing and implementing the management information system.
F. Staff
4.07      As of December 31, 1982, P&T's total staff was 27,870, of which
15,803 was for telecommunications. Salaries have been adjusted roughly
pari passu with the increase in the consumer price index over the 1974-82
period. Personnel costs now represent 62% of the operating expenditures of
the telecommunications branch, and any further improvement in its financial
performance (para 5.12) will depend to a large extent on the success of
measures to reduce the ratio of the number of staff per 1,000 DELs. This
ratio has already slightly reduced since 1980, and P&T plans to further
decrease it from 39 per 1,000 DELs (1982) to 23 per 1,000 DELs by the end
of 1988. This measure is crucial to the productivity and future financial



- 22 -
performance of the telecommunications branch. A decreasing staff ratio
would be one of the principal performance indicators of DGT (para 2.15).
G. Training
4.08      P&T ensures the specialized training of its staff at all levels
for both posts and telecommunications. Its training organization handles
the following facilities:
(a) the central P&T school in Algiers. The present capacity
is for 600 students at one time. It trains middle and
upper levels of non-engineering staff as well as junior
technicians and other maintenance staff;
(b) regional schools at Constantine and Ouargla and under
construction at Saida. Total capacity is 250 students to
be extended to 750 students, from 1986 when the three
schools will be operational at full capacity. Middle
level operational and installation staff would be trained;
(c) the telecommunications institute at Oran (ITO). The
present capacity of 1,000 students at one time will be
increased to 1,300 in 1986. ITO receives assistance from
UNDP/ITU and has also a significant number of teachers,
paid for mainly with bilateral assistance. It trains
higher level telecommunications staff, including
specialized technicians and engineers in the various
branches of telecommunications. Some post-graduate
studies are performed abroad, mainly in France. About 7%
of the ITO students come from other African countries; and
(d) seven holiday centers with space for 500 to 600 students
which, during off-season, are used for short-term
training.
During the period 1983-87 P&T plans to train a total number of 14,000 of
its own staff plus approximately 500 foreign students at the above
establishments. The biggest problem in this effort is the shortage of
teachers, but P&T's training branch plans to resolve it with a teacher
training program of 220 candidates; assistance is being obtained from ITU
for the implementation of the program. The programs for training of staff
and of teachers cannot be successful without the full use of available
resources. The programs adequately cover the needs of the organization up
to the end of 1986 (see also para 4.19). Details of the staff training
program and of the proposed expansion of the training capacity are given in
Annex 22.
H. Accounting
4.09      The responsibility for preparation of accounting data is divided
between (a) the accounting division of the financial resources department



- 23 -
and (b) the accounting department (Agence Comptable); the latter reports
directly to the Minister. The accounting division is in charge of verify-
ing the accounts of the individual post offices and the operation of the
accounting system. The Agence Comptable prepares monthly summaries of
receipts and expenditures and issues the year-end financial statements.
4.10      The number of staff in the accounting division and the Agence
Comptable is adequate considering that computers will gradually take over
the routine tasks (para 4.05). To improve the quality of its accounting
staff, P&T should provide more in-house courses or let staff participate in
courses given by institutions such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Ecole
Superieure de Commerce, and the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite.
Promotion and salary policies should be linked to successful participation
in accounting courses. Under the proposed project, consulting services
would be provided to examine the training requirements of the accounting
staff and to design and implement a training program (para 4.20).
4.11      P&T's accounts, although reasonably well kept, do not provide all
the information required for good financial management and control. Separ-
ation of accounts between the principal branches exists only for certain
items, notably on the revenue side. P&T has a cash accounting system;
accounts payable and receivable are not recorded in the balance sheets. No
distinction is made between fixed assets and work in progress (other than
buildings). The last review of the fixed assets register took place in
1968. Depreciation is calculated over fixed assets on the books as of the
beginning of the fiscal year only. There is a lack of proper inventory
management, control and valuation.
4.12      Reorganization of P&T's accounting system is necessary and is
being planned. P&T plans to introduce, within the framework of the
national accounting system, accrual accounting and separation of accounts
between telecommunications and postal/financial services. In addition, P&T
wishes to undertake a review of its fixed assets register and related
procedures. Although these various tasks will be carried out to some
extent by P&T's staff, outside assistance in design and implementation is
necessary and has been requested. The proposed project would provide
consulting services through the management improvement program (para
4.20). During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the government
that P&T will introduce, by January 1, 1986, accrual and cost accounting
systems providing for separation of the accounts of the telecommunications
and postal/financial branches.
I. Billing and Collection
4.13      Billing is on a bimonthly basis and is--since 1982--fully
computerized (para 4.05). Bills are delivered on the 15th day of the month
following the billing period. Service is suspended if payment has not been
received by the end of that month. The accounts receivable situation is
satisfactory (para 5.07).



- 24 -
J. External Auditing Arrangements
4.14      Government has informed the Bank that the Inspection Generale des
Finances (IGF) of the Ministry of Finance will carry out the external
audits of P&T's accounts in future, and that its reports will be submitted
to the Bank. The IGF has been accepted as independent auditor in previous
Bank projects in Algeria. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Government that: (a) audits will be carried out in accordance with
generally accepted auditing principles; and (b) P&T's audited financial
statements would be submitted within six months after the end of the fiscal
year starting with 1984.
K. Budget Preparation and Control
4.15      P&T's budget consists of two parts:  the operating budget and the
investment budget. The operating budget is prepared at the wilaya level,
reviewed by the budget division of the general administration department,
and must show an overall surplus (para 5.02). The investment budget is
prepared by the central departments of P&T, within the framework of the
national investment plan. Both budgets are submitted to the National
Assembly for approval in October/November of each year, where they are
incorporated in the finance law which details expenditures and authorizes
commitments and borrowings.
4.16      The budget division exercises strict control over expenditures by
checking them monthly against budget chapter allocations. Although
officially the Comptroller of the Treasury has to approve major
expenditures prior to their being incurred, in practice only actual
suppliers' invoices are submitted for ex post facto approval. The budget
division summarizes year-end results by budget chapter, leading to requests
for, or cancellation of, credits to be included in the closure law.
Although marginal improvements could be made in budget preparation and
control procedures, the existing situation is satisfactory.
4.17      All P&T funds are public funds which P&T is expected to transfer
to the Treasury when received. On postal checking account deposits with
the Treasury relating to nongovernment customers, it receives between 2.25%
(parapublic sector) and 2.50% annual interest (private sector), which is
about equal to the rate at which it borrows funds from the Treasury
(para 5.02). P&T is entitled to keep a working capital balance equivalent
to up to three months' of operating expenditures. This arrangement is
satisfactory.
L. Insurance
4.18      So far, the high cost of commercial assets and liability
insurance has favored self-insurance by the government, which is in line
with the policy adopted in many other countries. Procedures for



- 25 -
replacement of lost or damaged assets, via supplementary budget
allocations, are sufficiently flexible to make this arrangement acceptable.
M. Management Improvement Program
4.19      P&T is aware of the vital managerial and organizational
improvements needed in virtually all major areas of its administration and
operations. The UNDP/WB study made a thorough evaluation of the present
situation in this respect and recommended a suitable course of action; it
also defined the outside assistance required to implement the proposed
measures. Following the study, the Minister formed in 1981 a working group
at the highest level within P&T to prepare a comprehensive action program
in this field, hereafter referred to as the management improvement program
(MIP). The recommendations of the working groups were formulated in 1982
and resulted in the reorganization of P&T's central administration as
promulgated by Presidential Decrees in January 1983. This was followed by
the decrees on tariff increases which had been set as a condition of
presentation of this project to the Board of Directors. The measures taken
were along the lines discussed during appraisal and earlier negotiations of
the proposed project. Other measures included in the MIP remain to be
implemented. These measures concern all branches of P&T's activities and
would provide for strengthening, assisting and improving P&T's general
administration, financial management and accounting system, its
operational, planning and developmental capabilities, staff training and
expansion of training facilities, together with the creation of new
services such as a specialized center for applied research and technical
control. The proposed Bank project would finance part of this program
through its technical assistance component, which covers the essential
requirements of the telecommunications branch.
4.20      Under further implementation of the MIP, the Bank would finance
100% of the foreign exchange cost (US$2 million) of about 170 manmonths of
consultants and 100 manmonths of staff training. Technical assistance
under the project would provide the following services and expertise over a
period of approximately two years:
(a)  management and organization of telecommunications
development, planning and implementation, operations and
personnel (2 consultants for a total of about 20 manmonths
and 15 manmonths of staff training);
(b) technical guidelines and fundamental plans for local and
long distance network construction and operation; traffic
and service quality analyses; and development of new
services (3 consultants for a total of about 24 manmonths
and 15 manmonths of staff training);
(c) development planning and management, detailed planning and
construction methodology and supervision of program/
project execution in switching, transmission and local
network techniques (5 consultants for a total of about 45
manmonths and 30 manmonths of staff training);



- 26 -
(d)  design of an integrated management information system,
including computer programing, and assistance in
implementing it (2 consultants for a total of about 24
manmonths and 10 manmonths of staff training);
(e)  introduction of an accrual accounting system, separation
of the accounts of the telecommunications and postal/
financial services, updating of the fixed assets register,
introduction of proper inventory control and valuation
procedures, and design and implementation of an accounting
staff training program (4 consultants for a total of about
44 manmonths and 20 manmonths of staff training);
(f)  review of the telecommunications tariffs (para 3.12)
(2 consultants for a total of about 8 manmonths and 6
manmonths of staff training); and
(g)  unallocated to eventually complement the above services,
about 10 manmonths of consultants and 4 manmonths of staff
training.
4.21      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that the project's management improvement and training program would be
carried out starting no later than March 1, 1984, and ending March 31,
1986, and in accordance with the agreed terms of reference of the
consultants and timetable. The proposed timetable is given in Annex 23.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Background
5.01      Postal/Financial Operations - In addition to telecommunications
services, P&T also provides postal/financial services (para 4.04). Pro
forma separation of the financial statements of the two branches for the
period 1974-78 was prepared by consultants financed under the UNDP/WB
preinvestment study and for the period 1979-82 by P&T staff. These
statements indicate that the financial performance of the postal/financial
branch was satisfactory during the period 1974-82, with strong operating
surpluses in each year. Postal tariffs were increased effective
February 1, 1983, by an average of 50% on both domestic and international
services.
B.  Past Financial Policy
5.02      Existing legislation demands that P&T's tariffs be established so
as to enable it to cover at least its own operating expenses, including
depreciation and debt service. During the period 1974-82, P&T also
financed 26% of its consolidated construction requirements from net
internal cash generation.  The remainder has been financed almost entirely



- 27 -
by Treasury advances with a 20-year final maturity, including a grace
period of 4 years and an interest rate of 2.5%. The same terms apply for
Treasury lending to other sectors of the Algerian economy.
5.03      The remainder of Chapter V deals exclusively with the
telecommunications branch.
C. Past Performance
5.04      The financial statements of the telecommunications branch are
presented in Annexes 24 to 26. A summary of the key indicators of its past
financial performance follows:

a/ As a percentage of construction requirements.
5.05      Measured by traditional yardsticks the past financial performance
has been weak, due to the financial policy followed thus far (para 5.02);
however, the trend since 1980 shows a gradual improvement in the financial
performance of DGT. Gross assets in service quadrupled from DA 1.4 billion
in 1974 to an estimated DA 6.0 billion (US$1.3 billion equivalent) by the
end of 1982. The rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation
reflects this rapid expansion and averaged 3.2% during the period 1979-82.
Operating ratios averaged 86%, while net internal cash generation
contributed 33% of construction requirements. Prior to the 1983 tariff
increase (para 3.10) tariffs were increased last in May 1975. Despite
considerable annual increases in domestic prices since then, the
telecommunications branch has been able to maintain a fairly level
financial performance due to a 200% increase in telephone subscribers
during the period 1975-82.
D. Present Financial Position
5.06      A summary of the estimated financial position as of December 31,
1982 is given below:

Balance Sheet
As of December 31, 1982       DA Million

- Other borrowings              131
Current liabilities              155
Total Liabilities           5,780
Current ratio                      4.6
Debt/equity ratio                83/17
Gross fixed assets in service (DA 6.0 billion) are shown at book value.
Following DGT's decision to switch from crossbar to electronic digital
equipment under its expanded program for large capacity exchanges (paras
2.01 and 3.13) book value now fairly represents replacement value. The
current ratio is satisfactory at 4.6. Under an accrual accounting system
this ratio would have been different, because accounts receivable and
accounts payable would be included under current assets and liabilities.
The debt/equity ratio of 83/17 reflects P&T's heavy reliance on Treasury
borrowings for financing construction requirements, consistent with past
financial policy (para 5.02).
E. Accounts Receivable
5.07      Although P&T does not have an accrual accounting system
(para 4.11), the accounts receivable situation is being monitored very
closely. The information provided indicates that, as of the end of 1982,
arrears were DA 121 million or 1.5 months of billing. This favorable
situation is due to strict enforcement of suspension and disconnection
policies for private subscribers. By decree of April 1978, government
agencies can be forced to pay through direct deduction from their Treasury
accounts, even when budget allocations for telecommunications usage are
exhausted.



- 29 -
5.08      The principal--and virtually only--collection problem relates to
the Radio Television Algerienne (RTA).  Agreement on a tariff schedule for
RTA's use of circuit facilities of P&T's domestic satellite system was
reached in 1980. P&T has billed RTA for a total amount of DA 52 million
through 1982. Government recently informed the Bank that a repayment
schedule has been agreed upon for RTA's arrears and that it would ensure
prompt settlement of bills for current usage.
F. Future Financial Policy
5.09      The Government has recently agreed to proposals made by P&T
aimed at increasing the level of net internal cash generation of the
telecommunications branch to about 50% or more of construction
requirements. A similar approach is taken in many other countries where
telecommunications entities fund a relatively large portion of their
construction requirements from internal sources. Implementation of this
policy would enable the government to spend less Treasury funds on
telecommunications and correspondingly more on the development of other
sectors of the economy.
5.10      Achievement of a contribution to construction requirements of at
least 50%, with possibly higher levels during and after the project
implementation period, is an acceptable and realistic target for DGT. As
from February 1983, P&T introduced a 50% increase in the base call charge
which is expected to produce a revenue increase of the same magnitude (para
3.10). Combined with the proposed staff efficiency improvements (para
4.07) and the potential to better utilize present and new installations
(para 3.04) DGT should be able to achieve this target.
G. Financing Plan
5.11      The forecast funds flow statements for the period 1983-90 are
shown in Annex 25. A summary of the sources and applications of funds
during the project implementation period (1983-88) follows:

TOTAL APPLICATIONS                  9,010   1,959  100
It has been assumed that the proposed IBRD loan and future external
borrowings would be at an 11% interest rate with a final maturity of 15
years, including 3 years of grace, and that residual borrowing requirements
will be financed through Treasury loans at the currently prevailing terms
(para 5.02). An existing commercial credit with Credit Industriel et
Commercial is at 7.75% interest and a seven year maturity without grace
period. DGT would finance during the project implementation period 57% of
total applications from net internal cash generation (59% of construction
requirements), which is satisfactory.
H. Future Finances
5.12      Forecast income and funds flow statements, and balance sheets for
the 1983-90 period are in Annexes 24 to 26. Assumptions on the financial
projections are in Annex 27. The key financial indicators of the
telecommunications branch for the project period are given below. Net
earnings are expected to show satisfactory progress as the combined effect
of tariff increase and efficiency improvements takes hold. Net internal
cash generation is expected to increase significantly compared to the
period 1979-82 (para 5.04), indicating a satisfactory financial performance
of the telecommunications branch.

5.13      Net internal cash generation as a percentage of construction
requirements is expected to average 59% during the project period. In the
years following project completion, net internal cash generation is
forecast to further increase (Annex 25). At this stage of its development,
the Algerian telecommunications branch needs to focus on generating funds
to finance its large investment program and on reducing its reliance on
Treasury loans correspondingly. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Government that it will take all the necessary measures
to enable the telecommunications branch to achieve an appropriate ratio of
net internal cash generation to construction requirements. In this
context, the Government has assigned a ratio of about 50% from 1983 through
1988, and higher ratios in the years thereafter, as an objective for the
telecommunications sector. The corresponding rate of return on average net
fixed assets in service would increase from about 4% in 1982 to about 11%
in 1983 and thereafter (Annex 24). Also during negotiations, assurances
were obtained from the government that P&T will prepare and review, before
September 30 of each year, financial statements for the current and next
fiscal year indicating the estimated net internal cash generation ratios,
and present these statements to the Bank.
5.14      The forecast financial statements indicate that annual debt
service coverage will be satisfactory at an average of 3.1 during the
project period. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government that it will charge the amortization, interest and other charges
on the loan against DGT's budget at the prevailing standard Bank terms.
5.15      The data available in the project file and the related documents
are listed in Annex 28.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
A. Agrements Reached
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the government
that:



- 32 -
(a) P&T will introduce, effective January 1, 1986, an accrual
and a cost accounting system providing for separation of
the accounts of the telecommunications and
postal/financial branches (para 4.12);
(b)  P&T will:  (i) submit its accounts and financial
statements to an annual external audit; and (ii) submit
audited financial statements within six months after the
end of each fiscal year to the Bank (para 4.14);
(c) P&T will carry out the management improvement and training
program during the period starting March 1, 1984 and
ending March 31, 1986 (paras 4.20 and 4.21);
(d) the telecommunications branch will achieve an appropriate
net internal cash generation ratio averaging at least 50%
of construction requirements during the project
implementation period (para 5.13);
(e) P&T will prepare and review, before September 30 of each
year, financial statements for the current and the next
fiscal year indicating the net internal cash generation
ratios, and submit these statements to the Bank
(para 5.13); and
(f) P&T will charge amortization and all interest and other
charges on the loan against P&T's budget for the
telecommunications branch at the prevailing standard Bank
terms (para 5.14).
B. Recommendation
6.02      With the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$128 million including the capitalized front-end fee, at a
variable rate of interest and related fees, to be repaid over a period of
15 years, including a 3-year grace period.

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Project Description
General
1.        The project consists of part of DGT's investment program to be
started in 1983 and for execution until end 1987. It includes high
priority items representing about 22% of the total investment during this
period, to expand and modernize national regional and local networks in
order to satisfy urgent demand for network expansion and for automatization
of telephone service in 22 important wilayas where new subscribers can be
connected rapidly, and in isolated communities now without such services.
When selecting the project components, DGT considered that the project
could be of particularly great help to its current efforts to construct
local subscriber and regional networks in pace with the installation of
automatic switching equipment. The proposed works represent local and
regional network facilities for the connection of about 350,000 new
subscribers, about 66% of the total number of new subscribers to be added
during the project time slice of DGT's program. The project also includes
technical assistance and training for sectorial management and
organization, for program/project engineering and execution, and to improve
future operations and financial management. This assistance is essential
to enable P&T and the DGT to implement the managerial and organizational
changes required in order to cope with DGT's operations and constructional
responsibilities which were initiated in 1983. The 22 wilayas mostly
concerned by the project are those of Annaba, Guelma, Constantine, Tebessa,
Setif, Bejaia, Blida, El Asnam, Tizi-Ouzou, Sidi-bel-Abbes, Oran, Medea,
Laghouat, Batna, Biskra, Skikda, Mostaganem, Mascara, Tlemcen, Tiaret,
Jijel and Oum-El-Bouaghi. The various components of the project are
detailed below.
Coaxial Cables and Carrier Systems for Interurban Network
2.        This includes construction and equipment of five coaxial cable
links between national and regional transit exchanges in ten important
regional districts (wilaya level), also linking the concerned wilayas with
the main east-west and north-south national trunk routes. The total length
of new coaxial cable to be laid underground is about 600 km and an existing
600 km coaxial cable of the main north-south route, now partially equipped
on one pair of tubes, will be expanded to 1900 channel capacity using
digital technique on the second pair. All five links will include line and
multiplex transmission equipment as follows:

The cable to be used is of small diameter (1.2/4.4 mm) coaxial type with
four coaxial pairs and peripheral quads of 0.9 mm diameter conductors in
number varying from 14 to 84 depending the location. Cables will be
imported for the links No. 1 to 5, and laid and spliced jointly by SONELEC
and SONATITE. The Ouargla-Constantine cable is an existing cable with 4
standard (1.2/4.4 mm) coaxial pair, 2 of which are now used with 300
channel capacity only. The two other pairs will be equipped with 140
megabits digital line systems and multiplex equipment for up to 1900
channels. Under the project, equipment of this cable will be redustributed
and expanded for channel capacities as required for the main north-south
national trunk link it will constitute, and for the regional and
interregional networks along its 600 km route. For all the links, line
equipment including repeaters and remote control, maintenance and signaling
equipment, and multiplex equipment would be supplied, installed and
delivered ready for operation by foreign manufactures.
Automatization of Regional and Rural Networks
3.        This item includes the construction of about 1000 km of medium
capacity intraregional cable and multiplex transmission systems in the 22
wilayas of the project and the installation of about 400 line-concentrators
servicing about 42,000 distant subscribers. The new cable links would
principally consist of overhead self-supporting pair cables of small or
medium capacity (from 4 to 50 pairs, 0.9 mm diameter), and of similar one
small coaxial pair (1.2/4.4 mm) cables to install on existing pole lines
now saturated. In addition to the line concentrators, this will enable
automatization of the telephone service, and access to the national
automatic network, of about 400 small capacity exchanges in rural areas.
DGT's staff will install all equipment, after initial training and
supervision from the suppliers, where necessary. Detail of the equipment
to be procured is as follows:

Local and Urban Networks
4.        This item includes the construction and the rebahilitation/
expansion of local cable and overhead line subscriber networks and outside
plants in about 450 medium and large cities in all wilayas representing
about 500,000 distributed pairs of local network available for immediate
and future connection of subscribers. Switching equipment is, or will be,
available in these localities from ongoing works or from works under the
third plan. The works comprise construction of ducts and cable of the
primary and secondary levels of the local distribution networks. In some
cases, overhead subscriber lines will prolong the underground cable
systems. DGT's planning unit designs the duct system capacity for about 20
years of expansion, and the cable distribution systems for about 2.0 to 2.5
times the known or short-term planned demand, depending the forecast pace
of growth of the networks, which is standard practice. Used cables and
equipment are of proven and largely used types. The Bank financed imported
equipment under the project, for which detailed lists of types,
characteristics and quantities are available in the project file, include
(a) local cables and accessories; (b) PVC ducts; and (c) copper wires,
poles and overhead lines accessories. These imports are complementary to
the local production by SONELEC of some categories of equipment (small and
medium capacity underground cables essentially), in order to enable the
construction of the local networks as planned by DGT. The total cost in
foreign exchange of this equipment amounting to about DA 243 million
(US$52.8 million equivalent), represents approximately 50% of total DGT's
requirements for the above three subgroups of materials during the project
period. An estimated total number of about 310,000 new subscriber
connections will be made in the local networks to be constructed or
expanded under the project, from 1984 to 1987.

PCO in Isolated Communities
5.        This item includes 600 PCOs in isolated localities now without
telephone service in 18 wilayas where population and development centers
are largely dispersed and where the road and transportation systems are
lacking or insufficient. These wilayas include 9 wilayas among the 22
selected under the project and 9 other southern wilayas with higher
priority and need for such PCO service. Of the proposed 600 PCOs, about
400 will be connected using overhead pole lines, 160 using single channel
VHF radio and 40 HF radio links of standard types. Overhead lines
equipment includes about 180,000 wooden poles and 1,200 tons of copper or
bimetallie wires, for construction of about 6,000 km of open wire pair
line. Terminal telephone stations are also included.
Miscellaneous Equipment
6.        The project also provides for equipment of large regional centers
and stores with transport and handling equipment for cables and open wire
line materials, as well as tools and machinery for network construction.
It also includes some power supply equipment and the equipment to carry out
the acceptance tests of the systems and of the external plant to be
constructed under the project.
Technical Assistance and Training
7.        Technical assistance consists of 170 manmonths of consultant and
expert services, and of 100 manmonths of training services for senior
management and professional staff of P&T and DGT to attend overseas
courses, fellowships and seminars. Annex 23 gives a proposed timetable
including specialities of the consultants and fields of study for P&T's
staff. The proposed terms of reference and schedule for these activities
were agreed during negotiations. More details are in the project file.
(UNDP/WB Study, Document B, Chapter 7.6 and Annex 7), and a timetable is
given in Annex 23.

Rate of Return on Investments
1.        The Algerian P&T's 1983-88 investment program, of which the
project is an integral part, also includes ongoing and other works. The
project is basically a time slice of the investment program and the close
relationship between project and non-project parts makes any attempted
separation arbitrary. The rates of return calculated therefore refer to
the whole of P&T's telecommunications investment program.
2.        The benefit period extends from 1983 to 2002, when on average the
equipment provided under the program will have finished its useful life.
3.        As from 1990 on operating costs and revenues related to the
program are assumed to remain constant. Incremental revenues are based on
expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and traffic brought
about by the program. Operating costs are based on additional assets and
traffic generated by the program, excluding depreciation and interest.
4.        No residual values of fixed assets have been taken into account,
as the discounted real value of these would be minimal in 1983 prices.
5.        A summary of the cost and benefit streams is given below in DA
millions. All revenues and costs have been deflated to bring them to their
comparable 1983 price levels.
Capital        Operating             Net
Year      Expenditures   Costs    Revenues       Benefits
1983          890          -          -            (890)
1984        1,100          60         248          (912)
1985        1,090         116         460          (746)
1986        1,142         172         670          (644)
1987        1,113         242         880          (475)
1988        1,304         332       1,253          (383)
1989          339         427       1,477           711
1990-2002       0         518       1,688         1,170
The net benefit stream above results in a financial rate of
return of 14.95%.

6.        Adjusting for taxes and duties, and estimating the future
consumer surplus by tabulating over the program period the prices in real
terms (1983 level) which existing subscribers and applicants are
demonstrating a willingness to pay, and assuming that new subscribers are
prepared to pay the same real price, the economic rate of return is 38%.
Labor has not been shadow priced in the above calculations as most of P&T's
staff is qualified, and there is no surplus of qualified staff in Algeria.
Foreign exchange has not been shadow priced because reliable estimates of
the shadow price are not available.
7.        A sensitivity analysis was performed on the program's economic
rate of return with the following results:
10% increase in capital expenditures:          35%
10% increase in operating expenses:            37%
10% decrease in operating revenues:            34%
Combination of all the above factors           31%
8.        A further sensitivity analysis was performed, assuming a delay in
benefits but not of costs. A one year delay of all benefits would result
in a minimum economic rate of return of 29%. A two year delay would result
in a minimum economic rate of return of 24%.

MINISTRY OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS (P&T)
GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS (DGT)
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Summary of Telecommunications Training Programs and Facilities
General Organization
1.        The General Directorate for human and financial resources,
through its directorate for training, controls P&T's specialized schools
for training the administrative and technical staff who are assigned to
posts, telecommunications or administrative branches, or move from one to
the other later. Both branches rely heavily on the university, on the
Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and on foreign institutions, for training
the higher level managers. The students attending the various courses at
P&T's schools are recruited at determined education or graduation levels
and are engaged by contract to serve P&T for a number of years varying with
the length of the courses. After successful completion of their training,
the students are junior civil servants. Part of the students get
complementary training for specialization or internal promotion. Training
is provided at the Telecommunications Institute of Oran (ITO) at engineer
and senior technician levels (1,000 students), at three regional schools in
Algiers, Constantine and Ouargla (600, 150 and 100 trainees separately) at
junior technician and "national" levels, and at smaller centers with a
total capacity of about 550 trainees in 7 other cities where shorter
duration training are taking place, at operator and worker levels.
The Telecommunications Institute of Oran
2.        ITO is the highest training center of P&T's specialized
educational system. The institute is managed and operated by P&T. Due to
the high level of education, it provides in telecommunications and
electronics at applied engineering and university engineers (Ingénieur
d'Etat) levels, it works under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher
Education and Scientific Research. ITO's various courses are as follows:
(a)  Ingénieurs d'Etat (IE courses started in October 1977,
established by cooperation with ITU): highest level in
technical field; This level was reached until this year
through foreign schools, or through Ecole Polytechnique
of El Harach. Graduation from the institute requires a



- 64 -                        ANNEX 22
Page 2 of 3
two-year general training at the university with full
credits in exact sciences, followed by three years at the
institute itself. A first group of 20 students first
graduated from this course in October 1980. Since 1981,
the full capacity of 40 IE students graduate each year,
mostly for P&T's needs but also for the needs of some
other organizations with important private
telecommunications systems. In future, ITO will also
train engineers for the local telecommunications and
electronics industry;
(b) Ingénieurs d'Application (junior graduation in applied
engineering): four years of study at the institute
starting after baccalauréat (or equivalent examination),
presently a total of more than 400 stude.ats are enrolled
in this line; and
(c) Techniciens Supérieurs (senior technicians), with two
origins:
(i) from lycées (classe de première, at first level of
high school certification), two years at the
institute--presently a total of about 160 students;
and
(ii)  from recruitment internal to P&T, opened to
technicians after five years under P&T--one year at
the institute (about 40 students).
The institute also provides courses occasionally for technicians (one year,
about 50 students) in parallel with the regular schools of Algiers,
Constantine and Ouargla, and with the military school for transmission.
3.        The Institute of Telecommunications in Oran has also about 10% of
students coming from other African countries, studying mainly at the level
Ingénieur d'Application. ITO is considered as one among the best
telecommunications training centers at this level in Africa. Its present
maximum capacity is 1,000 students, which all board at ITO during their
training, which covers about nine months of the year. Its laboratories are
well equipped for the various curriculae, partly with help from UNDP and
from bilateral institutions for equipment and pedagogy, and also with
equipment provided by the main suppliers of equipment. To this effect, the
DGT includes appropriate training elements in the large contracts for new
types of equipment. The number of students graduating at all levels from
ITO each is presently about 700. In addition, about 350 students are
attending short or medium term recycling courses in the various
specialties. About 105 of all students are specialists or trainees from
other government departments (such as army, railway, SONATRACH) and from
other French speaking countries. Existing facilities are sufficient and



- 65 -                       ANNEX 22
Page 3 of 3
adequate for present p&t requirements. ITO was expanded to 1,000 students
in 1982 and it is proposed to further expand it to 1,300 students by 1986.
This expansion will enable to meet training requirements for DGT's staff
under the ongoing expansion program and for future operations.
Training at Junior Technician, Vocational and Workers Levels
4.        At lower levels, junior technicians, testers and skilled workers
for installation, maintenance and operation of the equipment, operators and
specialized workers for maintenance and construction of overhead lines and
cable networks are trained either in the three regional schools of Algiers,
Constantine and Ouargla, or in the seven other smaller training centers.
Ocassionally, on-the-job training is also made by sending instructors from
the regional schools to where there are enough attendees.
Proposed Expansion of the Training Capacity
5.        As a part of its management and operations improvement program,
P&T is planning an important expansion of its training capacity in order to
cope with its needs of specialized technical and administrative staff at
all levels to implement its development program and for future operations.
The proposed expansion is adequately planned to cope with DGT's training
requirement for new and existing staff at completion of current program
under the third plan. The facilities will also enable to continue training
staff for the specialized telecommunications services from other government
agencies. The proposed expansion would be realized in two stages as per
the following table.

ALGERIA
MINISTRY OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS (P&T)
GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS (DGT)
Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Projections, 1983-90
Increase in domestic prices: 10% per annum
I.    Income Statements
Operating Revenues
Telephone and telex: calculations based on data shown on page 3 of
this annex. Revenues per DEL are assumed to remain virtually
constant during the period 1983-87 and to increase by about 10% in
1988, which is conservative
Telegraph: + 10% per annum
Leased circuits: + 15% per annum, including receipts from
Radiodiffusion et Television Algerienne--RTA
Reimbursable works: annual increases corresponding to percentage
increases in connected telephone lines. Works performed on a
cost-plus-10% basis for subscribers and special clients (e.g.,
Aviation, Ministry of Interior, etc.)
Works for own company: annual increases corresponding to percentage
increases in connected telephone lines
Operating Expenses
Personal costs: increases in personnel as discussed during
negotiations (see performance indicators, Annex 17); average
personnel expenses increased by annual rate of inflation
Materials: increases corresponding to rate of expansion of connected
telephone lines plus annual rate of inflation
Other expenses: increases corresponding to rate of expansion of
connected lines plus annual rate of inflation
Depreciation:  5% of average gross fixed assets in service
Other income (net): + 10% per annum, starting from a 1983 level of
DA 10 million

Page 2 of 3
II. Balance Sheets
Assets moved into service: 80% of work in progress in previous year plus
40% of the current year's capital expenditures (see page 3). For the
period 1978-82 the following adjustment was made to P&T's books to better
reflect work in progress: 100% of work in progress shown on the books
(representing buildings only) plus 50% of capital expenditures during that
year.
Cash and Banks: present cash levels are unusually high. The forecasts
assume that they will be at a more normal level equivalent to 20% of cash
operating expenses.
Accounts Receivable: an adjustment has been made in 1983 to incorporate
accounts receivable, as would be the case under an accrual accounting
system; a similar adjustment has been made under accounts payable.
Accounts receivable are forecast at a level equivalent to 15% of annual
operating revenues (1.8 months of billing).
Inventories:  2.5% of average gross fixed assets in service.
Other: + 15% per annum.
Current liabilities: + 15% per annum from 1984 (see also accounts
receivable).
