                The IQR is the ratio between the student-teacher ratio in worst-off 25% of
                schools, compared to the best-off 25%. A system to improve teacher distribution

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design1

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Economic crisis and fiscal constraints: The East Asian economic crisis of 1997 created severe
fiscal constraints and forced a 15% reduction in the Government of the Philippines (GOP)
national budget. Despite efforts by the GOP to allocate at least 40 percent of the government
budget to the social sectors, capital expenditures and non-wage recurrent spending for operations
and maintenance were negatively affected (including for textbooks and vaccines). Shortages of
social sector inputs contributed to declines in key indicators, including reduced vaccination
coverage and availability of textbooks in classrooms. These fiscal constraints in turn highlighted
the problem of high costs and inefficient expenditures on many critical inputs in the social sectors,
due to lack of transparency and inefficiencies in procurement, contract management, construction,
and logistics systems.

Weak governance and corruption. The Philippines suffers from weak governance and high levels
of public sector corruption (with perceived levels of corruption similar to Indonesia and
Vietnam).2 While governance and corruption were problems throughout government, a survey in
the mid-1990s found that the health and education sectors were perceived as being among the
most corrupt government departments, and a report by investigative journalists in 1998 estimated
that corruption and various payoffs represented 15% to 30% of the cost of government-financed
school textbooks.3 In the late 1990s, all of the Bank-financed projects in the social sectors were
either rated unsatisfactory or at risk of unsatisfactory outcomes, due largely to the weaknesses in
procurement, financial management, and implementation capacity noted above.

Decentralization reforms launched by the government in the early 1990s led to the devolution of
responsibility for basic health and social welfare services to local governments (although the
education sector remained centrally managed). Decentralization was intended to improve service
delivery and accountability to the local populations, but was implemented with insufficient
preparation, which created confusion regarding role and accountabilities.

Active civil society sector. Despite weak governance, a vibrant and diverse civil society sector
has emerged in the Philippines, with a growing number of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
seeking to strengthen accountability of government at national and local levels.

SEMP1 design and rationale. Although a 1998 evaluation by the World Bank's Operations
Evaluation Department recommended discontinuing lending to the social sectors, the Bank
instead initiated the first Social Sector Expenditure Management Project (SEMP1), which
supported the Departments of Education (DepEd) and Social Welfare and Development (DSWD),



1This ICR was prepared by a World Bank team composed of Timothy Johnston (Task Team Leader),
Lynnette Perez, Eduardo Banzon, Maria Loreto Padua, Cesar Banzon, and Arindam Dutta. The document
was developed through consultation with government agencies ­ DBM, DepED, DOH and DSWD and
civil society organizations. Special thanks to these agencies and to DBM Undersecretary Laura Pascua for
their input and support.

under the leadership of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). Instead of a classic
"project" design, the SEMP financed specific line items in the government's budget within the
budget ceilings established by DBM. As such, the SEMP design adopted a two-track strategy of
(i) using loan proceeds to provide "cash backing" for purchase of critical social sector inputs,
while using World Bank International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures to increase
transparency and reduce costs; and (ii) promoting core fiduciary and governance reforms. The
approach was championed by reformers in the Department of Budget and Management, who
sought to leverage reforms with support from reform-minded leaders in the sectoral Departments,
and to establish links with civil society organizations to improve accountability for service
delivery.

SEMP1 implementation and rationale for SEMP2. Despite the fundamental challenges, the first
SEMP was largely successful in achieving its objectives, which in turn improved implementation
of other Bank-financed projects in the social sectors. With a relatively short period of project
execution (two and a half years), however, progress in implementing agreed financial
management and procurement reforms was modest. The SEMP2 therefore sought to further
deepen and support implementation of the reform process, ensure continued financing for key
social sector inputs, and extend the project activities to the Department of Health (DOH).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The SEMP2 had the following Development Objectives:

(i) Enhancing performance (efficiency, quality and equity) and governance (transparency and
accountability) in the three social sector Departments - (Education [DepEd], Health [DOH] and
Social Welfare and Development [DSWD], and the school building program implemented by the
Department of Public Works and Highways [DPWH] - with oversight and support of the
Department of Budget and Management [DBM]; and (ii) providing quality inputs to basic social
services.

The Loan agreement included an extensive list of performance indicators, including:

Improvement in the delivery of basic social services:
    · Improve student : textbook ratios (1:2.5 to 1:1 in the four core subjects--math, science,
        English, Filipino) by distributing 50 million new textbooks;
    · Increase the percentage of fully immunized children from 61% (2001) to 67% (2005);
    · Improve TB cure rates from 80% to 85%.

Improvement in management of social expenditures:
    · Percentage savings resulting from improved procurement of textbooks and drugs;
    · Financial Management (FM) improvement, including:
             o spread sheet-based automated accounting systems installed;
             o management reporting established.
    · Procurement Improvement:
             o Procurement units established in three social sector Departments;
             o Procurement processes streamlined;
             o Electronic procurement (E-procurement) implemented.
    · Teacher Deployment:
             o Reduction in the number of "red" zone schools ­ student : teacher ratio (STR>50)
             o Inter-quartile ratios (IQRs) for each division close to 1;



                                                  2

             o Institutionalization of a new teacher deployment system.
    · Drug Regulatory System:
             o Performance standards for the Bureau of Food and Drugs defined and
                 maintained.

Key indicators for improved governance and accountability
    · Develop and implement an independent Public Expenditure Tracking System;
    · Increase in client satisfaction with basic social services according to a Report Card
        Survey;

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

No changes were made to the PDO. The Loan Agreement was amended on October 19, 2004, in
order to reallocate funds, add additional subcomponents, and revise some of the key performance
indicators and/or update baseline data and targets (see summary table in Annex 2). Changes
included:

    · Two additional indicators were added to reflect additional activities implemented by
        DSWD using cost savings from the project: (a) 150,000 individuals served by protective
        services in 2004 and 2005; and (ii) develop and adopt program evaluation and monitoring
        tools for improved management of residential centers and institutions.
    · Baseline data and targets were (a) established for improving student: teacher interquartile
        ratios, and (b) revised/updated for TB smear positive notification rates.
    · The indicator for development of a MIS "flash" reporting system was dropped.
    · Under Component C, two indicators were dropped: (a) increase in client satisfaction with
        basic social services according to a Report Card survey; and (b) develop and implement a
        Public Expenditure Tracking System. A new indicator was added in their place: Develop
        and adopt action plan for increased transparency and accountability in budgetary
        processes in the social sectors.

The addition of the new indicators was clearly justified, as was the updating of targets and
baseline data for TB and IQRs once updated information became available. The decision to drop
the three indicators may have been justified in that it allowed implementing agencies to focus on
a more limited set of priorities, but it partly reflected limited progress with respect to these
specific activities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiaries of the project were users of government-financed social services,
through increasing the availability of key inputs to improve the quality of basic social services, as
well as through improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public social sector agencies.
While the financing was not specifically targeted at the poor, the poor and disadvantaged sections
of the population rely heavily on publicly provided basic social services.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Project activities were grouped into three main components: strengthening key budgetary
programs the social sector departments; systems improvements and reforms; and strengthening
transparency and accountability.


                                                    3

A. Strengthening Key Budgetary Programs

A. 1 Basic Education Services (US$75.1 million at appraisal) covered the provision of key
educational inputs such as textbooks, classrooms, and repairs and maintenance of existing schools.
For textbooks, international competitive bidding procedures in SEMP 1 resulted in significant
savings. These gains were to be consolidated while improving manuscript evaluation procedures,
and assessing textbook availability and utilization. The construction of classrooms using
competitive bidding procedures was to help bridge a large backlog while benchmarking cost and
quality. Responsibility for school repairs and maintenance was to be formally decentralized to the
school level, through financing small grants (up to PHP 10,000) for minor repairs to school
buildings.

A. 2 Public Health Services (US$26.75 million at appraisal) covered the procurement of drugs,
vaccines and supplies for important public health programs--TB control, the Expanded Program
for Immunization (EPI), and the prevention and control of rabies. The declining coverage from a
previously successful immunization program was to be reversed by ensuring the timely and
efficient procurement and distribution of vaccines. A steady supply of TB control drugs would be
assured to the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course) program being implemented
with technical support from WHO. DOTS had also entailed improvements/changes in diagnostic
policies and microscopy services, case-holding strategies, treatment regimen, drug supply and
monitoring. The project financed the purchase of vaccines for the Rabies Action Project in the
Visayas which aimed to declare the Visayas Region a rabies-free zone by 2005.

A. 3 Social Services (US$11 million at appraisal) were to be provided through the
Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS). CIDSS financed barangay-
centered activity in poor municipalities. The poorest barangays were identified using minimum
basic needs indicators. Communities used the same indicators to determine their most urgent
needs, and subsequently planned projects to address these needs (e.g., water supply, sanitation,
day-care centers, skills training, rural roads, and livelihood development projects). The project
financed small grants to communities (up to PHP 10,000) for such initiatives.

B. Systems Improvement and Reform ($1 million appraisal estimate):

This component sought to support: (i) further implementation of the financial management,
procurement and MIS/IT improvement program initiated under SEMP 1 in DepEd and DSWD,
and support for financial management, procurement and MIS/IT improvement in DOH; (ii)
teacher deployment and human resources planning in DepEd; and (iii) strengthening of the
Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD). Due to GOP reluctance to use loan financing for technical
assistance, key inputs in support of this component -- including technical assistance, training, and
associated hardware -- were to be either from the GOP budget and/or from capacity building
grant funds, with technical advice and supervision support from the Bank.

B. 1 FM/Procurement/MIS/IT. The strategy for financial management improvements under
SEMP 2 was to focus on introducing computerized database management systems that would
facilitate the introduction of the new electronic National Government Accounting System
(eNGAS), roll-out of a "flash management" reporting system, and skills upgrading of FM staff.
Procurement improvements would focus on building capacity in the agencies for planning,
streamlining processes, improving payment mechanisms, performing price analysis and
maintaining benchmarks, tracking distribution and implementing e-procurement. The project
sought to support an in-house effort to upgrade the Unified Data Gathering System (UDGS) and


                                                   4

for Personnel Information Systems in DepEd, using standard database software, and providing
necessary training at all levels. The IT improvement program planned to develop IT infrastructure,
upgrade IT knowledge and skills, develop strategic plans for information technology and create a
governance and organizational structure for IT in the departments.

B.2 Teacher Deployment and Human Resources Planning. A study of teacher deployment issues,
carried out during project preparation, provided the basis for this component. It was found that
while the national distribution of teachers was fairly equitable, the regional distribution among
divisions was less so, and that at the local level, the distribution of teachers among the schools
showed major inequalities in most divisions. The following activities were to be implemented
during the project: (i) monitoring teacher deployment; (ii) deploying new teachers under an
improved allocation system so that teachers could be targeted to the most needy schools, and
institutionalizing the system; (iii) identifying and eliminating long-term vacancies; (iv) transfer of
vacant teacher positions from teacher-surplus to teacher-shortage schools and (v) review and
reverse (where appropriate) the designation of teachers to non-teaching roles.

B.3 Strengthening of the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD). On the basis of a diagnostic
assessment of BFAD financed during project preparation, an action plan for the improvement of
BFAD was to be implemented to strengthen BFAD's capacity to meet agreed performance
standards with regard to the rate of issue of product registration certificates, accreditation and
conduct of testing and inspections, and issue of Good Manufacturing Practice certification.

C. Strengthening Transparency and Accountability (US$0.5 million appraisal estimate)

The project aimed to support initiatives to strengthen transparency and accountability in the
various stages of the budget process. These include collaborative efforts with civil society in
analyzing budgets, tracking expenditures and leakages, and obtaining client feedback. At least
one round of implementation of the initiatives were to be implemented, and the tools that
underpinned these initiatives were to be popularized and made available to interested citizen's
groups for continuous national and local application.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised. Following the anticipated phase-out in 2004 of financing for
the CIDSS program, the DSWD requested that additional social protection activities that had been
financed under SEMP1 be financed using cost savings from other components of the project. The
SEMP2 loan agreement was amended on October 19, 2004, to include "Support Services on
Social Protection and Promotion of Rights and Welfare of the Poor and Disadvantaged," under
component (A3). The new components were funded using the unused $1.4 million balance of
the unallocated category and $2.3 million initially allocated for the CIDSS grants under the
Project.4 Two new indicators were added to the results framework to reflect these new activities.




4 Support Services Programs included assistance to: victims of disasters and natural calamities; persons
with disability and senior citizens; protective services for individuals and families in especially difficult
circumstances; protective and rehabilitation services for Center-Based Constituents; social laboratories.


                                                       5

1.7 Other significant changes

There were no significant changes in project design or objectives. The closing date for the
project was extended three times (from December 31, 2005 to June 2006; then to December 31,
2006; and finally to June 30, 2007), primarily to complete the final procurements and delivery of
textbooks, as well as school construction managed by DPWH. Initially, the project was to be
implemented with support from Project Management Units (PMUs) in the sectoral departments,
but these were phased out after the second year of implementation, in order to mainstream
activities and reforms into the line units of sector departments.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Project design was well-grounded both in lessons of earlier operations and in analysis of key
sectoral and reform issues, and developed by field-based staff who had been responsible for
design and implementation of SEMP1. The SEMP concept had been developed by DBM, with
close involvement and support of sector departments. A project preparation grant financed
several key studies in preparation, which in turn served as the basis for implementation of reforms
under the SEMP2.5 Risks were well identified, including fiduciary risks, potential opposition to
reforms from certain vested interests, and weaknesses in fiduciary and implementation capacity.
Appropriate mitigating measures were introduced to address these risks. Ownership of project
objectives was strong among key senior officials in the implementing ministries, and particularly
in the DBM. In addition, project preparation involved civil society organizations seeking to
strengthen accountability for government spending.

2.2 Implementation

Due to continuity in the World Bank and government teams that designed the project, and
advance planning for procurement, the project implementation took off quickly following project
effectiveness. The project benefited from remarkable stability of key counterparts in DBM, who
were strong supporters of the reform agenda and remained in place from the design of SEMP1
through the close of SEMP2. The World Bank's Team Leader changed only once during the
main implementation phase, with a third Team Leader taking over in the final months before
project closure. The key local sector specialists and fiduciary staff in the World Bank country
office remained in place throughout the project.

The pace of implementation slowed by the second year, however, and the project took two years
longer to implement than expected (with three extensions of the closing date, as noted above).



5 The $918,000 PHRD grant financed the following studies: a study on strategic planning for education
materials; teacher deployment and utilization; a textbook quality review; establishing a school registry
tracking system; a review of the Health Sector Reform Agenda; pharmaceuticals regulation; financial
management and information and communication technologies (ICT) strengthening of DOH, master plan
for the Bureau of Food and Drugs, a study on Budget Execution and Accountability Tracking Systems
Integration and data architecture, a review of the CIDSS and management systems for DSWD-managed
centers and institutions. The grant closed on October 31, 2002, all activities having been completed except
the education Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) and procurement support to DOH


                                                      6

The reasons for the delays were several. First, the Bank and government agreed to extend
SEMP1 by a year, and several activities that were expected to be financed through SEMP2 were
instead reimbursed by SEMP1. Second, progress in implementation of core fiduciary reforms
was initially slow and uneven across the three social sector Departments (see below).6 Third,
while school construction undertaken on a delegated basis by DepEd progressed relatively on
schedule, school construction undertaken by the DPWH suffered from repeated delays. Fourth,
cash management restrictions imposed by DBM contributed to delayed release of National Cash
Allotments (NCAs), which delayed implementation of some activities.7

Finally, while DepEd made progress in reducing the time from advertisement to contract
completion, the total time for completing textbook procurement typically exceed one year.
Moreover, losing bidders mobilized to overturn the final round of textbook contract awards
through domestic litigation, submitting procurement complaints to World Bank headquarters, and
orchestrated media campaigns (see discussion below and in Annex 9). A lower court issued a
Restraining Order against the final textbook contract award a month prior to the revised closing
date of December 31, 2006. This Order was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court in
March 2007--which represented a major victory in efforts to defend procurement reforms in
general and the integrity of procurement under World Bank-financed projects specifically--but
necessitated the final project extension to June 30, 2007, which allowed for distribution of the
textbooks.

Despite delays, project development objective and implementation ratings were satisfactory
throughout implementation. The project benefited from twice-yearly supervision missions, which
provided an opportunity to discuss progress in reforms, resolve implementation bottlenecks, and
review progress toward key indicators. While a mid-term review was originally planned for early
2004, the project team and government agreed that a formal MTR was not necessary, given that
the project was subject to regular supervision and was on track for achieving its objectives.
Finally, the project was implemented during a time of periodic political turmoil, as well as unrest
and conflict situations in several areas of the country (including Mindanao), which negatively
affected implementation in those regions.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The results framework for the project was comprehensive, and included a mix of outcome and
intermediate indicators, the majority of which were available through the routine monitoring
systems of the government. An amendment of the Grant Agreement in October 2004 resulted in
revision of some key performance indicators as well as updating of baseline data and targets for
two others (see Section 1.3 above and Annex 2). An additional indicator was inadequately
specified (tetanus toxoid), but not corrected during the amendment (see below). Key performance
indicators were regularly updated in Aide Memoires, and discussed with government during
supervision missions. In addition, the Project supported the strengthening and establishment of



6DSWD was the smallest of the Departments with a history of good management, and progressed rapidly
in implementing procurement, financial management, and ICT reforms. DepEd was the largest Department
in government, and implementation of reforms and project activities slowed by periodic leadership changes,
as well as mid-level staff being preoccupied with day-to-day responsibilities.
7For example, the NCA for the Calendar Year 2003 School Building Program (SBP-CY03) was released in
last quarter of CY, and the contracts had to be put on hold. In addition, delayed transfer by DBM of
DepEd's 10% allocation under SBP delayed implementation of DepEd construction and the principal-led
school building program.


                                                      7

monitoring systems in the social sector ministries, including the establishment of Basic Education
Information System (BEIS). The government did not regularly produce its own annual project
Progress Reports, however, as agreed in the Loan Agreement. In addition, despite progress in
improving monitoring systems, supervision missions noted concerns regarding fragmentation
among different information systems and databases, and uneven use of information for decision-
making at central and local levels.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment and social safeguards. With respect to environmental Safeguards, the Project was
rated as environmental category "C", which meant that no specific environmental safeguards
were required, although DOH was expected to maintain standards with respect to medical waste
Management, and guidelines for asbestos management applied to construction programs.
Compliance was satisfactory overall, but compliance to guidelines on school building
construction by DPWH engineers was only moderately satisfactory. For social safeguards, the
Project social analysis focused on measures to ensure that basic social services are available to
poor and marginalized groups, and to ensure adequate participation by civil society groups in
project implementation and monitoring.

Fiduciary safeguards. Fiduciary risks were judged to be substantial. The Bank sought to address
these through an integrated approach of requiring compliance with World Bank guidelines on
financial management and procurement; regular supervision by Bank procurement and financial
management specialists and consultants; and support for reforms to strengthen fiduciary capacity,
regulations, and systems. The Bank undertook regular fiduciary supervision of the operation, and
provided technical support and guidance in terms of implementing system-strengthening reforms.
Fiduciary compliance was rated satisfactory overall throughout project implementation, although
various issues were identified and addressed in the course of project implementation. These
included initial problems with delayed submission of Financial Management Reports (FMRs),
due to weak FM systems, although timeliness of FMRs submission improved by the third year of
the project. Project disbursement was also slowed by delayed submission of Statements of
Expenditure (SOEs) by participating departments, or problems with incomplete documentation in
SOEs. As the transparency and capacity for procurement improved, the Bank and government
gave increased attention to reducing leakages and wastage in the logistics and distribution of
social sector commodities (including textbooks and vaccines).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The commodity support, activities, and reforms promoted by SEMP2 are being continued and
enhanced by follow-on sectoral National Program Support (NPS) operations, including in
education and health (already under implementation), and social protection (under preparation).
The current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has adopted the NPS model as one of the key
instruments for support to the social sectors. NPS operations focus on core mandates and service
delivery improvements, through financing specific budgetary line items within the overall budget
ceilings of the departments, and provide greater confidence in the use of procurement and
financial management country systems in these new operations. A few specific contracts and
activities initiated under SEMP2 but not completed prior to the closing date (including a final
procurement of Social Studies textbooks) will be financed by these successor operations, or
financed through the government budget (including DPWH school construction). Some of the
cross-cutting reforms supported under SEMP1 and SEMP2, including improving budgetary
execution and transparency and strengthened social accountabilities, are being addressed through



                                                 8

the Bank's governance and public sector management program, including a budget expenditure
review that has been undertaken for DepEd and is planned for DOH. Civil society and social
accountability activities are being carried forward in the NPS projects, as well as through cross-
cutting social accountability activities being led by the Bank's Social Development Network.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the Project objectives is rated as High. The Project objectives were fully aligned
both with the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), as well as the government's
national development strategy, both in terms of a focus on improving availability of key social
services and commodities, as well as improving governance and management in the social sectors.
Project objectives and components continue to be highly relevant to the current CAS (2006-08),
which emphasizes social inclusion, greater decentralization, and transition from project-based to
program-based operations compatible with fiscal constraints, and aligned with core mandates and
service delivery improvements within the budget.

The relevance of project design is rated as Substantial. Project design incorporated lessons from
earlier operations. Rather than avoiding or seeking to bypass fiduciary and governance
weaknesses in the social sector, the Project sought to address these directly. Project design gave
responsibility to the organization's regular/organic staff to ensure institutionalization and
mainstreaming of innovations, reforms, policies/programs, and also balanced "top down"
measures to improve governance (such as implementation of the new procurement law) with
"bottom up" measures to strengthen accountability for service delivery (through involving civil
society organizations in monitoring delivery of social services). Minor design shortcomings
included lack of baseline data for some indicators, and inadequate arrangements for financing
some planned activities (for example, client scorecards). On balance, overall relevance is rated as
High.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall progress in achieving project Development Objectives (efficacy) is rated Substantial.
The majority of key Project indicator targets were achieved or exceeded, although a few key
indicators registered only modest progress compared to original targets. Sub-objectives (i) and (ii)
are both rated Substantial. Outcomes by objective are briefly summarized below, followed by a
more detailed discussion of outputs and outcomes by project component.

(i) Enhance the performance and governance in the three social sector Departments. The
project contributed to substantial progress on core fiduciary and governance reforms in the social
sector ministries, despite the challenges--and strong resistance and opposition--encountered.
These included implementation of reforms and capacity building in procurement and financial
management; strengthening the involvement of civil society organizations in monitoring service
delivery; and establishing new systems and processes for teacher deployment, information
systems and monitoring. Implementations of financial management reforms, and some planned
activities for improving governance and accountability, were not completed (public expenditure
tracking surveys, and mainstreaming client scorecards). Despite these shortcomings, overall
progress is rated substantial.

(ii) Provide quality inputs to basic social services. Substantial. The project reached or exceeded
the majority of output targets with respect to financing critical social sector commodities and
programs (despite cash rationing), and improved quality and reduced costs through competitive
procurement processes. The project contributed to significantly improving the availability of
school textbooks, improving the quality of school construction, assuring availability of vaccines
and TB drugs; and supporting community-driven development activities and social protection
programs through DSWD.

A. Strengthening Key Budgetary Programs

A.1 Basic Education Services (US$50.35 million actual -- US$75.1 million appraisal).
The subcomponent sought to ensure provision of key educational inputs, while reducing costs and
improving efficiency in distribution and allocation of resources. Most of the targets were
achieved or exceeded. Overall rating for this component is therefore judged as Satisfactory.

Textbook procurement and distribution: Despite the controversies and negative media coverage
surrounding textbook procurement under the project (see Annex 9), this component was very
successful. Prior to 1998, DepEd was responsible for the development and production of
textbooks and teachers manuals. Complaints from the private book industry led Congress to pass
new legislation mandating that textbook development, printing, and distribution should be
subcontracted to the private sector. The pre-SEMP contracts were awarded with limited
transparency and competition, however, leading to escalating prices, problems with textbook
quality (both text and quality of stock) and distribution.8

     · Improved availability of books. 56.97 million textbooks were procured under SEMP2,
        exceeding the original target of 50 million. These textbooks, combined with those funded
        under the Bank-financed Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP), contributed to
        significant improvements in the textbook-student ratio, from 1:2.5 prior to the project to
        almost 1:1 for the core elementary subjects (Math, Science, English, and Filipino) by the
        end of project. Textbook-student ratios at the high school level did not fully reach the
        target, but still improved significantly (to 1: 1.3 on average). While the project
        performance indicator was stated in terms of textbook ratios at the school level, actual
        availability at school level is more variable.
     · Cost savings. ICB for textbooks (which was initially introduced under SEMP1 and
        continued under SEMP2) resulted in 46% decline in prices for textbooks (from an
        average of Php90 to 100 per elementary textbook pre-SEMP 1 to an average of Php40 per
        textbook), despite increased quality standards for paper thickness and bindings. This
        resulted in estimated savings of US$35.8 million in textbook procurement during SEMP2,
        compared to prices prevailing prior to SEMP1 (1998-2000). This direct savings estimate
        is conservative, since it does not account for inflation or for the likely increased lifespan
        of textbooks due to increased page and cover thickness. Overall, the introduction of
        international competitive bidding for textbook procurement (including textbooks financed
        by SEMP1, SEMP2, and TEEP) generated approximately US$125 million in cost savings
        for the GOP over a seven-year period; adjusting for inflation yields an estimated $153
        million in total savings (2006 prices).
     · Revised Textbook Policy and quality improvements: One weakness identified during
        SEMP1 was inadequate quality of textbooks: the problem predated SEMP1, but the

           introduction of ICB alone did not solve the problem. Dialogue during supervision
           missions and a background study commissioned during project preparation formed the
           basis for a new textbook policy, which was issued by DepEd in July 2004. Among other
           measures, the new policy introduced a four-stage quality review process, and increased
           quality standards for textbook production and content. This contributed to improved
           physical quality of textbook (in terms of thickness of paper, binding, printing), and
           ensuring increased textbook life.9 DepEd sought to improve content of textbooks through
           a rigorous and stringent evaluation process, including contracting more than a hundred
           independent evaluators to review the accuracy and content of textbooks. The quality
           review process continues to undergo refinements based on experience, including
           introducing pre-bid evaluations for publishers to improve manuscripts prior to the formal
           bidding and evaluation process. Errors and inconsistencies have been reduced, but not
           eliminated. Recently, DepEd introduced further revisions to further streamline and
           strengthen the content evaluation and overall quality review process.

     · Improved transparency in distribution. The project supported and mainstreamed a
           nationwide partnership between DepEd and a consortium of more than 36 Civil Society
           Organizations (CSOs) to ensure quality production and timely delivery of textbooks to all
           public schools. This was piloted in one province under SEMP1, but is now a national
           program formalized through a memorandum of understanding between DepEd and CSOs,
           and has been cited as "best practice" in an OECD procurement publication.10 The
           Textbook Count led by Government Watch (G-Watch) has contributed to significant
           improvements in textbook distribution and delivery; improved feedback mechanisms,
           which led to speedier identification and resolution of issues; and greater coordination
           between and among stakeholders for improving service delivery and mobilizing
           partnerships and resources.

     · Textbook exchange. The National Textbook Exchange Program was introduced during
           implementation to address disparities in the availability of textbooks in schools due to
           multiple titles, owing to procurement of textbooks from different sources prior to SEMP
           2 and an inefficient distribution and allocation system. A total of 597,851 elementary
           textbooks and 133,037 high school textbooks were exchanged among schools/divisions
           with excess textbooks and those with shortages in 2004/2005, benefiting 38% of the total
           divisions in the country.

Classroom construction and rehabilitation: SEMP2 financed school construction at the central
level through the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), and expanded the




9It is still too early to assess the actual increase in textbook life from these improvements, but the increase
should be at least 15% in the average shelf life of textbooks.
10"In the 1990s corruption was rampant in the Department of Education in the Philippines. The Department
was unable to deliver the most basic services to its 18 million public school students. Unqualified bidders
were over-pricing their school text books and corrupt officials were awarding them contracts to deliver
books which seldom arrived at schools. In 2001 a new government decided to fight corruption and reform
the way text books were ordered and delivered. The `Textbook Count 1-2-3' project made sure that every
text book was accounted for and delivered. NGOs, parents, Boy Scouts and Girl Guides were all involved,
including the Coca Cola company who agreed to deliver text books for free in their trunks when delivering
soft drinks to remote areas." Development Assistance Committee, Organization for Economic
Development and Cooperation (OECD/DAC), "Why is Procurement Important?" Factsheet, December

"principal-led approach" to school construction piloted under the WB-financed Third Elementary
Education Project. For the latter, an MOU was developed between DPWH and DepEd, in which
10 percent of the school construction and maintenance budget allocated to DPWH was delegated
to DepEd for "principal-led" school construction and rehabilitation. This budget line was entirely
financed by SEMP2. The Project demonstrated that increased involvement of principals and
parent associations in school construction decreased costs and significantly improved quality. In
addition, the DepEd made use of the Basic Education Information System (BEIS) to better
prioritize decisions regarding new classroom construction, which had previously been heavily
influenced by political considerations.

    · Principal-led school construction and rehabilitation. Despite the DepEd managing only
         10% of the Regular School Building Program (SBP) Budget of the Government, it was
         able to build 841 new classrooms and repair and/or rehabilitate 1,820 classrooms in 856
         schools, which represents a substantial portion of the total original target of 1,750
         classrooms constructed. Many of the classrooms rehabilitated by DepEd had been
         severely damaged by fire, typhoon or flood, and had been unusable. The Project
         supported the development of streamlined operational manuals, and principals received
         training in bidding and construction supervision. Independent NGO evaluations11 and an
         independent consultant evaluation commissioned for the ICR (see Annex 8) concluded
         that schools constructed through this program resulted in better quality, lower cost (by 4
         percent on average) compared to schools constructed by DPWH, largely due to greater
         involvement of school staff and parent associations in the bidding and construction
         monitoring process. In addition, the success of the principal-led school building had
         several positive "spin-offs." First, it enhanced school-based management, which now
         underpins the Basic Education Reform Agenda of the Government. Second, it boosted the
         self-confidence of school heads and enhanced their status in the community; and because
         the construction or repair was usually well done, it helped the school head mobilize
         additional resources from the LGU and the community. Third, the successes in terms of
         physical quality, cost and resource mobilization through the principal-led approach led
         Government to allocate more budgetary resources for the DepEd-managed school
         building/classroom construction in 2006 (Php1.1 billion) and 2007 (Php1.539 billion),
         compared to previous years when DepEd received only 10% of the total Regular School
         Building budget.

    · DPWH construction. While the School Building Program (SBP) had historically been the
         responsibility of DPWH, it had been beset by serious problems in non-transparent
         procurement, poor supervision and quality control, political influences in school selection
         and bidding, and limited involvement of schools and communities. The Bank agreed to
         finance the central SBP under two conditions: (i) adoption of World Bank-approved
         procurement practices for National Competitive Bidding (NCB), and changes in the
         previous procurement practices of DPWH for school buildings (including wide
         advertising, no pre-qualification of contractors, no fixed prices per classroom); (ii)



11Government Watch (G-Watch), Ateneo School of Government, "Main Report of the BAYANIHANG
ESKWELA: The Citizens' Monitoring of DPWH-Implemented School Building Projects, April 2007. In
2003, a "Consolidated Report on the Joint DepEd/DPWH/WB/G-Watch Monitoring of School Building
Projects" was undertaken in the context of a World Bank supervision mission, which compared the quality
and cost of construction among a sample of DPWH, principal-led, and NGO-finance school building
projects. In this survey, all 12 of the SEMP-financed school building projects were judged satisfactory, but
half of the 24 DPWH-constructed classrooms were found to be either incomplete or of poor quality.


                                                    12

        DPWH was to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with civil society organizations for
        the local monitoring of the bidding and construction process. The MOU was signed in
        2004, and the NGO involvement has subsequently received support from USAID and
        other donors. NGOs annually visit a sample of schools being constructed by DPWH.
        Initial reports found serious problems with quality in at least half the schools; while
        problems still persist, the involvement of NGOs and schools has improved oversight and
        quality. Execution of SBP financed by SEMP2 was repeatedly beset by delays, however,
        due initially to a lack of compliance by DPWH district offices to agreed procurement
        guidelines. This led to all these contracts being rebid at central level, but contractor
        performance was uneven at best, since most winning contractors were based in the Luzon
        region. As of project closing in June 2007, 481 classrooms had been completed and were
        reimbursed by the project. The average cost per classroom was Php550,000, which was
        comparable to the DepEd's classroom cost.

    · Repairs and maintenance of existing schools. To address persistent problems of
        inadequate school maintenance, SEMP1 piloted a new system for providing grants of up
        to 10,000 Php to school principals for repair and maintenance of schools. This program
        was scaled up nationally under SEMP2. A total of 41,561 school repair and maintenance
        grants were provided, exceeding the target of 40,000 grants during the project life. Field
        supervision conducted during the project found that about 90% of the work was
        consistent with the guidelines. An independent evaluation commissioned for the ICR
        found that preventive maintenance and minor repairs supported by the grant were well
        executed, and are likely to extend the effective life of existing school buildings (see
        Annex 8). The amounts of the grants were relatively small, but helped school principals
        to mobilize additional funds from communities. Implementation was negatively affected
        initially, however, by overly complex procedures for the grants and inadequate
        understanding by principals and DepEd regional offices regarding eligibility criteria and
        the documentation required by the project for reimbursement.12 Due to slow initial
        implementation, DBM also subsequently reduced the Project funds allocated for this
        component. As such, over 100,000 grants were in fact rewarded, but only 40% were
        ultimately submitted for reimbursement by the Project (the grants not eligible for
        reimbursement by the Project were financed by the national budget).

While increased school enrollment and test performance were not included as formal project
outcome indicators, these improved during the initial years of project implementation, possibly
due to increased teacher and textbook availability. Total school enrollment continued to increase
in the 2005/6 school year, but the net enrollment ratio declined slightly due to population growth.
Test scores also declined in 2005/6, although the reasons for the decline are still being analyzed
by DepEd. These trends underline the need for continued focus on progress toward education
sector outcome indicators.




12 The Operational Guidelines developed for the Program specified that signed a Implementing Agreement
(IA) was required between school principal and Division Superintendent in order to be eligible for
reimbursement by SEMP2, but IAs were lacking for many schools. Many principals and regional
education officials did not participate in the initial orientation workshops for this program (in contrast to
the much higher coverage of training for the principal-led school construction program). Many SOEs were
submitted with improper documentation, and the finance unit of DepEd did not provide adequate
monitoring oversight in the first two years. The percentage of SOEs eligible for reimbursement improved
somewhat to over 60% by 2006, however.

A.2 Public Health Services (US$37.5 million actual, US$26.75 million appraisal estimate)

The sharp decline in vaccination coverage prior to the Project had been precipitated not only by
the financial crisis, but also by a 1998 decision by DOH leadership to undertake procurement of
vaccines and essential public health drugs (such as for TB control) through local suppliers, rather
than through UN agencies. Due to procurement difficulties, none of these commodities were
delivered from 1999 to 2001. Project financing supported the reintroduction of procurement
through UN agencies for these essential commodities, and the Loan backing ensured timely
payment for these supplies, which were necessary -- but not sufficient -- conditions for improving
key coverage indicators. The DOH and UN agencies took a lead role in seeking to improve
implementation of these programs at national and local levels. Delays in signing supply contracts
with UN agencies and in payment releases delayed delivery of some commodities. In addition,
late delivery of vaccines procured through the DOH system prior to the project, together with the
donation of additional vaccines prior to the measles campaign, contributed to an oversupply of
vaccines in 2003/4. This combined with inadequate warehouse management resulted in spoilage
of some vaccines in 2005 (see below). Commodity supplies remained adequate throughout
implementation, however, and did not negatively affect availability or coverage. Overall rating
for this component is satisfactory.

Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI):

The Project financed the purchase of US$24.2 million worth of EPI vaccines and tetanus toxoid
through UNICEF. It also facilitated the development and adoption by the DOH of a multi-year
plan for vaccine procurement under the EPI Program.

· Child vaccination: The Project helped stabilized the supply of EPI vaccines, and with
    technical support UNICEF and WHO, DOH made significant progress in its campaign to
    immunize all children with the DPT, polio and measles vaccines. The percentage of children
    fully vaccinated (FIC rate) increased from 61% in 2003 to 83% in 2006, significantly
    surpassing the original target of 67%. The campaign to eradicate measles ­ which included
    the regular health center vaccination as well as a nationwide measles vaccination campaign in
    2003, and for which the project ensured an adequate vaccine supply -- led to the drop of
    measles cases in 2006 to 173 cases, which is a 97% decrease from the 2003 baseline.13 The
    project also contributed to the country's successful maintenance of polio-free certification.

· Tetanus toxoid. The loan agreement used an indicator "the number of children protected at
    birth (from tetanus neonatorum) by tetanus toxoid vaccine," but the baseline figure and
    targets were mistakenly specified in terms of children infected with tetanus at birth (baseline
    figure of 0.2 per thousand live births in 2003). By 2006, there were no reported cases of
    tetanus neonatorum for the year, although this was largely because DOH no longer
    systematically tracked this indicator, since most neonatal tetanus cases result from at-home
    deliveries. With respect to the appropriate indicator; the percentage of children protected at
    birth with tetanus toxoid (defined as newborns whose mothers had 2 doses of TT during
    pregnancy child or had 3 doses prior to delivery) increased modestly from 54% in 2002 to
    59% in 2006. The relatively low coverage reflects continued issues with regard to quality




13Accord to data from the routine information system (FHSIS), measles vaccination coverage increased
from 76% in 2002 to 83% in 2004 (with coverage sustained at 83% in 2006). Given the typical three-year
cycle for measles epidemics, DOH undertook a month-long measles vaccination campaign in October 2007.

     and attendance of antenatal services, as well as preference by some women (particularly those
     planning facility deliveries) not to receive the vaccination.

TB control: The Project financed procurement of US$9.4 million worth of TB drugs (through
WHO/IAPSO and WHO/GTZ drug facilities) for 148,183 persons, against an original target of
200,000. TB drug procurement had been decentralized to regional DOH offices, which had led to
a two-three fold increase in prices and unreliable supplies. The DOH re-centralized procurement,
and with the shift in TB Regimen to single dose combination, project-financed procurement was
done through WHO-IAPSO, which resulted in significant savings. The number of Public-Private
Mix DOTS clinics increased more slowly than expected, which contributed to a shortfall in the
number of TB cases identified and treated relative to projections. The TB cure rate increased
steadily from 73 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2006, compared to an original target of 85
percent. The actual cure rate may have been higher, as a portion of TB patients who completed
treatment and may have been cured were not confirmed microscopically for the absence of TB.
The TB smear-positive notification rate increased from 53% to 75% in 2006, against the original
target of 80 %.14 The Bank team worked closely with WHO specialists during supervision and
program reviews. Supervision missions noted that regions with high TB cure rates tended to also
have high case identification rates and smear-positive notification rates, suggesting continued
variations by region in the quality of program implementation.

Prevention and control of rabies: Rabies was endemic to the Visayas region of the Philippines.
The project financed purchase of 1.6 million USD worth of rabies immunoglobulins and rabies
vaccines for people who were bitten by potential rabid animals, particularly dogs. Minimal rabies
vaccines for animals were also procured. The incidence of rabies declined from 6 per million in
January 2003 to 1.8 cases per million in 2006 against an original target of 1.0 case per million.
While the original goal was to eliminate rabies in Visayas region, the DOH concluded in 2004
that this goal was unrealistic (due to poor logistics, low LGU support and inadequate advocacy),
and instead focused its resources on eliminating rabies in Bicol Peninsula and Davao city, where
the incidence was high. As of 2006, however, the incidence remains relatively high in both
regions. There were 22 reported human rabies cases in Bicol translating into an incidence rate of
4.5 per million, and 10 human rabies cases in region 11 (the Davao region) translating into an
incidence rate of 2.3 cases per million. One cause for the failure to attain the national and regional
objective has been the persistent low coverage of rabies vaccination of dogs (which falls under
the responsibility of local governments and the Department of Agriculture, whereas DOH is
responsible only for human vaccination). In 2006, it was reported that only 10% of dogs were
vaccinated for rabies versus the ideal coverage of 75%.

A.3 Social Services (US$11.1 million actual; US$11 million appraisal estimate)

This component met or exceeded all its targets. Performance is rated as satisfactory.




14 In the loan agreement, the targets were originally 95% for December 31, 2003 and 100% by the closing
date, but these numbers were corrected as these numbers were targets for TB success rate (the number of
cured TB cases plus cases who have completed DOTS) and not for TB smear-positive notification rate.
Nonetheless, the corrected target was also not reached and was attributed by the TB program staff to the
less than expected growth of the PPMD clinics.

Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS).

Under this component, the Project supported the implementation of the Comprehensive and
Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS) program of the DSWD until December 2004. By
the end of 2004, CIDSS reached 3,850 barangays (villages) in 1,475 municipalities/ cities of 78
provinces. Evaluation studies by academic and research institutions on the CIDSS program
highlighted its effectiveness in empowering communities and LGUs to address poverty
alleviation.15 Specifically, the Program built the capacities of organized community-based
organizations to identify, implement and maintain sub-projects that respond to the most pressing
minimum basic needs of the communities and enhanced LGU capacities to support various
community projects (see Annex 7). CIDSS implementation was fully devolved in December
2004 to participating LGUs, with DSWD's role refocused on the provision of technical assistance.
The program also served as the basis for the design of the KALAHI/CIDSS project of the DSWD,
which is supported by a separate World Bank loan.

Support Services on Social Protection and Promotion of Rights and Welfare of the Poor and
Disadvantaged

In parallel with the phase-out of CIDSS financing, the project incorporated several other DSWD
programs that had been financed under SEMP1. The Protective Services were designed to
respond to special needs of children, women and families to safeguard them from physical harm,
violence, abuse and exploitation. From CY 2004-2006, the various community-based services
reached about 360,988 clients (see Annex 2). These community-based protective services16
provided the DSWD with an alternative strategy to center-based services. DSWD's Protective
services also provided relief and rehabilitation assistance to victims of disasters and calamities in
coordination with the LGUs. From CY2004-06, around $3.085M was disbursed for relief
assistance and $0.298M for Emergency Shelter Assistance which involved the repair of 3,169
units of damaged houses.

Based on the recommendations of a report prepared during SEMP1 (the "Hoffman Report"), the
DSWD prepared a Divestment Program for its Centers and Institutions. As a result of this
Program, the number of DSWD-managed facilities has been reduced from 78 to 65. The
divestment of facilities involved the adoption of innovative arrangements for center management,
including enhancement of partnership with NGOs; and resource sharing with local government
units (LGUs). The "Hoffman Report" also provided the basis for the development of the Program
Supervision Model, which has been adopted by DSWD for its center-based and community-based
programs, as well as in providing technical assistance to NGOs. DSWD also adopted a de-
institutionalization policy which involved implementation of community-based services and other
alternative placement approaches.

B. Systems Improvement and Reform

Total financing needs for this component were estimated at $1 million during appraisal, which
were to be financed through the GOP counterpart contribution, since (as noted above) the GOP

was reluctant to borrow for technical assistance. The Bank provided technical advice and support
through supervision missions and local fiduciary staff on these issues, and also mobilized grant
funds through a project preparation grant and capacity building grants (including Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grants for procurement and financial management). While the various
participating departments incurred budgetary expenditures in support of these systems
improvements and reforms, they were not separately tracked by the project reporting systems, so
no disaggregated data on the GOP counterpart contribution to this component were available.

Overall performance for this component is judged to be moderately satisfactory, reflecting
satisfactory progress in implementing procurement reforms and improved logistics, moderately
satisfactory progress in financial management, moderately satisfactory overall progress in ICT,
and moderately satisfactory progress in BFAD reforms and improved teacher deployment.

B.1 FM/Procurement/MIS/IT.

Financial Management: Prior to the project, financial management in three social sector
departments was entirely manual: accounts were rarely fully reconciled, there was no
computerized accounting for system, and qualified audit opinions were the norm. Progress has
been significant relative to this weak starting point, but needs further consolidation, particularly
in DepEd and DOH.
    · eNGAS. The Project supported the introduction and implementation [in the three
        Departments of eNGAS], a financial management software developed by the
        Commission on Audit (COA). As of the project close, eNGAS was fully operational in
        DSWD and DOH central offices, and partially implemented in DepEd. It is also being
        rolled out to DOH and DSWD field offices, and to DOH retained hospitals. The
        accounting division at the DepEd central office began using eNGAS in 2004, but the
        system is still not fully operational because of slow progress in encoding transactions and
        reconciling balances from earlier years. It is fully operational in only two small bureaus
        at the Central Office, and in one of 16 DepEd regions. DepEd is the largest Department
        in government, but several factors have hindered progress, including: (i) insufficient
        allocation of funds to support staff salaries and for IT procurement; (ii) the absence of a
        strong champion at DepEd for eNGAS implementation, due to frequent changes in the
        head of the agency and of the undersecretary for finance and administration. Progress of
        eNGAS implementation is to be followed up under NPSBE, and also under the NSSHRP
        for health.
    · Strengthening overall financial management. To strengthen the effectiveness and profile
        of financial management, DSWD and DOH elevated the financial management units to
        be headed by Assistant Secretaries. DSWD has made the most progress in shifting
        financial management from a book-keeping to a strategic management function. DOH
        recruited its first "non-doctor" manager -- a senior executive from a government financial
        institution -- to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Finance. At the time of the ICR
        mission, however, performance of the DOH Finance Service has yet to reach a level
        where strategic financial management is in place and functioning. DepEd has made the
        least progress in elevating the role and function of their finance unit, and staff continue to
        focus mostly on transaction processing.
    · Management reporting. Production of quarterly Financial Management Reports (FMRs)
        improved during the project, but only modest progress was made in strengthening
        internal management reporting in the three departments. Initial templates were developed
        for "flash reports" and piloted in DOH. But with incomplete roll-out of eNGAS in the
        three Departments, completing Flash Reports proved tedious and have not been fully
        implemented (as noted above, this performance indicator was dropped in 2004).

Procurement reform:
     · Passage and implementation of procurement reform law. The increased transparency and
          savings generated by international competitive bidding (ICB) under SEMP1 provided
          evidence that contributed to the adoption in 2004 by GOP of a comprehensive national
          Procurement Reform Law (RA 9184). SEMP2 supported implementation in the social
          sector Departments of the various mandates under the new procurement law, including
          the establishment of procurement units, Bids and Awards Committees (BACs), the
          development and adoption of procurement manuals, and involvement of civil society
          organizations in procurement monitoring. As such, the social sectors--with support from
          DBM--were in the vanguard of procurement reforms nationally, even though these
          reforms have encountered resistance internally and externally. Reform implementation
          progressed the most rapidly in DSWD and DOH (even though the latter did not benefit
          from technical support in procurement during project preparation), due largely to
          "champions" for reforms in these departments.17 DepEd continued to obtain savings
          from ICB and NCB procurement using project financing, but procurement reforms
          proceeded more slowly, in part due to frequent leadership changes, although the key
          reforms were eventually implemented.
     · Electronic Procurement. The GOP initiated development of a national electronic
          procurement system (eprocurement) in the year 2000, which was institutionalized
          through the 2003 procurement reform law. Project supervision missions provided advice
          and support for implementation. DOH and DSWD have made the most progress in
          electronic procurement. Beginning in 2004, DOH and DSWD began posting drug prices,
          procurement notices and awards, and misprocurements on their websites.18 These
          experiences have facilitated to the development of a new national electronic procurement
          system which is currently being rolled out nationally.19
     · Civil society procurement monitoring. The SEMP2 facilitated involvement of CSOs in
          monitoring the procurement process in social sectors, including participating as observers
          in Bids and Awards Committee meetings at central level in both DOH and DepEd.



17In its comments on the draft ICR, DSWD noted various activities undertaken by the Department in
support of procurement reform. These include trainings for procurement personnel on the Government
Procurement Reform Act (GPRA); the hiring of a National Procurement Specialist (NPS), who developed a
national procurement manual for KALAHI-CIDSS and a Procurement Improvement Plan (PIP) for DSWD;
procurement trainings for DSWD Field Offices in 2006; development in 2005 of a Project Procurement
Management Plan (PPMP) in compliance with the planning and budgeting linkage provision of RA 9184;
and designation of supply Officers from every office/unit to ensure compliance in the preparation of Project
Procurement Management Plan (PPMP) and for requests for procurement of goods and services.
18 DSWD also actively participated in the development of e-procurement by consistently posting Invitation
to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB), Request for Quotations (RFQs), Requests for Expression of
Interest (REI), not only at the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) but also
at the DSWD website. This practice has promoted transparency and wider dissemination of procurement
information and opportunities (since 2004). Further, the Department developed in 2007 the Electronic
Procurement Transaction Monitoring System (EPTMS), a multi-stakeholder web-based monitoring system
of procurement transactions to increase transparency and as an enhancement in the government e-
procurement process
19The Philippines Government Electronic Procurement System (PhilGEPS) will initially provide
information to bidders and the public on all central public procurement, but is being rapidly rolled out to
local governments, and is expected to contribute significantly to improved competition and transparency in
public procurement. PhilGEPS has received technical support from various donors and from an IDF grant.
Online bidding is planned for the next phase. See website: www.philgeps.net

         During project preparation, DOH cooperated with G-Watch to review medicine
         procurement, including TB drugs, which revealed high prices and regional discrepancies.
         This contributed to the decision to return to central procurement of TB drugs, and the
         posting of essential drug prices on the DOH web site. Involving CSOs in provincial and
         LGU bids and awards committees has proven more difficult, due to resistance by some
         LGUs and limited procurement expertise among local CSOs.

Improved logistics. As procurement practices improved, attention increasingly turned to
improving logistics and distribution systems for textbooks and vaccines. DepEd adopted a series
of measures to improve efficiency and transparency of textbook distribution, including
involvement of civil society monitors down to school level (see below), as well as partnering with
private sector companies (such as Coca Cola) to assist in distribution to remote areas. In DOH,
Bank supervision missions in 2004 and 2005 identified significant weaknesses in the storage and
distribution system for vaccines. These reports and an ensuing government investigation led to
personnel changes and to the adoption by DOH of a logistics strengthening program, which has
significantly improved vaccine warehousing and distribution and reduced spoilage.20 An
inspection of the central and a regional office warehousing facilities found that most of the agreed
changes had been implemented.

Management information systems (MIS) and information technologies (IT). Several key
improvements were implemented, including establishment of management information systems
(MIS) units and adoption of IT strategies in DOH and DSWD; establishment of Local Area
Networks (LAN) and initiation of Wide Area Networks (WAN); adoption of the Information and
Communication Technology Service Management (ICTSM) framework in DSWD for service and
technical support; and upgrading of skills and equipment in all SEMP2 departments. A team of
DepEd staff developed a Basic Education Information System (BEIS), which has become a key
tool for planning, budget preparation, policy formulation, resource allocation and performance
monitoring. Overall progress has been modest with respect to the more fundamental objective of
using IT tools to improve operational efficiency and use information for decision making in the
three departments. Fragmentation among multiple project-based information systems continues to
be a problem. Integration of systems for budgeting, procurement, financial management, and
supplier payment would contribute to further efficiency gains and help consolidate the reforms in
each of these areas (e.g., ensuring procurement plans are linked to budgets, and that no payments
are made for contracts unless they were processed according to procurement regulations).

B.2 Teacher Deployment and Human Resources Planning.

On the basis of the background study financed during project preparation, DepEd adopted a new
teacher deployment policy. A system to improve teacher distribution was implemented, including
using the Basic Education Information System (BEIS) to color-code schools according to their
staffing situation, and prioritizing new teacher allocations and transfer of vacant positions to
shortage schools. In the 2006 deployment, 100 percent of the 7,237 new teaching posts were
allocated to "red" or "black" zone schools. Progress was achieved in reducing interquartile ratios
(IQRs21), but fell short of targets ­ with gains coming mostly from improved teacher distribution



20 Weaknesses in the storage and logistics for vaccines were first identified in Aide Memoires in 2004, but
it was the uncovering of spoilage of some 20,000 vials of vaccines in 2005 that led a government
investigation, significant media government, and subsequent changes in management of logistics in DOH.
21 The IQR is the ratio between the student-teacher ratio in worst-off 25% of schools, compared to the best-
off 25%.


                                                     19

within local "departments." There were several reasons. First, new posts only represented less
than 2 percent of public sector teachers. DepEd also sought to use the system to reallocate vacant
teaching posts to underserved schools. This was successful among elementary schools within
local departments, but efforts to reallocate vacancies from secondary schools or among
departments encountered stiff resistance from local stakeholders. Second, areas with teacher
shortages experienced population growth (due to in-migration) at more than double the national
average. As such, inequities might have increased (rather than decreasing slightly) had the new
deployment system not been implemented.

B.3 Strengthening of the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD).

The project preparation grant supported the development of a BFAD "Masterplan" to strengthen
its capacity to regulation the pharmaceutical sector and improve internal systems and processes,
which was adopted by BFAD. Its management implemented a number of measures in the first
years of the implementation, including hiring additional personnel to reduce the processing time
of pending drug registration, completion of the Cebu and Davao satellite laboratories, and
initiated computerization of its registration databases with support from a government e-
technology fund. Implementation of other measures was constrained, however, by government's
restrictions on BFAD revenue retention, a shortage of personnel relative to mandates, and a
limited GOP budget allocation.22 Other actions needed to strengthen BFAD are either pending or
still need enactment, including the quantification of performance standards, the roll-out of the
much-awaited automation of several key functions particularly drug registration, the full
implementation of the new staffing based on a product-based approach, and sustained income
retention. Over-all progress in improving BFAD performance relative to the initial objectives was
therefore modest, and many planned activities have been "rolled" into the successor NSSHRP
project.

C. Strengthening Transparency and Accountability

The project contributed to substantial progress in improving the transparency and efficiency in
the procurement and distribution of social sector commodities (textbooks, school construction,
vaccines and pharmaceuticals), through involvement of CSOs in the procurement and distribution
process. Progress was modest in improving CSO involvement in the budgetary process, however,
as well as in mainstreaming accountability tools such as citizen score cards. The cost of this
component was estimated at US$0.5 million at appraisal, to be financed through GOP counterpart
contributions and preparation grants. As in component B, the GOP did not separately track
counterpart contributions for this component. Overall performance is judged moderately
satisfactory¸ reflecting highly satisfactory experience in civil society involvement in textbook
distribution and school construction, satisfactory progress in involving CSOs in procurement
monitoring, and modest progress on improving budget transparency, expenditure tracking
systems, and client scorecards.

     · On the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) developed during the project,
         CSOs regularly participate as observers in the procurement process at central DepEd,




22BFAD was allowed to retain income based on provisions inserted in the 2005 General Appropriations
Act. However, it was only allowed to retain the 2005 income and the provision was subsequently vetoed in
the 2007 GAA.


                                                   20

        DOH, and DSWD, which has increased transparency.23 Strengthening CSO involvement
        in procurement monitoring at the regional and LGU level is the next challenge.
    · The project was highly successful in improving the transparency and efficiency of
        textbook distribution through involving CSOs in the monitoring of procurement and
        distribution of textbooks. The Textbook Count and Textbook Walk sponsored by DepEd
        in partnership with Government Watch ­ in which over three dozen CSOs were involved
        in monitoring textbook distribution down to individual school level -- has been cited by
        OECD as an international "best practice" in improving transparency of government
        procurement and logistics.
    · Both DepEd and DPWH have signed MOUs for civil society monitoring of the school
        building program. The first Joint Monitoring of School building in 2003 - involving the
        Government Watch, with DepEd, DPWH, and World Bank - revealed high quality of
        SEMP and TEEP-financed school buildings, but highlighted weaknesses in the DPWH
        school building program. On the basis of these findings, DPWH agreed to allow greater
        role for school principals and parent-teacher-community associations in monitoring
        construction and contractor performance. Subsequent Joint Monitoring missions (now
        financed by USAID) have found improved performance by DPWH-financed school
        construction, particularly when local stakeholders were involved in on-site monitoring.24
    · Annual Brigada Eskwela initiative of DepEd (from 2004) mobilized active participation
        and involvement of parents, communities, local government units, private sector, civil
        society groups during school maintenance week; generated significant resources in terms
        of imputed labor cost and materials (paint, supplies and materials, etc); resulted in
        significant cost-savings for schools; led to substantial physical improvements in school
        facilities/environs in many schools; and initiated good practices of actively involving
        stakeholders, especially of parent-teacher-community associations (PTCA) in school and
        student improvement, which was subsequently continued and institutionalized in many
        areas.
    · A first round of Client Scorecards was implemented in 2002, which continues to be
        widely cited,25 but no follow up round has been undertaken. The indicator was dropped
        during the October 2004 amendment to the Loan Agreement. DBM would prefer that
        these surveys be financed independently from government, but an appropriate financing
        mechanism still needs to be developed.
    · Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS). A PETS survey for education was
        budgeted in the project preparation grant, but not completed prior to project effectiveness.
        Due to a combination of funding constraints and focus on other priorities, this indicator
        was subsequently dropped. Various approaches for improved tracking of public
        expenditures are being pursued in the sectoral programs and through the Bank's
        governance dialogue.
    · Budget monitoring ­ DBM has begun posting budgetary and budget execution
        information on its web site, and prepared a brief action plan for improving budget
        monitoring and civil society involvement. Progress on the latter has been limited, due to



23National-level Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) that have regularly participated in procurement
monitoring include the Transparency Accountability Network (TAN), NORFIL, and Procurement Watch.
Fewer local CSOs have experience in procurement monitoring, which has constrained CSO involvement in
procurement monitoring at LGU level.

experiences that have been developed, and made recommendations for further mainstreaming.

         DBM's focus on other priorities and limited capacity among CSOs to engage in budget
         monitoring.

3.3 Efficiency

The Project's overall efficiency is rated as substantial. This is based on (i) substantial direct cost
savings generated by the project, particularly for textbooks; (ii) substantial improvements in cost-
effectiveness of social sector inputs and processes, such as for school construction; (iii)
substantial cost-effectiveness of health sector interventions, particularly for vaccination; (iv)
substantial "spin-offs" and externalities from reforms introduced by the project on overall
government social sector expenditures, including implementation of procurement reforms,
logistics improvements, increased civil society involvement in procurement monitoring and
service delivery (see Annex 3).

While the economic returns from improving access to education and improved health care are
known to be high, as a multifaceted social sector project, it is not possible to calculate an overall
Economic Rate of Return or Net Present Value. Strictly on the basis of cost savings, however,
SEMP2 contributed direct savings to the government equal to $35.8 million for textbooks alone,
relative to prevailing prices of government textbook procurement in 1998-99, prior to the SEMP
projects. Moreover, international competitive bidding by SEMP1, SEMP2, and TEEP generated
approximately US$125 million in cost savings over 1999-2006 million. Adjusting for inflation
(2006 prices) increases the estimated savings textbook procurement to $153 million (see Annex
3). Direct cost savings for the principal-led school construction program were more modest
($131,000 savings relative to construction costs by DPWH, and $350,000 savings relative to the
originally budget costs for classroom construction). The direct cost savings estimates do not
include, however, significant indirect savings due to improved quality for textbook and school
construction, or the substantial savings and efficiencies in the logistics and distribution systems
for textbooks and vaccines, which are difficult to estimate quantitatively.

While vaccination is an eminently cost-effective intervention, the project contributed to DALY
reductions at costs below international standards. Available data suggest that the cost per
incremental Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted ranged from US$30.5 (measles) to
US$134 (for DPT). Incomplete data for the TB program make estimations more difficult, but
available data suggest that the project contributed to DALY reductions from TB mortality at
approximately $34 per DALY reduced, which is cost-effective but slightly higher than average
estimates for developing countries.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall outcome rating is Satisfactory, on the basis of high relevance, substantial efficacy,
and substantial efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

No direct data are available on poverty impacts. The project increased availability of social
sector inputs in the public sector (including vaccines, school textbooks, etc) that
disproportionately are used by the poor. Evaluation of the CIDSS subcomponent showed positive
contributions to community infrastructure and social capital.



                                                 22

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project made significant contributions to promoting key policy reforms, as well as to
translating those reforms into guidelines, procedures, and practices, which contributed to
improved performance in the social sectors, and also created a "demonstration effect" that helped
promulgate reforms in other government departments. International procurement practices as
applied in the SEMP and other WB projects provided evidence that supported passage of the
(Phil) Government Procurement Reform Act (RA 9184), and SEMP2 supporting implementation
and operationalization of the reforms. The project introduced new accountability arrangements
and innovative practices, including community school construction, improved teacher
deployment system, civil society monitoring of textbook distribution and school construction, and
formalized these arrangements through MOUs between government departments and CSOs,
many of which are now being "mainstreamed."

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

While the procurement reforms supported by the project were expected to generate opposition,
few anticipated the aggressiveness and highly organized nature of the campaign by losing bidders
to overturn textbook procurement award decisions and to undermine the procurement reforms
(including making public accusation of corruption against DepEd and World Bank staff ).         26

While a great deal of misinformation was, and continues to be disseminated in the media and
public fora, a positive outcome has been the confirmation by the Supreme Court of the award
decision, and mobilization of reform supporters in government and civil society to defend the
reforms. (See Annex 9).

3.6 Summary of Findings of Stakeholder Workshops

As two-day stakeholder workshop was organized during the ICR mission, which included key
staff from participating departments, and representatives of civil society organizations that were
involved in the project. The workshop summarized project results, summarized lessons and
recommendations (see Annex 6). Participants also anonymously rated project outcome, Bank and
borrower performance. Stakeholders rated all of these to have been fully satisfactory.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcomes is rated as Modest. The most significant risks to
development outcomes include (i) risks to sustaining and consolidating the reforms and systems
improvements supported by the project, including for procurement and financial management, (ii)
risks to sustaining or maintaining inputs or programs supported by the project, including school
buildings, textbooks, or the teacher deployment system. While the project has helped implement
and consolidate the procurement reform law and electronic financial management system,
opposition to procurement reforms persists. To mitigate this risk, reformers within the GOP, WB,
and civil society partners have sought to publicize the benefits of the reforms and mobilize



26 In addition to making various corruption accusations in print and electronic mass media, lawyers for
some of the losing bidders filed formal procurement protests to World Bank headquarters, as well as
several formal complaints with the World Bank's Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) against Bank
Staff. INT reviewed the accusations according to its procedures and found insufficient basis to warrant
further investigation.


                                                    23

support for further deepening the reform process. The recent Supreme Court ruling represented an
important victory against legal challenges to procurement reforms. Systems improvements (in FM
and IT) face risks in terms of staff turnover (DOH) and the need for senior management to
consolidate progress. The successor projects in health, education and (under preparation) social
protection will seek to continue progress in implementing improved practices and replicate
successful programs in the sector departments. To mitigate risks to inputs financed by the project,
GOP has increased budget allocations for operations and maintenance, and new health and
education projects are supporting efforts to ensure adequate maintenance. In terms of budgetary
reforms, the shift to a national Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is helping to
uphold yearly provisions of teacher positions to keep up with population growth, and to gradually
shift budget funds toward education and health.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Bank performance during project preparation was fully Satisfactory. The project design was
well grounded in lessons of previous operations, and a project preparation grant helped strengthen
preparation of key components and reforms. There was strong continuity of team members from
the SEMP1 project--including for procurement and financial management--and the team worked
closely with key counterparts in DBM, sector departments, and civil society in preparing the
operation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

The quality of Bank supervision is also rated as Satisfactory. The project benefited from twice-
yearly formal supervision missions, which regularly included subsector specialists (e.g., IT or
education specialists), as well as regular follow-up from field-based fiduciary and technical staff.
Supervision missions and Aide Memoires were used to monitor progress toward agreed
objectives, and to raise policy and technical issues with DBM and the sector departments. The
Bank's procurement and financial management team members devoted significant time to
providing advice and technical support to their GOP counterparts in implementing reforms ­
above and beyond their regular responsibility for monitoring and clearing project-specific
transactions. Given the wide range of activities and reforms supported by the project, a few issues
did not receive consistent attention during supervision missions (such as client scorecards, or
improving transparency of the budget process), although many of these are now being picked up
by other Bank country program activities. Continuity of the Bank's engagement in activities and
reforms supported by the project have been assured by the design and implementation of national
program support operations in education and health, and a social protection operation is under
preparation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

On the basis of satisfactory performance during both preparation and supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated Satisfactory.




                                                 24

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Government performance is rated as Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Overall rating of implementing agency performance is judged satisfactory, based on average the
performance of the four key implementing agencies.

    · DepEd: Performance was fully satisfactory with respect to achievement of output
        targets for textbook procurement and school construction, moderately satisfactory with
        respect to reform implementation (with satisfactory progress on procurement reforms,
        moderately unsatisfactory progress in eNGAS implementation and FM reforms, and
        moderately satisfactory progress on teacher deployment), and highly satisfactory with
        respect to increasing civil society involvement. As the largest government ministry (with
        schools not devolved to Local Government Units (LGUs)), implementing reforms (such
        as in financial management) was clearly a challenge, but was also exacerbated by
        frequent leadership changes and varied commitment by mid-level managers. Performance
        is judged satisfactory overall.
    · DOH: DOH performance with respect to provision of vaccines (including the decision
        to use UN agencies for procurement) was fully satisfactory; performance for the TB and
        rabies programs were moderately satisfactory, since they did not meet original
        performance targets. Despite having not participated in SEMP1, DOH made substantial
        progress in implementing procurement reforms (although streamlining procedures
        remains a priority), and modest progress in financial management reforms (the latter has
        been undermined by inadequate capacities for strategic finance management at the DOH
        Finance Service, however). When problems in vaccine logistics were uncovered, DOH
        management moved quickly to address them. Overall performance is rated satisfactory.
    · DSWD: DSWD was usually the first department to implement reforms in procurement,
        financial management, and information technology systems, and also fully met or
        exceeded initial targets with respect to the CIDSS program and support services on social
        protection. Recommended reforms with respect to centers and institutions have been
        only partially implemented, however. Overall performance is rated satisfactory
    · DPWH: The School Building Program implemented by DPWH was plagued by
        prolonged delays; although it was agreed to adopt National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
        procedures for school construction, the Bank was forced to reject all initial contract
        packages prepared by DPWH district offices. When the packages were rebid centrally,
        DPWH leadership was slow to exercise legal remedies against poorly performing
        contractors. Mitigating this poor performance was the agreement by DPWH to involve
        CSOs in monitoring the school building program, and efforts by central staff to complete
        the centrally bid contracts despite delays. Overall performance is judged moderately
        unsatisfactory.
    · DBM: DBM staff and senior managers demonstrated strong ownership of project
        objectives, and strong commitment to implementation of key reforms in the sector
        departments and nationally. Key staff have been remarkably stable throughout SEMP1
        and SEMP2, contributing to continuity in implementation and oversight. Delays in
        release of cash allotments for some programs contributed to implementation delays.
        Overall performance is rated Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

On the basis of an overall satisfactory rating for government performance, and a majority of
implementing agencies performing satisfactorily, overall borrower performance is rated
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

The SEMP2 experience demonstrated the importance of linking reforms to clear outputs and
anchoring the program very clearly within the macroeconomic constraints and policy context of
the country. It also demonstrated that progress is possible on difficult governance reforms in the
social sectors, while illustrating the "stop and start" nature of the reforms and the varied progress
across sectors and reforms.27 The Borrower's ICR and The ICR stakeholders workshop produced
a wide range of lessons and recommendations (Annexes 5 and 6). Some of the key lessons are
summarized below.

Promoting and consolidating governance reforms. The stakeholder workshop underlined the role
of SEMP2 in the reform process. "DBM was charting new orientations in public expenditure
management and embarking on wider budget reforms. The SEMP lessons provided
demonstration windows for policy definition and validation ­ for example, providing the learning
for GOP on the need to work on the framework for procurement reforms, which contributed to
the drafting and passage of the procurement law (RA 9184)." The SEMP2 supported
implementation of reforms through translation of reform policies into actual processes, guidelines
and transactions involving project components, which were subsequently integrated into
mainstream departmental and governmental processes. Key elements of success included:

     · Sustained championship for reforms at the Secretary, Undersecretary, and Assistant
        Secretary levels was the key factor in the degree of progress. Given turnover at the
        senior management level, strengthening capacity and commitment by middle managers
        was key to success and essential for sustaining reforms and system improvements.
     · Demonstrated successes were replicated across social sector departments, and
        subsequently other government departments.
     · The involvement of World Bank and other donors in reform implementation provided
        value added in terms of the discipline and oversight involved in WB procurement and
        financial management rules (particularly prior to passage of RA 9184), and helped
        strengthen the position of reform-oriented senior managers and line personnel,
        particularly when they were subject to internal or external "pressures." Supervision
        missions provided important opportunities for assessing progress, sharing lessons, and
        dialogue on technical and policy issues.




27The 2003 joint report on the School Building Program opened with the following quote: "...Getting
good government is a lengthy, laborious and multifaceted process, fraught with opportunities for failure
and misspent resources." Quoted from Merilee Grindle (ed.), Getting Good Government: Capacity
Building in the Public Sectors of Developing Countries (Harvard University Press: Boston, MA 1997).
The SEMP2 experience confirms the "lengthy and laborious" nature of reform processes, but it is notable
that SEMP2 financing for social sector inputs were spent effectively and efficiently.




                                                   26

    · Reform efforts met with (continuing) resistance and created considerable stress for those
        working on changes. Reform supporters in government and civil society will need to
        continue to work together to publicize the positive contributions of reforms, including in
        public and the media, in order to stem efforts by reform opponents to reverse or weaken
        key legislation and systems.

Strengthening accountability and civil society engagement. Efforts to strengthen "bottom up"
accountability were a crucial complement to "top down" reforms and systems strengthening
efforts. Key lessons include: (i) The participation of civil society and other stakeholders in
procurement and monitoring of service delivery is essential to ensuring efficiency in resource use,
enhancing impact, mobilizing resources, and increasing accountability; (ii) piloting of CSO
involvement in the context of a Bank-financed project helped establish relationships and build
confidence among central government, CSO, and local stakeholders, and to demonstrate the value
added of CSO monitoring; (iii) formalizing these relationships through MOUs has helped
"mainstream" these arrangements nationally; (iv) the quality and depth of CSO participation has
been greatest in monitoring delivery of books and school construction at the local level, and in
monitoring procurement at central level. CSO involvement has been more limited in procurement
monitoring at LGU level, and in budget monitoring at national level, largely due to lack of
capacity and resources; (v) CSO participation could be made more sustainable through enhancing
technical capacity and networking among CSOs, identifying stable funding sources, strategic
deployment and/or enhancing local CSO capacity in rural/remote areas.

Decentralization. Project experience demonstrated that if local accountability and participatory
mechanisms are in place, decentralization of service delivery (e.g., for school construction) can
improve quality and efficiency. If those conditions are not in place (e.g., as was the case for TB
drug procurement or textbook procurement), centralized procurement and oversight, combined
with local monitoring of service delivery, led to better outcomes. Given that delivery of most
social services is devolved, however, a strong message from the ICR workshop is that supporting
the implementation of fiduciary reforms and increasing transparency and accountability for
results at the LGU level is critical. This requires an integrated effort of dialogue and capacity
building with local chief executives and politicians (involving both central authorities and local
constituents) with respect to national reform laws and regulations; rolling out system
strengthening reforms at local level, including eNGAS, eProcurement (PhilGEPS), and revised
chart of accounts; strengthened oversight and monitoring by central agencies, both fiduciary
oversight and service delivery (through "LGU Scorecards"); and strengthening capacity of local
CSOs and communities to monitor service delivery and use of LGU resources.

Implications for National Program Support (NPS) and instrument "mix." The SEMP projects
introduced the use of investment lending to finance priority line items in agency budgets.
    · In doing so, it assured cash availability for priority expenditure items while providing an
        entry point for improving national fiduciary systems and related reforms. The use of
        national systems was both an advantage and constraint. It helped mainstream systems
        reforms, but meant that project execution was at times negatively affected by delays in
        the cash allotment process, weaknesses in the human resource management system, etc.
    · Technical assistance was not included in the loan, and even if eligible, was difficult to
        procure through government processes. The Bank and GOP managed to mobilize TA
        through various other sources, including project preparation grants and capacity building
        grants (PDF). While insufficient TA was not the binding constraint for slow progress of
        some reforms (e.g., FM reforms), it is clear that having flexible TA available through
        other sources (including development partners) is an important complement to the NPS
        approach, particularly to support capacity building and reform implementation.


                                                 27

    · Would a Development Policy Loan (DPL) have been equally effective in promoting these
        reforms (e.g., providing direct budget financing based on achievement of agreed
        reforms)? The consensus among stakeholders and the ICR team is "no." While a DPL
        could have included policy conditions related to certain reforms, the complex and highly
        political nature of these reforms suggests that policy conditionality alone would have had
        limited impact. Policy lending should be considered a complement to, rather than a
        substitute for, this type of targeted support for sector reform implementation.
    · With the transition toward "sectoral" NPSs, one lesson emerging is the need to establish
        other forum for lesson sharing among the social sector departments and to facilitate
        dialogue with DBM and other central departments.

Systems strengthening. Targeting strategic (sector/fiduciary ) policies and monitoring their
implementation in Bank-funded projects is useful in ensuring greater effectiveness in the use of
existing resources, and effective use of savings from policy interventions and additional resource
mobilization to enhance quality. Specific lessons include: (i) assigning responsibility to the
Government agency organic staff helps to ensure institutionalization and mainstreaming of
innovations and reforms and sustainability of gains; (ii) systems improvements and reforms in
procurement, FM, IT need to be integrated in order to achieve further efficiency gains,
particularly with regard to timely payment systems, planning and budget execution; (iii) while the
multi-sectoral design of the SEMP2 increased project complexity, it also facilitated cross-agency
learning and demonstration effect of the faster reformers on other departments/units. An ICR
workshop recommendation was to continue this through annual social sector reviews involving
the three departments and DBM.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

As described in the main text, section 3.2, the Project enhanced development objectives in three
areas: (A) Strengthening Key Budgetary Programs, (B) Systems Improvement and Reform, and
(C) Strengthening Transparency and Accountability. The actual costs by area and programmatic
section are provided in Table 1 below.

    · Components B and C were to be financed though the GOP counterpart contribution. While the
        sectoral departments incurred expenditures related activities under these components (including
        for staff, equipment, and logistics), there were not tracked separately by the project monitoring
        system.
Of these areas, (B) and (C) represent the most difficulty in assigning economic benefits, because
of the reforms and improvements are process oriented, with accumulated developmental
outcomes. These areas represented only 1.3% of Project costs at appraisal. The benefits from
these program areas are potentially significant over time; ­ particularly since they seek to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of all budgetary expenditures in the social sectors --
implying that in a long-term analysis, these Project investments would be rewarded with large
benefit-cost ratios.

The intermediate outcomes for the two areas (B) and (C) were noted in part F of the introductory
Data Sheet, and include demonstrable increases in the capacity of partner government
organizations and entities to perform their functions on time, as per plan, and on budget. These
areas were rated moderately satisfactory overall based on performance in component activities.
The associated improvements in service delivery will impact developmental outcomes in the
Philippines in two ways:

    · Direct benefits accruing to customers of public services: For component B.2, the benefits
        to pupils of teacher redeployment funded through the Project over 2003-07 are direct,
        especially in underserved schools where new nationally-funded teachers were deployed.28
        Per PDO indicator 6 in the Data Sheet (section F), the reduction in the overall IQR is a
        metric of the reducing overall inequity in teaching resources across the Philippines. The
        redeployment should also reduce overall Pupil-Teacher-Ratios (PTR) without requiring

         an increase in the total number of teachers29. Based on review studies for developing
         countries, while the effect on student attainment from reducing the PTR is less significant
         than teacher education and experience,30 benefits of reducing PTR increase as the
         educational system develops.31 Therefore, if both the overall IQR and overall PTR
         continue to fall, the benefits to society from reduced inequity in education and higher
         student attainment will continue to accrue. The value of these benefits is not immediately
         quantifiable in monetary terms.
     · Benefits to Government departments/agencies from improvement procurement, financial
         management, planning/budgeting, and information technologies (indirect benefits to
         customers and society): Improved functioning in participating agencies and departments
         of the Government under component B.1 will lead to cost savings for the budget, reduced
         wastage/leakage of funds, and enhanced coverage and quality of services to customers.
         Improved procurement, logistics, and financial management will contribute to significant
         cost savings for public sector funds and reduced wastage of resources, although the extent
         of savings are difficult to quantify. Improved budgetary planning and transparency, and
         improved internal management systems are likely to contribute to increase efficiency in
         the allocation of government resources in the social sectors. The cost of providing high
         quality government services to society should thus decline over the future due reforms
         support by the project.

The rest of this Annex concerns the area Strengthening Key Budgetary Programs ­ accounting for
nearly 100% of actual Project costs ­ in which the programs are: (1) Basic Education Services,
(2) Public Health Services, and (3) Social Services. Instead of the standard benefit-cost or internal
rate of return analysis, the focus below is on economic aspects of the program benefits and to
quantify these where possible. The dates below are used as indicators for the assignment of
specific benefits recorded in various calendar or fiscal years to the SEMP projects.

1. Basic Education Services

(i) Textbooks and teacher manuals procurement and distribution: This component generated
benefits for students, the Government, and the formal education sector in general. First, from the
investments under the Project as well as the Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP), the
availability of textbooks increased from the average country-level textbook-student ratio of 1:2.5
prior to the Project to nearly 1:1 for core elementary subjects. For secondary students, the
textbook-student ratio increased to 1:1.3 on average. Besides the increase in textbook availability,
the quality of textbooks provided ­ physical (thicker paper, durable binding, and better printing)




29This effect follows since all schools are not equal ­ large, well-funded schools can have higher
attainment at a given PTR compared to smaller schools because of other resource advantages.

Research Observer 10(2): August 1995, pp. 227-246
31For example, the evidence from the U.K. shows that reducing PTR, ceteris paribus, raises math and
science attainment in secondary schools. See: Steele et al, J.R. Statist. Soc.(2007) 170, Part 3, pp 801-824


                                                      35

and content/accuracy ­ improved. Both the quantity and quality32 of textbooks can be related to
student attainment. The international evidence base for the relationship between quantity of
textbooks and student attainment is discussed below. Second, the Project also instituted
international competitive bidding (ICB), a process improvement that generated cost savings for
the Government which can be expected to continue to accrue in the future. Third, the Project
improved processes related to the distribution and allocation of textbooks across schools which
improved the equity, timeliness, and efficiency of the system. These benefits to the education
sector will also accrue as long as the processes are maintained. This lattermost benefit is not
amenable to quantification for purposes of this analysis.

Student Attainment: Increased textbook resources in developing countries have been related to
student attainment in a vast literature of statistical analyses and in natural experiments. 33     34 35

Results broadly indicate that where textbooks are scarce, providing them to students yields high
returns36. In the Philippines, a study in the mid-1980s of the impact of increased textbook
availability on student attainment concluded that the overall effect of the first year of increase in
textbook availability was to raise academic achievement by one-third of a standard deviation for
language and math, and one-half for science (in the affected grade levels).37 These impact
coefficients are relevant to their time period, but also inform the benefits of the reduction in
textbook-student ratios achieved two decades later under this Project (SEMP 2).




32Specifically, the physical quality improvements also raise the usable life of the textbook ­ from 2 years
in 1999 to 4-5 years now, which increases the period during which benefits accrue from a single purchased
copy. Source: testing done by Industrial Technology Development Institute of DOST

Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis 8(4): Winter 1986, pp. 379-392
34Results from a randomized evaluation in Kenya suggest that the benefits largely accrue to students with
stronger academic backgrounds, and are sensitive to the language of the textbooks. Glewwe et al. "Many
children left behind? Textbooks and test scores in Kenya." Poverty Action Lab Paper No. 44, July 2007
35Cost effectiveness of the increase in textbook availability compared to other inputs into education varies
according to country context. An early review found that textbooks were more cost-effective in a country
(Brazil) vs. teacher training, and vice-versa in another country (Nicaragua). M. Lockheed & E.A.

37 The study evaluated the impact of the "Philippines Textbook Project" (rollout during 1977-78, a part of
the Third Education Project funded with a World Bank loan). The project reduced the textbook-student
ratio from 1:10 prior to the investments to 1:2 at the end of the project. The study compared the with-
project student achievements to the natural control group of prior year students (who did not receive the
project benefits) See Heyneman et al. "Textbooks in the Philippines: Evaluation of the pedagogical impact
of a nationwide investment," Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis 6(2): Summer 1984, pp. 139-150.

The Project contributed to a significant increase in textbook availability for elementary students
and some improvement for secondary students. This suggests that student achievement should
increase, based on the literature. The overall impact will depend in part on the distribution of
student backgrounds, and it should be noted that the availability of textbooks at the school level is
variable. Results from standardized test in the Philippines (see Table 2) show a significant rise
(over 12 percentage points) in achievement scores for "core subjects" for both elementary and
high school levels, from 2002-03 to 2004-5, which corresponds to the increased availability of
textbooks financed through SEMP1, SEMP2, and TEEP. Scores subsequently fell in 2005-06,
although part of that decline may be attributable to changes in test administration, including
introduction of independent monitors. These data do not permit specific attribution of improved
test scores to textbooks financed by SEMP2, or quantification of economic benefits from these
investments. But test score data provide further evidence that increased availability of textbooks
have contributed to improve student achievement.

Cost savings: Over the period of the procurements under SEMP 2, 52.7 million textbooks and
manuals were procured against the original target of 50 million. These were delivered over Class
Years 2002/03 through 2006/2007. Estimating the cost savings for the SEMP 2 procurements
requires the baseline costs per copy ­ for example, from the 1998 DECS catalogue ­ and detailed
cost data for the SEMP 1 and SEMP 2 procurements to disentangle and attribute the savings.
Based on such calculation, SEMP2 savings have been estimated by DepED and are shown in
Table 5. For SEMP 1 related savings, weighted average cost data were available for the periods
1998-2000 (the comparable procurement period prior to SEMP 1) and 1999-2003 (for the
procurement period under SEMP 1, TEEP, SEDIP, and 2003-2006/7 (specific for SEMP 2 only.)
These are listed in Table 4 below.

The following assumptions and compromises are made for the estimation of cost savings:
    a. The weighted average costs per copy (textbook or teacher manual) that existed before
        SEMP would have continued without the Project's introduction of international
        competitive bidding processes. Specifically, if SEMP 1 was not initiated, it is assumed
        prices would revert to the levels before competitive bidding began (i.e., pre-SEMP 1).
    b. The implementation of the international bidding process under SEMP 1 and SEMP 2
        imposed no additional costs on the procurement system compared to what existed without
        these projects. Therefore, the total costs of procurement under these projects are taken to
        represent the entire cost to Government and donors.
    c. The weighted average cost values are not adjusted for inflation. Based on CPI (national
        series, all income households, 2000=100), annual inflation in the Philippines over 1999-



                                                    38

        2006 averaged 5.3%38. With inflation adjustment, the estimated (real) cost savings would
        be even higher. Therefore, the savings estimates below are inherently conservative.
     d. Given that no baseline costs are available for teacher manuals for 1998-2000 (i.e., pre-
        SEMP), the estimated percentage savings on a weighted cost per unit basis for the SEMP
        1 period are assumed the same as for textbooks in the analysis below.

Based on the cost figures in Table 4 and the assumptions, Table 6 below presents the estimated
percentage savings on a weighted average cost per unit basis over the SEMP 1 period.

Table 6: Percentage with-Project savings on a weighted average cost per unit (WACU) basis

                                                  Elementary                      Secondary
            Textbooks                                  48%                          43%

The cost savings are estimated based on the counterfactual implied by a. above, and the volume
figures and percentage savings from Tables 3 and 4. For example, the cost of purchasing 91.15
million elementary textbooks (delivered CY 1999/2000 ­ 2002/03) is first calculated using 1998-
2000 prices, and then the cost of the same volume of resources using the 1999-2003 prices is
subtracted to yield the total savings in PHP for the SEMP 1 period. This is then valued at US
dollars at the average nominal exchange rate prevailing at the end of the period, US$1=55PHP.

     Textbooks                  $69,158,561                         $20,187,505        $89,346,066
 Teacher manuals                 $116,438                             $61,533             $177,972

The teaching materials ­ textbooks and teacher manuals ­ will generate intrinsic benefits for
students and instructors over their usable lifetimes which have not been quantified in this analysis.
For example, the increased availability of textbooks has the effects on attainment as already
discussed. In this context, the savings on procurement costs are an added bonus, freeing up
Government resources for alternative uses. If effectively invested, these free resources will
generate their own developmental benefits. The overall SEMP 1+2 innovations in international
competitive bidding generated approximately US$125.3 million in cost savings over a seven year
period (1999-2006). SEMP2 specifically generated US$35.76 million in savings from textbook
procurement alone. Using 2001 as the base of SEMP 1 savings and 2005 as the base of SEMP 2
savings, the value can be approximately adjusted for consumer price inflation (index series: all
income households, IMF) to yield an estimate at 2006 prices of $153 million in total savings.
Given that many positive effects were not quantifiable, the overall estimate of benefits is
conservative.

SEMP2, especially with the DepEd-managed construction, which was directly financed with
Project funds.

As discussed in the main text and the independent evaluation (Annex 8), as of project closing
(June 2007) the DepEd-managed construction with 10% of the regular school building program
(SBP) budget finished 841 new classrooms and the repair/rehabilitation of 1,819 classrooms. The
DPWH finished 481 classrooms. There were also differences in quality: DepEd-constructed
classrooms were found by the independent evaluation to be of better quality due to involvement
of school administration and parent associations in the building. These improvements in quality
represented significant indirect cost savings (for example, completed DepEd schools typically
included electrical wiring and chalkboards, whereas these had to be separately financed and
installed for DPWH-financed schools). Better quality construction may also contribute to a
positive learning environment and have an incremental effect on student attainment at the margin.

The specific calculation and attribution of cost savings in the SBP under SEMP 2 is complicated
by a lack of baseline data (e.g., cost of construction by type of classroom and agency, number to
be constructed in the absence of the Project). The cost of construction varies by the size of
classroom, the school, as well as the contractor. However, detailed data are not available for all
the classrooms constructed for the DepED program, and very little data is available at this point
for the DPWH construction program either before or during the Project period. Therefore, while it
would be worthwhile to compare weighted average cost of construction per classroom type to
baseline values for both DPWH and DepED building programs, the data do not permit this
evaluation. The direct cost savings are relatively modest compared to savings under the textbook
component. The indirect savings from better quality likely exceed the direct savings, but available
data did not allow quantitative estimates of savings from quality improvements.

The independent consultant field visits (see Annex 8) yielded some comparator data for a small
sample of DepEd and DPWH constructed classrooms across 23 schools:

DepEd- constructed classrooms in the sampled schools to the prescribed `7m x 9m' standard set
for secondary schools, and did so at lower cost than DPWH, except for two-storey classrooms of
size `7m x 9m'. The figures in the table above could be used to estimate total savings for the SBP
under SEMP 2. Based on data from the DepED's centrally bid-out school-building contract
packages for CY 2004-2005, it can be established that 37.5% were `7m x 7m' and 62.5% were
`7m x 9m' classrooms across the sample of 696 classrooms, but it cannot be distinguished if the

latter type of classrooms were single or double-storied. Therefore, if 62.5% of the DepEd
construction of new structures during SEMP 2 (841 classrooms) was of the type 1 storey `7m x
9m', then a total of US$131,160 was saved.

Data is also available from DepED on construction savings over prescribed budget cost by the
type of construction process: principal-led or national competitive bidding. Table 9 below
illustrates the savings and the number of new classrooms constructed using the two modes.

* Based on average, CY 2003-04 ** Split between 1 storey vs. 2 storey is unknown at this point.

Based on Table 9, using just the values for Principal-led construction and the average cost per
classroom over CY 2003-04, for the construction of 249 new classrooms, approximate savings of
US$89,916 were registered. Over the SEMP 2 period, the DepEd SBP also generated savings in
its contracting of construction as compared to the programmed cost. These savings are listed in
Table 9 below. They suggest that over the SBP in the class year 2003, DepEd contracting saved
2.84% from programmed costs with 99.7% of construction completed. over the class year's
period 2004-05, the contracted costs are slated to be 5.21% under program values, with nearly
77% of construction completed at time of reporting. In US$ terms, the savings for the two periods
are US$96,727 and US$350,619 respectively (at 1US$=44PHP). These "book" savings, together
with indirect savings from improved quality, imply that in future DepEd can construct more
classrooms at the same budget and/or that the budget/programmed costs for SBP can be
rationalized to suit other priorities.

2. Public Health Services

The Public Health Services area of the Project was delivered with the joint efforts of the DOH,
UN agencies and other local partners (suppliers and nongovernmental organizations). Of the
various programmatic heads under this area, vaccine shortage issues within the Expanded
Program for Immunization (EPI) in the Philippines were the major target of Project funds (Table
10). The EPI portions supported by Project funds comprised measles, DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis,
Tetanus), and polio vaccination, along with additional tetanus toxoid (TT2) inoculation. The very

low incidence rate of rabies in the target Visayas region ­ maintained through the Project ­
implies that the analysis below is better suited for the other two major targets of spending.

(i) Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI): Vaccination programs satisfy public finance
criteria very well because of their prevention focus, the positive externalities to society from the
vaccination of an individual, and the fact that these services usually face some form market
failure requiring public provision. In addition, most types of vaccination programs ­ and
especially for measles ­ are known to be very cost-effective for reducing child mortality and
morbidity per dollar of unit cost. Given the severe symptoms of measles, pertussis, et al., and
lasting disability in the case of untreated poliomyelitis, the case is very strong for universal
coverage with these childhood vaccines. In the case of the TT2 vaccine, besides protection from
neonatal tetanus for the infant, the mother is also protected for up to 3 years after inoculation.
Over the SEMP 2 period, as EPI-related vaccine supplies were stabilized and implementation
improved given initial procurement issues (see main text, section 3.2.A.2), such that coverage in
the target population increased as per Table 12.

Data on the exact composition of the vaccines for DPT3, cost of vaccine per dose or per child for
the various diseases, the without-Project incidence of disease (baseline/counterfactual), and
complete coverage data for all years are not available at this point; hence traditional cost analyses
of vaccination programming cannot be performed. There are also issues with the tracking and
reporting of cases of neonatal tetanus which are required to establish current and baseline
incidence for the disease (see main text). Trend data are also not available for urban-rural
differentials in vaccination coverage to evaluate the important factor of Project impact on existing
inequity in health outcomes. In addition, the impact on current/future measles incidence from the
efforts to ensure vaccine supply for measles under the Project will be confounded with the
general efforts under the Government's `Knock out Tigdas (KOT)' initiative, which aims to
eliminate the disease from the country with a door-to-door campaign to immunize 9 million
children aged between nine months and four years. The reduction in measles incidence from
about 5700 cases in 2003 to 173 in 2006 (97% reduction) is at least partly attributable to
improved vaccine availability in the SEMP 2 financing period. Though 2007 is the peak of a
three-year measles epidemic cycle, and incidence has risen in the year, the KOT program, if
implemented as per plan, can reduce the incidence further going forward.

pregnancy or 3 doses ever before delivery)

The number of children fully immunized (FIC) during the Project period rose from the baseline of
2.385 million in 2002 to 2.575 million in 2006 according to approximate data released by the
Field Health Services Information System (FHSIS) (2006). Specifically, between 2004 and 2006,
this number grew by approximately 95,000 children. If it is assumed that in the absence of the
Project, the incidence of disease in the population lacking coverage would be as recorded in
2000-01 then the averted number of DALYs is given in Table 13 below. The 95,000 increment in
the FIC coverage is assumed to fully attribute for the averted number of Disability Adjusted Life
Years (DALYs) (per 100,000) in column IV of Table 13. Assuming 100% vaccine efficacy per
FIC, the cost per incremental DALY averted by disease group under SEMP 2 for 2004-2006
(using average cost per vial data till Q3 of 2006) works out to approximately: US$134 (DPT) and
US$30.5 (measles). Both are eminently cost-effective interventions and achieve DALY reduction
at costs below the international standard. The costs of wastage, vaccine storage and delivery and
recurring costs are not included.

For assessing the benefits in terms of cost per DALY averted of the SEMP 2 financed TB control
program compared to the baseline, it is necessary to estimate how many additional smear positive

TB cases and deaths were averted. Data required include baseline and with-Project detection rates
and cure rates, and baseline death rates. Approximate estimates of 25000 deaths p.a. in the
Philippines prior to SEMP 2 indicate a death rate of 20%39.

All of these metrics improved with the Project, according to qualitative and limited quantitative
records. However, baselines and the with-Project data on death rates in smear positive and smear
negative TB patients in the Philippines are not available. This complicates the economic analysis
specific for the Philippines case. However, estimates are available from similar DOTS programs
in developing countries with a high TB burden. Based on a prior estimation from a World Bank
supported TB-DOTS project in India40, 99% of the benefits were from deaths averted, yielding an
overall $34 per DALY reduced. Data from sub-Saharan Africa (specifically, Malawi) suggests a
year of healthy life could be gained for less than US$541 with TB treatment, and other review
studies have suggested $25 per DALY for comprehensive TB-DOTS interventions in developing
countries.

3. Social Services

Of these, the Social Services activity contained the Comprehensive Integrated Delivery of Social
Services (CIDSS). A separately funded World Bank loan for the KALAHI/CIDSS project was the
subject of a prior independent and comprehensive analysis which established that the design ­
adopted from the SEMP2 CIDSS program ­ was economically beneficial, generating a net IRR of
21% and a NPV of PHP 1.03 billion42. The SEMP2 CIDSS component over-achieved its targets
in terms of the number of sub-projects implemented (2,495 by project closing compared to the
PAD target of 2,000).

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR


1. From June 2002 to June 2007, the Philippine Government implemented the Second Social
   Expenditure Management Project (SEMP2) in accordance with its $100-million Loan
   Agreement with the World Bank. The Departments of Education (DepEd), Health (DOH),
   Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and Public Works and Highways (DPWH) were
   in charge of the implementation while the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)
   performed oversight.

   On its completion, the project's development objectives to provide inputs to basic social
   services and enhance performance and governance had been satisfactorily achieved. The
   accomplishments in 16 out of 25 development and intermediate outcome indicators met or
   exceeded the targets while the others were not very far below the target or nevertheless
   surpassed the available baseline value. In terms of budget allocation, 50% of the loan went
   to the education sector, 38 percent to health, and 11 percent to social welfare.

   The entire SEMP2 experience offered key lessons that should be adopted and utilized for
   future undertakings.

2. In the education sector, the project covered textbooks, school buildings and teachers'
   deployment. The DepEd was the implementing agency of all these project components, with
   the DPWH co-implementing the school building component.

   A total of 56.97 million textbooks for core subjects, Math, Science, English and Filipino,
   was procured and delivered, which exceeded the target by 6.97 million. It has improved the
   textbook-pupil ratio in the said four subjects from a baseline of 1:2.5 to 1:1.

   Combined DepEd and DPWH accomplishments resulted in the construction of 1,441 new
   classrooms, which was short of the target by 309. DepEd finished 841 new classrooms and
   repaired/rehabilitated 1,819, 119 of which qualified as new ones because they were severely
   damaged. It therefore contributed 960 new classrooms, which surpassed its individual
   agency target of 750. DPWH was responsible for the shortage as it finished only 481
   classrooms, including repaired/rehabilitated ones, out of its individual agency target of 1,000.

   For the grants for repair and maintenance, which targeted 40,000 recipients, 41,561 were
   considered eligible for reimbursement. Trainings on minor repairs and maintenance were
   also provided to 41,561 Parent-Teacher-Community Associations (PTCAs).

   Finally, the Inter-quartile ratios (IQR) for teacher deployment, which was targeted to
   improve to 1.75, only reached 2.01. There were still resistance from Division Offices to give
   up vacant teaching positions to other divisions that need them. Note, however, that DepEd
   managed to pull the ratio down from the recorded baseline of 2.17.

3. In the health sector, the project covered the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI),
   Rabies Control, and Tuberculosis Control. The DOH was the implementing agency.

   The EPI's sub-program for fully immunized children (FIC) reached 83% against the target
   of 67%. Measles cases, which were targeted to be halved to 3,500, were reduced to 173
   cases or 97% reduction. The polio free certification was also maintained, but there was no
   report on the number of child protected at birth (CPAB) with tetanus toxoid because of
   problematic reporting system; the use of tetanus toxoid also met opposition from a religious
   group.




                                                47

   In the case of rabies control, the recorded accomplishment was 1.8 cases per million
   population, which fell below the target by 0.8.

   The TB drugs were administered to 148,183 patients against the target of 200,000 patients.
   DOH attributed the failure to reach the target to the stricter and more specialized
   administration of the drugs to patients. Also, the reported TB smear notification rate of 75%
   was below the target of 80%, but improved much on the baseline of 53%. The TB cure rate
   was better off from a baseline of 73% to 82%, but was also lower than the project target of
   85%.

4. In the social welfare sector, the project covered the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery
   of Social Services (CIDSS) projects, support services and social protection, and
   administration of centers and institutions. The DSWD was the implementing agency.

   A total of 2,495 CIDSS subprojects were successfully implemented and made significant
   improvement in the lives of beneficiary communities. This accomplishment exceeded the
   target of 2,000.

   The area of protective services registered an impressive accomplishment of serving 366,432
   individuals in years 2004 and 2005 against the target of only 150,000. Relief goods
   amounting to P141.94 million were distributed to victims of disasters and calamities; the
   target was P26.78 million. On the other hand, 5,515 units of core shelters and 3,169 units of
   emergency shelter assistance were extended to victims of disasters and calamities, from their
   respective targets of 2,363 units and 2,983 units.

5. The target timeframe for budget disbursement and project completion was generally
   observed. DBM reported 98.1% disbursement as of 31 December 2006 and 100%
   disbursement as of 30 June 2007. The short delay was due to the legal dispute in textbooks
   procurement.

6. The achievement of the SEMP2 development objectives and key performance indicators was
   largely credited to the significant progress, though at varying degrees, in the social sectors'
   systems reform and improvement efforts, especially in the case of DSWD. This, at the
   minimum, confirmed the correct direction of the reforms.

   The preparation of plans for Financial Management, Procurement and Information,
   Communication and Technology (ICT) systems had been completed. The operationalization
   of the electronic New Government Accounting System (e-NGAS) in the Central Offices, on
   the other hand, was likewise completed in DOH and DSWD, though not in DepEd. DepEd
   cited lack of manpower, hardware and funds as reasons for its failure to operationalize e-
   NGAS.

   Also, the passage of the RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA)
   paved the way for successful efforts to reconstitute procurement units and streamlining of
   procurement processes in all agencies.

   DOH adopted and maintained the contract distribution system, and likewise achieved 70%
   automation of the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD) through the Integrated Information
   System for quality assurance. DepEd, on the other hand, has organized an IT unit and
   developed the Basic Education Information System (BEIS), which serves as the
   department's primary source of national statistical data on elementary and secondary
   education.

   DSWD likewise installed department-wide ICT infrastructures, one of which was the
   establishment of the Regional Management Information System (RMIS) Unit in all of its 16
   Field Offices.



                                               48

   Finally, measures to strengthen transparency and accountability across agencies, specifically
   in the budgetary process, were carried in the implementation stage, though still not
   completed.

7. Aside from the positive effect of systems reforms on performance, the SEMP2
   implementation left vital lessons on leadership, decentralization, accountability, linking
   reforms in procurement, financial management and IT, and sustainability and
   institutionalization. These were documented and synthesized in the SEMP2 Stakeholders'
   Workshop.

   Leadership played a major role in pushing for the needed reforms. This was very evident in
   top-level management initiatives in the social sector departments to put in place procurement
   systems and procedures and motivate adherence to these systems and procedures, especially
   with the passage of the GPRA. Notably, these led to lower prices, a more efficient system of
   procurement from contracting to award and delivery, and improved credibility of the
   transactions.

   It is worth noting, however, that the diligence and persistence of middle-level managers
   greatly supplemented the top-level leadership, where there had been fast and often
   unpredictable transitions. The middle managers, therefore, "provided continuity and stability
   by keeping the reform measures on check." Given such strategic role, a recommendation to
   organize better the selection and/or appointment process and provide them continuing
   professional development program was forwarded. A more stable top-level leadership,
   however, would still be the ideal condition to ensure consistency in policy reform
   implementation.

   The gains of decentralization presented another lesson. DSWD's best practice in
   community-based procurement and DepEd's Principal-Led School Building Program
   illustrated these gains. On the other hand, DOH's decision to recentralize the procurement of
   anti-TB drugs after seeing high increase in prices and longer contracting period in the
   regional offices' procurements pointed to the need for accountability systems to go hand-in-
   hand with decentralization.

   Lesson on strengthening accountability also emerged with the additional mechanism
   provided by the Internal Audit Units (IAUs) and the interventions of civil society as third-
   party monitors, which made important contributions to effective project implementation.
   The environment was deemed favorable to pursue the full activation of the IAUs in the
   entire bureaucracy and the continued partnership with civil society, but limited resources and
   capacities pose great constraints. Bringing these mechanisms in the local setting would even
   be a bigger challenge.

   Going back to procurement reforms, its central role in SEMP2 implementation also marked
   an important lesson--it must be linked with the entire financial management system and ICT.
   The complete picture of an effective system could only be seen within a framework that
   bring together in and through ICT the entire process of budgeting, procurement planning,
   contracting and implementation, and accounting and audit, This, of course, would entail
   budgetary, human resource and time requirements.

   Finally, the need to ensure that SEMP2 accomplishments would be sustained left a
   challenging lesson. In response, the agencies started devising different ways to bring it about.
   DOH's "FOURmula One for Health", DSWD's transfer of CIDSS to the local government
   units, and DepEd's Textbook Count and DepEd-DPWH joint policy on coordination on the
   school building program, were examples of these efforts on sustainability. The lesson,




                                               49

   moreover, underlined the importance of establishing a network of support and a strong pro-
   reform advocacy program to realize sustainability and institutionalization.

8. A post-SEMP2 completion scenario has many positive openings to sustain the
   accomplishments. The positive results themselves planted the seed of confidence in the
   overall capability of the government to deliver services. The political stability and persisting
   question on the credibility of the President, however, remain to be a serious concern.

   At any rate, the familiarity with the reformed systems' processes that key stakeholders,
   especially the government implementers, had developed, and the benefits that they had seen
   accrue from these reforms indicate strong likelihood of continued support for these reforms.
   Lessons pointed to the need for follow-up efforts for wider information dissemination and
   public advocacy. These are important to generate a broader constituency that would express
   appreciation and acceptance of the reforms. Such support mechanism, in turn, could be
   harnessed to counter possible attacks by those who had been negatively affected by the
   reforms.

   Lessons on linking reforms and growing demand for sustainability and institutionalization
   hinted at a maturing process. Consolidation of the lessons from previous project
   implementation experiences could be considered to map out strategic directions of future
   reforms and interventions. This should provide lens to see clearly the way in which the
   projects could really impact on poverty reduction and national development.

Annex 6: Summary of ICR Stakeholder Workshop Report

The results of SEMP2 Stakeholders' Workshop43 are here synthesized into the major accomplishments
of the projects and the categories of cross-cutting lessons that emerged from the exercise, namely (1)
Leadership and Human Resource, (2) Decentralization, (3) Accountability, (4) Procurement, Financial
Management and ICT, and (5) Sustainability and Institutionalization of Reforms. The following were
the salient points:

         Many outcome indicators in service provision were satisfactorily met, but with some
         prominent exceptions of programs for school buildings, teacher deployment and anti-TB
         drugs. Systems reform and improvement helped deliver better services.
         Systems reform and improvement was largely a function of the support of the top leadership
         of agencies, the championing of the middle managers and the level of capacity and
         competency of the human resource as a whole.
         Decentralization yielded favorable results when complemented by accountability measures.
         Accountability measures in the forms of civil society participation and internal audit
         enhanced government effectiveness and credibility. Sustaining such efforts would have long-
         term effect on institutional development.
         Financial management and procurement reforms must be linked for effective and results-
         oriented expenditure management. Information technology (IT) is a critical component of
         these reforms.
         Sustaining the gains of the project is a serious concern to realize growth and poverty
         reduction.

Satisfactory Service Provision through Systems Reform and Improvement

Based on the SEMP2 Results Framework Analysis44 and the agency presentations of accomplishments
during the workshop, the government met satisfactorily many outcome indicators, in both areas of
service delivery and systems improvement. Remarkably, the accomplishments surpassed the targets in
DSWD's CIDSS and protective services, in DOH's measles reduction and fully immunized children
(FIC) programs, and DepEd's textbook procurement.

On the other hand, the government accomplishment in the programs for school buildings, teachers'
deployment, and anti-TB drugs fell below the set targets. DPWH cited shortage of funds for their
below-target accomplishment. DepEd attributed the higher Inter-Quartile Ratio for Teacher
Deployment to the resistance of some divisions to give up their vacant teaching items for areas with
shortages. DOH explained it became difficult to reach the target 200,000 TB patients after it
introduced a stricter and more specialized drug administration scheme. It is important to note,
however, that for all the indicators with baseline information, the condition was better off after the
SEMP2 completion.45

In the area of systems improvement, the plans for financial management systems improvement,
specifically procurement and ICT, had been completed. The Electronic National Government
Accounting System (E-NGAS) was made fully operational in all the implementing agencies, except
DepEd. The advanced phase of these systems reforms in DSWD was identified during the workshop



43The Stakeholder Workshop was organized by Government Watch (G-Watch), Ateneo School of
Government. G-watch also produced this summary of workshop findings and recommendations.
44Prepared by Tim Johnston (WB, 25 November 2007) based on preliminary ICR Reports submitted by the
DepEd, DOH, DepEd and DSWD.
45The indicator for administering anti-TB Drug has no baseline information.


                                                    51

as the main reason for the agency's good performance. In DOH, the groundwork for these reforms had
also been instituted successfully with its procurement and logistics divisions and Bureau of Food and
Drugs' (BFAD's) 70% automation. The impact on project implementation, however, was still limited
because they were only starting to take root. The institution was still undergoing adjustments, which
take time. In DepEd, even bigger efforts and adjustments must be put in place in view of the scope of
its centralized operation and size of organization; the efforts require more resources. In DPWH,
systems reform had to contend with the traditional work environment, which remains prone to external
interference and highly undesirable practices.

At any rate, while the extent and level of systems improvement varied across agencies and its impact
differed in terms of pace, it provided all the agencies the building block for sustained and even wider
institutional strengthening. This partly explained the generally satisfactory accomplishment of the
agencies in SEMP2 implementation, which was also validated in the rating exercise46. DBM reported
98.1% disbursement as of 31 December 2006 and 100% as of 31 December 2007. The delay was due
mainly to the legal dispute in textbooks procurement.

Leadership, Middle-Managers and Human Resource

There was a consensus among the workshop participants that leadership was crucial for reforms. In all
the agencies, especially DOH and DepEd, the top executives were at the forefront of pushing for and
eventually putting in place the mechanisms of the new Government Procurement Reform Act (GPRA).
In DepEd, for instance, the leadership spearheaded the effort to bring down textbook prices and pursue
better arrangements with DPWH for the school building program. In DOH, the leadership also moved
to lower anti-TB drug prices. These were done side-by-side with the setting up of procurement and
logistics offices.

The DSWD leadership, for its part, supported the creation of a specific structure for finance service in
compliance with the SEMP requirement. It also had a plan for a separate finance manager so that
financial management would no longer be regarded as a mere support structure. The DBM leadership
had been crucial in introducing and implementing system-wide improvement. It was instrumental in
translating reform pronouncements into actual guidelines and processes, the successful use of which
was spread in many departments. At any rate, these initiatives could not have prospered without the
pivotal role of the middle managers. With frequent changes in the top-level positions (since 2002, all
of the original Secretaries left before their term ended and some key Undersecretaries have also left),
it was the middle managers who provided continuity and stability by keeping the reform measures on
check.

Thus, the middle managers did not only support, but also sustained the systems reform program. But
to ensure that they would pursue the reforms consistently and effectively, the workshop participants
recommended an agency Human Resource Development Plan that would address the need for a clear
and accountable selection and/or appointment process and an adequate program for continuing
professional development, especially for those involved in financial management. Some factors that
were considered to realize these measures were support from the senior management, participation of
key stakeholders, including civil society, and availability of funds. The constraints that should be
anticipated include turfing issues within the units and the resistance from those who benefit from the
old system.

Decentralization

Decentralizing project implementation functions were reported in the workshop to yield good results.
DSWD had the best practice in community-based procurement. It worked because integral in it was
the accountability and transparency ensured through "people's participation". DepEd took great
interest in DSWD's achievement because it appreciated the importance of such direction, consistent
with its school-based management policy. It still had a limited venture into the decentralization
through its Principal-Led School Building Program, which resulted in better quality projects. The
DPWH had no major decentralization effort, except for delegating contracting to its district offices,
the effects of which had yet to be assessed.

The case of DOH proved the importance of emphasizing accountability in a decentralized setup. Prior
to SEMP, its regional offices handled anti-TB medicines procurements, but these were as much as
three hundred times more expensive than the national bulk price and took longer to finish contracting.
Thus, DOH decided to revert the procurement functions for TB goods back to the Central Office to
avail of the economics of scale and due to the fact that procurement of program drugs is not a regional
health office core function. Despite this, accountability system in the regional offices was an area for
improvement. The emphasis on accountability implied the need for performance indicators for both
regional agencies and Local Government Units (LGUs). One effective way of exacting accountability
was the use of scorecards to reward well-performing agencies and identify a more equitable
distribution of project recipients.

To achieve these reform measures, the workshop participants proposed incorporating indicators on
health and other social services in the Local Government Project Monitoring System (LGPMS). They
also suggested that less capable LGUs be oriented more on the budget and expenditure programming
of national government agencies. The Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) must
open the information system to other departments and work to minimize political considerations in
incorporating the identified indicators.

For a more equitable use of national budget for local service delivery, the workshop also forwarded a
reform measure that waive the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of the G-36 (36 richest LGUs) in
favor of the more needy LGUs. The DBM's and the Office of the President's leading role in the
advocacy and negotiation were considered the main factors to advance this reform measure. The civil
society must also be engaged in the process. Political considerations as well as some resistance from
the G-36 were the possible constraints.

Accountability through Civil Society Participation and Internal Audit Unit

All the SEMP2 agencies had an engagement with civil society in monitoring project implementation.
Prominently mentioned in the reports of the DepEd, DOH, DSWD and DPWH was the research and
monitoring interventions of Government Watch (G-Watch), the transparency and accountability
program of the Ateneo School of Government. G-Watch partnered with DepEd for the Textbook
Count, a national program to ensure transparent procurement and effective delivery of textbooks. It
was done in collaboration with civil society, Scouts, church parishioners, private sector (such as Coca-
Cola), students, parents and the community. The program was credited for the lower price, shorter
procurement period, improved quality and improved delivery of textbooks. G-Watch also joined the
inspection of school buildings with DepEd and DPWH, the findings and recommendation of which
served as the basis for the drafting the DepEd-DPWH joint memorandum on school building
monitoring and inspection. This effort has also evolved now into Bayanihang Eskwela, a community-
led monitoring of school building construction, which was successfully pilot-tested in 25 school sites
in Luzon. The DOH also tapped G-Watch to monitor its medicines procurement, whose report
revealed (a) higher prices and longer delays in the procurement of anti-TB drugs, and (b) big



                                                   53

discrepancies in medicines prices across regional offices and hospitals. These prompted the DOH to
do necessary adjustments in its regional procurements and install system for the posting of regional
medicines prices in the web.

Finally, the DSWD also engaged G-Watch in a study on disaster relief distribution. This enabled the
Department to see the need to institute a transparency and accountability mechanism. It responded by
establishing a third-party monitoring of relief goods with the help inter-faith groups, which greatly
reduced pilferage in the distribution of disaster relief.

The active participation of civil society coincided with and complemented the government effort to
establish Internal Audit Units (IAUs). It is meant to strengthen accountability through preventive
means, especially in government transactions involving procurement and service delivery. The IAU in
DSWD and DPWH had already been established, but DepEd and DOH were still awaiting the plantilla
positions therefor. The significance of both participatory and government-led accountability reform
initiatives could not be overemphasized. The remaining challenge was to mainstream and integrate
them in all layers and systems of the bureaucracy.

In response to this, the workshop participants recommended the following steps: (a) create functional
IAUs in all agencies; develop appropriate manuals for their operation; (b) support civil society efforts
by helping it improve capacity; make monitoring templates available down to community or barangay
organizations. It was also suggested that external scorecards be developed to validate or verify agency
performance. The workshop participants identified many facilitating factors, such as the presence of
CSO networks and willingness to do monitoring work and the enabling environment with the
establishment of a Procurement Transparency Group under GPPB; the issuance of Executive Order
No. 124 Creating Internal Audit Units in All Government Agencies; PAGC's efforts to develop
generic manuals for internal audit and DBM's guidelines on internal control; and the completion of
the Organizational Performance Indicator Framework (OPIF), which was introduced in all
departments. Some constraints, however, include the limited capacity and resources for information
dissemination and operations.

Linking Financial Management, Procurement Reforms and ICT

SEMP2 contributed to vital reforms in procurement and financial management (PFM) by way of
providing the impetus or setting the agenda for them. The most well-known as well as the most
successful of these reforms was the adoption of a macro-framework for procurement reform, which
culminated in the passage of the GPRA (RA 9184). The other equally relevant reforms that had been
adopted were:
         automation of accounting systems from COGAS to ENGAS;
         strengthening of FM functions and review of structures with the drafting of the PFM manual;
         flash reporting of financial data; and
         PFM training course is also being drafted.

Interestingly, the convergence of many efforts and initiatives around procurement reform made the
stakeholders realize that it could not happen in isolation. A holistic systems reform must be pursued.
From one end of financial management, for instance, budget planning remained weak and highly
politicized in many, if not all, government agencies. From another end, processing and release of
payment to suppliers or contractors had not been prompt and efficient. Both affect the quality of
procurement. Bad plans could jack up unit prices; late payment increases cost of money, which
bidders could charge to their bid price.

The point, of course, was not only to pursue other reforms as aggressively as was done with
procurement, but rather to make sure that these reforms were linked with each other. The entire
financial management system, from budgeting, procurement planning and contracting, to accounting



                                                    54

and audit, should be taken together. This entails that the financial management unit must be
transformed into a strategic partner, and that it be allowed to exert stronger influence in the operation
of the agency. That way, it can help shape outcome of projects and programs, which traditionally were
the domain of planning and program units.

It was argued in the workshop that one of the most effective ways of linking these systems reforms
was through ICT. A caveat was, however, raised on the nature of ICT as a tool, whose results may
look good only on paper. The point about the holistic approach, therefore, still holds. The menu of
recommendations that the workshop provided appears to offer such holistic approach:

         Promote capacity development on procurement from top management down to the staff level;
         Integrate systems on IT across procurement, planning and financial management;
         Link/synchronize the procurement plan with the planning and budgeting;
         Conduct supplier orientation and development program;
         Dialogue with Congressmen on projects from the procurement down to the implementation of
         the projects;
         Reduce payment delays to encourage bidder participation; cut processing of payment from
         one month to a shorter period through bi-monthly submissions;
         Implement E-NGAS and integrate other features of E-NGAS with the existing system;
         Advocate for Finance Managers to support FM in their own agency;
         Create Customized Users Manual for Procurement and Financial Management per agency;
         and
         Enhance compliance of LGUs to RA9184 through their usage of their procurement manual.

The major constraints identified include budgetary, human resource and time constraints as well as
particularistic interests.

Sustainability and Institutionalization

The implementing agencies were looking beyond SEMP2. They had to confront the challenges of
sustaining the accomplishments in service delivery and the best practices in systems improvement.
DOH's blueprint for sustainability was enshrined in the program "FOURmula One (F1) for Health" It
integrated the same SEMP components of (1) health outcomes and (2) health systems performance,
with service delivery as a pillar of the first component, and good governance plus health regulations as
pillars of the second.

For DSWD, the way to sustain the gains was through the localization of the programs. This meant the
transfer of administration and management (including fund sourcing) of the programs to the LGUs
and the communities themselves. LGUs, for instance, had been assuming the implementation of
CIDSS.

DepEd, on the other hand, has sustained the gains of textbook procurement through the adoption of
the Textbook Count in the Department's regular program. The practice of proper coordination with
DPWH on the monitoring and inspection of school buildings had also been galvanized by the joint
memorandum. Finally, DepEd Order 59, series of 2007, manifested the Department's commitment to
the institutionalization of citizen's participation in procurement monitoring.

By and large, the workshop emphasized the need for continued partnership-building and public
advocacy to promote sustainability. The established network of support for the systems reforms and
development interventions that started through SEMP, admittedly, still had a long way to go and
should continue to reinvent and recalibrate itself to address new challenges. Sustainability approaches
would be needed until the gains of the program had finally made evident impact on poverty reduction
and growth.

Annex 7: Summary of "Impact Study on the Localization of CIDSS"

As provided for in Executive Order No. 443 of 1997, the implementation of the Comprehensive
and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS) Project was designed to be turned-over to the
local government units within a 5-year period. Specifically, the turn-over involved the adoption
of the CIDSS strategies, components and structures by the local government units as part of their
response to address poverty in their localities.

In anticipation of the full phase of CIDSS in 2004 and its integration with the new KALAHI-
CIDSS Project, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) undertook a study
to determine the impact of the CIDSS localization in terms of the following aspects:

        · Level of access to social services
        · Level of empowerment among families and communities in terms of their capacity
             for self-governance, specifically in undertaking collective problem-solving as well as
             broadened control over productive assets;
        · Quality of governance in terms of adoption and management of CIDSS concepts and
             principles
        · Effectiveness of DSWD in preparing the local government units and the communities
             for the localization of CIDSS Project

The Study covered a sample of 30 municipalities where CIDSS was localized 3-4 years after its
localization at the time of the evaluation (17 municipalities started CIDSS implementation in
1994/95 and localized in 1999; and 13 started CIDSS implementation in 1996/97 and localized in
2000).

On the overall, the Study revealed that the localization of CIDSS was successful as indicated by
continued reduction of unmet needs as well as the continuing strong commitment of the LGUs to
apply the prescribed principles and procedures of the Project. The continuity of CIDSS were
mainly attributed to the participation of the communities in the identification of their needs, using
the MBN as major information tool; planning out and implementing the solutions; and the
partnership with various agencies as well as with the LGU. The Study also recognized though
that continuation of CIDSS is constrained by the changes in LGU leadership and staff.

Highlights of the findings were as follows:

Impact on Poverty Reduction

Based on the tracking of the results of the Minimum Basic Needs (MBN) surveys conducted
during three periods (i.e., the baseline year, the localization year and the latest year), a
progressive reduction in percentage of households with unmet needs was registered in the sample
municipalities across the island groups of Luzon, Bicol-Visayas and Mindanao. The Study
further noted that the MBN was a useful tool for the community to analyze their level of needs
and identify priority projects/beneficiaries.




                                                   56

Impact on Accessibility to Social Services and Community Resource Mobilization

The Study reported the improved physical, financial and institutional access to social services
which was attributed to the community leaders' confidence and capability as developed through
their participation in CIDSS. The findings also noted that the provision of social services
involved resource sharing arrangements among the national government agencies, LGUs, non-
government organizations and business groups. Moreover, there were manifestations of self-help
as the communities undertook simple projects such as primary health care, home sanitation and
environmental projects.

Impact on Empowerment

Communities continued to organize community welfare structures (CWS) as a venue to plan
actions and access support that will address their needs. The Study also reported of the
community members' pride regarding their democratic/participatory decision-making that is
responsive to their needs and reflective of their desires as well as regarding their practices on fund
management which they learned from CIDSS.

Quality of Governance

The Survey respondents registered awareness of the key CIDSS concepts related to community
organization, total family approach, focused targeting and convergence. The continued
application of these concepts manifested through the implementation of LGU projects through the
CWS; updating of the MBN; updating of the community development plans; and monitoring
activities on CIDSS.

Effectiveness of DSWD Assistance in Preparing LGUs for Localization

The Study raised the need for the DSWD to be flexible in its operational policies on localization
with due consideration to the preparedness of the municipalities to implement CIDSS particularly
with regard the LGU's financial capacity. Related to this, the Study recommended that DSWD
maintains a Special Fund to continue supporting LGUs in implementing its localized CIDSS,
particularly for innovative initiatives. Likewise, continued technical assistance from DSWD as
well as from other national government agencies was recommended.

The major recommendations forwarded by the Study were as follows:
         ·       MBN approach be continued as monitoring tool;
         ·       Issuance of policy instrument to strengthen resource sharing to enhance
                 community access to basic services;
         ·       Continued technical assistance/training for the CWS to achieve status as true
                 peoples' organization that can undertake advocacy
         ·       Issuance of LGU policy, recognizing CWS;
         ·       Issuance of national policy to encourage LGUs to deploy more workers to the
                 community;
         ·       Continued training for LGU staff on CIDSS concepts and procedures as well as
                 their application/integration not only in local social welfare offices but in the
                 management and planning processes for local programs and projects;




                                                  57

·  Enhancement of operational guidelines on CIDSS localization, taking into
   consideration the level of preparedness of the LGUs, particularly with regard
   financial capability;
·  Setting up of Special Fund by DSWD to continue supporting innovative LGU
   projects;
·  Adoption of the CIDSS processes by all national departments with primary
   services that address the MBNs

Annex 8: School Building Program (SBP) ­ summary of evaluation findings

Construction Cost and Quality

A comparative review of the school's experience in the implementation of the DepEd and DPWH
school building program and an analysis on the SBRMS experience was conducted as a part of
the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report of the SEMP2.

The review had three objectives namely, to compare and analyze the implementation of the
DepEd and DPWH school building program in terms of cost effectiveness, timeliness, and quality
of construction, to assess the quality of execution of the SBRMS grants and the extent to which it
contributed to improve maintenance of school facilities and physical improvements in the school
infrastructure, and to assess impact of the Principal-led approach to the implementation of the
school building projects.

The 23 schools visited were located in Pangasinan (Region I), Cebu (Region VII), and Davao
City (Region XI). Nineteen schools covered for the school building component were comprised
of nine single storey buildings with 7m x 9m classroom size, six two storey buildings with 7m x
9m classrooms, five single storey buildings with 7m x 7m classrooms, and three of the schools
have repair/rehabilitation works. For the SBRMS component, 15 recipient schools were visited.
The total project cost for all 23 schools inspected is Php 27,333,066.37.

The review involved physical inspection of the school buildings selected in collaboration with
DepEd and DPWH, photo-documentation, a short interview with school principal and teachers,
and analysis of the contract documents available.

Twenty four (24) out of the 25 school buildings inspected that were implemented by DepEd and
DPWH were all completed and found in generally good condition. All the fifteen (15) schools
visited that received a Php10,000 grant from the SEMP2 have complied with the project
guidelines and were all eligible for reimbursement by the project.

DepEd and DPWH followed a common set of standard designs for single storey and multi-storey
school buildings thus resulting in uniformity of appearance of school buildings. However, despite
the prescribed classroom dimension by DepEd which is 7mx9m particularly for secondary
schools, the DPWH constructed 7mx7m sized classrooms in secondary schools.

In terms of quality of workmanship, the DepEd implemented school building projects are
relatively better than those completed by DPWH. Although total quality management is the
responsibility of the contractor, the degree of monitoring has a significant impact on the quality of
works accomplished. Hence the involvement of the principal and stakeholders in the supervision
of construction works helped ensure quality output and the contractor's adherence to the
approved program of works.

All the 25 school building projects inspected are well within the original prescribed budget of the
Department of Education per standard design. DepEd implemented SBPs have a lower average
spending per classroom for a single-storey school building with an average cost of
PHP387,929.32 for 7m x 9m classroom as compared to DPWH implemented school buildings
with an average cost of Php404,060.49 for a 7m x 9m classroom.




                                                 59

Cost-wise, school building projects constructed by DepEd are relatively cheaper than those
constructed by DPWH in terms of completeness of school building facilities, and better quality.
DepEd is able to construct more with the same amount of money than DPWH.

Of the 15 school buildings with available information on project duration, three were completed
on time, four were completed ahead of schedule, while seven were delayed in completion, and
one was left uncompleted for almost a year now since start of construction.

DepEd-implemented school building projects are relatively completed earlier compared to
DPWH-implemented projects. Six of the seven school buildings that have an on-time or earlier
completion dates are all DepEd Principal-led implemented.

All of the school principals and teachers interviewed said that the PHP10,000 grant they received
was not sufficient to repair the urgent and priority needs of the schools. Most of the interviewee
also commented on the extensive documentation requirements and requested that it be further
simplified.

The SBRMS grants, though small in amount, have significantly contributed to improving the
condition of school facilities. It helped generated additional financial support from the
community. The grant, however, was not sufficient to fund the major repair and rehabilitation
needs of the schools hence projects that were implemented were only those that would fit in the
PHP10,000 budget.

The Principals who were interviewed generally expressed their satisfaction with the principal-led
mode of implementation and preferred that all SBPs be done in this mode.

Greater transparency and accountability is evident in principal-led school building projects. The
school heads can clearly exercise their managerial functions in overseeing the construction works
in their schools. The principal-led SBP can be expected to reduce irregularities since the school
heads being the end users of these facilities have a greater stake in ensuring the qualities of
construction works.

The principal is also instrumental in mobilizing the community to participate in school
improvement activities such as maintenance, minor repairs and security. The school-community
partnership is very important to ensure successful implementation of projects and the delivery of
the school's objectives.

Expenditure Review

A review of the expenditure for school-based repairs and maintenance scheme (SBRMS) under
the Second Social Expenditure Program (SEMP 2) was made to bring into light the following: 1)
the reasons why some transactions were ineligible for bank financing; and 2) the factors that
contributed to the low utilization of the funds provided for this loan category. In summary, the
reasons why there was so much repair and maintenance expenditure that were adjudged ineligible
for reimbursement from the loan are as follows:

    1. The regional office implemented PHP200,935,582.90 worth of repairs and maintenance
         projects before the issuance of the new guidelines.

         Most of the projects would have qualified in the list of works allowed but the mere fact it
         was implemented by the regional office made it ineligible. The regional office was


                                                  60

        acting on the basis of previously allowed practice allowed practice in SEMP 1 (a big part
        of these projects were carried over from SEMP)1. Moreover, the regional office had a
        higher limit for entering into contracts so the transactions it entered into were more than
        the cap of PHP10,000 per school. This fact also made these transactions ineligible.

        In addition, the regional office used funds to repair the facilities of regional offices like
        the Regional Education Learning Center (RELC). These again are not eligible for
        reimbursement. This led DepEd to put a cap of 20% of budget for repairs and
        maintenance that regions and divisions may use for purposes other than teaching related
        so that 80% will be available for school repairs and maintenance reimbursable under
        SEMP 2.

    2. Included in the amount of Php140,712,306.61 worth of repairs and maintenance projects
        were those implemented by division offices before the issuance of the new guidelines and
        those implemented by schools but with incomplete documentation.

        Like the regional office, the projects implemented by the division would have qualified
        in the list of works allowed but these were not implemented by the principal so they are
        not eligible for reimbursement as well. The division was acting on the basis of previous
        guideline as the new guidelines were still not issued. Also, most of these projects were
        carried over from SEMP 1.

        The division also used funds to repair division office facilities and these do not qualify
        for reimbursement. These also include some funds used to repair non-teaching rooms as
        the principal's office or the PTCA room, etc., which also are not eligible for bank
        financing. (Please see samples of this highlighted in Attachment D-2.)

        Included in this group are some SBRMS projects implemented by schools which would
        qualify for reimbursement but have incomplete documentation so they could not be
        included in the SOEs yet. Part of the problem was due to the movement of school heads
        that delayed liquidation of cash advances for SBRMS.

In general, it was determined that the main reason for the ineligibility for bank financing of repair
and maintenance transactions done early in the project life was because these were implemented
by regional and division offices continuing the previous practice allowed before SEMP 2. Late
release of the guidelines for SBRMS compounded this problem.

Meanwhile, the reasons for the low utilization of SBRMS funds have been identified as follows:

        1. Late release of the guidelines for SBRMS contributed to the low utilization of
             SBRMS funds.

              Early in the life of SEMP 2 regional and division offices continued to implement
              repairs and maintenance for schools following previously allowed practice using
              one-third of the total budget for the purpose over the life of the project. These
              transactions are ineligible for bank financing. Implementation of SBRMS following
              the new guidelines was actually done one-year late due to the late release of the
              guidelines.




                                                  61

         2. The enormity of the DepEd organization slows down delivery of essential
            communication, e.g., changes in policy, and reduces the ability of DepEd personnel
            to monitor implementation of SBRMS.

             The new guidelines for SBRMS and the reports that had to be made thereafter had to
             be coursed through several levels of the organization and this delayed delivery
             slowing down the process. This is compounded by the dearth of finance staff at the
             division level to follow-up on liquidation of cash advances of principals
             implementing SBRMS. Likewise, essential skills in handling funds for principal
             grantees was wanting as not all were given the benefit of training.

         3. DBM apparently underestimated the ability of DepEd to produce SBRMS SOEs
            eligible for bank financing as indicated by the drastic reduction in the fund allocation
            for the purpose.

            There is an apparent underestimation by DBM as the PMO of the actual need of
            DepEd as one of the implementing agencies of SEMP 2, particularly in the fund
            allocation that DepEd can realistically utilize for SBRMS. As a result, not all SOEs
            eligible for bank financing were used and the level of utilization of this allocation
            was only at 45% when it could have been at 64%.

In summation, low utilization of SBRMS funds resulted from delays in the release of new
guidelines that led to ineligible repairs and maintenance transactions. DepEd management
apparently took too long to release the department memorandum governing the implementation of
SBRMS. The subsequent amendment provided in a department order was also released late. The
size of the DepEd bureaucracy added to the delay. Finally, DBM also contributed to the low
drawdown as it exercised discretion to reduce the allocation for SBRMS and not to use all
SBRMS SOEs eligible for bank financing submitted by DepEd within the deadline set.

Annex 9. Experience and lessons from textbook procurement and distribution

Prior to 1999, the public schools had been experiencing acute shortages of textbooks and other
learning materials, with a textbook-pupil ratio of as low as 1 textbook per 8 students. The
problem was not only rooted in the inadequacy of the budget to finance procurement and delivery
of these textbooks but also rampant corruption and inefficiencies that had plagued government
textbook procurement for decades. A Social Weather Stations survey in September 1999 ranked
the then Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) as the sixth most corrupt
government agency, because of the blatant and highly complex cheating in its purchases of
educational materials, especially textbooks and supplementary materials. An investigative report
by Yvonne Chua of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) in 1999 concluded
that government textbook procurement was subject to significant corruption and collusion by a
small number of local suppliers, and estimated that payoffs to corrupt officials in government
represented 15 to 30 percent of the cost of textbook contracts.

Since 1999, however, the succeeding Secretaries of the Department of Education have developed
and implemented wide-ranging reforms in textbook procurement. In July 2004, DepEd issued its
new Textbook Policy through DepEd Memo No. 289, which sought to strengthen upstream
quality and cost-effectiveness in the textbook evaluation and procurement process, as well as
downstream distribution issues. Consistent with this new policy, the textbooks financed under
the WB-assisted First and Second Social Expenditure Management Projects (SEMP 1 and 2) and
the Third Elementary Education Project were acquired through international competitive bidding.
Through increasing the transparency and competition during textbook procurement, the
Government was able to lower the cost of textbooks by at least 46%, improve physical quality in
terms of paper, body and cover, thus ensuring longer textbook life; and realizing significant
cumulative savings to an estimated US$125 million (US$153 million if adjusting for inflation
(see Annex 3).

The strong involvement of at least 36 civil society organizations in textbook procurement,
delivery and distribution have ensured timely distribution of textbooks to the 42,000 public
schools nationwide, thus, enabling the almost reaching of the desired national average of 1:1
textbook-pupil ratio. A four-stage content evaluation process of different specialists was put in
place starting December 2005. The initial gains from the implementation of procurement reforms
have also earned international recognition for the Philippines, including the recent citation by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ­ Development Assistance Committee
(OECD-DAC) on the successful reforms in textbook procurement. The independent conclusions
of OECD-DAC procurement specialists deserve to be quoted in detail:

        "In the 1990s, corruption was rampant in the Department of Education in the Philippines.
        The Department was unable to deliver the most basic services to its 18 million public
        school students. Unqualified bidders were overpricing their school text books and
        corrupt officials were awarding them contracts to deliver books which seldom arrived at
        schools. In 2001 a new government decided to fight corruption and reform the way
        textbooks were ordered and delivered. The `Textbook Count 1-2-3' project made sure
        that every text book was accounted for and delivered. NGOs, parents, Boy Scouts and
        Girl Guides were all involved, including the Coca Cola company who agreed to deliver
        textbooks for free in their trunks when delivering soft drinks to remote areas."
        (Development Assistance Committee, Organization for Economic Cooperation and
        Development (OECD/DAC), "Why is Procurement Important?" Factsheet, December
        2006).


                                                 63

The gains were not without challenges and resistance, most recent of which were the procurement
protests and cases filed by the losing bidders in the latter half of 2006 against the Philippine
Government on the awarding of contracts for Social Studies textbooks financed by SEMP 2.
Allegations included the winning bidders have engaged in collusion, and that the government has
favored certain bidders during the procurement process. These allegations were repeatedly aired
in the electronic and print media by the losing bidders, including making direct and indirect
accusation of corruption against the winning bidders, DepEd officials, and even World Bank staff.

The Philippine Government is responsible for implementation, including all procurement (from
the bidding, evaluation, and awarding of contracts) on projects financed by WB loans, such as
SEMP 2. It is the World Bank's responsibility, however, to review implementation, including
procurement, to ensure that funds are used for the intended purpose and that the agreed
procurement procedures as stated in the Loan Agreement are strictly followed. In response to the
protest registered by the losing bidders, the World Bank's Regional Procurement Advisor and
Head of the Legal Procurement department reviewed the procurement complaints relative to the
Social Studies textbook procurement. On the basis of this review, it was found that the
suppliers' complaints were without merit and that the awards were made in accordance
with the applicable guidelines for procurement under WB financing and with the provisions
of the legal agreement for the SEMP 2 project. The losing bidders were informed as such in
writing. Further complaints were lodged against the winning bidders and against World Bank
team members with the World Bank's Department of Institutional Integrity (INT), which is
responsible for investigating all allegations of corruption involving Bank-financed projects or
staff. INT reviewed the accusations according to its procedures and found insufficient basis to
warrant further investigation.

Following the dismissal of the procurement complaints filed with the World Bank, the losing
bidders sought a Restraining Order (RO) against the delivery of the final order of textbooks. A
lower court granted the RO ­ which resulted in further delays of textbook distribution ­ but, on
appeal by way of certiorari, the Philippines' Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Government
and overturned the RO in March 2007. In doing so, the Supreme Court both affirmed the
applicability of World Bank procurement procedures as stated in the project legal agreement, and
sent a strong message of support for ensuring the integrity of the procurement process in the
government, in particular in the Department of Education.

Thus, the legal and procedural challenges lodged against the social studies textbook procurement
process were thoroughly review and rejected. Moreover, typically, companies collude in order to
obtain a higher price for the procured goods (the situation that prevailed prior to the SEMP1 and
2, according to both the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and OECD-DAC). But as
noted above and detailed in Annex 3, the introduction of international competitive bidding (ICB)
under the SEMP projects drove down the cost of textbooks by nearly 50 percent. Furthermore,
much of the complaints and legal challenges against the procurement awards under SEMP2 were
based on efforts to disqualify or otherwise exclude firms that had submitted the lowest responsive
bids. Had these efforts succeeded, the result would have been less competition and higher prices.

Remarkably, there continues to be efforts in the Philippine media and through the political
process to assert that a "textbook scandal" transpired, even as the project was financed by SEMP2.
Efforts are also underway to seek repeals or reforms of key elements of the national procurement
law. The need to sustain and strengthen procurement reforms therefore, has become an

procurement reform within and outside of government, will also need to be mobilized to ensure
that further reforms or legislative changes will strengthen--rather than weaken--transparency
and efficiency gains from the Philippines procurement reform process.
