enhancing performance, and governance in the\n            three social sector departments - Education, Health, and\n            Social Welfare - which also includes the school building\n            program, and the provision of quality inputs to such\n            services. The components will: 1) strengthen key budgetary\n            programs, covering the provision of educational inputs\n            (textbooks, classrooms, and repairs/maintenance of existing\n            schools); provision of public health services, through the\n            procurement of drugs, vaccines, and supplies for effective\n            public health programs (tuberculosis control, expanded\n            immunization programs, and rabies' prevention and\n            control); and, provision of social services through the\n            comprehensive integrated delivery of social services\n            (CIDSS), an activity centered in poor municipalities to\n            accelerate basic services (water supply and sanitation,\n            drainage systems, and waste disposal); 2) provide technical\n            assistance (TA), and training to implement financial\n            management systems, procurement, and information technology\n            improvement programs. Furthermore, teacher deployment and\n            human resources planning will be implemented under an\n            improved allocation system, targeting teachers to the most\n            needy schools. And, and action plan will improve the Bureau\n            of Food and Drugs, by strengthening capacities, for improved\n            standards; and, 3) provide TA and training to strengthen\n            transparency and accountability of the budget process."}, "docdt": "2002-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
