"The objectives of the Second\n            Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy\n            Loan Program for Guatemala are: i) maintain fiscal space for\n            priority spending through tax policy and tax administration\n            reforms; ii) improve governance and transparency of public\n            financial management and expenditures; and iii) improve\n            access to finance and deepen financial markets through\n            reforms to the financial legal framework and public debt\n            management. The operation builds on the progress made under\n            the First Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL) and supports the country's strategic program to\n            strengthen Guatemala's capacity to grow and provide\n            adequate resources to reduce poverty and inequality.\n            Progress on critical reforms is being made, including\n            strengthening tax administration, promoting financial market\n            stability, improving monitoring and evaluation of the\n            country's new conditional cash transfer program,\n            modernizing customs processes, as well as enhancing\n            governance and transparency. In response to the global\n            crisis and economic slowdown, the Government has prioritized\n            its development plan on near term steps to mitigate the\n            impact of global crisis, including focusing efforts on\n            expanding its new conditional cash transfer program and\n            creating a task force to monitor the economic situation and\n            take policy actions, as needed, to respond to the crisis.\n            The Government has adjusted its reform program to reflect\n            additional actions and priorities, including reforms to\n            increase access to finance and address financial sector\n            stability, while other actions anticipated by the Government\n            prior to the crisis, particularly implementation of measures\n            to boost tax collections, have been delayed. Guatemala made\n            steady progress on the transparency and financial management\n            in recent years. The implementation of the integrated\n            financial management system (SIAF), which was built upon a\n            good normative framework and a modern technological\n            platform, contributed to efficiency in financial\n            transactions and the production of timely, transparent\n            information on most government finances."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
