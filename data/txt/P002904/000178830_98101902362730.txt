TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                Republic of Uganda
Amount:                  SDR 6.4 million (US$8.0 million) equivalent
Terms:                   Standard
Project Objectives
and Description:       The project would assist the Government in preparing
suitable development and rehabilitation projects and
in strengthening relevant ministries and agencies
in planning and project preparation. It would finance
technical assistance for prefeasibility and feasibil-
ity studies, rehabilitation and capacity utilization
studies, staffing of planning and project preparation
institutions, and training for project planning and
preparation.
The main risk facing the project involves possible
delays resulting from the technical weakness of the
Ministry of Planning and Economic Development. How-
ever, in view of the Bank Group's involvement in a
UNDP-financed technical assistance project which is
directed at the needs of this ministry, it was con-
cluded that this risk is being satisfactorily
addressed.
Estimated Costs:                                                         US$ Million

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
technical assistance credit to the Republic of Uganda for the equivalent
of SDR 6.4 million (US$8.0 million) on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Uganda was circulated in June 1969
(Report No. AE-2). Since 1971 there has been a hiatus in World Bank Group
operations in Uganda. However, after the change in Government in early 1979 a
number of missions have visited the country; their findings were incorporated
in the President's Report on the Reconstruction Credit (No. 983-UG) dated
January 29, 1980. After the last change of Government in early May two more
missions by Bank staff have visited Uganda; this report reflects their findings.
In addition, an analysis of the situation of the Ugandan economy and its
reconstruction needs was the subject of a report prepared by a team of experts
under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat. 1/
Background
3.        Uganda, which in 1970 had one of the highest per capita incomes in
Eastern Africa, experienced a decline in real GDP estimated at about 1% per
annum on average from the early 1970s through 1978. With population growth
averaging more than 3% per annum, per capita GNP fell by about 25%. The
decline was particularly severe in the modern sector, with the output of
monetary agriculture, manufacturing, mining and construction all having
fallen.  Only subsistence agriculture achieved some growth, as farmers turn?]
away from the production of export cash crops (principally coffee, tea,
cotton and tobacco) towards essential food crops. Real investment also fell
sharply during the 1970's.
4.        The decline in the modern sector of the economy was reflected in the
changing structure of output. In the early 1970s, about 70% of GDP originated
in the monetary economy; monetary agriculture accounted for some 24%; industry
11%; and modern tertiary sector activity about one-third. By 1978, it is
estimated that the share of subsistence agriculture had increased from 27% to
over one third and that the non-monetary economy accounted for nearly 40% of
GDP. The output declines were largely attributable to the sudden expropriation
of all foreign-owned business and the expulsion of Ugandans of Asian origin.

tion of the Economy of Uganda; two volumes, London, June 1975.

5.        The balance of payments situation was seriously affected by this
situation. From 1970-71 to 1978 both exports and imports fell by over 55%
in real terms. Uganda had formerly exported significant quantities of tea,
tobacco, sugar and cotton, but production of these cash crops declined
precipitously, leaving coffee as the only significant export crop. Coffee's
share in export receipts increased from 53% in 1971 to over 90% in 1978,
despite a decline in official coffee exports from 175,000 tons in 1971 to
113,000 tons in 1978. The cumulative balance of payments deficit for the
period 1970-78 amounted to over US$130 million, of which some US$100 mil-
lion accumulated as unpaid arrears. Uganda experienced some respite from its
balance of payments problems during the coffee price boom of 1976-77 when
higher coffee export earnings permitted some relaxation of import controls:
for a relatively brief period the country was able to import vehicles, spare
parts, raw materials and consumer goods, and domestic manufacturing made
a mild recovery. However, with the decline in coffee prices in 1978 the
balance of Dayments again showed a large deficit.
6.        In addition to declines in the real value of exports and imports,
Uganda experienced a fall in net capital inflows. In 1971 and 1972, net
official capital inflows were approximately US$30 million per year; by 1978
they had declined to US$12 million, implying a much greater decline in real
terms. At the same time, outflows of short-term capital increased. However,
a corollary of the decreasing level of external assistance flows to Uganda
after 1971 was a correspondingly low level of external public debt; recorded
external public debt outstanding rose from US$210 million at the end of 1972 to
only US$270 million at the end of 1978. 1/ As a result, the ratio of Uganda's
debt service to export proceeds fell to 5% in 1978; however, if payment arrears
on external debt are added to debt service, this ratio would have been 8%.
7.        Despite the contracting real economy, the Government's budgetary
operations were strongly expansionist. Total expenditures increased from
UShs 1.9 billion in 1970/71 to UShs 5.2 billion in 1976/77, while revenues
only increased from UShs 1.3 billion to UShs 3.4 billion, and net foreign
borrowing actually decreased. Net domestic financing, almost entirely
through the banking system, rose from a little over UShs 0.35 billion in
1970/71 to UShs 1.6 billion in 1976/77.  This heavy deficit financing by the
Government was the major cause of the nearly six-fold increase in the money
supply between 1971 and 1978.  While the improvement in coffee prices boosted
Government revenues significantly and reduced the recourse to deficit financ-
ing in 1977/78, the deficit and Government borrowing from the banking system
both rose sharply again in 1978/79.
8.        Because of the severe shortfalls in domestic production and the
scarcity of imports, coupled with heavy Government deficit spending and
resultant monetary expansion, inflation was rampant. The official low-income
consumer price index (which may actually understate true price inflation) rose
1/   The W.orld Bank Group accounted for 21%9 of total debt outstanding at
the end of 1978, the USSR for 20%, and the UK for 12%.

at an average annual rate of 36% from 1970 to 1978. Despite this high infla-
tion rate the official minimum wage was increased only 54% over these years;
civil service salaries also fell sharply in real terms.
Recent Developments
9.        Since the liberation in early 1979, there has been little improve-
ment in Uganda's economic situation. Economic development in Uganda during
the past year has suffered from the unsettled political conditions of the
country. The constructive spirit present at the meeting of the UNLF in
Moshi in March of last year evaporated gradually as Governments changed;
the erosion of the political consensus progressively reduced the decision-
making capability of the Government. Maintenance of the law and order and
security continues to be a subject of great concern. The present administra-
tion is devoting particular attention to this issue and there is some evidence
that the security situation has improved since the last change of Government
in May. The economic prospects are similarly dependent to a large extent on
political developments. General elections are now scheduled to be held in
December. These elections would be the first since 1962 and, it is hoped,
will bring into power an administration that enjoys the broad popular support
necessary to carry on the important economic reform process.
10.       Production trends in 1979 have not been encouraging.  Agricultural
output declined over 4%, attributable in part to adverse weather conditions.
There may have been a slight increase in subsistence agricultural production
which however would be an indication of the continued disruptions in the
monetized sector of the economy. Output of the manufacturing sector has
stagnated; capacity utilization is estimated to have been about 20% on
average. A hopeful aspect was the arrival of the late but adequate rain
last spring which has eased the problem of food supplies, except for the
northern and northeastern regions which continued to depend on food shipments,
to alleviate famine conditions. Another hopeful aspect is the slow beginning
of the rehabilitation of important agricultural processing facilities which
promises to bring capacity utilization to higher levels.
11.       It was hoped that the UNLF Government would bring to a halt the
fiscal mismanagement of the Amin period. The 1979/80 budget, which was
finally presented to the National Consultive Council (NCC) on December 4,
1979, did imply a substantial improvement in fiscal performance. It promised
to hold the overall deficit to only UShs 1.4 billion, of which UShs 0.6 billion
was to be financed by the sale of government stocks outside the banking
sector. The provisional outturn for 1979/80 reveals a dismal picture, however.
Recurrent revenue fell UShs 632 million below the budget, while recurrent
expenditures exceeded the budgeted level by almost UShs 1.0 billion. While
development expenditures fell short of budget by UShs 640 million, foreign
grants and loans plus domestic development revenue experienced an even larger
shortfall of UShs 876 million. The result was a total deficit of UShs 3,186
million, almost 2 1/2 times the budgetary forecast, which had to be financed
entirely by borrowing from the Central Bank. At a time when output was
stagnating and imports declining, this monetary expansion was inflationary.



- 4 -
12.       Attempts to arrest price increases through administrative controls
have been largely ineffective. The black market or "magendo" economy has
continued to spread and pervades all areas of the economy. Unfortunately,
those few areas where price controls continue to be of some relevance happen
to be of crucial significance: salaries to Government and public sector
employees and prices paid to producers of Government-marketed export crops,
particularly coffee. Second jobs or illicit incomes are essential for
Government employees to survive. Coffee is being smuggled where possible
or else there is a tendency.to extend the cultivation of food crops, which
can be sold at free market prices, at the expense of coffee. The unofficial
exchange rate which ranges between 10 and 15 times the official parity of
the Ugandan shilling is perhaps the best indication of the prevailing dis-
tortions. A significant devaluation of the Ugandan shilling is essential
if the economy is to be brought back on a course of progressive rehabilita-
tion. The devaluation would have to be accompanied by appropriate increases
in producer prices, effective measures to increase Government revenues,
improved control over Government spending, and appropriate adjustments in
the remuneration of public sector employees.
13.       Political considerations, mainly concern over the possible impact
of significant policy changes on the outcome of the pending elections, have
so far kept the Government from taking long overdue economic policy decisions.
The budget for 1980/81 does not attempt to deal with the critical issues of
resource mobilization and expenditure control. Large increases are projected
in recurrent revenues (50%), primarily in sales taxes and in customs and
excise revenues, and in external loans and grants (60% above the 1979/80
budget and more than five times the 1979/80 actual). However, little in the
way of additional revenue measures is proposed; rather the revenue forecast
relies entirely on a significant revival of the economy which is not likely
without more determined management efforts by the Government. The expenditure
side of the budget implies that the increase over 1979/80 actuals will be held
to 16%. However, expenditure estimates do not make any provision for public
sector wage and salary increases which could add UShs 300 to 400 million. The
level of development spending, projected to be double the 1979/80 actual
figure, is obviously dependent on the availability of aid; if aid is not
forthcoming, the major part of the proposed public investment cannot be
covered. The 1980/81 budget was prepared on short notice, with little
analysis of the underlying economic situation, with little study of revenue
prospects, and without the careful review of priorities that would be essen-
tial if the reconstruction effort is to make a real beginning in 1980/81.
As yet little effort has been devoted to dealing with the weaknesses in tax
administration and expenditure control along the lines of the recommenda-
tions made by IMF and Bank missions.
14.       In 1979, the exports increased by 19% over 1978 because both coffee
export volume and price went up in the second half of the calendar year.
Revenues were 30% higher for the year than had been forecast last September.
The cautious attitude of the Bank of Uganda in allocating foreign exchange
and the disruption of trade by the war during the first half of the year
contributed to a decline in import values of 11% from the already low 1978



- 5 -
level, equivalent to at least 20% in real terms (compared to 1977, the decline
was 30% in nominal terms and 50% in real terms). The level of 1979 imports
was nowhere near the UShs 6.0 billion of imports which the Commonwealth Report
indicated were essential for the first phase of the reconstruction period.
While the growth of exports and especially the tight restrictions on imports
brought about n large trade surplus, there was a very large deficit on capital
account attributable mainly to large repayments of short-term trade credits.
15.       For 1980, the Bank of Uganda has produced a slightly more optimistic
forecast. Export receipts are expected to increase only marginally over 1979,
with no significant improvement in non-coffee exports such as cotton, tea,
tobacco, copper or hides and skins. However, the Bank of Uganda is anticipat-
ing a substantial increase in nominal imports over the depressed levels of
1978 and 1979, about back to the 1977 level.
16.       Gross aid disbursements in 1979 totalled only US$50.0 million equiva-
lent, consisting of US$31.0 million in the form of grants and US$19.0 million in
the form of loans. Net aid disbursements amounted to a mere US$25.0 million
equivalent. The Bank of Uganda is projecting gross capital inflows of US$290.0
million for 1980, including US$50.0 million of private commercial loans and
investments. This figure would seem optimistic; total gross disbursements in
the current calendar year are not likely to be much above US$100.0 million
equivalent. However, this figure does not include emergency food aid which
will probably amount to an additional US$20.0-25.0 million.
17.       Commitments of foreign assistance have fallen short of earlier
expectations, the effective transfer of external assistance has been clearly
disappointing and far short of even the most elementary requirements asso-
ciated with the reconstruction process. Uncertainty about the political
situation has discouraged many donors from extending commitments and caused
some to suspend the use of credits extended earlier although some of the
development assistance allocated to Uganda was diverted to meet the urgent
requirements for humanitarian assistance in the Karamoja region. However,
the dramatic shortfall in aid disbursements is not only a reflection of
shortfalls in commitments, but is also due to the fact that the Government
of Uganda had considerable problems absorbing available assistance effec-
tively. Weaknesses of the planning machinery and the Government administra-
tion and the shortage of well prepared projects had much to do with this.
18.       The Government of Uganda last year adopted a two-phase strategy
to revive the economy. The first phase was designed to restore the production
and sale through official channels of export cash crops (coffee, cotton, tea
and tobacco) and re-establish vital Government services. The second phase
covered a medium-term investment program directed at the rehabilitation of
key productive sectors and the country's infrastructure to the level which
prevailed in 1970. While the Government is still struggling with the first
phase of this strategy and further progress would seem dependent on Government
decisions in the exchange rate, fiscal, and price administration areas, the
rehabilitation of critical productive facilities has made a slow beginning.
Investment programs have been developed for the restoration of productive



- 6 -
capacity of those sectors which provide significant foreign exchange earnings
or savings, such as coffee, tea, sugar and cotton output and processing.
Technical assistance has been provided in some cases through joint ventures
or management contracts with experienced international firms. The gradual
restoration of output levels should in due course provide some relief both
to the balance of payments and to the budget. It is now important to rein-
force and extend these efforts into other areas of the economy, including
the rehabilitation of the country's infrastructure. This will require
strengthening the Government's planning capability to take on the preparation
of specific proposals in a more systematic fashion.
19.       Notwithstanding the lack of well-prepared projects, it is obvious
that the severe shortage of foreign exchange resources is seriously affecting
the reconstruction program. Even under the most optimistic assumptions,
imports in 1980 will be far below the requirements for even the first six-
month phase of the reconstruction process identified by the Commonwealth
team; they would be more than UShs 1.0 billion below the minimum requirements
estimated at the time of the appraisal of the Reconstruction Credit presented
to the Executive Directors last January. It is to be hoped that the pending
elections will dispel the present political uncertainty and thus lead to
larger aid flows to facilitate the necessary step-up of reconstruction
activities and investments.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
20.       Bank Group operations in Uganda began with an IBRD loan of US$8.4
million for hydroelectric power development in 1961. Between 1967 and 1971
Uganda received seven IDA credits totalling US$42.6 million for projects
in education, roads and agriculture (tea, tobacco and beef ranching). In
addition, Uganda has benefitted from ten loans totalling US$244.8 million
which have been extended for the development of the common services and
development bank operated jointly by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda through their
association in the former East African Community (EAC). IFC's only investment
in Uganda, in a textile company, was sold to the Government in 1970. Annex II
contains summary statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Uganda and the
EAC organizations as of August 31, 1980 and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
21.       There had been a hiatus in Bank Group operations in Uganda from
1971 until earlier this year, when a Reconstruction Credit of US$72.5 million
(including a participation of US$17.5 million by the Kingdom of the Netherlands)
and an EEC Special Action Credit of US$20.0 million were approved (Credits
No. 983-UG and 54-UG); the Association is also acting as Administrator of a
Can$ 3.0 million grant from the Government of Canada for the reconstruction
effort. Throughout the 1970's, the Bank Group continued to disburse funds
against prior loans and credits. At present, only two of those Bank Group
assisted projects, a road and an education project, are still under imple-
mentation. Completion of and final disbursement for the road project is



- 7 -
expected within the next month. The education project, which experienced
implementation problems even before the recent war, was adversely affected
by the fighting and subsequent looting (see Annex II for details).
22.       The Reconstruction Credit which was signed last April was declared
effective on May 1, 1980. Disbursements against the first tranche of the
credit have however not yet begun. Following the change in Government last
May, which was accompanied by a prolonged phase of uncertainty regarding the
focus of political power, the Government agreed not to submit any withdrawal
requests until we had had an opportunity to review jointly the prospects
for the implementation of the reconstruction program. We wished to assure
ourselves that the new Government would effectively carry on the reconstruction
program and confirm the undertakings entered into by the previous Government.
The Government of Uganda has acknowledged all past undertakings to the Bank
Group and confirmed its intentions to carry out the reconstruction program
described in the June 1979 Commonwealth report. We have recently agreed to
resume disbursements under the Credit and under the associated EEC Special
Action Credits and the Canadian grant initially up to a total amount of US$25.0
million equivalent. Given the prevailing economic dislocation, in particular
the pervasive black market, and given the Government-s unwillingness at this
time to introduce the necessary drastic reforms to bring the situation under
control, we agreed with the Government that the use of these funds would be
limited to specific items, which are clearly related to reconstruction projects
and whose ultimate application can thus be supervised. Progress of the
reconstruction program and the use of the Credit will be reviewed before the
end of December to determine the further use of the funds available under the
first tranche of the Credit.
23.       Following the liberation last year, the Bank Group began project
identification in a number of sectors with a view to establishing an active
project pipeline. Since an initial reconnaissance mission in July 1979,
particular efforts have been made to assess the basic constraints facing
the Government in the productive sectors and in transportation. Industrial,
agricultural and transport sector reconnaissance missions visited Uganda in
the course of last year as well as initial water supply, urban and education
missions. Project preparation is now in process in these various sectors and
should be further advanced through the proposed project.
East African Community
24.       Lending from the Bank Group to the EAC continued until 1976 when the
problems facing the Community made it impossible to continue lending within
that framework. After direct lending to Uganda stopped in 1971, Uganda con-
tinued to benefit directly from loans made to the EAC Corporations; a telecom-
munications project in 1973 and the East African Development Bank (EADB) in
1976. Uganda is also an indirect beneficiary of a 1972 EAC harbors loan,
although the proceeds of that loan are being disbursed entirely in Kenya
and Tanzania. Since October 1, 1977, all remaining balances under EAC loans,
with the exception of the EADB loan, have been disbursed on the basis of
separate national guarantees. Under the agreed allocation of undisbursed



- 8 -
balances for each loan, as approved by the Executive Directors, some US$2.0
million was allocated to Uganda for completion of projects in that country,
US$1.9 million for railways and US$0.1 million for telecommunications. These
amounts are now fully disbursed.
25.       The major developments affecting the EAC were outlined in a report
to the Executive Directors dated December 29, 1977 (R77-312) and more recent
developments were reported in a statement to the Executive Directors during
their meeting on May 6, 1980. The three former Partner States have employed
Dr. Victor Umbricht as an independent mediator to recommend disposition of
the assets and liabilities of the Community corporations and the General Fund
Services. Dr. Umbricht has visited East Africa on numerous occasions, has
employed consultants to assist in the appraisal of Community assets and
liabilities, and has in March 1980 made formal recommendations on the alloca-
tion of these assets and liabilities. The next step would be the start of
negotiations among the three Governments, based on the mediator's proposals.
Meanwhile, the Mediator's report and recommendations on the future structure
of the EADB have been accepted by the Partner States and the revised EADB
Charter along with the Treaty to enact the new Charter have been ratified by
the three Governments.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
26.       The priority of fast disbursing assistance and its critical role in
the Reconstruction Program was a central focus of the President's Report on
the Reconstruction Credit. It is critical that attention begins to be
directed towards the medium- and longer-term requirements of the rehabilita-
tion process. Such a focus would help to avoid some of the delays en-
countered in the initiation of the economic reconstruction. Probably the
most critical deficiency facing the Government will be the near total absence
of well prepared investment proposals. Reflecting the departure of many of
the trained civil servants and the limited commitment of the Amin regime to
development, the Government machinery for economic planning suffered consider-
able deterioration through the 1970's. Additionally, there is the difficult
task of rehabilitating existing projects which will require substantial
technical assistance. It is evident that if the country is to be successful
in its rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts and at the same time lay the
foundations for achieving rapid economic growth, the capacity of the Govern-
ment to prepare and manage rehabilitation and development projects will need
significant improvement.
27.       The availability of adequately prepared projects will be an impor-
tant factor in the Government's ability to attract external financial assis-
tance, as well as to effectively utilize such assistance. It will also
enable the Government to apply in the selection of projects, rational develop-
ment and rehabilitation priorities. Steps have been taken to strengthen
Uganda's institutions for economic planning. A Ministry of Planning and
Economic Development (MPED) has been reestablished to oversee and coordinate
development planning. Moreover, since MPED did not have sufficient influence



- 9 -
on determination of macro-economic and sectoral priorities when it existed as
a separate ministry in the past, the Government has given priority to strength-
ening MPED. To assist in this effort, the Bank Group, as executing agency
for a UNDP-financed planning project, is providing assistance to MPED in
staffing and training.
28.       A National Planning Commission was set up in October 1979,
consisting of various ministers with economic and social portfolios, with
a Secretariat in MPED. A National Manpower Council has also been proposed,
to take stock of available and potential Ugandan manpower and to reinstitute
manpower planning. Additionally, steps are being taken to recruit Ugandans
currently resident outside the country, with training and experience in eco-
nomic planning and project preparation. While these efforts are expected to
lead to significant improvements in planning and project preparation capacity,
there will still be a need for selective expatriate inputs. Given the lim-
ited financial resources of the Government it will require external financial
assistance to address these needs.
29.       A technical assistance project for project preparation and related
activities would be a suitable instrument for providing the Government with
some of the financial resources it needs to deal with the problems of a
limited pipeline of well prepared projects and weak planning and project
preparation capacity. Under such a project, the provision of technical
assistance funds would be quick and flexible for a broad range of activities,
supplementing what will be available from UNDP and bilateral sources.
Although no exact figures are yet available on their magnitude, these other
sources are expected to fall far short of Uganda's extensive needs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The need for financing technical assistance was first brought to the
attention of the Bank Group's reconnaissance mission visiting Uganda in July
1979. The project was prepared by the Government with the assistance of Bank
Group staff and appraised in December 1979. Negotiations were held in
Washington in April 1980; the Ugandan Delegation was headed by Mr. G. Nkojo,
Governor of the Bank of Uganda, and included representatives of MPED, the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice. A Credit and Project Summary
is at the front of this report and Annex III contains supplemental project
data.
Objectives and Description
31.       The project aims at assisting the Government of Uganda and its
agencies in preparing suitable development and rehabilitation projects for
financing by the Bank Group and other donor agencies, in completing capacity
utilization studies, in strengthening Ugandan institutions involved in
project preparation activities and in providing assistance in the implementa-
tion of such projects. It would comprise:



- 10 -
(a) about 480 manmonths of consulting services for preparing
pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for high priority
investments in both the directly productive and social
infrastructure sectors of the economy;
(b) about 120 manmonths of consulting services for preparing
rehabilitation studies and capacity utilization studies for
existing projects mainly, but not exclusively, in the indus-
trial, agricultural, transport and communications sectors;
(c) about 120 manmonths of external assistance for staffing of the
planning departments of ministries and other government agencies
with economists and other technical specialists for project
identification, preparation, and appraisal work;
(d) about 60 manmonths of external assistance in providing emer-
gency and short term managerial and technical staff for ope-
rating projects mainly, but not exclusively, in the industrial,
agricultural, transport and communications sectors; and
(e) training for Ugandans in project preparation, evaluation,
implementation and related techniques.
32.       Project funds from the credit would be allocated to specific sub-
projects by agreement between the Government and the Association. Realloca-
tions between categories of use, if necessary during project implementation
because of changing needs and priorities, would also be done by agreement
between the Government and the Association. It is expected that the project
funds would be committed in about three years.
Organization and Implementation
33.       Administration of the project would be provided by the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development (MPED). As noted above (para. 27), this
Ministry is responsible for coordinating all Government project selection work
and related development assistance; it is therefore in a position to have an
overview of needs and priorities both among and within sectors.
34.       In order to ensure that MPED has the capacity to (i) process sub-
project applications from potential users of the credit funds, (ii) communi-
cate with the Association on subprojects and disbursements, and (iii) follow
up on the implementation of approved subprojects, it has been agreed that a
project coordinator be appointed in MPED to oversee the implementation
of the project. A senior administrative officer would be designated as the
project coordinator (Section 3.04(b)(i) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement); an appointment to this post would be a condition of effectiveness
(Section 5.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). Terms of refer-
ence for the project coordinator are included in Annex IV, Part A of this
report.



- 11 -
35.       It would also be necessary to establish a framework for formally
reviewing requests for financing. The major element of the review process
would be a subproject review committee under MPED. It has been agreed that
this committee be chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MPED (or his designated
representative) and that it includes as members the Secretary of the Treasury
(or his designate), the Chief Government Development Economist of MPED, and
at least four officials from other ministries and parastatals (Section 3.02(c)
of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The terms of reference for this
committee are contained in Annex IV Part B of this Report; its creation would
be a condition of effectiveness of the credit (Section 5.01(a) of the
draft Development Credit Agreement).
36.       Subproject processing procedures are reviewed in detail in Annex
IV, Part C of this report. Subproject requests, which would include requests
for funds for consultant studies, expatriate staff or training, would origin-
ate in Government ministries, parastatals, other Government agencies or the
private sector and be submitted to the project coordinator. In their submis-
sions, the relevant organizations would be required to justify their proposals
and address the various items raised in the procedures. For studies, this
would include draft terms of reference, estimated costs, other potential
sources of financing, a short list of consultants and proposals, if any, for
cost recovery. For expatriate staff, this would include a draft job description,
estimated costs, other potential sources of financing and the proposed timing.
For training, it would include the proposed candidate, details on the location
of the training, cost estimates, other possible sources of financing and the
proposed timing.
37.       The review of these requests would be undertaken by the technical
staff of MPED (Section 3.02(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). It
is anticipated that most of the required background analysis would be done by
the economists of the sectoral planning department of MPED, who are organized
and specialized by subsectors. Where the expertise of staff in other minis-
tries or agencies is needed, the project coordinator would arrange for their
participation in the review process, and ad hoc working parties would be
formed to undertake the work. The conclusions of the review would be summa-
rized in an evaluation report. Since the technical capability of MPED is
being upgraded under the UNDP/IBRD financed planning assistance project (para.
27), it is felt that there is no need to provide additional long term techni-
cal staff to administer this project. However, the UNDP financed experts in
MPED would be available as needed to assist in implementing this project
(Section 3.04(b)(ii) of the draft Development Credit Agreement), and the
appointment of the Chief Technical Advisor under the UNDP project (or suit-
able equivalent arrangements) would be a condition of effectiveness of this
credit (Section 5.01(c) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
38.       Upon receipt of the technical staff evaluation, the subproject
review committee would act on the recommendations contained therein; it
would approve, reject or recommend modifications of all proposals. For
all subprojects (except for training subprojects) estimated to cost above the



- 12 -
free limit of US$10,000, its decisions would be subject to review and final
approval by the Association; the aggregate free limit would be US$200,000
(Section 3.02(d) and (e) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
39.       Approved subprojects would be implemented by the ministry, depart-
ment, parastatal or other public or private organization that proposed them.
These organizations would be required to adhere to the general framework of
the proposals as approved, provide whatever documentation is required for
withdrawal requests, monitor performance in executing the subproject and make
available all relevant information to MPED (Section 3.02(f) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement). The Government would assign a qualified local
counterpart to each individual expert hired under the project component
involving staffing (para. 31) above and Section 3.05 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Costs and Financing
40.       The estimated foreign exchange cost of the various categories of
activities to be financed from the credit funds would be:
US$ Million
-  prefeasibility and feasibility studies                    4.3
- rehabilitation and capacity utilization
studies                                                 1.1
- technical assistance for strengthening
planning and project preparation
institutions                                            1.1
- short term management and technical
assistance for existing projects                        0.5
-  training                                                  1.0
8.0
41.       The costs for studies and technical assistance consist largely of
consulting services, but also include allowances for financing of the needed
imported equipment (estimated at 10% of consulting costs) needed to facilitate
the work of consultants. The estimated average cost/month for consultants for
studies, technical assistance, etc. (including salary, international travel,
and subsistence) is approximately US$8,000. The training costs are for
fellowships. In addition to the costs reviewed above, there would be the
costs of providing counterpart staff, office space and secretarial facilities.
These would be borne by the Government and the implementing agencies on a
subproject by subproject basis. While it is difficult to estimate such local
costs in advance, since the needs will vary greatly from subproject to sub-
project, it is expected that they would amount to about 25% of the total cost
of the various subprojects.



- 13 -
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       Consultants and experts hired under the project would be qualified
and experienced and would be hired under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association; they would be selected from short lists to be approved in
advance by the Association (Section 3.03(a) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). Contracts for expendable and nonexpendable equipment are not
expected to attract international interest and would therefore be let through
competitive bidding in accordance with normal Government procedures (Section
3.06 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). These procedures have been
reviewed by the Association and found satisfactory: all Government purchases
exceeding UShs 10,000 for any single ministry in any financial year and
contracts for services or civil works exceeding UShs 25,000 for any ministry
in any year must be approved by the Central Tender Board under the Ministry of
Finance; the procedures require either competitive bidding or submission of
not less than three quotations from different suppliers.
43.       The credit would be disbursed against 100% of the foreign exchange
costs and 90% of the local costs of consultants, internationally recruited
staff and related vehicles and equipment, and 100% of the costs of training.
As noted above, the Government would provide counterpart staff and local
facilities as required for subprojects.
Reporting
44.       MPED would maintain records adequate to record and monitor the
progress of each subproject and it would prepare a quarterly report on the
status of each subproject (Section 3.07(a) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). In addition, not later than 6 months after completion of the
project, the Government would prepare and furnish to the Association a comple-
tion report on the costs and benefits resulting from the project (Section
3.07(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). Finally, the MPED would
maintain separate accounts in respect to each subproject (Section 4.01 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
45.       The major benefit of the project would be the development of a
pipeline of rehabilitation and development projects suitable for financ-
ing by the Government, the Bank Group and other external agencies. As noted
above, the timely preparation of such projects would be critical to the
initiation of the medium- and long-term rehabilitation. Moreover, the
quality of the project proposals and the confirmation of their priority would
obviously be central to the success of the reconstruction effort as well as
the long term performance of the economy. The project would also play a
central role in the Government-s effort to revitalize its planning machinery.
In addition to providing funds for addressing any residual manpower needs in
MPED, the project would help ensure that this ministry reestablishes its
proper role in Uganda's new planning system. The main risk in implementing
the project arises out of possible delays in strengthening the technical



- 14 -
capability of MPED because of delays in recruiting the UNDP-financed experts.
However, since the Bank Group is involved as executing agency for that
project, the risk is viewed as acceptable.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Uganda
and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
47.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex
III to this report. Conditions of effectiveness of the Credit Agreement
include: (i) the appointment of a project coordinator in MPED; (ii) estab-
lishment of a subproject review committee in MPED; and (iii) the appointment
of the Chief Technical Advisor in the UNDP-financed planning assistance pro-
ject.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

D. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF AUGUST 31, 1980
There are currently three projects under execution:
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 258-UG - Second Education Project:  US$7.3 million
credit of June 23, 1971; Date of Effectiveness - October 26,
1971; Closing Date - December 31, 1981
Project implementation is now about four years behind schedule.
Prior to the war a number of remedial actions were taken to speed up imple-
mentation: these included strengthening the Project Unit, streamlining
Government processing of project related matters, and contracting for civil
works. Reflecting these measures, progress towards educational objectives was
satisfactory; project implementation had advanced by 12% from August 1978 to
January 1979, raising the overall completion of the project to 48%. However,
following the recent events in Uganda, in which the war and subsequent looting
affected most contractors and school sites, the status of the project com-
ponents had to be reviewed and the effect of the war assessed. A supervision
mission visited Uganda in November 1979 to begin this work. Arrangements
have been made to enable the project to be fully implemented; the closing date
has been postponed by 24 months to December 31, 1981 to allow completion of
the project.
TRANSPORT SECTOR
Credit No. 164-UG - Second Highway Project: $11.6 million
credit of September 29, 1969; Date of Effectiveness -
December 1, 1969; Closing Date - June 30, 1980
All of the civil works contracts being supported by this Credit
have been completed except one small contract for a bridge over the Ishasha
River on one of the IDA-financed tea roads. Four of the original 11 technical
assistance posts financed under the Credit remain occupied. Skilled expatriate
technical assistance continues to be essential for the Ministries of Transport
and Works, and financing of the posts will continue to be provided under the
Credit during 1980. Since only a small balance remains in the credit, which
is expected to be disbursed within three months, the closing date was not
postponed.

RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
Credit No. 983-UG - Reconstruction Credit I; US$72.5 million
credit of April 2, 1980; Date of Effectiveness - May 1, 1980,
Closing Date - December 31, 1980
Along with the IDA credit, which includes US$17.5 million repre-
senting the Government of the Netherland's participation, a US$20.0 million
EEC Special Action Credit and a Can$3.0 million Canadian Grant have been made
available to the Government in support of its reconstruction program. The
total amount of about US$95.5 million was to be released in two tranches.
No funds have been disbursed yet.
E. EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY PROJECTS INVOLVING UGANDA
In addition to the projects described above, Uganda also benefits
from lending to the East African Community. Following the disintegration of
the East African Community, the allocation among the Partner States 1/ of
undisbursed balances of loans to the East African Community Corporations at
October 1, 1977 was approved by the Executive Directors on January 12, 1978
on the basis of recommendations made in a report dated December 29, 1977
(R77-312). Agreements in line with those recommendations were subsequently
signed by each of the Partner States on January 25, 1978. A portion of the
undisbursed balances under two loans (Loan 674-EA - East African Railways
Corporation, and Loan 914-EA - East African Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation) was allocated to Uganda. Industrial projects in Uganda are also
eligible for financing under the ongoing East African Development Bank Project
(Loan 1204-EA). Progress on implementation of these projects is summarized
below. Although the closing date for Loans 674-EA and 914-EA has expired,
since the amount allocated to and guaranteed by each Partner State is clearly
defined under the terms of the agreement of January 25, 1978, disbursements
continued to be made. Uganda's allocation under Loans 674-EA and 914-EA has
been fully disbursed.
Loan No. 674-EA - Third Railways Project: US$42.4 million
Loan of May 25, 1970; Date of Effectiveness - October 30,
1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
The original purpose of the project was to complete the Railways
1969-72 Development Program, including track improvement, procurement of
rolling stock and other equipment, and to finance studies of the economic
feasibility of certain railway lines and services. The physical execution
of the original project has been seriously delayed due to administrative
and political problems within the Community. In November 1974, the
Executive Directors approved a reallocation of the uncommitted balance of
the Loan to be used for consultant services and emergency investments in
trc  -' terial.  All three countries have enacted legislation to establish
1/   Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

their own Railways Corporations. The agreed allocation of undisbursed funds
at October 1, 1977 among the various countries concerned is given below:
US$ Million
Kenya                               2.0
Tanzania                            3.8
Uganda                              1.9
Total            7.7
This loan is now fully disbursed except for US$27,000 of the amount allocated
to Kenya; this amount is expected to be disbursed shortly.
On January 12, 1978, the Executive Directors approved the utilization
of US$1.2 million equivalent, out of the proceeds of this loan, to finance the
East African mediation effort. This amount, in addition to US$0.5 million
provided by UNDP for this purpose, is expected to cover the total estimated
cost of the mediation service.
Loan No. 914-EA - Third Telecommunications Project: US$32.5
million Loan of June 22, 1973; Date of Effectiveness -
September 19, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 1979
The project included provision for procurement of local telephone
exchange equipment, cables and susbscriber apparatus, microwave and UHF/VHF
systems and multiplex equipment, interurban cables and wires, automatic
switching and signalling equipment, telegraph, telex and data equipment,
and training. All project items except the microwave radio system have
been completed; this system is likely to be completed by mid-1980. The
slippage of the project's completion was due to initial delays in procurement
caused by staffing and other problems associated with the relocation of head-
quarters. About US$31.8 million of the loan had been disbursed to date. The
agreed allocation of undisbursed funds as at October 1977 among the countries
concerned is as follows:
US$ Million
Kenya                                2.4
Tanzania                             3.5
Uganda                               0.1
Total              6.0
Loan No. 1204-EA - East African Development Bank: US$15.0
million Loan of March 1, 1976; Date of Effectiveness -
June 7, 1976; Closing Date - March 31, 1981
The environment within the Community has continued to have a
negative impact on EADB operations. Level of operations both for appraisal
and supervision has been depressed, but there has been some improvement in t6-
state of portfolio with the arrears affected portforlio fallinig from 50% as of
June 30, 1977 to 43% as of June 30, 1980. About US$10.1 million of the loan
has been disbursed to date, and the uncommited balance amounts to approximately
US$1.9 million. The closing date has been postponed to March 3], 1981 to
allow completion of the project.
