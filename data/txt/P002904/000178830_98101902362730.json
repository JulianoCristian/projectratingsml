planning and project preparation\n            institutions, and training for project planning and\n            preparation. The main risk facing the project involves\n            possible delays resulting from the technical weakness of the\n            Ministry of Planning and Economic Development. However, in\n            view of the Bank Group's involvement in a UNDP-financed\n            technical assistance project which is directed at the needs\n            of this ministry, it was concluded that this risk is being\n            satisfactorily addressed."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
