Irrigation\n            Project is to assist the Royal Irrigation Department (RID)\n            in its continuing program to improve and expand\n            Thailand's irrigation facilities. The project includes:\n            (a) construction and/or improvement of main, lateral and\n            tertiary canals and drains (including adjacent farm roads)\n            for irrigation of an area of about 27,000 hectares on the\n            left bank of the Mae Klong River (East and West Malaiman\n            areas); (b) review of RID's organization with a view to\n            determining staffing, training and reorganization\n            requirements and implementation of a plan of action for\n            strengthening RID; and (c) preparation of future irrigation\n            projects. The project will directly benefit some 6,800 farm\n            families, about 40 percent of whom at present have incomes\n            below the absolute poverty level. A further 2,000 landless\n            agricultural households living in the project area will also\n            benefit because of the additional labor demand generated by\n            the project. The project entails no unusual risks."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
