intensive\n            employment in Niger's industrial and artisan sectors is\n            the primary objective of this project which also seeks to\n            strengthen the sector's institutional infrastructure. A\n            line of credit to BDRN financed by this credit will assist\n            relatively labor-intensive small- and medium-scale\n            enterprises. Technical assistance and training programs for\n            BDRN, including the development of a Bank Management\n            Training Program at ENA to serve all six Nigerian financial\n            institutions, will help upgrade BDRN's Development\n            Department. The project would also provide financial and\n            technical assistance, with UNDP, for OPEN, a new agency\n            which will provide technical assistance and training for\n            local entrepreneurs. Financial and technical assistance is\n            also provided under the project to the Artisans Center of\n            the National Museum to improve the productivity and\n            employment of artisans affiliated with the Center and to\n            develop the export market for their products; through this\n            component the project will assist some of the poorest\n            segments of the urban population. It is estimated that 500\n            jobs will be created in the modern and utilitarian artisan\n            sectors and 370 jobs in the artistic artisan sub-sector."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
