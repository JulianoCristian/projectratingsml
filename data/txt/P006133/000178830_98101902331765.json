    Development Project will continue previous Bank efforts to\n            foster rural development in the Altiplano. It will focus on\n            increases in productivity and production of small farmers\n            thus improving their incomes and living standards. The\n            project will consist of a directly productive component\n            including credit for on-farm investment, production inputs,\n            forestry, and other productive activities; an infrastructure\n            component, including upgrading feeder roads, and provision\n            of water supply and waste disposal facilities; and an\n            administrative and technical support component providing\n            technical assistance, extension services and production\n            inputs to participating farmers. The project design is\n            considered to be of low risk because it is based on\n            experiences gained under the Bank's two ongoing rural\n            development projects in Bolivia."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
