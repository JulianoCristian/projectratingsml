(a) ensure\n            predictable and sustainable financing for the forest and\n            wildlife sectors and effective forest law enforcement; (b)\n            improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and\n            transparency; (c) address social issues in forest and mining\n            communities; and (d) mainstream environment into economic\n            growth through Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA),\n            Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and development of a\n            climate change strategy. The DPO focuses on supporting the\n            Government's plans to invest in demand and supply-side\n            approaches in order to improve governance in the natural\n            resources sector and specifically target improved revenue\n            management, financial flows and livelihoods in the forestry,\n            wildlife and mining sub-sectors. The DPO will support\n            Government of Ghana (GoG) actions that enable dialogue with\n            complementary funding facilities for expanded civil society\n            engagement in natural resources governance. The expected\n            outcomes at the end of the DPO series include: (i) improved\n            management of government revenues and finances in the\n            forestry and mining sectors; (ii) reduced illegal logging;\n            (iii) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining\n            communities; and (iv) integration of environmental\n            considerations into policy formulation and implementation\n            across government, including risks associated with climate change."}, "docdt": "2010-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
