                      decreasing poverty and inequality, to be achieved with the help of the
                      Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy and a series of World Bank
                      programs, including Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and
                      other DPOs such as Natural Resources and Environmental
                      Governance (NREG).
                      Primary risks to the proposed operation include: (a) political risks,
                      (b) macroeconomic risks, (c) financial risks, (d) environmental risks,
                      (e) social risks, and (f) risks of misperception. The DPO series has put
                      in place mitigation measures to address these potential risks through:
                      (a) promotion of dialogue and positive interaction between relevant
                      stakeholder, (b) establishment of mechanisms to adjust expenditure to
Risks and Risk        the level of available financing; (c) close monitoring of the release of
Mitigation            funds to other government agencies; (d) undertaking an environmental
                      evaluation of targets and triggers and the holding of annual progress
                      reviews; (e) use of Poverty and Social Impact Analysis, increased
                      social accountability and transparency, and payments from carbon
                      storage promoting activities; and (f) updating key stakeholders
                      regarding objectives and positive outcomes.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
     PROPOSED THIRD NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL
 GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION FOR THE REPUBLIC OF
                            GHANA

                                  I      INTRODUCTION

1.      Background. This program document presents a proposed third, in a series of three,
development policy operation (DPO-3) to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 6.6 million (US$10
million equivalent) to support the Government of Ghana (GoG) as it implements reforms under
the Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (NREG) program. The reforms will focus
on the forestry and wildlife, mining and environmental protection sectors.


2.     Program Objectives. The objectives of the three operations in this DPO series are to (a)
ensure predictable and sustainable financing for the forest and wildlife sectors and effective
forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and
transparency; (c) address social issues in forest and mining communities; and (d) mainstream
environment into economic growth through Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA),
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and development of a climate change strategy.


3.      Rationale and Links to the Government's five year Program. This programmatic DPO
series supports the first three years (2008-2010) of GoGs five year (2008-2012) NREG program
to address governance issues in the forestry and mining sectors and improve environmental
management. Currently forestry, wildlife and mining are key to Ghana's economy and share
common challenges, including revenues that are not well captured and large numbers of people
dependent on the sector for their livelihood. In addition, environmental policy (via the
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA) needs to be strengthened to effectively control
pollution, and to reduce long-term negative health and economic impacts due to environmental
degradation and climate change. Ghana has recognized the need to address these important
issues. The 2006-2009 Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II), extended to 2010, has
the overarching goals of sustaining economic growth of at least 6 percent per year to attain
middle-income country status and surpass the 2015 Millennium Development Goal of halving
poverty levels to 26 percent of the population and reducing inequalities.


4.      The GPRS II has three distinct pillars--private sector competitiveness, human resource
development, and good governance and civic responsibility--with priorities for environmental
management identified through an SEA. The DPO focuses on supporting the Government's
plans to invest in demand and supply-side approaches in order to improve governance in the
natural resources sector and specifically target improved revenue management, financial flows
and livelihoods in the forestry, wildlife and mining sub-sectors. The DPO will support GoG
actions that enable dialogue with complementary funding facilities for expanded civil society
engagement in natural resources governance.

5.      Long-Term Development Plan. A draft `Long-Term Development Plan 2009-2015' was
tabled in June 2008, and its orientations are still to be confirmed by the new administration,
which took office in February 2009. Environment and natural resources continue as elements
within wider national objectives on growth. No major change in strategic direction is foreseen, as
the Plan is expected to remain centered on Ghana's objective of becoming a middle-income
country and reaching all MDGs by 2015. The use of oil revenue constitutes a new factor to be
considered in this planning perspective.

6.      Expected Outcomes. The expected outcomes at the end of the DPO series include: (a)
improved management of government revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors;
(b) reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining communities; and
(d) integration of environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation
across government, including risks associated with climate change. (See Annex 2 for details on
the expected outcomes and associated indicators).

7.     Development Partnership Arrangements. A Framework Memorandum of Understanding
(Annex 5) signed by GoG and participating Development Partners (DPs) --Agence Française de
Développement (AFD), the United Kingdom's Department for International Development
(DFID), the European Commission (EC), the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in
Ghana (EKN), and the International Development Association --guides the GoG/DP
collaboration in support of the NREG program.1 The Framework Memorandum sets out the
process for joint agreement and assessment of a three-year rolling Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF) and outlines a review process that is aligned with the broader Multi-Donor
Budget Support (MDBS) program.

       II      GHANA'S RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS

                A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS


8.      The Government elected in January 2009 inherited a difficult macro-economic
situation, brought on by a series of shocks which exacerbated a structural trend of widening
fiscal imbalances. Rapid fiscal expansion in 2008 and the sudden closure of access to
international capital markets in September 2008 resulted in a widening current account deficit
and a contracting capital account surplus. By end-2008, fiscal and current account deficits,
including grants, culminated at 14.5 and 18.7 percent of GDP, respectively. While fiscal
expansion was prolonging trends observed since 2005 ­ with a public sector wage bill increasing
from 8.5 to 11.3 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2008 ­ it was also the result of a combination
of severe exogenous shocks, including floods and droughts in late 2007, a rise in world food
prices, which prompted the Government to introduce food tax exemptions, and a rise in oil
prices, which led the Government to purchase oil on behalf of utilities, in the absence of effective

    Even if not providing financing through the NREG Sector Budget Support program, all participating DPs in
    Ghana's Environment and Natural Resources Management (ENRM) Sector Group have observer status in the
    NREG program.

tariff adjustment mechanisms. The electoral cycle also contributed to the fiscal expansion, as
observed during previous elections. Deficits and demand pressures strongly contributed to the
depreciation of the Ghana Cedi, which lost more than 40 percent of its value against the US
dollar from June 2008 to June 2009 (figure 1), and to accelerated consumer price inflation, which
culminated at 20.7 percent (year-on-year) in June 2009.

9.      In response, the Government immediately adopted a multi-year fiscal stabilization plan.
The strategy comprised immediate actions in 2009 to restore expenditure control and pave the
way for structural reforms in the public sector and in energy in 2010. These actions and reforms
aim to stabilize the debt to (non-oil) GDP ratio from 2010 onward. These intentions were
reflected in the Budget Law 2009 approved by Parliament in March 2009 (which targeted a 9.4
percent of GDP fiscal deficit in CY09), as well as in the Budget Law 2010 laid out before
Parliament in November 2009, which targets a 7.5 percent of GDP fiscal deficit in CY10.
10.     The International Monetary Fund (IMF) supports the Government's fiscal
stabilization plan. On July 15, 2009, the IMF Board approved a 3-year arrangement under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for Ghana in an amount of US$600 million to
support the Government's economic program to tackle macroeconomic imbalances. A joint first
and second review of the PRGF by the IMF board is scheduled for May 2010.
11.    Through the Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC), IDA has
also been supporting structural reforms to restore budget discipline and tackle long-standing
public sector and energy issues, while protecting the poor. The DPO was approved on June 30,

                                                            3
2009 by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors, for a total amount of US$300 million
equivalent to be disbursed in two successive tranches of US$150 million each.2 Efforts supported
by the EGPRC concentrated on measures to: (i) establish a treasury single account, improve
compliance with the public procurement law, correct any budget deviations (fiscal deficit, pro-
poor expenditures), publish fiscal accounts, and submit to Parliament the Freedom of
Information Bill; (ii) reconstitute the boards of energy-related utilities and regulatory authority,
adopt an electricity sector financial recovery plan, adopt legislation on oil and gas regulatory
framework and fiscal regime, implement a net hiring freeze in the public sector, eliminate ghost
workers in health and education services, classify half of subvented agencies in preparation for
their rationalization, divestiture, or commercialization; and (iii) extend the number of LEAP
(cash transfer program) beneficiaries and review the effectiveness of pro-poor expenditures.
12.     Since mid-2009, the economy has shown strong signs of stabilization, while weathering
the impact of the global financial crisis. Following large expenditure slippages in 2008, both the
fiscal and current account deficits were significantly reduced in the course of 2009, under the
impact of positive exogenous shocks (high hydroelectric reserves with good rains, low oil prices,
high cocoa and gold prices, good cocoa harvest) and significant fiscal stabilization efforts and
achievements (see Table 1 and 2). The fiscal deficit reached 9.7 percent of GDP in 2009 (against
14.5 percent a year earlier) while the balance of payments' current account registered a 5.1
percent of GDP deficit (against 18.7 percent a year earlier). Since July, the exchange rate
stabilized and even slightly appreciated against the US$ (following a 45 percent depreciation
since June 2008). Consumer prices also broadly stabilized, growing at an annual pace of 4.0
percent over the period July 2009-February 2010. As such, the year-on-year inflation target set
forth by the Bank of Ghana for December 2009 ­ 14.6 percent - was almost attained (15.9
percent), and within the inner range agreed upon with the IMF. By March 2010, 6-month T-Bills
were subscribed at 15.7 percent, down from 26.4 percent a year earlier.
13.    Indirect indicators suggest a significant deceleration in GDP growth in 2009.3
Estimates for 2009 put real GDP growth below 4 percent in real terms, down from an estimated
7.3 percent in 2008. A number of indirect indicators tend to support this estimate, from indirect
tax revenue and import demand to energy supply and private sector credit growth. And while
exports (gold, cocoa) continued to enjoy high world prices, growth in domestic demand is likely
to have decelerated, under the combined impact of fiscal stabilization, tighter credit conditions,
and lower private transfers and foreign direct investments. Latest data suggest that the economy

  The first tranche was disbursed upon effectiveness in July 2009. By April 2010, prior actions regarding (i) the
adoption of corrective measures in 2009 to meet fiscal deficit and pro-poor expenditure targets, (ii) the submission
of the freedom of information bill to the Parliament, (iii) the classification of pro-poor expenditures, (iv) the
approval by Cabinet of the electricity financial recovery plan, (v) the elimination of ghost workers from the Ghana
Education Service, (vi) the appointment of a Minister of State for Public Sector Reform, (vii) the initiation of
employment audits in all MDAs and (viii) the classification of Subvented Agencies for divesture and
commercialization were considered met by the World Bank staff, pending receipt of appropriate means of
verification. Progress was also significant on the remaining prior action, that is, the adoption by Cabinet of the fiscal
and regulatory frameworks for the oil and gas sectors.

  GDP estimates are based on indirect indicators of supply and a 17-year old base year, 1993, possibly not reflecting
structural economic changes which occurred since. National accounts are currently being re-based by the Ghana
Statistical Services, and this endeavor is likely to entail significant upward revisions in GDP levels.

started to regain strength towards the end of 2009, rebounding from the sharp deceleration in the
first half of 2009.
14.      Not being greatly exposed to international financial markets (on both assets and
liabilities sides), Ghana's financial sector (mostly banks) was not directly affected by the
global financial crisis. The banks' balance sheets continued to expand rapidly in 2009 (31
percent increase between December 2008 and December 2009), while significantly elevating
capital adequacy ratios.4 Yet, GDP growth deceleration, exchange rate depreciation, related
currency mismatches, and large public arrears likely contributed to rising Non Performing Loans
(NPLs), which attained 14.9 percent of total loans in 2009 (up from 7.7 percent a year before).

          B.       MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

15.     By April 2010, Ghana was considered by the IMF to have met all but two of its
quantitative targets under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in 2009: the September ceiling
on the fiscal deficit and the continuous limit on non concessional borrowing, which was
breached in November, when a State Owned Enterprise liability was taken over by the budget.
Estimates for the end-2009 point to a fiscal deficit at 9.7 percent of GDP (on a cash basis), that
is, slightly above the fiscal target of 9.4 percent of GDP set forth in the Budget Law 2009.
Higher than anticipated domestic interest costs and lower than anticipated grants and tax revenue
contributed to the slippage. In contrast, primary expenditures (goods and services, transfers and
domestically financed investment expenditures notably) were severely compressed (although the
share of pro-poor expenditures was protected5) with regard to the Budget Law. Measured on a
commitment basis, the fiscal deficit was about 11.5 percent of GDP in 2009, down from an
estimated 20.9 percent in 2008 once included arrears and outstanding commitments.6
16.      The 2010 Budget Law,7 which was submitted to Parliament on November 19 2009,
foresees a fiscal deficit at 7.5 percent of GDP in 2010. While structural reforms in energy (the
implementation of the electricity financial recovery plan to avoid the recurrence of subsidies to
utilities), public sector (conduction of payroll audits and elimination of ghost workers,
restructuration of subvented agencies, civil service reform for effective decentralization and
improved performance management) and public financial management (treasury single account,
integrated financial management and information system, effective cash management and
commitment control systems, inclusion of all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) in
the payroll management system) are expected to prevent the re-occurrence of expenditure
slippages, most of the fiscal adjustment is budgeted to stem from additional tax and non tax
revenue. The latter is expected from the removal of important tax exemptions, the conversion of
excise to ad-valorem taxes (to avoid inflation erosion), increased royalties from the mining
sector, higher dividend distribution from State-Owned Enterprises, and better alignment of user
fees with costs.
17.    Nonetheless, discussion with the IMF Staff subsequent to the Budget presentation led
to the identification of additional measures in anticipation of a possible revenue shortfall,
given the optimistic revenue assumptions retained in the budget law and potential contingent

5
  The share of pro-poor expenditure in total expenditure stood at 26.8 percent by end-September 2009, against 24.9
percent targeted for the full year 2009. In comparison, the share of actual pro-poor expenditure in total expenditure
stood at 22.3 percent in 2008 (against 24.5 percent targeted).
6
  The review at Parliament in August 2009 of the budget 2009 execution at mid-year revealed a stock of public
expenditure arrears, outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities to State Owned Enterprises by end-2008
largely exceeding that budgeted to be cleared in 2009 (GHc 1.80 billion against GHc 0.54 billion budgeted). By end-
2009, the stock had gone up to an estimated amount of GHc 1.85 billion, the result of a decline in arrears to the
private sector and liabilities to SOEs almost exactly offset by an increase in outstanding commitments vis-à-vis the
Statutory Funds (National Health Insurance Scheme, Social Security, Ghana Education Trust Fund, Road Fund,
District Assembly Common Fund, HPIC and MDRI related funds), which are legally funded through fixed shares of
tax revenues.
7
  The 2010 Budget refers throughout the full Program Document to the Budget Statement and Economic Policy, and
the Appropriation Act, approved together by the Parliament in December 2009.

liabilities.8 The Government and the IMF also agreed to revise upwards the 2010 fiscal deficit
target (from 6.0 to 8.0 percent of GDP under the proviso that no new arrears will be
accumulated) initially envisaged at the signature of the ECF, so as to accommodate for the
liquidation over time of the stock of expenditure arrears and outstanding commitments
uncovered afterwards. Such a revision was nonetheless not affecting the targeted fiscal deficit for
2011, at 4.5 percent of non-oil GDP.
18.      The Government strategy is nonetheless not immune from risks. The feasibility of the
fiscal adjustment is endangered by a number of internal factors. Risks lie in particular in
Government's ability to negotiate with unions a within-budget public wage increase and a
gradual implementation of the "single spine" reform9 in 2010, to contain the recurrence of
energy subsidies10, and to succeed in significantly raising tax and non tax revenue. In the event
of this, the Government would have little choice but to de facto contain transfers to the Statutory
Funds, either through accumulating new arrears or introducing greater flexibility in the fiscal
rules governing these funds. On the other hand, likely oil revenue (with first oil expected in the
fourth Quarter of 2010) - not accounted for in the budget 2010, as well as stronger than
anticipated economic recovery, could facilitate the adjustment.
19.     As part of a multi-year stabilization plan, the International Monetary Fund considers
the fiscal deficit target of 8.0 percent of GDP for 2010 financeable. IMF staff considers the
fiscal and external deficits as financeable given donors commitments for 2010, including
US$200 million from a new World Bank Development Policy Operation scheduled to be
submitted to the Board in 2010 and the release of the EGPRC second tranche (US$150 million).
20.     The implementation of the Government's economic stabilization and reform program
should minimize risks of external debt distress. Preliminary updates to the joint Bank-Fund debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) using the latest debt data and projected financing flows suggest
that Ghana remains at moderate risk of debt distress, in line with the 2008 and 2009 DSAs. In the
baseline projections, external debt indicators remain below the threshold levels for debt distress.
These results depend on the planned sustained reduction of the fiscal deficit to low levels; debt
dynamics based instead on the continuation of fiscal deficits at the average levels of recent years
would quickly exceed the DSA threshold levels. Stress tests also indicate that the DSA outlook is
sensitive to the economic growth and borrowing costs assumptions. The debt-to-GDP indicator is
expected to be revised downwards over the course of 2010 as a result of the national accounts
rebasing exercise which is projected to result in an upward revision to nominal GDP (of
approximately 50 percent). Importantly, however, this would not affect the debt service to export
and revenue ratios over the coming decade.


8
   In particular, the financial situation of TOR (and ability to operate) was clarified by a GHc 445 million equity
injection from the Government in March 2010, which allowed the refinery to settle its debt with GCB. The financing
of the operation was obtained with the issuance of a Ghana Cedi denominated 3-year Treasury Bill for non residents
carrying a 15.0 percent annual interest.
9
   The reform aims at unifying salary scales across the various public sector entities. Since it is not intended to
negatively affect anyone's salary, the implementation of the reform could be fiscally expensive. 100 million Ghana
Cedi was budgeted in 2010 to start its implementation, to be completed over a five-year period. MoFEP calculations
suggest that the full implementation of the reform could entail a wage bill at 14 percent of GDP by 2014.
10
    In March 2010, the Cabinet agreed to accept an increase in electricity tariffs of 33 percent, to be implemented no
later than June 1, 2010.

                                                          8
21.     Debt sustainability is also predicated on prudent non concessional borrowing.
Following the issuance of US$750 million worth of Eurobonds in 2007 (to finance additional
electricity capacity and road networks), Ghana borrowed in 2008 the equivalent of US$585
million to finance projects for rural electrification, electricity capacity, housing and health. These
projects were believed to carry important development benefits, even if insufficient quantitative
information prevented World Bank staff from assessing their economic and social returns. As
such, the non concessional borrowing policy note distributed to the Board of Executive Directors
in January 2010 recommended that (i) IDA continue to provide Ghana its full IDA allocation on
blend terms in FY10 and (ii) the policy should be reviewed before any new lending in FY11.11
Early information from Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) indicates a total
amount of US$477 million worth of non concessional borrowing in 2009.
22.     Ghana's macroeconomic framework is assessed as adequate for the purpose of the
proposed operation. The fiscal stabilization objectives set forth in the 2010 Budget, the nature
and pace of actions taken by the Government in 2009 to regain control of the fiscal situation on a
sustainable basis and the complementary financial assistance from donors provide the conditions
for the proposed operation to meet its objectives, and justifies the use of IDA resources for the
current sectoral development policy operation.



                   C.       POVERTY TRENDS AND PROGRESS IN SOCIAL
                                AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT


23.     Income Poverty and Social Protection. Ghana recorded very significant poverty
reduction between 1999 and 2006. The estimated proportion of the poor in the total population
went down from 39 percent in 1999 to 29 percent in 2006.12 While all major regions recorded
reductions in poverty, some achieved them much more rapidly than others. By now, the bulk of
poverty has become concentrated in the three northern regions which now comprise more than
half of the poor (against a fourth of Ghana's population). Efforts to address the special needs of
these lagging regions had been initiated in the recent past, and there are ongoing efforts to
amplify them in the context of an ambitious Savanna Accelerated Development initiative which
is supported by several Development Partners (DPs) including the Bank. The initiative aims to
increase agricultural productivity and promote a more sustainable management of its natural
resources. The initiative will ensure tight coordination and better targeting of public and private
(e.g. NGOs) activities, in order to achieve durable poverty alleviation.




11
   The recommendation is based on the following factors: (i) market conditions have changed fundamentally; (ii)
additional external financing sought by the Ghanaian authorities aimed at supporting ongoing development projects
is needed to sustain economic growth and assist in meeting the MDGs; (iii) a graduated response permits time to
assess developments as they unfold, including projected oil exports beginning in 2011; and (iv) there are benefits
associated with IDA's continued full engagement with this country as it makes sectoral policy choices and builds up
its own capacity to evaluate the expected returns on its public investments.
12
    Poverty rates are computed using the national poverty line. Estimates using the international poverty line of
US$1.25 a day put the poverty rate at 30 percent in 2006, down from 39 percent in 1999.

                                                        9
24.     Since 2006, various factors could have impacted poverty positively or negatively.
Between 2006 and 2009, per capita real consumption grew by almost 30 percent (source: IMF),
which, if equally shared across households, should have generated substantial poverty reduction
gains (assuming unchanged distribution, the headcount index would have approached 20 percent
by end-2009). However, important uncertainties regarding the measurement of private
consumption and its distribution among households and regions, and the fact that some recent
shocks might have disproportionally affected the poor (droughts and floods in the Northern
regions, food price increases in cities) could mean lower actual poverty reduction gains.

25.     In 2010 income poverty could rise further, as per capita private consumption growth is
expected to fall. Because lower growth and the planned fiscal adjustment entails higher energy
tariffs and increased taxation, staff forecasts aggregate per capita real private consumption to
stagnate in 2010, which would result in income poverty rising assuming unchanged income
distribution. This underlines the importance of protecting vulnerable households from the
downturn in economic activity through targeted measures, such as a further extension of the cash
transfer program LEAP to new beneficiaries and the protection of pro-poor public expenditures
as the budget contracts. The Government's recent review of existing social protection
mechanisms indeed suggest that LEAP offer the greatest guarantee of reaching the poor as
relatively well targeted13, even if implementation costs remain high and could be reduced as the
program expands (and other programs adopt similar targeting mechanisms, through the adoption
of the single register, See Section 4B). On the other hand, tax exemptions granted to consumer
goods and services (food imports, electricity, petroleum) or inputs (fertilizers, diesel) mostly
benefit non-poor.

26.     Millennium Development Goals. The review of progress towards the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) depicts a picture of quick progress on some MDGs. The income
poverty, hunger, primary completion, gender parity at school and access to water goals (MDG1a,
MDG1b, MDG2, MDG3 and MDG7a respectively) are on track.14 These services have been
extended to millions of poor in the past decade, and protecting the gains of the past must be a key
priority for the next years. At the same time, other important MDGs, such as sanitation
(MDG7b), child (MDG4) and maternal mortality15 (MDG5) are still off-track and require more
efforts. While progress on health-related MDGs would need to rely mostly on efficiency gains
(and goals to possibly be re-evaluated downwards, given the growing recognition at the global
level of their overly ambitious nature16), a case is to be made to raise resource allocated to

   World Bank staff calculations suggest that with 60 percent of its beneficiaries below the poverty line, LEAP has
the highest targeting efficiency among Ghana's social programs and subsidies.
14
   When at least two observations are available after 1990, with a sufficient number of years separating them, the
World Bank determines whether a country is on or off track to meet a given MDG by 2015. To do so, it compares
the progress recorded so far with that needed to reach the MDG, under the assumption that progress becomes
increasingly difficult the closer countries get to the goal. Technically, this is equivalent to comparing the annual
growth rate between 1990 and today with the constant growth rate required to reach the MDG in 2015 from the
situation in 1990.
15
   Given the difficulty to estimate and monitor on a regular basis maternal mortality, an input indicator ­ birth
attendance by skilled health staff ­ is retained for measuring progress. In 2007, the maternal mortality rate was
estimated at 451 deaths per 100,000 live births.

27.     Health. In 2008, the holistic assessment of the health sector showed overall "green"
satisfactory performance. Such a performance is also measured by the comparison of the last
two demographic and health surveys (DHS) in 2003 and 2008. The progress achieved over this
period is impressive: under-5 mortality was reduced from 111 deaths per 1,000 births to 80, the
proportion of malnourished under-5 children was reduced from 18 to 14 percent, and the
proportion of medically assisted deliveries went up from 47 to 59 percent. Health progress
results to a large extent from the creation and continued increase in coverage under the National
Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), reaching 12 million people by October 2008. Pro-poor
progress during the 2007-08 food and fuel crisis was supported by public subsidies that paid
some of the insurance premium due by the poor.

28.     Education. In line with the Education Sector Development Strategy adopted in 2003,
progress in terms of access to primary education has been significant. Gross primary
enrollment rates went up from 86 to 95 percent between 2003/4 and 2008/9, while net primary
enrollment rates went up from 56 to 88 percent over the same period. Over the years, increased
efforts at building new schools in deprived districts, and increased attention to gender parity,
have allowed for an extension of progress in access in primary education by vulnerable
populations.18 The demand side was supported with the initiation of a school feeding program in
poor regions, and by the development of conditional transfers in the context of the LEAP
program (which also involves incentives to improve nutrition).

   Policy attention is now increasingly shifting to quality. Ghanaians students rank poorly in international
mathematical and science tests (TIMSS), and national tests conducted in 2007/8 suggest that only 26 and 11 percent
of primary graduates are respectively proficient in English and in mathematics.

                                                                  11
29.     Water and Sanitation. Meeting the Millennium Development Goal on water and
sanitation means that about 0.4 million more people need to gain access to water and 1.3
million to sanitation, every year between now and 2015.19 Investment in rural water facilities
rose since 2003, and as a result access to safe water went up from 55 percent of the rural
population in 2003 to 76 percent in 2008. In the meantime, though, the share of urban population
with access to safe water declined, from 83 to 79 percent. Furthermore, progress in sanitation has
been very slow, and this has continued to tax progress in non-income poverty outcomes. The
challenges for the future include not only larger budgets and improved institutional capacity in
the sector, but also tackling issues of sustainability of service delivery, including proper
operation and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities.

generation potential, management, and sustainability of the natural resources sectors. This
section of the program document outlines the challenges and their impact on economic growth
and environmental protection in the three focal areas of the DPO series - forestry and wildlife,
mining and environment - and the Government's strategy to address them. The Government's
Letter of Development Policy for sectors supported by this DPO (Annex 1), outlines its approach
to governance of natural resources forming a solid base for improving the ability of the country
to benefit from use of its mineral resources, and conservation and sustainably harvesting its
renewable resources. As part of the new GoG's program of reform, the intention is to strengthen
its multi-stakeholder Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Board, and develop its
work program, including extension of the EITI principle to other sectors such as oil, forestry and
fisheries. This extension of EITI signals the Government's commitment to adopt a value chain
analysis approach to guide improved natural resources management and governance. Valuable
lessons can be learned from existing sectoral practice. For example, the Forestry Commission
publishes timber royalty receipts and disbursements every quarter. The Minerals Commission
has developed guidelines for the use of mining royalties by Districts, and is planning to set up
decentralized EITI offices to strengthen accountability at the local level. A wider circulation of
these publications is however required to make them more useful tools for accountability.

30.     Ghana has a strong record of social accountability and transparency mechanisms
across a range of sectors. This has been evident under NREG where, inter alia, a participatory
process substantively influenced the forestry sector Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) and
civil society has been consulted on the minerals and forestry policy matrices. It is envisaged that
non-state actors will also engage with the Inter-Ministerial Forum/Environment Advisory
Council. To further enable civil society demand for accountability around NREG, an interim
civil society facility (Kasa "Speak Out" in Twi), is being funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom
of the Netherlands (EKN) (1.6 million for 2008-10). A dedicated fund is also being provided by
the European Commission (EC) (1.25million for 2008-12) to enable civil society, industry and
local authorities to engage in a Governance Initiative for Rights and Accountability in Forest
Management (GIRAF). A new multi-donor civil society facility, Ghana Accountability and
Responsiveness Initiative (GHARI), may include some elements on natural resources and
environment following inception in 2010. Civil society has active membership of the Ghana
EITI Steering Committee and in the emerging committee dealing with forest carbon and
Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), while an expanded dialogue
across civil society and other non-state actors is emerging on climate change, with the
establishment of a civil society climate change working group and the advent of new actors such
as Climate Action Network Ghana. The intent of these initiatives is to further develop the
capacity of civil society to engage in evidence-based policy advocacy and to enable non-state
actors to interact more systematically with state institutions responsible for natural resource and
environmental governance.


          A.    FORESTRY AND WILDLIFE

Governance Challenges

31.    The need to curtail illegal logging, largely for the domestic market, establish
sustainable forest management, and improved capture of revenues, are the main governance

                                                13
challenges in the forestry sector. Factors contributing to forest degradation and loss in Ghana
have been well documented. Although the introduction of a new verification system, developed
under the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) between Ghana and the EU, will do much to
reduce the loss of revenue through illegal logging to supply export markets, the challenge of
addressing illegal supply to the domestic market should not be underestimated. Increasing
demand for cheap lumber for local markets, combined with poor incentives for communities to
maintain and manage forests outside forest reserves, is a major stimulus for illegal harvesting
and associated forest degradation. The challenge is compounded by a lack of reliable statistics
on unofficial trade, covering the domestic market and overland trade with neighboring countries.
Establishing how a legal and sustainable local supply can be achieved and what level of
processing for export is appropriate are pressing concerns. Further attention is also required to
create the right incentives for communities and farmers to sustainably manage forest and wildlife
resources. Additional challenges lie in implementing and maintaining secure and predictable
financing for the sector. Achievement of revenue collections by the Forestry Commission should
be in line with previously set expectations and targets, and the contribution of redistributed
benefits to poverty alleviation needs to be further secured and confirmed. Payments for
environment services in emerging programs such as REDD are likely to play an increasingly
important role. Longstanding challenges remain the effective implementation of existing policy,
legislation and regulations and the institutional capacity and strengthening required for this at all
levels, including communities.


Government's strategy

32.     Improving forest governance will commence first by establishing capacity and
procedures applied to timber bound for export market, and then turning to timber on the
domestic market. The stated overall aim of the 1994 Forest and Wildlife Policy was,
"Conservation and sustainable development of the nation's forest and wildlife resources for the
maintenance of environmental quality and perpetual flow of benefits to all segments of society."
The Policy set out several strategies through which this aim would be achieved, including: (a)
revision of forest reserve management planning procedures for sustainable forest management,
including development of biodiversity conservation and environmental protection in the high
forest zone; (b) establishment of databases and information communications technology (ICT)
linkages to facilitate decision-making and policy analysis; (c) local community participation in
the management of forest and wildlife resources with rights to consultation, access and benefits;
(d) private sector investment in plantation development, focusing on the conversion of the timber
industry into a low volume, high value industry; and (e) legislative reform in support of these
strategies.20 In 1996, the GoG launched a Forestry Development Master Plan to guide the
execution of the Policy to 2020. The Master Plan is currently being updated and revised.


33. Illegal logging for the domestic market is leading to overharvesting and loss of revenue.
According to the Master Plan the annual sustainable harvest is 1 million m3, which mainly

supplies a timber industry that is primarily focused on export markets. Monitoring the origin of
timber bound for export markets will be easier to accomplish in the first instance. Domestic
consumption, which mainly derives from illegal sources, greatly exceeds the sustainable harvest.
Since 1992, there has been an upsurge of illegal felling in reserves and on off-reserve lands, and
measures by the Forestry Commission to control this phenomenon have been ineffective, and
forest resources have been depleted. The Master Plan outlines obsolete laws and regulations,
limited financial resources and the inadequacy of line agencies and their working conditions, and
constraints to its implementation. These factors are particularly critical under the existing socio-
economic situation of pervasive poverty that contributes to agricultural encroachment of forest
reserves and ­ in particular - illegal timber operations. Three key elements of the Master Plan
supported under NREG are: (i) ensuring the legality of timber (which will be addressed under the
Voluntary Partnership Agreement, linked to prior actions under DPO 1 and 2), (ii) the need to
ensure sustainable financing for the sector (supported by a prior action under DPO 1), (iii)
improving the quality of forest management (supported by prior action in DPO 1 and 2), and (iv)
ensuring transparency in distribution of resources to forest communities (supported by a prior
action under DPO 2).


Critical Approaches

34. Under the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the EU Ghana has committed to
ensure that all timber exported from Ghana to Europe is of legal origin. GoG's commitment
to a more comprehensive approach to sector reform was tested during an Africa Forest Law
Enforcement and Governance conference held in Yaoundé, Cameroon in 2003, where the
concept of a VPA with the EU for the export of verified legal timber was first discussed. The
VPA mechanism forms part of the EU's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade
(FLEGT) Action Plan to tackle the causes of illegal logging. Central to these agreements is a
commitment by tropical timber-producing countries to verify the legality21 of their timber
exports to the EU in exchange for which the EC and EU member states contribute toward the
cost of putting in place the required verification systems. These agreements were also promoted
as a means of strengthening sector governance more broadly. In December 2006, GoG initiated
formal negotiation process with the EU, defining the scope of the negotiations to address illegal
logging not just for export to the EU, but to all exports and the domestic market as well. Through
the VPA process, GoG recognized an opportunity to further their sector reform agenda more
broadly. Issues relating to strengthening of rights of access to resources also forms part of the
legislative reform agenda set out under Ghana's VPA. The NREG framework for the forest and
wildlife sector, therefore builds on the reform agenda set out as part of the VPA negotiation
process.

International Agreements

35.   In September 2008, Ghana became the first tropical timber-producing country to sign
a VPA with the EU. In January 2010 the first Ghana/EU meeting of the Joint Monitoring Review

     The definition of legality is derived from a subset of Ghana's laws relating to timber harvesting, transport, and
     processing.

                                                          15
Mechanism met to discuss implementation of the Agreement, the process of appointing an
independent monitor, and arrangements for monitoring the impacts on local livelihoods. The
reform agenda set out as part of this Agreement (described above) and in particular the multi-
stakeholder consultations on which this reform agenda was based, has laid the foundations for
other processes such as those for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation
(REDD) that require strengthening of forest governance as a prerequisite for successful
implementation. Ghana is a recipient of support from the World Bank administered Forest
Carbon Partnership Facility to develop its national strategy and plan for REDD, which will be
developed through a consultative process in the coming year (REDD+ includes broader
components on conservation, forest carbon and sustainable forest management). While
modalities and values are yet to be developed, payment for REDD could provide additional
economic incentives for sustainable forest management, and will further bolster NREG
objectives. The development of Ghana's national strategy for REDD will build on the experience
of the broad consultations and civil society participation in preparing the VPA, and will be
institutionalized in the context of NREG. More recently, Ghana has been selected as a pilot
participant in the Forest Investment Program (FIP) under the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) Trust
Fund, with a view to strengthening steps towards transformational change in Ghana's forest
related policies and practices.

             B. MINING

Governance Challenges

36.     Transparency in establishing mineral development agreements, and capacity to assess
mineral revenues owed to government. Gold production has increased significantly in recent
years, reaching 3.13 million ounces in 2009, representing the largest source of export revenues
for Ghana. Ensuring the corresponding increase in revenues and strengthening the development
impact of the sector remain however a work in progress. This is mainly due to the multiplicity of
players with strong vested interests, weak accountability mechanisms, and weak capacities.
Nevertheless, the Minerals Commission has done significant work during the last year to put in
place a modern mineral rights cadastre (licensing system), and draft regulations to facilitate its
implementation of the new Minerals and Mining Act (2006) Act 703. In addition, as per the
proposed Budget Law of 2010, the Government has proposed a revision to the mining royalty
rate to a fixed 5%. Questions remain however as to how the Government would implement this
in cases where companies have fiscal stability agreements on current and potential future
investments. As such, the process of negotiation and the level of transparency with regard to
access to resources ­ and in particular, favorable conditions for large scale investors ­ need to be
improved. Furthermore, there is a possibility that GoG is not collecting the amount of taxes and
royalties agreed in the minerals development agreements and in the law. This is mainly due to
lack of coordination and capacity of relevant government agencies to project revenues and
operating costs for individual mines, which in turn determines the levels of royalty to be paid.

37.  Revenue distribution to municipal and district levels and social conflict in mining
communities. Since 1993, 10 percent of mineral royalties is set aside in the Minerals



                                                16
Development Fund to finance mining sector institutions at the national and local levels in areas
where mining operations are conducted.22 However, the Minerals Development Fund is not yet
codified in law (though submitted to the Attorney General's Office in 2009) and thus money is
not systematically distributed to the mining agencies. Similarly, transparency in the allocation
and use of monies accruing to District Assemblies and Traditional Authorities is not fully
satisfactory. Partly due to this lack of transparency of the amounts and uses of revenues that flow
to the mining Districts and Municipalities, and partly due to uneven social responsibility
practices by mining companies, relationships between communities and mining companies are
often strained. Communities have grown increasingly wary of new mining investments. The
major complaints against mining companies from communities include those related to lack of
compensation for land or agricultural productivity, alleged human rights abuses by mining
company private security forces, and environmental and noise pollution.23

Government's strategy

38.      The Mining Policy Document is clear and comprehensive. Ghana's 1992 Constitution
states that all sub-soil or surface minerals are, "the property of the Republic of Ghana and shall
be vested in the President on behalf of, and in trust for, the people of Ghana." The Constitution
also provides for the establishment of a Minerals Commission, to help regulate and manage the
utilization of minerals in Ghana. The Mining Policy Document developed by the Minerals
Commission outlines sixteen guiding principles for the sector, including inter alia ensuring that
Ghana's mineral endowment is managed sustainably and an equitable sharing of financial and
developmental benefits of mining between investors and all Ghanaian stakeholders. It also
encourages local and foreign private sector participation in the exploration and exploitation of
mineral resources; recognizes the need for a stable regulatory environment, access to and
security of tenure of areas of mineral potential, and a stable, competitive, and fair fiscal regime.
The new Mineral and Mining Act (703) was passed in 2006, with regulations submitted to the
Attorney General's Office in late 2009. Regarding the administration of mining laws and
regulations, it focuses on the application of modern principles of transparency and
accountability; as well as acting in harmony with regional and international partners.
Furthermore, the policy aims at achieving a socially acceptable balance between mining and
physical and human environment and ensuring internationally accepted standards of labor,
gender-balance, health, mine safety, human rights, community relations, and environmental




22
   Ten percent of mineral royalties are allocated to the Mineral Development Fund for the purpose of helping to
   sustain Ghana's public mining sector institutions. Of the remaining 90 percent of mineral royalties that do not
   flow to the Mineral Development Fund, 80 percent flow to the central Treasury and 10 percent flow to the Office
   of the Administrator of Stools and Lands and to mining communities. This is not done through the Mineral
   Development Fund; rather, the Internal Revenue Service (which collects the royalties) transfers funds to the
   Office of the Administrator of Stools and Lands, and this office transfers funds onward to the District Assemblies,
   Stools, and Traditional Authorities according to the following formula: of the 10 percent set aside for the Office of
   the Administrator of Stools and Lands and mining communities, 10 percent stays with the Office of the
   Administrator of Stools and Lands and 90 percent is distributed to District Assemblies (55 percent of the 90
   percent), Stools (25 percent of the 90 percent), and traditional councils (20 percent of the 90 percent).

protection; and it encourages mining companies to develop participatory and collaborative
approaches in their relationship with neighboring communities.



Critical Approaches

39.      Ensuring that the revenue due to Government from its mining operations is fully
captured, and reducing social impacts on mining communities are priorities. NREG is
supporting the Minerals Commission as it operationalizes the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act
(Act 703) and addresses sector challenges that have developed over several decades. Two
particular challenges stand out: social impacts in mining communities ­ both from large-scale
and small-scale mining operations - and ensuring that the revenue due to Ghana from its mining
operations is fully captured. In response, the Minerals Commission, through extensive
stakeholder consultations, has developed Social Responsibility Guidelines for Mining
Companies and Communities. These guidelines provide good practice guidance to large-scale
mining companies on how to engage and interact with mining communities. The objective is to
reduce conflicts, which would then be tracked through an annual community survey. The
Minerals Commission is also working to identify specific areas to set aside for small-scale
mining to facilitate legalization and registration of such miners, while at the same time, to make
it easier to provide technical and other training, for example, in environmental management, pit-
closure, and alternatives to mercury use. In some regions, the Minerals Commission is also
initiating alternative livelihood programs.

40.      Measures to improve revenue collection, improve the transparency of distribution of
revenues at the local level, and improve the regulatory framework for the sector are underway,
and supported by NREG. Operations and capacity of the Mining Revenue Task Force was
further strengthened during 2009. The Task Force brings together key agencies across
government responsible for mining sector revenue policy formulation, assessment, collection,
administration, and auditing, for a collaborative approach to ensuring that Ghana receives the
revenue due under law from the exploitation of its mineral resources. Furthermore, bringing
clarity to the distribution of revenues--particularly at the local level--is the subject of guidelines
developed by the Minerals Commission, and intersects with Ghana's implementation of EITI.
The regulatory framework that underpins the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703), which
was submitted to the Attorney General's office in December 2009, includes fiscal, health, safety,
technical, and other aspects, updating compensation, closure and post-closure policies, and
updating environmental standards (working with the Environmental Protection Agency). The
Minerals Commission is cognizant of the need to ensure the requisite skills to deal with the wide
range of challenges facing the sector, and has included training as an integral part of its
approach. The Minerals Commission has also committed to the establishment of a unit dedicated
to social and environmental issues in recognition of this critical challenge.

International Agreements

41.    Ghana is party to a number of important international and regional agreements and
partnerships related to better management of mineral resources. Since 2003, Ghana has been
implementing EITI, having produced three reports to date on the mining sector. Among the first

                                                 18
countries participating in the initiative, Ghana has submitted a good-quality EITI Validation
Report in February 2010, meeting the deadline set by the international EITI Board. In its work
plan for 2010-2011, GoG has also stated its commitment to incorporating oil in the EITI process
as revenues from the sector start to flow in earnest. Ghana also participates in the Kimberley
Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) to ensure origin of diamonds, and by registering small-
scale diamond miners in line with the scheme. However, with the decline in demand for
diamonds on the global market, many artisanal and small-scale miners have turned to gold
mining instead. Ghana has chaired the African Mining Partnership (AMP), led by African
mining ministers, to champion and coordinate mining and mineral-related initiatives under the
auspices of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). In February 2009, AMP
merged officially with the African Union Conference on Ministers Responsible for Mineral
Resources Development and will thus be directly linked to efforts to implement the "Africa
Mining Vision 2050." Similarly, Ghana played the leading role in the creation of ECOWAS'
Directive on the Harmonization of Guiding Principles and Policies in the Mining Sector, with
the objective to adopt a common mining code for West African countries by 2012. Member
States have up to July 1, 2014 to comply with the Directive.


            C. ENVIRONMENT


Governance Challenges

42.     Consolidating fragmented environmental institutions into the new Ministry of
Environment, Science and Technology (MEST). With the re-creation of the Ministry of
Environment, Science and Technology following the establishment of the new Government in
2009, the Government has pursued a restructuring of institutions responsible for overseeing the
environmental agenda in Ghana. Existing entities, including the Environment Protection Agency
(EPA) and new entities including the Ghana Environmental Conventions Coordinating Authority
(GECCA), and possibly upgrading the National Climate Change Committee to a "Commission"
with a stronger mandate are part of this process of reform with clarified roles and responsibilities
of the units as well as for key staff. This is process of change that should be expected to take
time as it inevitably requires changes in authority and financing of agencies.

43.      Key challenges include the increasing need to improve environmental assessment
across sectors. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the lead agency responsible for
pursuing this, with a mandate to establish effective partnership and collaboration with relevant
institutions and agencies, including the judiciary. The key service delivery process is the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is required for the issuance of permits and
certificates as well as monitoring of Environmental Management Plans. The demand for permits
and certificates has, since the enactment of the 1994 EPA Act, been growing steadily.
Applications for permits and certificates increased from 515 in 2002 to 1,555 in 2005, with about
50 percent coming from the Greater Accra region. Development of sectoral guidelines to guide
EIA at regional and district level is an important element of a precautionary approach to
pollution prevention and ensuring good environmental governance. However, enforcement of


                                                19
compliance remains a challenge for EPA, partly due to resource constraints, which the program
also addresses in the long-term.

44.     Mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development. During 2009 and leading
up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties
meeting in Copenhagen (UNFCCC COP15), several studies were undertaken to enhance the
preparedness to climate change, including a draft adaptation strategy, and a proposal for the
preparation of a low-carbon growth trajectory. The Bank contributed the consultation draft
Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change (EACC). However, with the multitude of possible
future instruments and opportunities for mainstreaming now emerging following UNFCCC COP
15, Ghana must strengthen its preparedness in order to stay attractive to climate financing and
carbon investors. The creation of a "National Framework for Climate Change" would help
organizing the relevant ministries and agencies to each play their role, including particularly
Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources,
Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.

45.     Governance of natural resources. The new Ministry of Environment, Science and
Technology has taken the lead in the creation of the Environment and Natural Resources and
Advisory Council (ENRAC), which will become a body of a dozen people under the Vice
President, and reporting to the Cabinet on key decisions required for environmental governance.
This is a bold and needed step to create the awareness of policy-makers on the key issues
affecting economic growth and prosperity of the country in the long-term. This new body will
need to become operational in early 2010 and will be a strong elements of the country's
commitment to environmental governance.

46.     Strengthening the link between the funding needs and allocations, and clarifying
institutional roles at the national and local level. Establishing a robust link between a core
environmental mandate (defined through refined institutional responsibilities in MEST) and
financial flows (revenues and public finance allocation) will enable a more comprehensive
dialogue between Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, and the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning on budgetary allocations and delivery. Enhancing the
relationship with the judiciary and other sectoral agencies will also be essential for effective EIA
delivery, and cross-sectoral coordination with other ministries will be required to mainstream
climate change into sectoral policies. In addition, there is a need to build decentralized
environmental capacity at district level to provide effective management and governance to
complement central and regional structures, and in particular to the Western Region where new
oil discoveries may now be put in production. However, there is still uncertainty about the
structures that would best take on board these decentralized tasks. Currently, natural resources
and environment departments are being proposed through the Local Government Service,
although the functions, staff, and funds for these remain to be defined. Departments will need to
be assigned and equipped by the EPA, in conjunction with other relevant sectoral Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs).

Government's Strategy




                                                20
47.     The Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MEST). The Government
strategy on natural resources governance is expressed in the Letter of Development Policy (see
Annex 1). This letter provides emphasis on sustainability and on governance of natural resources
use. Further, the Government is also pursuing expansion of the EITI steering committee to
include revenue reporting from the petroleum sector, and remains committed to an Extractive
Industries Value chain Approach. In addition to these two important foundations, the MEST is
strengthening its strategy implementation on the research side through the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research (CSIR) with thirteen research institutes each of which has a mandate
covering specialized areas such as animal, building & roads, food forestry, plants, soil, and
water. On the climate change front, the Government is developing a national framework on
climate change, including an objective on low carbon growth, which will anchor Ghana's
sustainable development agenda. This will focus not only on the industrial and the transportation
sectors but also will ensure energy efficiency in households. MEST is also proposing to establish
a Climate Fund that will support mitigation and adaptation actions. The climate fund is likely to
have an open window for the establishment of a gender fund to assist women and children and
other vulnerable groups.

48.     The EPA strategic plan is currently being reviewed and updated. The directive
principles of state policy of the 1992 Constitution include an article on the need to, "protect and
safeguard the environment for posterity." An overall policy framework is provided by the 1991
National Environment Policy, while the 1991 National Environment Action Plan (NEAP)24 will
supported by a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) with NREG support. The EPA,
according to its mandate and the EPA Act (Act 490, 1994), is a key actor in environmental
protection in Ghana. EPA's 2003 strategic plan, which is currently being redrafted and updated,
sets out its overarching objectives, guiding principles, regional and departmental objectives.

49.     Need for a new consolidated strategy for environment. Given new development issues
in Ghana, including extractive industries (and in particular the petroleum sector) and climate
change issues and opportunities, mentioned above, there is need for the country to conclude on
setting annual priorities for key development issues to address year by year. The priority issues
being addressed through the NREG program are described in more detail in the policy matrix for
2010 (Annex 4).

Critical Approaches

50.    Ghana is being progressively recognized as a leader in the use of strategic
environmental assessment and advancing the climate change agenda. The NREG approach
has drawn on lessons from both the Ghanaian and Tanzanian experience of environmental




24
     The NEAP covers (a) integration of environmental consideration into sectoral, structural and socio-economic
     planning at all levels; (b) maintenance of ecosystem and ecological processes essential for the functioning of the
     biosphere; (c) guidance for healthy environmental practices in the national development effort; and (d) seeking
     common solutions to environmental problems in West Africa, Africa, and the world at large. The latter
     specifically addresses obligations and contributions under Multilateral Environmental Agreements to which
     Ghana is party.

                                                           21
mainstreaming within national development planning.25 Following early experience with the
National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) in conducting a Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA) around the GPRS, the EPA has institutionalized SEA practice, applying this
at both sectoral and district levels. Ghana is now recognized as a leader among developing
countries in this regard.26 Recommendations from an independent review of SEA practice in
Ghana have highlighted the need for ex-ante SEA and systematic follow up of findings.


International Agreements

51.     Ghana is party to many multilateral environmental agreements that determine both
international and national response measures. In 2009, the Ministry of Environment, Science and
Technology established the Ghana Environmental Conventions Coordination Authority
(GECCA) with responsibility for managing affairs with the Biodiversity Convention, Climate
Change Convention, Desertification Convention, and the Stockholm Convention. Ghana has
been particularly active with the Climate Change Convention as an influential party within the
African Group, and in wider structures such as the Adaptation Financing Board, Ghana is
making a particularly substantial contribution in the area of Technology Transfer under the
international negotiations under the UNFCCC. Ghana associated with the Copenhagen Accord
under the UNFCCC at an early stage.


Governance Challenges on Climate Change

52.     Although MEST and EPA are promoting the need to address climate change, a
coordinated response across GoG remains to be developed. The widespread flooding in 2007
indicated that Ghana's current capacity to predict and respond to climate-related risks is
inadequate. To enable climate-resilient development, Ghana needs to develop national and sector
specific responses through policies, legislation, strategies and programming. In particular, Ghana
needs to tailor its response to climatic risk in a strategic manner, incorporating both geographic
and social dimensions, to ensure a rapid response in higher risk areas such as the northern region
which is prone to flooding, and the vulnerable coastal areas. Under the new government, the
country is increasingly acknowledging the cross-sectoral nature of the climate change agenda,
and envisages the creation of a "National Framework for Climate Change" to include adaptation,
mitigation, and low carbon growth, and also intends to establish a REDD+ Secratariat. Details
for these initiatives will be elaborated during 2010.


Critical Approaches on Climate Change


25
   "Environment at the Heart of Tanzania's Development: Lessons from Tanzania's National Strategy for Growth
   and Reduction of Poverty ­ MKUKUTA", IIED, 2007.
26
   The OECD-DAC Task Force on SEA is preparing a case study on the evolution of Ghanaian practice and linkage
   to country systems around SEA and the NREG program, while the October 2008 World Bank Workshop on
   Country Environmental Analysis in Paris featured extended discussion on Ghana. Ghanaian experience is also
   influencing a new program on environmental integration with Government of Zambia, IIED and in-country
   development partners

                                                     22
53.     Coordination across sectors will be key to improving environmental management, and
preparing to manage the impacts of climate change and variability. Ongoing research on
climate impacts will contribute towards the development of the national adaptation strategy.
Further quantification required on socio-economic impacts and on climate models is being
articulated in the Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change study which is expected to be
finalized in 2010. Improving the early warning systems will require the strengthening of the
Ghana Meteorological Agency to be able to perform this function, by collecting the relevant data
and also engaging in sub-regional, regional, and global observation networks. An increasing
awareness and commitment to develop and adopt climate change policy on the part of MoFEP
suggest that climate change issues can now be addressed at both political and technical levels,
thereby increasing the prospects for integrating climate change strategies effectively into sectoral
and national development planning.

             D. BUDGET MANAGEMENT

54.     Budget management by the NREG agencies has been improving over the last year, but
a lot remains to be done to achieve desired measurable outcomes. Promoted by the sector
budget support approach (with DPO as one instrument), the agencies are moving to
comprehensive budget frameworks. Under DPO1 and DPO2, the agencies continued to work
with a specific NREG-program budget, linked to program objectives and targets. Under DPO3,
agencies intend to mainstream the NREG program in the annual working plan of the agencies,
and the agencies will no longer work with specific SBS-NREG-budgets. They receive funding
from GoG to execute their work program, in addition to internally generated revenues (levies and
fees). Under DPO2 and DPO3 the policy matrix has been considerably rationalized and now
focuses on the key strategic policy and institutional issues.

55.     Multi-annual budget frameworks of the three agencies are not yet very detailed, and
need to be further strengthened. With the support of technical assistance from the Royal
Netherlands Embassy, MDAs involved in the NREG program have formulated an action plan for
strengthening financial programming and financial management. The action plan focuses on
improving the quality and comprehensiveness of the agencies' budgets and the multi-annual
budget frameworks, ensuring that audits are produced in a timely manner covering all
expenditures, developing strategies to exploit the revenue generating capacity of the respective
sectors, training staff in procurement planning and cash flow projections. An analysis of the
agencies' annual and multi-annual budgets is detailed in a policy note, and is an important aspect
of the annual policy dialogue.

56.     Government funding levels of the sectors have increased. The increased budget
allocations to the agencies and strengthening of the budget management capacity are expected to
lead to more effective functioning of the agencies, which will help them to considerably improve
the collection of levies and fees and improve the effectiveness of their governance functions in
the immediate future. GoG will need to ensure that the three agencies continue to be adequately
financed through Internally Generated Funds and/or GoG sources. For the Minerals Commission,
for example, which (with exception of the Inspectorate Division) did not receive any GoG
funding prior to NREG, GoG resources will become their most significant source of funding.

  IV      JOINT DEVELOPMENT PARTNER SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
                                PROGRAM


           A. LINK TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY (CAS)


57.     CAS Objectives. The NREG DPO 3 program is aligned with the FY08-11 CAS and also
the revised results matrix in the CAS Progress Report (extending the CAS period until the end of
FY12) and the new Medium-Term National Development Policy Framework 2010-2013. The
CAS sets out the broad objectives of increasing growth and decreasing poverty and inequality, to
be achieved with the help of the Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) and a series of World
Bank programs, including Economic Governance & Poverty Reduction Credits (EGPRC) and
other DPOs such as the Agriculture DPO. The G-JAS has a substantial chapter on environment,
reflecting the findings of the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). The environment as a key
priority for development was thus accepted at the highest level of the donor community and
marks an important step forward toward joint NRE programs. In line with the donor
harmonization agenda and Ghana's good track record of PRSC implementation, close to 50% of
lending under the CAS is currently in the form of DPOs.

58.     Natural Resources and Environment and the CAS. The revised results matrix of the
CAS progress report is structured along the lines of the Medium-Term National Development
Policy Framework 2010-2013 and identifies individual sectors as the entry point of interventions
rather than the three pillars in the GPRS II. The section on sustainable management of natural
resources in the CAS is substantial and covers the three sectors under the NREG program:
forestry, mining and environment and outcomes and milestones to be achieved during the
remaining CAS period. The CAS recognizes that sustainable NRE management is urgent, and
prioritizes the reform and capacity building of key natural resource & environmental agencies as
central to improving environmental governance and safeguarding the environment. CAS
priorities further include the need to improve: (a) transparent fiscal and revenue frameworks in
natural resources management; (b) the analysis and governance of extractive industries through a
value chain approach (an expanded EITI); (c) engagement and dialogue with civil society
organizations and local communities, mainstreaming social accountability throughout the
portfolio, and in monitoring and evaluation of projects and programs; (d) increased coordination
between natural resource/environment ministries and agencies; (e) increased attention to climate
change mitigation and adaptation; (f) sound environmental management of the oil and gas
sectors, and (g) an improved platform for data and information to support evidence based policy
making. The CAS Progress Report confirms the engagement in the NRE sector and the intention
of continuing sector budget support to the EI Value Chain Approach with a DPO planned in
FY11, which will build on the mid-term review of the NREG series currently planned for the
first quarter of FY11.

              B.      DONOR HARMONIZATION

                                              24
59.     Bank/Fund Collaboration. The IMF and World Bank teams collaborated closely since
the design and launch of the PRGF and EGPRC in early 2009. Following the agreed institutional
division of labor between the Bank and the IMF, there is a common understanding of the macro
situation and the World Bank is taking the lead in the areas of energy, public sector reform and
safety nets. The IMF and World Bank teams are also closely collaborating on issues of public
financial management with a clear division of labor on the policy actions identified.

60. DP Support. GoG's NREG program is supported by five DPs--AFD, DFID, EC, EKN,
and the World Bank--with such support designed and implemented jointly with GoG from the
outset. The cooperation between DPs began with joint analytical work (CEA, Ghana
Environment Sector Study) and joint sector dialogue via the ENR Sector Group. During
preparation and implementation of the series, joint missions were undertaken and a joint program
document developed. Simultaneously, VPA negotiations proceeded with EC and DFID support.
A joint Framework Memorandum (Annex 5) states how DPs and GoG will work together under
the NREG program. DPs have harmonized support by using a joint PAF, and undertaking a joint
assessment of the PAF.

61.     While Bank support for DPO-3 will be US$10 million equivalent, to be disbursed in a
single tranche on effectiveness, the following development partners will also provide a total of
approximately US$16.6 million per year to support the five year government program:

EKN: approximately 7 million per year over five years (2008-2012);

DFID: approximately £2.1million per year for three years starting in 2009 (2009-2011);

AFD: approximately 1 million per year over five years (2008-2012);

EC: approximately 4 million per year over three years starting in 2010 (2010-2012).


62.     Other DP support, and the shift from project to budget support. DP project support in
the forestry and wildlife sector is being largely phased out in favor of budget support under
NREG. However, the Fonds Français pour l'Environnement Mondial financed a 1.2 million
biodiversity and forestry project, which ended in December 2009, and the EC's US$12 million
Protected Areas Development Program, which ended in 2009. The Netherlands' approximately
US$25 million project funding in the forestry sector ended in 2008. EC's 40 million Mining
Sector Support Project ended in the second half of 2009, and thereafter support to the sector will
be channeled through NREG. Complementary to NREG, CIDA is supporting a Ghana
Environmental Management Program (C$8 million) to strengthen EPA and its parent Ministry's
capacity and combat desertification in the northern Ghana. NREG-related Bank project support
is discussed in Section IV.C. The DP group on oil is the main mechanism to ensure, at GoG's
request, a coordinated approach to respective DP interventions. Norway continues to be the lead
DP providing technical support in the oil sector, with the World Bank and USAID. Norway and
NREG DPs are coordinating closely in regard to environment and oil and respective interactions
with EPA in the light of the targets on environmental guidelines and the SEA on oil in the NREG
PAF. Ensuring a coherent approach is particularly important in light of new initiatives that are


                                               25
intended to pilot, scale up and learn from new approaches on enabling sectoral responses to
climate change challenges.


63.     Environment and Natural Resources Sector Group. Sector Groups have been
established in Ghana to improve GoG/DP dialogue and coordination. The Environment and
Natural Resources Sector Group was established in 2004, and its membership includes the key
Government institutions responsible for mining, forestry and environmental management,
MoFEP and Development Partners with an interest in supporting improved environmental and
natural resources management. The Sector Group's three main objectives are to (a) conduct
continuous sector policy dialogue between GoG sector representatives and interested DPs; (b)
review the performance of the ENR sector at least once each year and exchange views on
progress toward agreed outcomes and actions that contribute to improved sector performance;
and (c) improve harmonization and alignment of GoG's and DPs' procedures, projects,
programs, and skills to improve the efficiency of implementation of GoG's sector policies and
strategies. The Technical Director for Forestry in the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources
and the Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency are currently co-chairs of
the Sector Group on GoG's side, while the EKN has taken over in April 2010 as sector lead, on
the DP side. Civil Society representatives attend Sector Group meetings on a quarterly basis and
participate in the Annual Sector Review. Within the wider donor architecture in Ghana, the
Sector Group is the first contact point for information and analysis of achievements in the sector.
It maintains a strong link with the MDBS group and contributes directly into the MDBS
dialogue.

64.     Links to the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS). The MDBS is a general budget
support modality in the highly harmonized donor community in Ghana. The Bank's Economic
Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit, the Agriculture DPO and NREG are part of the
MDBS and are assisting GoG to implement GPRS II and its successor, the Medium-Term
National Development Policy Framework. NRE priorities and expected outcomes under the
MDBS Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) 2009-11 build on the commitment and
momentum created under the MDBS in previous years to safeguard the environment, and
expanding the scope and content of NRE in national fora and donor dialog. Under C3 and the
heading "Improve Cross-sectoral Natural Resources and Environmental Management", the PAF
2009-11 outcome is the enhanced inter-sectoral coordination, improved sector-wide partnership
and accountability in view of enhanced coherence in policies and decision making, integration of
environmental issues into policy, plans and budgets. The target for 2009 was the establishment of
the Environment and Natural Resources Advisory Council (ENRAC) to provide cross-cutting
policy direction on environmental and natural resources management, and creation of a platform
to discuss and inform on these issues. Inauguration for the Council was planned for April 2010.
The targets for 2010 and to 2011 are further steps to achieve the stipulated outcome of
coordination, partnerships and accountability. Under NREG, the establishment of monitoring and
evaluation systems in the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources and the Ministry of
Environment, Science and Technology, is linked to and complementary to the PAF trigger under
E1 and the heading to Strengthen the M & E system for 2009. This trigger calls for the
production of annual progress reports for six ministries which include key indicators based on
the formulation of M &E plans to monitor the sectoral development plans.

             C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS


65.      Bank projects that support improved natural resources and environmental governance
include - The Agricultural Development Policy Operation, which provides sector budget
support for policy and institutional reforms that contribute toward promoting sustainable
management of natural resources in agricultural lands. In the context of oil and gas, the Energy
Development and Access Project (GEDAP) is holding consultations on adoption of oil and gas
regulatory and revenue management frameworks and planned to have frameworks in place by
the end of the CAS period. The Land Administration Project (US$55 million, of which
US$20.5 million IDA contribution), which supports Government's land administration reform by
harmonizing land policies and the legislative framework with customary law; undertaking
institutional reforms to improve the land administration system; and establishing an efficient
system of land titling, registration, and land use planning. Under the Community-Based Rural
Development Project (IDA, US$60 million - a project aiming at increasing rural income,
improving rural infrastructures, and access to key support services) one component specifically
supports natural resource-based development. Also, in the context of the TerrAfrica Global
Partnership Program, the Bank provides technical advisory services to strengthen the
analytical underpinnings and the capacity of various Governmental institutions to oversee the
development and implementation of sustainable land management activities. In the pipeline are
(1) an oil and gas capacity building project (2) an initiative on social accountability and to
mainstream the approach in the portfolio and increase the demand-side governance through
funding from the Governance Partnership Facility (2) a project to promote the expanded
application of EITI value chain approach identifying priorities for improved governance in the
oil and gas sectors, and (3) statistical capacity building projects in support of evidence-based
policy-making. Ghana has also been selected as a FIP pilot and a Readiness Preparation
Proposal has been submitted to support Ghana's REDD initiatives.


66.    Links to Other DPOs. Specific links via targets in the MDBS and the EGPRC are
described above. More generally, the two sector DPOs - NREG and agriculture - rely on
macroeconomic assessments and debt sustainability analysis carried out under the EGRPC
Government-wide issues related to revenue and expenditure frameworks, budget allocations, and
budget execution are carried out as part of the EGPRC dialogue, with sector-specific issues in
these areas discussed as part of the NREG dialogue. The External Review of Public Financial
Management (ERPFM) underpins this dialogue. Currently, fisheries resources are included under
the agriculture DPO because institutional responsibility for fisheries is under a Department
within the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and because of the inclusion of fisheries in the
national agriculture strategy (i.e., the FASDEP).

             D. LESSONS LEARNED

67.     Lessons from Previous Projects. The design of the NREG program reflects lessons
learned from previous Bank interventions in the NRE sectors in Ghana and other countries as
set out in the program document for DPO-1. In particular, key lessons learned under the Natural
Resources Management Project, completed in 2003, included the:

        i.    Centrality of fostering country ownership and aligning with the GoG sector
              programs;

       ii.    Importance of the strategic approach to build capacity while using country
              systems, including a sound monitoring and evaluation system;

      iii.    Need for realistic end of program outcomes;

      iv.     Need to leverage reforms and capacity building and to focus the policy dialogue
              on key governance issues;

       v.     Importance of incorporating public participation, addressing the needs of civil
              stakeholders;

      vi.     Usefulness of leveraging co-financing and harmonizing DP interventions.

68.    Lessons from Global Experience. The following lessons or principles have also emerged
from global experience from the development and implementation of DPOs and they have been
incorporated into the design of the DPO series (see Box 3 for details): (a) reinforce country
ownership; (b) agree upfront with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework; (c) customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank
support to country circumstances; (d) choose only actions critical for achieving results as a
condition for disbursement; and (e) conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to
predictable and performance-based financial support.

69.    Lessons from DPO-2. The second year of NREG provided lessons that have been
incorporated in the design of DPO-3. In particular, the DPO continues to emphasize MoFEP-led
coordination as experience has demonstrated that a central coordinating function is needed to
ensure consistency in the management of the program. On the DP side, efforts toward donor
collaboration and harmonization have continued. Under DPO 2, division of labor among the
DPs in supervision of the program has been clarified and improved. Additionally, in an
endeavor to enable the dialog to better focus on substance, a small independent team of
consultants was hired under the supervision of MoFEP to work with MDAs to provide an
evidence based assessment of achievements, relevance and likely impacts of implementing
NREG. Box 1 provides a series of best practices which have been adopted in this DPO.

                         Box 1: NREG DPO and DPO Good Practice Principles
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
GoG has demonstrated strong ownership of the NREG program. The program matrix was developed by the
Forestry Commission, Minerals Commission, EPA, their parent Ministries, with an active leadership role by
MoFEP, and in discussion with DPs.
GoG consulted broadly with key stakeholders on the program matrix. Consultations with stakeholders were
carried out as part of the preparation of the NREG program, and as part of the validation of the program matrix.
There is strong political will to take civil society's perspective into account. Stakeholder and Risk Analyses
were launched under DPO-1 and continued under DPO-2, deepening the analysis of impacts of mining, forestry,
and oil exploitation on vulnerable communities.
Public disclosure. Documents related to the NREG program have been publicly disclosed to help ensure
accountability and transparency, and reinforce country ownership.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The NREG program matrix, or PAF, serves as a harmonized basis for monitoring and annual review by DPs.
The program matrix, jointly agreed with DPs, is used to assess GoG's progress on the reform agenda. Through
it, prior actions and triggers for each year are determined and agreed with GoG and disbursements are based on
achievements. The NREG program matrix combines policy-based actions and output/outcome-oriented targets
for each year of the program, with means of verification and a column quantifying (whenever possible)
expected outcomes. Each sector validates its matrix at the Ministerial level, confirming GoG's commitment to
the program.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The reform program captured in the NREG program matrix reflects GoG's agenda and intentions. The key
policy makers in each sector lead the process of developing the matrix and its actions for their respective sector.
In addition, the NREG program matrix is fully aligned with GPRS II pillars.
The program focuses on three key sectors. Taking Ghana's circumstances into account, the NREG program
decisively focuses on forestry and wildlife, mining, and environment precisely because the three sectors have a
very high potential for growth and have important social and environmental welfare implications. Sustainable
oil exploitation is part of the environmental governance focus.
The NREG program complements the ongoing MDBS program. Rather than include the objectives of the
NREG program in the existing MDBS (general budget support) program, the need for separate and more in-
depth reforms in this particular area led GoG and DPs to agree on the separate, yet complementary, NREG
program. It does not overlap with the MDBS program, but picks up on important sectoral areas not addressed by
the MDBS due to its focus on overall public sector management.
The timing and modality of budget support is aligned with the country's needs. The choice to use a DPO
reflects an understanding of the need to focus on governance reforms in the three sensitive sectors, and reflects
the growing capacity of Ghana's PFM system. All contributing donors use the same monitoring framework,
which reduces the transaction cost for the GoG.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
For DPO-2 and DPO-3 there are 6 prior actions and 29 targets ­ reduced from 66 under DPO1. The prior
actions/triggers are purposely limited in number and were selected because they are considered key in the
agencies' own policy documents.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
Under the NREG program, there are regular performance reviews. In accordance with Ghana's budget and
monitoring cycle, the PAF review takes place in the first half of the year, to review progress on triggers, and the
annual sector review takes place in the second half of the year, to take stock of progress and look forward. The
PAF review assesses implementation progress and determines disbursements, which are contingent upon
results. The reviews are conducted in accordance with Ghana's budget and monitoring cycle and in a
transparent manner--all stakeholders participate in the annual sector review.

70.    Lessons from Implementation of the NREG DPO Series - While an in depth analysis
and reflection on lessons learned over the course of this DPO series of three operations will be
undertaken in the context of the ICR, development partners' preliminary views on lessons
learned from the series includes the following:

        MDA stakeholders need to fully understand the SBS modality for it to be effective in
achieving its development objectives ­ the recommendation is that sector MDAs should be
sensitized at the outset through training in how Sector Budget Support functions, and how to best
take advantage of the opportunities it affords. For example, through provision of training and
assistance to sectors in developing multi-annual strategic plans and budgets that can be used in
their dialog with the Ministry of Finance, as well as design of strategically targeted performance
assessment frameworks.

        Transaction costs can be expected to be high in the initial years ­ this is due to the need
to build awareness and trust, and also develop operational modalities for advancing the dialog,
among the various MDA actors, and with DPs and civil society.

        A parallel program of targeted technical assistance could enhance the pace and
development impact of SBS reforms - for example through undertaking analysis necessary to
identify and define the most relevant priority policy reforms needed to achieve maximum
development impact, and also to build capacity of MDAs to undertake reforms and implement
their programs.

        Meaningful reform in the NRM sectors requires leadership and support at the political
level - NRM sectors are complex and reform is likely to require that strategy to address
competing formal and informal interests and incentives is supported through leadership at the
highest level.

        Performance Assessment Framework should be strategic and focused on key policy
reforms - Initial design of the NREG PAF included a large number of targets that would have
been more appropriately associated with traditional investment lending. This tended to obscure
the dialog on key policy reforms.

        Public Financial Management reform cannot be fully addressed with SBS - While
significant achievements were eventually made toward developing multi-year planning and
budgeting at the Agency level, comprehensive improvements in PFM must be addressed
systemically and are beyond the scope of SBS.

        Three years is insufficient time to achieve the full development impact of the SBS
instrument ­ introduction and adoption of the culture of SBS has been a major achievement of
the series. It has established a solid platform of understanding and enthusiasm for the SBS
modality on the part of MDAs. However, achieving the full and sustainable development impact
of the instrument will require continuity of support over a longer period than three years.

            E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

71.     The Analytical underpinnings for the NREG program are described in detail in the
program document for DPO-1. Key among these are the Country Environmental Analysis, the
Ghana Environment Sector Study (GESS), and preparatory studies for the VPA in forestry. The
Country Environmental Analysis grew out of recognition by GoG and DPs of the importance of
natural resources to Ghana's economy and the alarming rate of depletion/degradation and
inefficient management of these renewable and non-renewable assets. NREG is a "response" to
the Country Environmental Analysis's findings, to strengthen environmental
governance/management and mainstream policy dialogue in this area. It is the main platform for
DPs to engage with GoG to address issues raised in the report related to mining, forestry and
wildlife and wider environmental governance mechanisms.

72.    Other studies were undertaken during the preparation of DPO-1 and DPO-2, to inform
policy directions. They include a Public Revenue Analysis of the Forestry, Mining, and
Environment Sectors, to determine what can be done to enhance further the revenue generation
from these sectors; a Review of Budgets, Expenditures, and the Financial Management System
of the Natural Resources and Environment Sector; Translation of the NREG Matrices into
Action Plans and Budgets, beginning with the costing of 2008 and 2009 actions in the matrices;
and a Stakeholder and Risk Analysis, undertaken as the first phase of Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis (PSIA).

73.    In addition, the program has been further informed by the state of the PFM systems,
processes and practices as highlighted the ERPFM (2009) and Draft PEFA (2009) reports at the
national and sub-national levels.

                  Box 2: Summary Findings of Recent Studies under the NREG Program
   Public Revenue Analysis of the Forestry, Mining, and Environment Sectors. Key findings of this study
   include inter alia:
    There is a gap between economic rent capture from the NREG sectors and budget policy implementation.
    Wildlife revenue generating potential is constrained by the command and control approach to resource
        regulation and management, limited institutional capacity, and marketing of wildlife potential.
    How the Forestry Commission's finances work is not well understood in the public sector, and there is a
        lack of clarity in legislation about the purpose of Timber Rights Fees.
    Ghana's mining royalty system does not adequately address the extraction of economic rent as currently
        applied. The nature of the mining fiscal regime is straining the capacity of institutions to administer it.
    Placement of a reclamation bond has been made a requirement for all mining companies to comply with
        under EPA's mandate to enforce environmental compliance. This will be an excess charge on the mining
        industry under the policy of charging economic rent.
    EPA's mandate cuts across areas of responsibility of economic and social sectors. EPA is constrained
        financially and in terms of the human resources needed in attaining the ultimate objective of certifying
        environmental compliance of establishments.
    In the short to medium term, EPA should be dependent on government budget. EPA's long term policy
        should be one of self-financing through a taxation of the private sector for provision of environmental
        services.

   Review of Budgets, Expenditures, and the Financial Management System of the Natural Resources and
   Environment Sector. Key findings of this study include inter alia:
    The funding requirements of the sector necessary to perform its core functions far exceed the funding
       available from its revenue sources.
    The budget process fails to meet the resource expectations of the agencies; the annual budget is not
       currently guided by the rolling, three-year MTEF.
    Failure to adjust budget proposals for inflation leads to the need for additional funds.
    Consistent application of the expenditure classification codes is necessary for budget management.




     V        THE PROPOSED NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                   GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION


              A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

74.     DPO Series Objectives and Outcomes. The objective of the DPO series is to support the
Government of Ghana to implement a set of policies and reforms intended to: (a) ensure
predictable financing and sustainable management of the forest and wildlife resources and
effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining sector revenue collection, management,
and transparency; (c) address social issues in forest and mining communities; and (d) mainstream
environment into economic growth through Strategic Environmental Assessment, Environmental
Impact Assessment, and development of a climate change strategy. The proposed operation is
likely to have a significant positive impact on the environment, forests and other natural
resources. DPO-3 continues the focus on policies and reforms in the inter-related sectors of
forestry and wildlife, mining, and environmental protection toward achieving the overall
expected outcomes at completion of the proposed DPO series, which include (a) improved
management of government revenues and finances in the forestry and mining sectors; (b)
reduced illegal logging; (c) reduced social conflict in forestry and mining communities; and (d)

                                                       32
integration of environmental considerations into policy formulation and implementation across
government, including risks associated with climate change. The Government's NREG Program
covers a five-year period, but Bank assistance, through this DPO series, covers the first three
years. The five and three-year expected NREG outcomes are outlined in Annex 2.

75.      Overall progress toward outcomes. The joint GoG/DP mid-term review of five year
NREG program to be undertaken in July 2010, and also the Bank's ICR of the DPO three year
series, to be undertaken in the third quarter of 2010, will both carry out a detailed assessment of
progress toward achievement of intended outcomes. However, based on the annual assessments
of the PAF, as well as ongoing sector dialog, the general view of DPs and GoG is that progress is
on track toward achieving most three year outcomes as defined for each of the three sectors in
Annex 2. Given that this DPO series has been the first experience of Sector Budget Support for
the sectoral agencies, and that a change of Government took place in early 2009 (including the
creation of a new parent Ministry for EPA), the level and continuity of progress could be viewed
as particularly significant. In addition to progress under each of the sectoral policy objectives
included in the PAF, the initiation of improved multi-year strategic budget planning in the
sectors, and the inclusion of NREG expenditures in the 2010 GoG budget, signal that the culture
of SBS has been introduced, and has already begun to catalyze a more substantive dialog
between the sectors and with MoFEP toward achieving NREG objectives in the longer term.

76.     DPO-3 Prior Actions. NREG is a three year programmatic operation and IDA financing
is provided annually based on completion of a set of policy reform actions (i.e. "prior actions")
following annual joint review of progress by DPs and MDAs, and before approval of each
operation in the series by the Bank's Executive Board. Under DPO-2 policy actions and
indicators continued to focus and deepen the dialog on the forestry and mining sectors, and on
environmental protection. The new Government that came to office in early 2009 reaffirmed
Ghana's intention to support NREG, and progress continues to be generally on track, although
the process of changing administration led to some delays in processing and submitting
legislative reforms for Government endorsement.

77.     Post DPO-3. DPO-3 is the last of the Bank's initial programmatic series of three DPO
operations, but GoG will continue with the NREG program for an additional two years through
end 2012. Key actions and targets for the Government program going forward are included in
Annex 4. Some shifts in priority and new opportunities for engagement in the natural resource
sectors in Ghana have developed in the last several years since the DPO series began. These are
associated with the discovery of oil, development of the climate change agenda post-
Copenhagen, and the emergence of new approaches and instruments, such as REDD and the
Forestry Investment Program (FIP). As noted under lessons learned, this initial three year
engagement under the NREG DPO series may not be sufficient to to achieve all outcomes
envisioned. The joint DP/GoG Mid-Term Review (planned for July 2010), and the Bank's ICR
(planned for 3rd quarter of 2010) will inform selection of the best options and instruments
available to the Bank to most effectively support Ghana to achieve its overall NREG and NRE
objectives in the longer term

             B. POLICY AREAS

78.    Implementation and Prior Actions. Over the course of 2009, NREG MDAs focused on
implementing the comprehensive set of policy and institutional actions. Progress achieved under
DPO-2 is outlined below and detailed in Annex 3. Targets for DPO-3 are captured in the NREG
program matrices (Annex 4). The prior actions for DPO-3 and their status are shown in Tables 4,
5 and 6.

Component 1: Forestry and Wildlife Sector financing and Forest Law enforcement

79.     Intended Outcomes of NREG under this component include: law enforcement in the
forestry sector through an increased percentage of legally harvested wood supplied to the
domestic market, and initiation of the use of FLEGT licensing; forest health though a significant
reduction in the incidence of wildfires; predictable and diversified sources of funding for
Forestry Commission though improved collection of fees and royalties; private sector investment
framework in the forest and wildlife sector through increased volumes of tertiary processed
wood exported and expansion of the area of plantation forest resulting from private investment;
M & E system generating data on a monthly basis and made available to policy and decision
makers; an increase in the proportion of local communities actively informed on the details of
revenue collection and distribution, and active participation of local communities in decision
making regarding forest resource management. Outcomes expected on conclusion of the NREG
DPO series (i.e., after three years), and after five years are detailed and quantified in Annex 2.

80.     Progress to date. Under DPO-1 and 2, the Government implemented policy reforms and
actions outlined in the PAF. In accordance with the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA)
with the EC, which was established under DPO 1, piloting of wood tracking systems to verify the
legal origin of timber was initiated in four large companies engaged in the harvesting, processing
and export of timber. The VPA with the EC commits Ghana to ensure that all Ghanaian timber
entering European markets is of legal origin. Legality includes harvest origin as well as wider
legal compliance, such as ensuring that the timber derives from an area that has a current forest
management plan that is being implemented, that permits have been acquired in conformity with
regulations, and taxes and royalties have been paid. Furthermore, transport and processing was in
accordance with the legal prescriptions, environmental regulations have been respected, and
Social Responsibility Agreements are in place. Options to apply the VPA principles to the
domestic market were developed in 2009 under DPO 2. This entailed reviewing existing benefit
sharing arrangements in order to strengthen the forest sector's contribution to equitable and
broad socio-economic development. Pilots of the wood-tracking system are currently under way,
and FLEGT-licenses are expected to be issued from early 2011, following review of the
experience of the pilot operations, and there will be an expansion of scope of the tracking system
to include timber reaching the domestic market. The first VPA Joint Monitoring Review
Mechanism was conducted in January 2010. In addition, the Forestry Commission disseminated
bi-annual revenue disbursement reports within the targeted 30 days of publication. Further
progress for the forest sector under DPO-2 included the development of management plans for
15 forest reserves; implementation of the wildfire strategy, including awareness raising and
increased preparedness as well as the establishment of firebreaks around forest reserves; a
strategy for tertiary wood processing was developed and approved by MLNR; and a REDD+


                                               34
Readiness Preparation Proposal was submitted to FCPF. (See Annex 3 for additional details on
progress made to date).

81.    Areas of Focus in DPO-3. MLNR led the development of the forestry sector matrix,
which focuses on the following five areas for sector reform (See Annex 4 for details):

        Institutional Strengthening and Governance. This focal area relates to commitments
that GoG has entered into as part of the sector reform agenda set out under the VPA process, i.e.,
strengthening the Forestry Commission's regulatory function by delegating authority to the
private sector for certain aspects of resource management; agreement on an institutional structure
to implement the wood tracking system and the related Timber Legality Assurance System
(TLAS); and supplying more of the growing domestic market demand with timber from verified
legal sources. DPO-3 will focus on the completion of pilots with companies for the wood
tracking system, initiated under DPO-2, as well as preparation of a Forestry Development Master
Plan and completion of a study on the domestic wood market to further inform policy directives
by MLNR.

        Secure Natural Ecosystems for the Benefit of all Segments of Society. Illegal logging,
bushfires, encroachment of reserves, and poaching have greatly contributed to the degradation of
the forest and wildlife resources. Implementation of a national wildfire management policy, and
development, implementation and monitoring of Integrated Management Plans for forest
reserves and protected areas are therefore included as key targets under this policy focal area.
Under DPO-3, twelve (12) additional management plans are being developed and reviewed and
emphasis will be placed on ensuring effective implementation of plans revised under DPO-1 and
2. Effective implementation of these plans is also the focus of the proposed Forest Investment
Program-climate activity. Additionally, two regional-level REDD pilot project proposals will be
developed. The main outcome expected under this objective is an improvement in the integrity
of the forest and wildlife resource base, as evidenced by reduction in wildfires and increase of
keystone species in Protected Areas.

        Sustainably Finance and Promote Investment in the Forest and Wildlife Sector. With
respect to the sustainable financing element, DPO-2 included targets relating to the submission to
Parliament of a legislative bill on the Forestry Commission's financial framework, and also the
assessment of potential for sector financing from various carbon markets. DPO-3 will focus on
the implementation of the financial framework. With respect to attracting private sector
investment, a strategy for tertiary wood processing was developed and approved by MNLR.
However, a bill for improved revenue collection could not be approved in 2009 due to delays
associated with the change of Government, but it will be resubmitted to cabinet in 2010. With
plantations playing a key role in the future supply of Ghanaian timber, the sector has embarked
on a process of preparing land-lease and benefit sharing agreements for private sector plantation
development. The promotion, implementation and monitoring of these agreements are therefore
an important target under this focal area, and land leases have so far been signed with 14
investors for commercial plantation development over 9,000 ha, and will continue under DPO-3.
Development of timber plantations at the district level is a priority for the new Government and
1% of the District Assembly Common Fund has been allocated for plantation development.
Additionally, a national REDD+ Readiness Preparation proposal has been prepared and

                                               35
submitted to the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. The main expected outcomes are to secure
predictable and diversified sources of funding and to increase the level of (socially and
environmentally responsible) private sector investment in the sector.

        Strengthen Monitoring and Evaluation Systems (with use of Information
Communications Technology). The objective reflects the need to make better use of existing
information management systems, including financial and administrative, as tools for more
effective monitoring and evaluation that can be used to assess progress against targets set out in
the sector Master Plan and three-year Corporate Plan, and the use of information systems for
better planning. A draft M & E system for FC and MLNR has been developed and, under DPO-
3, will be refined in conjunction with development of the Minerals Commission's M&E system.
In addition, DP0-3 will also focus on the development of an ICT policy and database
management system.

        Promote Equitable Resource Access Rights and Benefits for all Segments of Society.
Poverty impact is difficult to measure and it is not possible to attribute poverty outcomes to one
sector alone. Hence, targets on revenue collection rates were proposed as an appropriate measure
of progress under DPOs 1 and 2, since a percentage of these revenues is shared among local
stakeholders. In recent years, the level of timber royalties redistributed to stakeholders has been
affected by poor performance in revenue collection and unpredictable sector financing. The
publication of bi-annual disbursement reports was therefore considered to be an appropriate
means of verification for the poverty impact target since the reports would indicate revenue
collection rates and their distribution. Disclosure of revenue disbursements at the local level was
a prior action under DPO-2 and will continue under DPO-3. Also under DPO-3, to increase
transparency and to better realize potential poverty impacts, local communities will be
encouraged to monitor spending of revenues received by District Assemblies and traditional
authorities27. Regional and national fora will help provide platforms for multi-stakeholder
engagement in policy dialogue and help to build trust among actors.28 The two main outcomes
expected under this focal area are transparency for communities on revenue distribution through
full and active disclosure and more active participation of communities in natural resource
management through instruments such as Forest Fora.

82.      Status of DPO-3 Prior Actions. The first prior action relates to the program objective of
institutional strengthening and governance, and required that the VPA be implemented through
piloting the wood tracking system in three commercial companies engaged in the harvesting
processing and export of timber. This prior action has been overachieved, with four companies
now actively involved in the pilot. The pilots will be evaluated in September 2010. The second
prior action, which relates to the objective of promoting equitable resource access rights and
benefits for all segments of society, required that procedures be established to improve
transparency of forestry revenue disbursements, through dissemination of bi-annual revenue
disbursement reports within 30 days of publication by the Forestry Commission. Procedures


27
     Guidelines for the use of timber royalties at local level have been prepared by MLFM/MLNR and are being discussed with the
     MLGRD. Once these have been approved, their implementation and monitoring may also become a target under this objective.
28
     The success of the regional fora in 2007 prompted a discussion about whether they should widen the issues discussed to also
     cover mining sector issues or Natural Resources more broadly.

                                                               36
have been established, and dissemination did take place following the most recent disbursement
in 2008, however, the 2009 disbursement has been delayed for reasons associated with internal
budget management, but dissemination will take place within the required time frame following
disbursement, which is expected to take place in the coming months (Table 4).

Component 2: Mining sector revenue collection, management and transparency, and social
issues affecting mining communities


83.     Intended Outcomes of NREG under this component include: reduction of the time
required for processing mineral licenses; improvements in the supervision and control of
production, social and environmental aspects of large scale mining; reduced perception of social
conflicts in mining communities; increased registration of small scale miners; improved

                                                       37
monitoring and collection of revenues from large scale mining; up to date information on mining
incomes, royalties, local revenues and their distribution published at the local level; and the
Minerals Development Fund Bill and other regulations operationalizing the 2006 Minerals and
Mining Act (Act 703) submitted for to Attorney General and Parliament for approval. Outcomes
expected on conclusion of the NREG DPO series (i.e., after three years), and after five years are
detailed and quantified in Annex 2.

84.     Progress to date. The PAF for the minerals sector focuses primarily on sector governance
issues including institutional strengthening for the sector; addressing social issues related to
mining; improved support to the small-scale mining sector; improved revenue collection;
management and transparency of revenues; enhanced policies and regulatory framework; and
enhanced international cooperation. Specific achievements include significant advances to
establish a modern mineral rights cadastre (licensing system), in line with the 2006 Minerals and
Mining Act (Act 703), and ensuring consistency between the new licensing system and new draft
regulations. This will enhance transparency and prevent the issuance of illegal licenses. With
regard to the institutional strengthening policy objective, the Minerals Commission, including all
of its departments and divisions, has started implementation of a Human Resource Development
Plan, focusing on enhancing skills of management and technical staff. The HR Development
Plan includes topics related to asset verification, environmental permitting, distribution of
royalties, and compensation29. In response to continued challenges in mining communities, the
Mineral Commission has finalized the Guidelines for Use of Mineral Royalties by Districts30 and
Municipalities, and the draft of Guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility. Both have gone
through significant stakeholder consultation in mining regions and communities. Finally, in
regard to the enhanced policy and regulatory framework and effective coordination policy
objective, a major advancement is the development and submission to the Attorney General in
December 2009 of the Mineral Development Fund Bill and other regulations to underpin the
2006 Mineral and Mining Act31. (See Annex 3 for additional details on progress made to date).


85.     Areas of Focus in DPO-3. Minerals Commission continues to fully own the mining
sector policy matrix, which focuses on five policy/program objectives. These are outlined below
(See Annex 4 for details):

        Institutional Strengthening in the Mining Sector. The ultimate outcome of this
objective is to enhance the capacity of the staff of the mineral sector agencies (Minerals

29
   Participation including the Ministry, Minerals Commission, Inspectorate Division of Mining, Geological Survey
Department, revenue agencies, Customs and Excise Prevention Service, Environmental Protection Agency, the
Academic and Research Institute, the Chamber of Mines, Traditional Authorities, civil society organizations, and
others.
30
   In the context of preparing guidelines for the use of mineral royalties, stakeholder meetings were held in Tarkwa
in December 2009, and a validation workshop is planned for March/April 2010. The study districts were: Bibiani-
Anwiaso-Bekwai, Tarkwa-Nsuaem and Prestea-Huni Valley (Western Region); Obuasi Municipality (Ashanti
Region); Asutifi (Brong Ahafo); Dangme East and Weija Municipality (Greater Accra Region). The guidelines
cover the following six areas: allocation of funds to project areas; allocation of funds to communities; budgeting;
payments; supervision and monitoring of projects; and accounting for utilization of the fund.

   Including regulation related to Compensation and Resettlement, Mineral Licensing System, Health and Safety
Bill, Explosives, and other General Matters.

Commission, Geological Survey Department, and the Inspectorate Division of Mining) to deal
with the difficult and complex challenges facing the mining sector. The five-year outcome
indicator chosen to measure this is, "100% of licenses processed within the time limit provided
in the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703)," which is an important indicator of the
investment climate and ease of doing business for private investors in the minerals sector as well
as Minerals Commission's capacity to facilitate this in a timely manner. This objective also
focuses on a wider-range of training and human resources development activities under Minerals
Commission's 2008-2009 Human Resources Development Plan. This will help ensure that
Minerals Commission staff has the requisite skills to respond to sector governance issues and
address the varied challenges in the mining sector. The implementation of the HR plan was a
target under DPO-2, and will continue, as the HR plan is further developed and implemented
under DPO-3. Responding to increased focus on issues related to mining communities, the MC
will strengthening the environment desk to include the Social Affairs Desk, to be responsible for
responding to social issues, including those related to social conflict, human rights issues,
artisanal and small-scale mining. Staffing this unit and making it operational will be a major
priority under DPO-3.

        Reduce Social Conflict Issues in Mining Communities and Improve Support to Small
Scale Mining (SSM). The purpose of this policy area is to contribute to an environment
whereby conflicts and perceptions of conflict in mining communities are reduced. The objective
focuses on two areas: (a) enhanced mining community benefits; and (b) an improved operating
environment and organization of Small Scale Mining. With regard to enhanced mining
community benefits, the Mineral Commission has elaborated guidelines to improve corporate
social responsibility practices of mining companies. During 2010, the Minerals Commission will
also develop a survey to track conflicts and perception of conflicts in mining communities.
Additional clarity concerning compensation payments and procedures related to closure of mines
has also been established in the development of regulations in these areas. Furthermore,
Guidelines for District Assemblies on the use of funds from mineral royalties have been
developed. Concerning improved conditions for Small Scale Mining activities, exploration
activities for suitable areas for SSM continue in three areas ­ Japa, Prestea and Kutukrom in the
Western Region. Inception Reports were submitted to the Minerals Commission in November
2009 and work is likely to be completed in mid-2010. The exploration work involves study of
the geology of the area using various methods, including satellite imagery, airborne geophysics
and reconnaissance field visits. Environmental and social concerns related to these new SSM
sites have been raised and beginning under DPO-3, MC will conduct SEA/EIA type assessments
prior to commencement of mining activities to minimize the effect on environment. In addition,
further collaboration with the Communities and Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (CASM)
Partnership will be pursued with a likely workshop planned for the first quarter of FY11. In
regards to both (a) and (b), the MC has committed to quarterly consultations with civil society
groups, particularly those involved in mining. The MC will also participate in the CHRAJ
(Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice) enquiry formed by the Ministry of
Environment, Science and Technology to follow up on findings of the report. Strengthening
these consultation and participation mechanisms will be a priority under DPO-3.

       Improve Mining Sector Revenue Collection, Management, and Transparency. The
purpose of this policy objective is to address the perception of a `revenue gap', the difference in

                                                39
amounts paid by companies and actual amounts due. An important first step has been the
creation of a Mining Revenue Task Force composed of the Mineral Commission, Ministry of
Finance, the Revenue Agencies Governing Board, Internal Revenue Service/Large Tax Payer
Unit, Customs Excise and Prevention Service, Office of the Administrator of Stools and Lands,
and EITI Secretariat. The Task Force is providing a platform for coordination between agencies
involved in the formulation of the mining sector revenue policy, and agencies responsible for
revenue collection and tax administration. Under DPO-2, training was provided to enable the
Task Force and the MC to apply a mine specific `fiscal model' to assess the operating costs,
production and the profitability of individual mines. The model was then applied to two
additional mines (Newmont and Goldfields). In the context of the EITI, Ghana successfully
submitted a validation report to the EITI Board at the end of February 2010. It has also finalized
a work plan for Ghana EITI 2010-2011, with budget and financing still outstanding. In addition
to formal requirements, GoG is including information on revenues paid at the local level (i.e. to
District Assemblies, Traditional Authorities and Stools) in the EITI reports. Similar to the forest
sector, the intention is to have this information actively disseminated at the community levels.
Dissemination and implementation of the Guidelines for the Use of Royalties at the District and
Municipal level, and if feasible, using EITI principles at the local level, will be priorities under
DPO-3.

       Enhanced Policy and Regulatory Framework and Effective Coordination among Key
Government Agencies to Improve the Performance of the Mining Sector. The ultimate
outcome of this objective is to ensure that the policy and regulatory framework for the mining
sector is in place and in line with international good practice, and compliance with
environmental standards is improved. Key outcome indicators to measure success include the
number of self-assessment reports (as required under the law and regulations) submitted by the
mining companies and regular financing from the Minerals Development Fund for the Minerals
Commission. Policy actions include Parliamentary adoption of the draft regulations that will
operationalize the 2006 Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703); review and adoption by the
Government of the draft Mining Policy prepared by the Minerals Commission (currently with
MLNR); and adoption of a Minerals Development Fund Bill (currently with the Attorney
General). Analysis indicates that the Policy needs to address environmental issues to a greater
extent and that it would be appropriate for it to be subjected to an SEA process, prior to
submission to Cabinet. Under DPO-3, coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency
on new standards for the mining sector will be pursued, and lessons learned from the SEA and
EIA work carried out with the EC funded Mining Sector Support Project will be incorporated.

        Enhance International and Regional Cooperation. The ultimate outcome of this
objective is to ensure Ghana's compliance with its obligations through international agreements,
in particular the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. Because of the decrease in diamond
mining due to the fall of global demand, it is proposed that this indicator be reformulated. The
new indicator is likely to focus work under DPO-3 on regional harmonization (Africa and West
Africa) and the implementation of the ECOWAS Directive on the Harmonization of Guiding
Principles and Policies in the Mining Sector, as well as preparing an Action Plan for the African
Union Commission's African Mining Vision 2050.

86.     Status of DPO-3 Prior Actions. DPO-3 Prior Actions focused on: (a) addressing social
issues in mining communities; and (b) improving mining sector revenue management and
transparency. With respect to addressing social issues, Social Responsibility Guidelines for
Mining Companies in Mining Communities have been developed and prepared in a very
inclusive and participatory manner (consultation with communities, mining companies,
municipal/district assemblies, NGOs and government institutions). Stakeholder consultation
workshops were undertaken from November 2009 through January 2010. The Guidelines will be
rolled out to companies and mining regions during 2010. Institutional arrangements, including
mechanisms ensuring accountability and participation of communities and civil society
organizations, need to be established to ensure effective and implementation. With respect to
improving mining sector revenue management and transparency, three fiscal models (for
Chirano, Newmont Ahafo, and Goldfields Tarkwa) have been applied. From November 2009 to
January 2010, a consultant: (i) worked with the Mining Revenue Task Force on application of
the fiscal models; (ii) provided training to MC, IRS, and Parliamentarians; and (iii) assisted with
the Minerals Commission in creating new financial reporting forms for mining companies
(which will facilitate the collection of information to continuously update the fiscal models).
Regarding the Macro Model, the MC is to update the portion that pertains to its fee regime
(Table 5).

Component 3: Mainstreaming Environment into Growth


87.     Intended Outcomes of NREG under this component include: Improved cross sectoral
coordination for environmental management through SEA review of new policies, and
establishment and operation of a new inter-ministerial forum on environment (the Environment
and Natural Resources Advisory Council ­ ENRAC); organized and functional national
environmental institutions; ; improved national environmental monitoring and reporting through
an environmental M&E system in place and operational; strengthened EPA regional and district
offices to undertake SEAs and EIAs; investment in climate change adaptation and mitigation
integrated in national budget and planning processes; and a strengthened national system for
environmental impact assessment, with an updated legislative instrument on SEA, and improved
processing of EIA applications. Outcomes expected on conclusion of the NREG DPO series (i.e.,
after three years), and after five years are detailed and quantified in Annex 2.

88.     Progress to date. 2009 was an important year for Ghana's environmental and climate
change institutions, with significant progress made in all areas of policy reform under DPO-2.
Of particular importance was the re-establishment of the Ministry of Environment, Science and
Technology following an eight-year hiatus of the presence of this ministry in the administration.
This has provided additional opportunity for enhanced reforms, and the need for clarification of
the roles and responsibilities of the institutions responsible for environmental management.
While progress has been satisfactory, some aspects of the program are particularly challenging,
such as the emerging petroleum industry and the new frontier of climate change, which are
subject to political and international influence. The Environment and Natural Resources
Advisory Council (ENRAC), planned for inauguration in 2010, will become a very important
entity to ensure that critical environmental issues affecting economic growth can be raised at the
highest level. Significantly, MEST and EPA are now both recognized in the national budget,
with 2010 operating budgets. On climate change, Ghana's capacity was overloaded by the
volume of tasks in preparation for UNFCCC COP15 and the design of new programs on disaster
risk management and adaptation. Nevertheless, the Government is moving toward a
comprehensive approach to climate change that will include adaptation and low-carbon growth,
and enabling measures, in line with international practice. In addition, following COP 15,
Development Partners have strengthened their own coordination with Ghana on climate change,
which is expected to enhance the quality and timeliness of results in 2010. (See Annex 3 for
additional details on progress made to date).

89.     Areas of Focus in the DPO-3. The environment matrix includes six focus areas for DPO-
3, described below (see Annex 4 for details):

        Cross-sectoral natural resource and environmental management and partnerships:
DPO-3 will support GoG actions to improve cross sectoral coordination, policy coherence and
integration of environment into policies, programs and budgets. Finalization of the Sustainable
Development Action Plan initiated under DPO-2 will help inform the plans of sector agencies, as
                                                42
well as long term development planning by NDPC. DPO-3 will also support the formalization of
the Inter-ministerial forum, now named the "Environment and Natural Resources Advisory
Council" (ENRAC), which is expected to include climate change and use of strategic
environmental assessments (in particular for the petroleum industry) in sector planning.

       Strategic Planning for Environmental Institutions: Following the establishment of the
Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology in early 2009, the government is in the
process of refining the organization to become an effective ministry. MEST now has a draft
organizational chart, with key entities listed including the Ghana Environmental Conventions
Coordinating Authority (GECCA), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR),
EPA, Town & Country Planning Department, Policy & Strategy Unit, Science and Technology
Unit, Research Unit, and Administrative Unit. Under DPO-3, it is expected that institutional
functions (for policies, regulations, implementation, and M&E) of MEST will be approved by
Head of Civil Service (Management Services Division).

         National Environmental Monitoring and Reporting: The Ghana Environment Sector
Study (GESS) identifies a number of ongoing environmental monitoring, data collection, and
information management activities. However, data are not yet systematically collected, stored,
analyzed, or shared across agencies and among districts. A consolidated reporting system is
needed to provide information that can be made accessible to relevant national, sectoral and
district agencies, as well as civil society. This will be particularly important at decentralized
levels to assist in early warning of climate change related events and other natural hazards and
potential disasters (including chemical and toxic waste hazards that the Environmental Protection
Agency has successfully averted in the past). Reinforcing environmental monitoring and
information management will enable more regular reporting on the state of the environment and
the costs of environmental degradation. Agreeing on mechanisms for public access to
environmental information will also enhance both public awareness and engagement on policy
development and implementation. DPO-3 will conclude work on the development of indicators
for the Sustainable Development Action Plan as well as a progressive integration of cost of
environmental degradation information into the database on the state of the environment to track
the impact of environmental degradation.

       Decentralized Environmental Management: The Environmental Protection Agency's
key service delivery process is the EIA, which results in the issuance of permits and certificates
as well as monitoring of compliance with Environmental Management Plans. The demand for
permits and certificates has been growing steadily. Applications for permits and certificates
increased from 515 in 2002 to 1,555 in 2005, with about 50 percent coming from within the
Greater Accra region, highlighting the importance of the Agency's decentralized strategy for
EIA permitting. Under DPO-3, piloting of an on-line EIA registration system will be
undertaken. Also under DPO-3, the capacity to apply Strategic Environmental Assessment,
including full disclosure and consultation, will be developed in an additional 20% of Districts
and mainstreamed in District Medium Term Development Plans, which will be supported by the
decentralized EPA capacity achieved under DPO-2.

       Climate Change: The importance and urgency of addressing climate change has been
recognized by policymakers in Ghana, but a more systematic response across GoG remains to be

                                               43
finalized, following new concepts emerging during 2009 and following COP 15. A considerable
increase in awareness on climate change was accomplished in 2009, across the media, key
MDAs, civil society and the general public. A draft adaptation strategy was produced by EPA
staff and national consultants and was being made ready for submission to Cabinet with
supporting policy briefs prior to the National Climate Change Forum in December 2009. This
will be updated to reflect sector plans and objectives, the findings from new analysis, such as the
study on the Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change, and a new UNDP program on
adaptation. The President announced Ghana's intent to develop a low carbon growth plan at the
Copenhagen UNFCCC Summit. Positioning Ghana to avail of international support will require
incorporation of the outcomes of UNFCCC negotiations and related processes, and new
opportunities for addressing adaptation, and low-carbon growth, including energy efficiency, and
REDD+. Increasingly, emphasis is being placed on achieving development objectives that are
affected by, or affect, climate variability and change. With the advent of new climate financing
mechanisms and systematic work by other developing countries, progress is required on several
supporting elements simultaneously to enable Ghana to draw on new resources and to prepare
and implement effective climate responses. Key amongst these are mechanisms for measuring,
reporting and verification, managing fiduciary risk and budgetary allocation of scaled-up
resources, building core institutional capacity and compiling evidence and tools to underpin
practice. The Minister of Finance and Economic Planning has also announced in April 2010 the
establishment of dedicated capacity to enable the Ministry to engage with carbon finance and to
make informed decisions on integrating climate change into national planning and budgetary
processes. The Government's comprehensive approach to climate change will include adaptation
and low-carbon growth in line with best practice32. It is expected that a consolidated "National
Framework for climate change" will be submitted to Cabinet during 2010, under DPO-3.

        National Environmental Assessment System: In 2003, in connection with the
formulation of GPRS I, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Development
Planning Commission led a number of SEAs. Subsequently, GoG decided to build the capacity
to develop SEA at the district level, focusing on pilots in selected districts, and to introduce SEA
to selected key sectors such as energy, water, and agriculture, as well as to build capacity across
a broad range of stakeholders to ensure they play an effective role in these processes. Following
the series of successful events in 2009 in the Oil SEA area, it is expected that the findings will be
mainstreamed into sector implementation (including resource requirements) for environmentally
responsible management in the oil sectors. This will be a priority area for the environment sector
under DPO-3.

90. Status of DPO-3 Prior Actions. The two prior actions for DPO-3 focused on climate
change and a strategic environmental assessment on oil. Regarding climate change, this prior
action has been dropped, as it is has been superseded (and therefore no longer relevant) under the
new government's policy framework for climate change. A draft national climate change


32
   Proposed objectives agreed in principle by the Minister for Environment, Science and Technology are: 1.
Adaptation/resilience/disaster risk reduction; 2. low carbon development, including REDD+; 3. financing
mechanisms; 4. knowledge and research; 5. MRV and communications; 6. cooperation and voice ­ widening
constituencies (international and national, including Parliament and civil society, regional bodies, negotiations); 7.
social dimensions and poverty, including gender; and 8. institutions and capacity building.

adaptation strategy was produced by EPA in 2009, and a concept for low-carbon growth was
produced ahead of the COP15. However, under the new government, and to reflect a more
comprehensive approach to climate change, and confirmed by the President's Office, these
strategies will be merged into a new "National Framework for Climate Change" and updated to
incorporate sector plans as well as reflect the findings of new analyses, such as economics of
adaptation to climate change, outcomes of UNFCCC COP 15, new opportunities for addressing
adaptation, new approaches for low-carbon growth, including energy efficiency, and REDD+.
The `National Framework for Climate Change' is expected to be submitted to Cabinet by end of
2010. Regarding the SEA on oil, several factors led to some delayed progress, particularly due
to the transition of the EPA to a new ministry following the change of Government and cross-
institutional delays on development of oil and gas policy and supporting measures. Despite these
challenges, the Ministry of Energy and MEST are fully engaged in the SEA process and have
made significant progress under DPO-2. In September 2009, there were two opportunities for
Ghana to learn from experiences of other countries on environment and oil, first through a
Ministerial-level study tour to Norway and The Netherlands, and then in the context of a Bank
and Norway sponsored seminar, hosted by Ghana, on Environmental Governance and the Oil
Sector, with participants from 12 countries. In addition, public hearings were held in six districts
in November 2009, and a needs assessment workshop on Oil and Environment was held in
December 2009, with a resulting draft SEA on Oil completed in March 2010. This draft SEA is
being reviewed with stakeholders prior to its finalization, expected by end of 2010. The Energy
and Environment Ministries will incorporate the SEA findings into their emerging policy
frameworks, and EA guidelines for oil and an updated oil spill contingency plan have also been
prepared (Table 6).

                          VI        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION


              A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

91.    Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA). A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment
(PSIA) exercise was undertaken in 2008 to inform NREG DPO-2 and provide policy makers and
other stakeholders with information on the range of actors engaged in the natural resource
management debate in Ghana. Government, civil society, private sector and DPs were consulted
as part of this initiative. The PSIA provided new inputs on stakeholders' perceptions of, and
engagement with, the NREG program. It also identified some of the key risks confronting
NREG implementation and identified core strategies for mitigating these risks. The outcomes of
the PSIA are provided in Box 3.

92.     However, Government and DPs generally recognize that considerably more information
is needed to enhance and deepen understanding of the poverty and social impacts of NREG. To
these ends, a second phase Social Impact Assessment is proposed, so the findings can inform the
implementation of DPO-3 and remaining years of the GoG program. This new Assessment will
focus specifically on social accountability issues in the mining and forestry sectors and will offer
practical recommendations that could be instituted to build demand-side governance capacity in
communities and stakeholder groups who are likely to impacted most by mining and forestry
activities. It will also try to determine whether risks identified in the original PSIA have been
mitigated, and whether any further issues need to be considered.




                                                     46
                           Box 3: Outcomes of Stakeholder and Risk Analysis
Stakeholders. Three sectors are covered by the NREG Program and have a wide range of stakeholders. In
addition to government (e.g., Forestry Commission, Minerals Commission, EPA, etc.), primary stakeholders
include communities, Traditional Authorities, Stools, large corporate entities, small and micro-enterprises,
artisanal miners, and chainsaw operators. Many local-level actors, while impacted by policies, are distant from
the policy process and not sufficiently involved or adequately consulted in decision-making. The result has in
large part been disinterest or opposition, which in the medium-term could generate conflict. Important
stakeholders, such as CSOs and the media, have not always been sufficiently consulted and engaged in policy
decisions in the three sectors. The NREG program has offered a significant opportunity for, and has
engendered, an elaborate stakeholder engagement process among GoG, DPs, CSOs, and primary stakeholders at
all levels.
Risks. Five principal risks have been identified: (a) institutional risks (caused by weak institutions, limited
capacity, and lack of resources); (b) increased social conflict; (c) increased poverty and vulnerability; (d)
reduced investment and growth; and (e) climate change impacts. Social conflict is at the heart of the risk
scenario. The underpinning causes of social conflict include: (i) discretionary power due to weak, confusing, or
in some areas non-existent rights, (ii) weak policy, legislative, and regulatory frameworks; (iii) inadequate
access rights, incentives and compensations, (iv) unconventional enforcement practices, (v) human rights
abuses. For instance, the poor collection rates of taxes and revenues, and the rural elite capture of revenues can
lead to conflicts between the private sector, communities and the state and its agencies. Unclear guidelines, for
example on compensation for displacement or damage to prime community-based resources (e.g., water) have
led to mistrust, which in turn leads to frustration, and occasionally proceeds to violence. The consequences of
social conflicts can be devastating in terms of international reputation, reduced investments, and Ghana's
progress toward the MDGs.
Risk Mitigation Measures. Strategies identified for mitigating risks include:
- Meaningful, timely and effective consultation with communities,
- Community based monitoring systems built into the enhanced policy and regulatory frameworks for mining
and forestry sectors.
- Social protection arrangements to support compensation and displacement packages for poor people during
transition periods to ensure they have adequate livelihoods..
- A realistic and comprehensive, macro-level "alternative livelihood" strategy, incorporating responsibilities
and approaches across several MDAs.
- A systematic review of all current skills development and social protection packages to see how these can be
broadened and transferred to rural communities that are negatively impacted (in terms of livelihoods) by tighter,
more rigorously enforced, regulatory environments in forestry and mining
- Actively involve forest-dependent communities by clarifying and securing their tenure, property, and carbon
rights and removing barriers to transparent, inclusive and accountable forest governance.
- Increasing the share of benefits accruing to local communities from both the mining and forest sectors
- Increased transparency and accountability concerning the sharing of revenues

                  B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

93. Environmental Impacts. An overarching objective of the NREG program is to achieve
positive environmental impacts. However, there is a possibility that some outcomes could lead to
unintended negative effects if insufficient due diligence to environmental impact is pursued
during implementation. For example: (a) new investment in the forest and wildlife and mining
sectors; or (b) diversification of the mineral production base leading to increased mineral
exploitation. However, NREG reduces risks by heightening attention to environmental impacts.
Also review of environmental implications of targets and triggers that could entail risk of
environmental damage is undertaken during annual progress reviews and during ongoing sector
dialog. Additionally, Ghana's experience of SEA has also been reviewed to consolidate good
practice and inform inter-sectoral planning and implementation.

94.      Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA). Ghana's experience of SEA practice and
institutionalization of this approach is under independent review and will inform the
consolidation of country systems to address such concerns. The evolution of the NREG sector
budget support has attracted considerable favorable attention from the OECD-DAC Taskforce on
SEA and Environment in 2008, as well as in the World Bank-convened workshop on Country
Environmental Analysis.33


                 C. IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION

95.     NREG Steering Committee. GoG has established a high-level NREG Steering
Committee, which meets at the Ministerial level (MoFEP, Ministry of Lands and Natural
Resources, and Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology) for the purpose of taking
policy and strategic decisions needed to implement the NREG program.

96.     NREG Technical Coordination Committee. This committee supported by a Technical
Secretariat, and provides guidance and facilitates overall policy dialogue, coordinates cross-
cutting issues, and organizes annual reviews of the NREG-PAF. The Technical Coordination
Committee is led by MoFEP (with MoFEP also responsible for the Technical Secretariat) and
includes representatives of the relevant MDAs and the National Development Planning
Commission (NDPC).

97.    The ENR Sector Group. This group consists of all DPs intervening in the ENR sectors.
The group is chaired by the Government. The purpose of the ENR sector group is to ensure a full
donor harmonized approach to the environment and natural resources sector.


98.     Annual Sector Reviews. The ENR Sector Group is used as a forum to address issues
related to the NREG program, and the annual sector review of the ENR Sector Group contributes


33
     The EPA hosted in May 2009 the conference of the International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA), and
     featured many Ghana and NREG-related presentations and discussions, including strategic environmental
     assessment for oil and Social Impact Assessment.

                                                        48
to the NREG (and related MDBS) performance assessment process, in line with the annual
budget cycle. As with the MDBS, the NREG Technical Coordination Committee and DPs have
agreed to hold at least two joint meetings per year: one in the first semester to discuss the results
of the annual review of the NREG PAF, and one in the second semester to update the PAF for
the following years; discuss the execution of the annual work plans and budgets of the MDAs
involved in the NREG program during the first half of the year; review the audit reports as
regards the previous year; and discuss special policy, strategy, and reform issues. All NREG
consultations and assessments will be open to all DPs who are a member of the ENR Sector
Group, whether or not they provide sectoral budget support.

99.    Modalities for DP Disbursement. Actual disbursements by DPs for the NREG program
could be less than the amounts programmed if the joint assessment exercise reveals that prior
actions and targets in the PAF have not been achieved. The overall set up of the disbursement
modalities is spelled out in the Framework Memorandum (Annex 5). Detailed disbursement
arrangements for each DP are reflected in individual financing agreements. All NREG
disbursements are contingent upon satisfactory progress in the implementation of the GPRS II
and satisfactory IMF assessment of the macroeconomic framework, as expressed in the
MDBS/PRSC dialogue. DP disbursements are aligned with the budget cycle and, in line with the
Framework Memorandum, commitment amounts for the coming year are estimated and
conveyed to GoG ahead of budget preparation for the coming year. The main modalities of DP
disbursement are as follows:

EKN and DFID: both agencies disburse single annual tranches, on the basis of a satisfactory
holistic assessment of the three matrices. Satisfactory progress with VPA implementation is
particularly important for DFID.

AFD: AFD disburses, after a holistic review of the PAF, a single annual performance tranche
based on the assessment of the triggers of the forestry matrix, although the funds will not be ear-
marked specifically for the sub-sector related to these triggers (e.g., forestry).

EC: the EC will disburse single tranches for the financial years 2009 and 2010, based on one
trigger per sub-sector, selected among the triggers agreed in the PAF.

IDA: the Bank will disburse a single annual tranche based on satisfactory implementation of the
overall Government program in the three sectors, with a special emphasis on prior actions
highlighted in the PAF.

100. National M&E Framework. The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)
has monitored the implementation of the GPRS II (2006 -2009) and has taken charge of
formulation of the Medium-Term National Development Policy Framework (2010-2013) as well
as the monitoring and evaluation. The NDPC has issued guidelines for sectoral as well as district
M&E systems in Ghana and is currently reviewing these guidelines through a consultative and
participatory process. Accordingly, MDAs and DPs work closely with NDPC to ensure that the
NREG M&E arrangements are aligned with core national indicators and the sectors' reporting
requirements. Under the MDBS PAF for 2009, the production of annual progress reports for six
ministries has become a trigger which strengthens the national M & E system. Under the
leadership of MoFEP, M&E systems for natural resources and environmental governance will be

                                                 49
aligned and harmonized with the national M&E framework and will build on the guidelines
produced by NDPC. A consolidated approach to development of M&E within the NREG MDAs
has been taken, and sectoral M&E systems for the two parent ministries under NREG are
currently under development. It will include not only the three participating institutions in the
NREG program but also all the other commissions and agencies under the Ministry of Lands and
Natural Resources and the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology.

101. NREG M&E Framework. The first step in the development of the sectoral M&E
systems is the M&E plan which outlines the policy objectives, baselines, targets and indicators,
as well as data acquisition and reporting methods, and the responsible institutions. It will outline
critical assumptions and key risks, and how information will be used, e.g., for strategic decision
making, better planning and budgeting, improved implementation and reporting, accountability
and transparency, or combinations thereof. The M&E plan will incorporate participatory
methods for data collection and analysis, systems for data processing and storage and
presentation of data. It will also define institutional arrangements, job descriptions, incentives,
training needs, as well as a communication strategy to ensure that information on the status and
impacts of GoG's program to improve natural resource management and environmental
governance reaches key stakeholders and the general public. The plan is expected to be
completed in 2010 and then implemented by all participating MDAs in a coordinated manner.
Additional tools, such as enhancing GoG's capacity to track the cost of environmental
degradation, will also be key to tracking progress on overarching NREG program objectives.
Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) is a particular requirement for access to
international support on climate change, including REDD+.

102. Annual NREG Assessment. More specific to the year-on-year tracking of progress under
the NREG program, M&E is undertaken through the annual environment and natural resources
sector review, which is led by GoG, as well as via the joint GoG-DP annual assessment of prior
actions and triggers in the PAF. A set of three year and five year outcomes has been developed
by each sector agency to track progress on policy objectives and outcomes (Annex 2). Following
DPO-3, the Bank's Implementation Completion and Results Report for the first NREG DPO
series will draw on the mid-term review of GoG's five-year program, being supported by the
Netherlands and DFID in mid-2010. If steady progress under the first DPO series is observed and
GoG remains committed to the long-term reform agenda that NREG is addressing, it is likely
that the Bank will remain a committed partner in the sector. The ICR will include an assessment
of appropriate instruments for continued Bank engagement in the NREG sectors, as well as
identify potential risks to achievement of intended outcomes of the government's five year
program, and sustaining the policy reforms established under the series. Conclusions will help
the Bank determine its best approach to continued engagement in both the NREG program as
well as in the related sectors.

103. Mid Term Review EKN, AFD and the EU will continue their support for NREG through
2012. DfID will design a multi-country instrument during 2010 that will enable continued
support. It has already committed £1.4 million for technical assistance on climate change and
environmental governance through 2012 that will leverage other resources on climate change and
REDD+. In July 2010 a joint DP Mid Term Review will assess progress in the NRE sector in
meeting objectives and targets of the NREG Statement of Policies on Natural resources and the


                                                50
Environment and associated annual NREG-PAFs, and will identify constraints and opportunities
for improving performance. The findings of the review will be used to inform Government and
DPs on the strategic direction and implementation of NREG by Government.


             D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

103. Public Financial Management: Ghana's fiduciary environment is considered adequate
for development policy lending. As reported in the ERPFM 2009 and the Draft PEFA 2009
reports, Ghana is gearing itself to building a strong foundation towards achieving aggregate
fiscal discipline, based on positive developments in the following areas: (a) prevalent low levels
of unreported extra-budgetary expenditure; (b) good and timely public access to key fiscal
information; (c) adherence to a fixed and coherent budget calendar; (d) high average debt
collection ratios for tax arrears and regular and timely revenue transfers to the Consolidated
Fund; (e) comprehensive recording, reconciliation and reporting of debt service and on the debt
portfolio; (f) predictable budget support disbursements; (f) timely in-year budget implementation
reports and annual financial reports; and (g) improved effectiveness and timely external audit
scrutiny. Building on the PEFA 2006 and the ERPFM 2006 reports, the latest reports further
confirm that Ghana has built a solid legal and regulatory framework and foundation for public
financial management that performs at an average level and occasionally above-average
standards.

104. However, the overall fiduciary control environment, according to the latest assessments,
continue to suffer from failures to (a) apply the guiding principles of a well structured
consolidated cash management system, in a Treasury Single Account mode, for all public
expenditures supported under the budget, (b) fully implement commitment accounting and
controls and hence document, report on, and minimize the potentials for, expenditure arrears ­
arrears that add to the distortion of macro-fiscal stability, (c) provide a consolidated fiscal picture
in respect of revenues and expenditures against the five separate and distinct funds of the
government; and (d) adopt and implement a Government Finance Statistics (GFSM2001) chart
of classification for budgeting, accounting and fiscal reporting, that is uniform across all
government formations.

105. As the trend towards a more widespread use of country systems looks increasingly
promising, upgrading, stabilizing, and rolling-out of a fully integrated financial management
information system for government budget management is critical to sustaining success in both
the maintenance of fiscal discipline and the effective and timely monitoring of overall
government finances. To this end, the GoG has initiated and approved a new PFM improvement
Charter ­ called the GIFMIS Charter ­ that outlines the framework that the government has
adopted, and seeks to implement on priority basis, aimed at reversing the key inherent
weaknesses in its fiduciary control environment. The Charter, which has the full government
ownership and unflinching commitment at the highest level, will address the key challenges
involved in the budgeting, accounting, and reporting systems, processes, and practices across
government. In addition, to support improved cash management, the CAGD has implemented a
form of `treasury realignment' that provides for integrating the treasuries as part of the
administrative control of MDAs and MMDAs, while retaining the recruitment and positing
powers of the accounting staff.

                                                  51
106. A summary assessment of the country's budget credibility and the quality of financial
reporting is found, based on the outcomes of the ERPFM (2009) and Draft PEFA (2009), in Box
4.




                                            52
                         Box 4: Ghana's Public Financial Management System: Key Findings
Credibility of the Budget. Actual primary expenditure compared with budgeted expenditure shows significant deviations at
both the aggregate level and at the level of individual Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Aggregate deviation
for 2008 was a high of 34.2%. Expenditure compositional variance has favorably shown a reducing trend during the last 3
years (see Table below). The largely ineffective establishment control and commitment controls, complicated further by
unpredictable budget releases, undermine efforts to maintain expenditure within budget ceilings. High expenditure arrears,
discovered at mid-term budget review, have contributed to further weakening the credibility of the budget. The improved
realism in revenue budgeting was however reported to have cushioned the impact of reduced overall budget credibility.
Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. While the budget documentation is fairly complete, comprehensible
and comprehensive, and is made publicly available, the budget classification system is not yet fully GFS compliant and is
incapable of directly supporting a functional outcome budgeting process. This is notwithstanding the fact that the
categorization of the administrative classification elements allows some linkage to the National Development Strategic
Framework. Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations also requires improvement.
Policy-based Budget. While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years ­ in as much as the approaches
instituted remain severely constrained ­ Ghana's performance is held back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack of
effective wage bill planning, and the absence of a transparent link between planned and executed budget activities. The
underlying institutional arrangements to support a policy based budget process are absent despite the adoption of a single
stage coordinated budget process for recurrent and development budgets. Despite underlying weaknesses in its
implementation experience, the GoG has adopted a three-year Medium Term Expenditure Framework for its budgetary
processes.
Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. While Ghana's central government scores well overall with respect to
some aspects of revenue administration, debt management, payroll management and procurement, but overall predictability
and control in budget execution remains an area of concern. The areas of concern include the discretionary elements of the
legal and regulatory framework for revenue management, the controls in the taxpayer registration system, the predictability
in the availability of funds for the commitment of expenditures, the extent of consolidation of the government's bank cash
balances, the effectiveness of the establishment control, and the effectiveness of the commitment control. Cash
management remains a particular challenge to the PFM systems as well as the apparent lack of effective procurement
planning as part of the budget process. Although the legal and regulatory framework is clear on the controls for each of the
main steps of the procurement and expenditure cycle, these are not applied uniformly across all MDAs. The internal audit
units are well structured although their focus continues to include pre-audit functions as well ­ a factor that undermines
their independence.
Accounting, Recording and Reporting. Within 4 ­ 6 weeks after each month end, the CAGD-managed bank accounts are
reconciled, following clear guidelines and procedures contained in the Accounting Manual. For the other government
accounts, the retained IGF bank accounts and those related to development partner funded projects, these remain outside
this arrangement. The retained IGF accounts are reconciled quarterly in some ministries but at least annually for all in the
preparation of the final accounts. Suspense accounts are also reconciled and cleared, but annually, as part of the year end
closing of accounts. Data integrity however remains a source of concern, especially in the absence of full consolidation of
all government fund types. The monthly financial statements produced, within 4 ­ 6 weeks after month-end, do not report
on expenditure at the time of commitment but the actual expenditures alone. The presentation permits only a partial (non-
consolidated) comparison of revenues and expenditures to the original budget appropriations. Timeless in preparing the
Public Accounts (Consolidated Fund) is achieved as they are submitted within 3 months of end of fiscal year, and the
accounts are largely consistent with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) cash basis of financial
reporting. Accounting, recording, and reporting are predominantly paper-based.
External Scrutiny and Audit. Submission of audit reports to the legislature is now timely - within 3 months and 6 to 9
months after receipt of draft accounts for the consolidated fund and the MDAs respectively - and in the scope and nature of
audits performed is satisfactory, although much of risk-based focus is required despite audits being largely compliant with
international standards. Effective follow up on audit reports is only just beginning. With procedures for review of budget
documentation by the legislature being firmly established and respected in terms of available review time, the scope of the
scrutiny as well as the failure in respecting the rules for in-year budget adjustments hamper performance against this PFM
dimension. Examination and completion of reviews of audit reports by the Public Accounts Committee remain untimely.

107. At the sectoral level: Taking a cue from the performance of the national budget execution
systems, the Credibility of the Budget at MDA levels was, overall, poor due to a variety of
reasons. One, the predictability of budget releases to MDAs was undermined, historically, by the
very long delays in releases of budget allocations against items 3 & 4 of the budget. Two, the
weak linkage between sectoral plans and their costings impacted the timely implementation of
budgets and realization of the expected objectives in a variety of cases.

108. Regarding NREG agencies, while the overall timing of flows of funds was particularly
encouraging, the slower than expected implementation of strategies gave rise to excess carried-
forward budget balances. This has been facilitated by the less than stronger relationship between
the budget as approved in the responsible Ministry's overall budget and the budget approved by
the various Boards of the NREG agencies. The fact that the NREG's IGF estimates are not
properly aligned with those in the GoG's overall budget is one of the key reasons why the
budgets of the NREG agencies do not fully reconcile with those approved in the GoG budget.
The Table below demonstrates that the budget execution in the NREG agencies is fragmented
and that the budget compilation process needs reengineering to avoid big differences between
budgets (as prepared by agencies and redone by the Ministry) and outturns, during any fiscal
year. Budget execution rates of the three NREG agencies are provided in table 8. Because of the
low credibility of the budgets, as they are mentioned in the GoG budget, budget execution rates
vary a lot. The credibility of the budgets made by the agencies themselves is much higher. EKN
has provided biannual support for MDAs to help take stock and provide guidance for improving
Public Finance Management within the NREG MDAs and MoFEP. Further support will focus on
forward planning in the context of comprehensive strategies and multiannual plans and budgets.

109. Apart from the poor estimation of the expenditure budgets of agencies in the GoG
budget, the low budget credibility arose out of additional factors, including (a) intermittent cash
flow problems at the Treasury level; (b) lack of adequate implementation capacity at the MDA-
level; (c) failure to integrate procurement planning in the budget process; and (d) changes in
priorities at the government level regarding how to allocate available resources. Strengthening
budget preparation of the MDAs through the multi-annual budgetary frameworks, including all
available resources, and better comprehensive reporting is needed, as well as better budget
execution.

110. An agreement on the NREG program includes a commitment by GoG to provide a
comprehensive overview of all expenditures of the MDAs concerned on a yearly basis within
three months after the closure of the financial year. Therefore, timely, comprehensive, and
reliable reporting on actual annual expenditures is a crucial element of monitoring NREG
program implementation.

111. Treasury Realignment. To address issues emanating from cash management, the
Controller and Accountant General Department (CAGD) has integrated treasuries into the
Finance/Accounts Division of MDAs and Metropolitan Municipal and District Assemblies
(MMDAs). Highlights of realignment include (a) Treasury staff to be part of MDA; (b) day-to-
day administration of Treasury functions to be within the purview of MDA management; and (c)
CAGD will continue to be responsible for the recruitment and posting of accounting staff to the
MDAs and MMDAs.

112. Actions Taken by GoG. As part of the Public Sector Reform Program, GoG has aimed to
strengthen central government structures and organizations by introducing programs to make
them more efficient, effective, and private sector-friendly. PFM laws, namely, the Financial
Administration Act of 2003, the Internal Audit Agency Act of 2003, and the Public Procurement
Act of 2003, have been enacted to regulate the use of public funds. New approaches in the scope,
timing, and quality of reporting on budget management have also been introduced and the
Accounting Manual and Departmental Accounting Instructions updated.

113. NREG Policy Matrix and PFM. One of the objectives of the NREG program is to
improve PFM as it relates to the three sectors (including accounting systems, audits, and revenue
collection). Annual dialog on the budget and indicative resource allocation to strategic priorities
is an accepted part of sector budget support practice. This will ultimately have the end-program
outcome of greater transparency of financial flows relevant to natural resources and environment
sectors, more efficient and effective use of available funds, and an increased level of budget
allocation and revenue collection. Targets related to this objective can draw upon ERPFM
diagnostic work, which identifies short- and medium-term priority actions, as well as technical
assistance provided on a regular basis by EKN as regards strengthening financial management of
the MDAs involved in NREG. The Draft PEFA also highlights weaknesses in the PFM that the
GoG is committed to manage, using various intervention platforms, including GIFMIS, as a key
thrust of the reform implementation. Monitoring of budget execution will be done in parallel
with MDBS/PRSC supervision missions, with the MDBS/PRSC focusing on aggregate fiscal
spending and the NREG program focusing on the implementation of the individual budget
programs of the relevant MDAs.


                                                55
114. Independent Auditing. The 2009 PEFA report concludes that the audit reports of the
Auditor General, as related to the Consolidated Fund, are of reasonable quality, and that the
performance in regards to the timeliness of the audits of the Consolidated Fund and MDAs has
also improved markedly over the last two fiscal years ­ 2007 and 2008. The audit reports for
both of these fiscal years were submitted to the Parliament within 3 months of the receipt of the
draft Accounts from the CAGD ­ i.e., 6 months after the close of the fiscal year. In respect of
MMDAs however, the average submission timeline achieved was 9 months after the end of the
fiscal year. There is therefore scope for further improvement in the coverage of audit as well as
the timeliness for completion of the MMDA audits.

115. Internal Auditing. Following the passage of the Internal Audit Agency Act in 2003,
progress has been encouraging, with the establishment of Internal Audit Units in MDAs and
MMDAs and the submission of quality reports. Under the Act, audit reports and implementation
committees have been created in spending ministries and departments with responsibility of
following up internal and external audit findings. The current business process for `BPEMS'
requires the Internal Auditors to approve transactions in the system before a payment is made;
this weakens their independence. There is a need therefore to shift the focus of Internal Auditing
from pre-payment audit to adoption of risk-based audit concentrating on systemic issues with the
objectives of ensuring (a) conformity to GoG's strategy; (b) effectiveness and efficiency of
operations; (c) reliability of financial reporting; and (d) compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. To meet this objective the major challenge facing the Internal Audit Agency is
attraction and retention of suitably qualified auditors. The Agency has made proposals to the
Head of Civil Service and MoFEP for a special scheme of service for Internal Auditors so that
the required skills and competencies to perform specialized audits can be attracted.

116. Foreign exchange Control Environment. Under the Fund's safeguards assessment
policy, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) has been subject to an update assessment with respect to a new
PRGF arrangement approved July 15 2009; the assessment, completed on December 2, 2009,
followed an initial safeguards assessment from October 2003. The update assessment found that
while the safeguards framework of the BoG has been strengthened in several areas since then,
new risks in governance oversight emerged with the removal of the former Board in January
2009, and a delay, due to a legal challenge, in the start of the successor Board. Pending the
resumption of Board activities some interim measures have been introduced to provide an
independent oversight mechanism. These include the introduction of an Advisory Panel
comprised of three outside members responsible for the external and internal audit and controls
systems. In March 2010, the authorities have advised staff that a new Board has been appointed.
They have also either committed to or implemented all measures proposed by staff.

117. Procurement. A new Public Procurement Act came into force in 2004 providing the legal
framework for a public procurement system based on transparent and fair competition, and clear
and comprehensive procurement procedures and regulations. A Public Procurement Board (PPB)
assigned to monitor the application of the new law and to regulate public procurement became
operational in October 2005. The 2009 ERPFM includes an assessment of Ghana's procurement
practices. The review concluded that the legal and institutional foundations for sound public
procurement are now in place in Ghana, but that continued efforts still need to be made to build


                                               56
capacity and institutionalize the processes now laid down in all the ministries, departments and
agencies of the Government. While part of the challenge is on the supply side ­ creating a cadre
of experienced procurement professionals ­ the PPB assessments also point towards a demand
side problem that ultimately has to be addressed, namely the low status senior management
assigns to the procurement function. Although entities are more aware that there is a well defined
set of rules for public procurement, watched over by the PPB and statutorily enforced, many are
still not giving the procurement function the importance it deserves. This in turn is part of a
larger issue discussed regarding the priority given to all aspects of PFM, and the recognition that
PFM is not just about rules compliance, but a vital underpinning of public entity performance.

118. Monitoring public procurement practices. The draft 2009 ERPFM strongly supports the
continued use of the PPB's procurement assessment tool, the PPME. Of particular interest is the
proportion of public procurement subject to open, competitive bidding on a transaction basis,
which in the 2007 report declined to only about one-quarter, down from around one-half in the
2006 report.34 These two estimates however are not entirely comparable. The 2006 sample was
skewed toward larger public sector entities, more likely to follow competitive processes, while
the sample of entities reviewed in the 2007 assessment appears to be more representative,
containing a large number of entities procuring smaller amounts and therefore relying
disproportionally on price quotation as a procurement method.35 This information will continue
therefore to draw increasing attention. There are two main reasons why. First, the share of
procurement following competitive procedures is a critical measure of the effectiveness of the
system as a whole. Second, given donor interest in the greater use of country systems, it will be
important to measure and track the ratio of open and competitive bidding to total procurement on
a total value basis. The review recommends therefore that the proportion of public procurement
that is open to competitive bidding be monitored by value. The most important improvement to
procurement practice needs however to go beyond actions by the PPB and include clear
incentives and sanctions by MoFEP. The first step is to have final public procurement plans for
the MDAs submitted to the Public Procurement Board (PPB) soon after the approval of the
appropriation law by Parliament. These procurement plans would then provide the basis for
budget releases by CAGD to these MDAs.

119. Overall Fiduciary Environment: The GoG's commitment to widening and deepening the
pace and scope of reforms is exemplified by a range of actions already taken as well as by the
strategies mapped in the GIFMIS Charter, which are all geared to further consolidating on the



34
   In either case, Ghana still ranks below the threshold for an A score under the PEFA methodology, which requires
   that more than 75 percent of the procurement contracts be awarded on an open competitive basis. An A, B, or C
   score requires that either more than 50 percent, or less than 50 percent of the procurement contracts, respectively,
   be awarded on an open competitive basis. This means that while in 2006 Ghana was on the borderline between a
   B and C score, in 2007 Ghana scored a clear C on the PEFA indicator for `competition, value for money and
   controls in procurement' (PI-19 indicator). The PEFA ranking for this same indicator for other countries in Africa
   is the following: Rwanda, A; Mauritius, B+; Kenya, B; Cote d'Ivoire, C. Rwanda ranks particularly high under
   this indicator with 82 percent of contract in 2006 awarded on the basis of open competition, accounting for 73
   percent of the total value of contracts above the threshold awarded during that year.
35
    For instance, half of the entities in the sample in the 2007 assessment (258 out of 515 entities) were located
   outside the regional capitals, while none of the entities were located outside the regional capitals in the 2006
   assessment.

                                                         57
achievements made in the area of PFM improvement across government as a whole. As a partner
in the work leading to the results highlighted in the analytical work already done in Ghana (for
example the ERPFM and draft PEFA of 2009), the GoG is determined to pursue reforms geared
to reversing the PFM weaknesses identified in those reports, in concert with development
partners. The key focus at this stage is to fast-track the design and implementation of a GIFMIS
project ­ being the thrust of the country's PFM reform platform - that will provide the necessary
systems and controls supportive of entrenching stronger expenditure management principles and
practices across government. Reform successes in the area of public procurement are also quite
encouraging as revealed by the PPA's use of the Public Procurement Model of Excellence
(PPME) as a self-assessment tool. As against a target of 80% set by PRSC7 and MDBS 8 for
assessment of performance of high spending entities in public procurement in 2007, actual
performance realized were 97.55%, 95.20%, and 81.63% respectively for (a) `use of appropriate
procurement methods', (b) publication of tender notices', and (c) publication of award of
contracts'.

120. In conclusion, and based also on the mitigated risks associated with the manner the Bank
of Ghana manages the country's foreign exchange reserves as highlighted by the latest published
IMF Safeguards Assessment, the overall fiduciary risk of the operation is rated `modest'.

             E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

121. Recipient and Financing Agreement. This proposed Credit, amounting to SDR 6.6
million (about US$10 million), would be made to the Republic of Ghana, represented by the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, in a single tranche.

122. Funds flow arrangements: The Government of Ghana shall identify a Foreign Exchange
Account with the Bank of Ghana and which forms part of the country's official foreign exchange
reserves, into which the proceeds of each of the Credit will be disbursed upon meeting the agreed
prior actions and upon Credit effectiveness. The Cedis equivalent of the funds in the Account
will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund of the Government of
Ghana held with the bank of Ghana which is used to finance budget expenditures.

123. Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund by the Government of Ghana shall not be
tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall be needed. The
proceeds of the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the negative list
as defined in the Schedule of the Development Credit Agreement. If any portion of the Credit is
used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule of the Credit Financing
Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount of the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such
request shall be cancelled from the Credit.

124. Assurance Requirements: Based on the modest fiduciary risk associated with the
operation, there will be no special fiduciary arrangements established for the Credit. However,
within 7 working days of disbursement of the Credit by IDA, the Recipient, through the Chief
Director of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, shall provide written confirmation
to IDA that the Cedis equivalent of the Credit has been received into the Consolidated Fund

                                               58
Account of the Government of Ghana, and the amount duly accounted for in the Recipient's
financial management system, together with information on the number of the bank account, the
date of the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to translate the Credit currency into Cedis. The
Bank will retain the option to seek an audit of the receipt and accounting of the disbursement, if
considered necessary.

             F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

125. Risks and risk mitigation measures are similar to those discussed in the program
document for DPO-1 and DPO-2, and are outlined below:

126. Risks of Weak PFM. There is a need to strengthen MDAs capacity to prepare credible
and comprehensive multi-year work plans that are accurately costed. Plans may not be translated
to realistic and credible budget estimates, under the MTEF as the costing framework has inherent
weakness due to weak capacities at MDAs. Technical assistance under the NREG program is
however helping to mitigate this risk by assisting MDAs to develop capacity and standardized
approaches to planning and budgeting.

127. Political. Natural resources in Ghana are highly political and contested, with a complex
institutional and contextual history. The NREG program is sensitive to this reality, and continues
to work to promote dialogue and positive interaction between relevant stakeholders to improve
natural resources and environmental governance through enhanced transparency and
accountability mechanisms. In addition, Ghana is one of eight case studies on the political
economy of natural resources being carried out by the Bank to try to better understand political
economy drivers behind the natural resource sector (the case study in Ghana is focusing on the
mining sector, with lessons to be learned for other natural resource sectors, including oil). With
the change of administration following closely contested elections in late 2008/early 2009,
GoG's commitment to the NREG program has not been questioned. The new administration is
committed to improving natural resources management in Ghana and views the NREG program
as a key component of this agenda. The proposed ministerial level Environment and Natural
Resources Advisory Council will further enable policy coherence and political ownership of this
agenda.

128. Macroeconomic Risks. Compared with a year the situation prevailing in late 2008, risks
of macroeconomic instability have declined sharply, as Government efforts and external support
has translated into higher foreign currency reserves, lower fiscal and current account deficits, a
stabilized exchange rate and a decelerating inflation rate. Risks nevertheless remain, given the
political feasibility of pursuing further fiscal adjustment through structural reforms, which could
possibly lead to insufficient GoG funds being made available to the NREG sectors. The
combination of the continued exceptional budget support from the World Bank and the IMF
program would mitigate these risks by providing support to the budget and balance of payments
and sending a strong signal to markets and Development Partners of Ghana's continued
commitment to bringing its fiscal stance to a sound and sustainable track.

129. Financial. Delays in the release of funds to the MDAs (either by MoFEP or by the line
ministries once funds are transferred to them by MoFEP) is a potential risk that DPs closely

                                                59
monitor in the context of implementing the NREG PFM action plan, which is aimed at
improving MDA planning and budgeting. Conversely, implementation capacity of the NREG
agencies may delay effective utilization of funds when GoG budgetary allocations are increased.
While timely releases of funds may reduce the chances of this occurrence, the NREG agencies
may also require technical assistance to facilitate the effective implementation of the NREG
programs.

130. Environmental. An overarching objective of the NREG program is to achieve positive
environmental impacts. However, there is a possibility that some outcomes could lead to
unintended negative effects if insufficient due diligence to environmental impact is pursued
during implementation. For example: (a) new investment in the forest and wildlife and mining
sectors; or (b) diversification of the mineral production base leading to increased mineral
exploitation. However, NREG reduces risks by heightening attention to environmental impacts.
Also environmental implications of targets and triggers that could entail risk of environmental
damage is undertaken during annual progress reviews and during ongoing sector dialog.
Additionally, Ghana's experience of SEA has been reviewed to consolidate good practice and
inform inter-sectoral planning and implementation.

131. Social. An overarching objective of NREG is to address social issues in forest and
mining communities. Forestry, mining, and environmental resources are highly contested in
Ghana. There is a risk that benefits will be captured by elites, or reforms blocked by entrenched
interest groups. There is also a risk that, without adequate technical support, communities and
key stakeholder groups, whose livelihoods stand to be most affected by changes, will fail to
effectively use their "voice" to make their concerns and demands known, and fail to have any
role in informing policy development. Social accountability and transparency require joint-
decision making, and without this stakeholder participation will be constrained and the enabling
environment for inclusive natural resources governance remains weak. The potential for social
conflict may be reduced if sound and clear efforts are made to increase the share of benefits
accruing to local communities. This increase in benefit shares by the communities will need to
be matched by demand-side governance capacity building in communities and affected
stakeholder groups. It is very important that forest-dependent communities are engaged in
planning processes, clarifying and securing tenure, property, and carbon rights, and that barriers
to transparent, inclusive and accountable forest governance are removed. Without sufficient
efforts in these areas, there is real risk that social conflict may increase as distributional
asymmetries become more evident. The proposed Social Assessment will help shed light on the
role and influence of various stakeholders and will identify practical ways of building
communities' demand side governance capacities. NREG implementation has, both through the
PSIA and other approaches, actively consulted with stakeholders in an endeavor to mitigate such
risks, and ensure the program results in social benefits. The intent is to further enhance these
efforts building on the recommendations of the proposed Social Assessment.

132. Misperception. While non-state actors have been - and will continue to be - engaged in
NREG program, there is a possibility that some groups will feel inadequately consulted and
informed and may misunderstand the intent of NREG. There is a need to expand on
communications and awareness raising activities, and further develop mechanisms for involving
non state actors in implementation and monitoring of NREG. The success of NREG will be


                                               60
reliant on key stakeholders being continuously informed and updated on the objectives and
intended positive outcomes of the program, as well as their opportunities to contribute toward its
success.

133. Risk that five year outcomes may not be achieved following the end of the DPO series.
The Bank will continue to support the ENR sectors. While other DPs are committed to
continuing support to the Government's five year NREG program, the Bank is obliged to assess
progress and achievements under the DPO series after three years in its ICR. Lessons learned
through implementing the series will inform decisions about a possible follow on operation, and
the choice of instruments. The CAS mid-term review includes provision for an operation that
will be defined following completion of the ICR. In addition, Ghana has been selected as
Forestry Investment Program (FIP) pilot country that will provide for continuity of support for
improved governance and sustainable management of the forestry sector, and a TA operation that

ANNEX 5: FRAMEWORK MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING




                      95
1. Preamble

1.1. This Framework Memorandum (FM) contains the understandings of the Government of
     Ghana (GoG) and the Development Partners which have signed this FM (hereafter called
     the signatory DPs), as regards providing sector budget support (SBS) for the design,
     implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Natural Resources and Environmental
     Governance (NREG) program in Ghana. This FM has been endorsed and approved by
     the GoG and the signatory DPs and came into force on the date of signature. DPs not yet
     signatory of this FM, can join this FM by agreement of all signatories and an official
     exchange of letters between the new signatory and the existing signatories.
1.2. This FM will operate subject to the provisions of the bilateral financing
     agreements/arrangements between the GoG and the individual DPs, which form the legal
     basis for the provision of budget support by each of these DPs. This FM is not a binding
     legal agreement and, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this FM and
     the bilateral agreements/arrangements, the provisions of the bilateral
     agreements/arrangements will prevail. Ultimate approval of the provision of budget
     support, and the circumstances/conditions under which it is provided, rests with the
     individual DP. However, DPs will, with due regard to the separate accountability of each
     DP, endeavour to sign bilateral agreements and maintain financing arrangements that are
     compatible with the spirit and provisions of this FM. In case of deviations, the signatory
     DP concerned will inform the GoG and the other signatory DPs of such deviations in
     writing.
1.3. Signing this FM is a commitment to participate actively in the activities foreseen in this
     FM, to respect the spirit and provisions of this FM and to provide financial resources for
     the NREG Program as agreed in the bilateral agreements.
1.4. Initially the NREG Program covers the forestry, mining and environmental protection
     sectors. The scope of the NREG Program could be expanded at a later date, after mutual
     agreement between the signatories, with other sectors and sub sectors dealing with
     natural resources and environmental governance issues.
1.5. When implementing this FM, the signatories endeavour to apply international guidelines
     as regards budget support, notably to focus the objectives and targets on results.

2. Principles and objectives

2.1. The overall objective of SBS for the NREG Program is providing support to the GoG for
     achieving the GoG's goals as regards the sectors and sub sectors covered by the NREG
     Program. The SBS will therefore be based on and embedded in well defined and result-
     oriented policies and strategies for the (sub) sectors concerned, translated into medium
     term action plans, medium term expenditure frameworks and annual work plans and
     budgets. It is acknowledged that not all these prerequisites are in place at the start of the


                                               96
    NREG Program, but will have to be further developed and strengthened during the first
    years of implementation of the NREG Program.
2.2. The SBS-NREG consists of (i) transfers of financial resources to the Consolidated Fund
     of the Treasury of the GoG and (ii) a joint policy dialogue conducted by the GoG and
     the signatory DPs as regards a number of policy and strategy issues and the targets to be
     achieved in the (sub) sectors covered by the NREG Program. A progress assessment
     framework (PAF) will be used for measuring progress towards achieving the sector
     development goals and the annual targets.
2.3. SBS for the NREG Program is based on the concept of a Sector Wide Approach
     (SWAp), which implies comprehensive planning, programming, budgeting, reporting,
     monitoring and evaluation as regards the (sub) sectors involved in the NREG Program,
     encompassing all sources of funding (treasury funding, Internally Generated Funds,
     project and program aid, etc.). This comprehensive planning, programming, budgeting
     and reporting is the responsibility of the MDAs involved in the NREG Program, and will
     be one of the subjects of the policy dialogue between the GoG and the signatory DPs.
2.4. The SBS funds to be transferred to the Consolidated Fund of the national Treasury will
     be taken fully into account by the GoG in the planning, budget and accounting process.
     They will become part of the national resources of the Treasury and will be managed
     and spent according to national procedures as regards public finance management. The
     transfer of funds from signatory DPs is subject to certain disbursement conditions as
     regards policy measures to be taken and/or performance targets to meet, as mentioned in
     the PAF (see chapters 3 and 5).
2.5. In principle the use of the SBS funds will be un-earmarked, which means that SBS funds
     are not meant to be used specifically for certain budget chapters, budget lines or
     expenditure items. Instead the GoG will ensure adequate levels of funding made timely
     available to the (sub) sectors covered by the NREG Program in order that the agreed
     NREG objectives and targets will be achieved. Funding levels required for the (sub)
     sectors of NREG will be one of the subjects of the policy dialogue. In specific
     circumstances a DP could decide to earmark its SBS in accordance with its own policy
     and procedures.
2.6. The signatory DPs confirm that they will, as far as possible, harmonise and align their
     policies and procedures as regards providing support to the NREG Program, while at the
     same time strengthening the ownership of the GoG as regards the design and
     implementation of the NREG Program. Harmonisation and alignment require:
    - a joint Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) with clearly defined objectives and
        targets;
    - a joint policy dialogue between the GoG and the DPs, and;
    - a joint regular review mechanism of the PAF
    - a joint review of the financial audits (see chapter 6).
2.7. The signatory DPs confirm also that they aim for improving the predictability of donor
     flows to the Treasury of the GoG through the arrangements agreed in this FM.
2.8. This FM for the SBS-NREG is compatible with the FM for the Multi Donor Budget
     Support (MDBS) in terms of (i) approaches and procedures, and (ii) division of tasks. In

                                              97
    principle the PAF of the MDBS deals with macro and cross sector issues. Those issues
    will thus not be included in the PAF of the NREG Program. On the other hand, sector
    related issues covered by the PAF of the NREG Program will not be included in the PAF
    of the MDBS. Exceptions could be made for some key reform issues, particularly those
    exceeding the strict boundaries and competences of the NREG (sub) sectors.
2.9. Reliable, transparent and effective Public Finance Management (PFM) is a requirement
     for each budget support program. The MDBS policy dialogue reviews regularly the
     progress with the implementation of the overall action plan for strengthening PFM in
     Ghana. The NREG policy dialogue will address some PFM issues at the level of the
     MDAs involved in the NREG Program, including the implementation of overall PFM
     reforms at the level of those MDAs.
2.10. One of the objectives of the NREG Program is to support the establishment and proper
      functioning of an inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral coordination mechanism for
      environmental and natural resource governance. The implementation of the NREG
      Program will become part of such a coordination mechanism once it has been
      established.

3. The Progress Assessment Framework and the review process

3.1. The Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) of the NREG Program contains the program
     and policy objectives and the annual targets as agreed by the GoG and the signatory DPs.
     The PAF will be used to assess progress with implementation of the NREG Program.
     The PAF is a forward rolling three-year planning instrument, containing fixed objectives
     and targets for the first year, projected objectives and targets for the second year and
     indicative objectives and targets for the third year.
3.2. The GoG and the DPs agree that the PAF will be limited in size and will be focused on
     the most crucial objectives and targets of the (sub) sectors concerned. The policy
     documents, medium term action plans, MTEFs and annual work plans of the MDAs
     involved will be broader in scope and more detailed. The PAF is not meant to replace
     those policy and planning documents of the MDAs concerned. The PAF will be result-
     oriented and comprise a balanced mix of policy actions/input indicators and
     result/outcome indicators.
3.3. The signatories of this FM will carry out a joint annual review of the progress achieved
     as regards the objectives and targets of the PAF. The purpose of that annual review is to
     assess progress as regards the implementation of the NREG Program, to formulate
     recommendations for strengthening the implementation of the NREG Program, to inform
     the decision making process as regards the disbursements of SBS (see chapter 5), and to
     prepare updating the objectives and targets of the PAF for the following years (see also
     article 4.3).
3.4. The annual review will be based on annual reports to be produced by the MDAs involved
     in the NREG Program. The review will be coordinated by the Chairpersons of the NREG
     Coordination Committee and the DP-NREG group (see chapter 4) and will be carried out
     by representatives of the participating MDAs, the NDPC and the signatory DPs. The

                                             98
    NREG Coordination Committee and the signatory DPs may wish, at certain occasions, to
    organise an external review of the NREG Program carried out by independent experts
    every three years. The results of such an external review will feed into the annual review
    process.
3.5. The annual review as regards the results of a particular year will be carried out before the
     end of April of the subsequent year, and preferably before the annual review of the
     MDBS.
3.6. Ideally the targets of the PAF for a particular year should be fixed before the end of
     September of the previous year in order to be in line with the budget preparation cycle.
     However, for the first year (2008) of this NREG Program a special arrangement is
     necessary to phase-in that sequencing. The first NREG-PAF, to be finalised before the
     end of January 2008, refers to the years 2007-2009 and includes fixed targets for 2007
     and 2008 and indicative targets for 2009. Attainment of the targets of 2007 will be
     evaluated before the end of January 2008. All future NREG-PAFs will follow the
     MDSB/PRSC timeline for preparation and assessment.
3.7. Notwithstanding differences in disbursement procedures (see chapter 5), the signatory
     DPs try to reach joint conclusions as regards the holistic assessment of the progress
     achieved in the (su)sectors on the basis of the PAF targets, as well as regards each target
     of the PAF individually.

4. Coordination, dialogue and reporting

4.1 The GoG will set up (i) a High Level NREG Steering Committee for the purpose of
    taking policy and strategic decisions as regards the NREG Program and (ii) a Technical
    Coordination Committee supported by a Technical Secretariat for the purpose of
    organising and coordinating the policy dialogue and the annual reviews of the NREG-
    PAF and for coordinating cross sector and common issues of the MDAs involved in the
    NREG Program. The High Level NREG Steering Committee will be composed of the
    Ministers responsible for Finance, Forestry, Mining and Environmental Protection. The
    Technical Coordinating Committee will be co-chaired by the Chief Directors of the three
    Ministries involved in the NREG Program. All MDAs involved in the NREG Program,
    including the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP), will have a high
    level representative in the Technical Coordination Committee (chief executive level).
    The MoFEP will be in charge of the Technical Secretariat. The terms of reference of the
    Technical Coordination Committee are attached to this FM.
4.2 The DP signatories of this FM will nominate a focal point (one of the DPs having signed
    this FM), which will be in charge of maintaining contact with the chair of the High level
    NREG Steering Committee and the chair of the NREG Technical Coordination
    Committee about all implementation issues concerning the NREG Program.
4.3 The NREG Technical Coordination Committee and the DPs will have at least two joint
    meetings per year: one in the first semester to discuss the results of the annual review of
    the NREG-PAF and to update the PAF for the following years, and one in the second
    semester in order (i) to discuss the execution of the annual work plans and budgets of the
    MDAs involved in the NREG Program during the first half of the year, (ii) to review the
                                               99
    audit reports as regards the previous year (see chapter 6), (iii) to discuss special policy,
    strategy and reform issues, and (iv) to discuss the budget of the following year. These
    joint meetings will be co-chaired by the chairperson of the NREG Technical
    Coordination Committee and the focal point of the signatory DPs. The sector dialogue
    will take place in the context of the Environment and Natural Resources Sector Group
    (see also paragraph 4.6).
4.4 The annual review of the NREG-PAF will be coordinated by the Chairperson of the
    NREG Coordinating Committee and the focal point of the signatory DPs.
    Representatives from Parliament and non-state actors may be invited to participate in the
    review as observers. Results of the joint assessment of the NREG-PAF will be
    disseminated to a broader group of stakeholders.
4.5 The annual review of the NREG-PAF will be informed by the budgets, medium term
    action plans, annual workplans and Annual Progress Reports (APR) of the MDAs
    involved in the NREG Program and the means of verification (of the targets and
    triggers) as defined in the PAF. In order to ensure a fully informed dialogue, the GoG
    will submit that documentation to the signatory DPs at least 3 weeks prior to the annual
    review.
4.6 Besides coordinating the NREG Program itself, the NREG Technical Coordination
    Committee will also take care of coordinating the NREG Program with other programs
    and projects being implemented within the NREG sectors. However, broader issues of
    environmental governance and coordination with other projects and programs in the
    environment and natural resources sectors (outside the NREG sectors) will be dealt with
    by the existing Environment and Natural Resources Sector Group and the future inter-
    sectoral coordination mechanism for environmental and natural resources governance
    (see also article 2.10).
4.7 It is acknowledged that the MDBS policy dialogue and coordination structure will be the
    pivotal point in a network of sector dialogues, guided by the GoG, where cross cutting
    issues, major policy reform issues and issues with significant budgetary implications can
    be raised. The MDBS policy dialogue will add value to and will be informed by policy
    dialogues at sector level. However, the MDBS policy dialogue will not repeat
    discussions that have been handled adequately at sector level nor will the NREG policy
    dialogue repeat discussions about macro and cross-sector issues already dealt with by the
    MDBS policy dialogue.

5. Disbursement mechanisms

5.1. The annual SBS of each DP consists of either one disbursement or two disbursements (a
     base tranche and a performance tranche). The decision as regards the disbursement
     conditions is left to the discretion of each individual DP and will be stipulated in the
     respective bilateral agreements as regards providing SBS for the NREG Program.
     However, the signatory DPs aim for harmonising their disbursement conditions as far as
     possible within the framework of guidelines presented in the following paragraphs.
5.2. Both general and sector budget support is only be provided to countries with adequate
     macro-economic and fiscal policies and an adequate public finance management (PFM)
                                             100
    system or a program aimed at strengthening the PFM system. These preconditions will
    therefore be part of the disbursement conditions of SBS for the NREG Program, but
    assessing whether these conditions have been met will be done in the context of the
    annual MDBS reviews.
5.3. In case of a single annual SBS-NREG disbursement the decision to disburse will be
     subject to the preconditions mentioned in paragraph 5.2 and a satisfactory assessment of
     attainment of the NREG-PAF targets. As regards those targets some signatory DPs will
     focus on a holistic assessment, others will focus on specific targets (then called triggers),
     or on both a holistic assessment and specific targets (triggers).
5.4. In case of two disbursements per year, the base tranche will be subject to the
     preconditions mentioned in paragraph 5.2 and a holistic assessment of attainment of the
     NREG-PAF targets, while the performance tranche will be based on certain specific
     targets (triggers) of the NREG-PAF.
5.5. The signatories of this FM agree that triggers (specific disbursement conditions) will be
     limited in number and will be chosen out of the list of targets mentioned in the PAF.
5.6. In order to improve the predictability of aid flows and to facilitate GoG's budget
     preparation process, the disbursement of the tranches in year N will depend on
     assessments made in year N-1 as regards the achievement of the targets of year N-2. The
     signatory DPs will inform the GoG as soon as possible after the annual review and at the
     latest before the end of August in year N-1 about the disbursements of the volume and
     timing of the tranches in year N. Disbursements should preferably take place during the
     first four months of year N. However special arrangements are needed for the first year
     (2008) of the NREG in order to phase-in this system (see next article).
5.7. At the start of the program the disbursements of 2008 will be based on the NREG-PAF
     review carried out in January 2008 (which has evaluated the targets of 2007). The
     following reviews and related disbursements will follow the time schedule of the MDBS.
     As stipulated in article 5.6 the GoG will be informed about the disbursements to be
     effectuated in 2009 before the end of august 2008.
5.8. Disbursements will be deposited in a foreign exchange account with Accounts Name:
    Nat. Res. And Environmental Gov. Budget Support, Accounts No. 1018631512593,
    in the name of the GoG held at the Bank of Ghana (BoG). The BoG will immediately
    inform in writing the signatory DP concerned and the Ministry of Finance and Economic
    Planning (MoFEP) as regards the receipt of the foreign exchange funds. Within 48 hours
    after receipt of the SBS disbursement the BoG will credit the Cedi equivalent to the

                             ANNEX 6. FUND RELATIONS NOTE

   Ghana--Assessment Letter for the World Bank and Other Development Partners

                                       March 31, 2010

                                        Introduction

This note provides the IMF staff assessment of recent economic developments and prospects
in Ghana. It reflects discussions with the authorities during staff missions to Accra in
October 2009 and March 2010 relating to the 2010 budget and other macroeconomic policies
covered by the first and second reviews under the IMF's Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement. It is intended that these discussions, if concluded in the coming weeks, will
permit an IMF Executive Board meeting to conclude the ECF reviews and consider the next
tranche of IMF financing around late May 2010.

            Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Program Performance

Growth in Ghana slowed from 7.3 percent in 2008 to about 3-4 percent in 2009 as lower
private remittances and reduced access to trade credits were accompanied by tighter fiscal
and monetary policies. The impact of the global recession was ameliorated by the strength in
the prices of the country's two main exports--cocoa and gold. The latest data suggest that the
economy started to regain strength towards the end of 2009.

On the fiscal front, the budget deficit was reduced from 14.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to
9.7 percent of GDP in 2009, close to the program target of 9.4 percent of GDP. This deficit
figure excludes, however, new domestic arrears incurred in 2009, totaling more than
4 percent of GDP. These arrears were accumulated when cash flows were squeezed by a
shortfall in indirect tax collections on account of the weaker economy, and as overruns were
experienced in the public wage bill, investment spending, and borrowing costs.

Monetary conditions were progressively tightened through 2008 and early 2009 under the
central bank's inflation targeting regime. By the second half of 2009, the growth rates of
liquidity and credit aggregates had slowed markedly. Private credit saw no growth, in real
terms, during 2009, after rising about one quarter in 2008. This compression would have
been sharper still, in the absence of the fiscal consolidation in 2009, which helped reduce the
crowding out associated with bank financing for the government deficit. With tighter fiscal
and monetary policies, the balance of payments improved markedly through 2009,
contributing to a stronger currency from July 2009 onwards. Reflecting these developments,
twelve-month inflation fell to 14.2 percent in February 2010, from close to 20 percent during
the first half of 2009. With evidence of declining inflation, monetary conditions were eased
from end-2009, with the policy interest rate reduced in both November 2009 and
February 2010, by a cumulative 250 basis points.

The quantitative targets under the ECF arrangement were met in the second half of 2009,
except for the September 2009 ceiling on the fiscal deficit, which was narrowly missed, and

                                             105
the continuous limit on external nonconcessional borrowing which was breached in
November when a state enterprise liability was taken over by the budget. The deficit targets
would have been missed by much larger margins, however, if large domestic arrears had not
been accumulated. The net international reserve target was met by a large margin. Good
progress was achieved in implementing most of the program's structural measures, with
some met ahead of time. Key achievements have been the establishment at end-2009 of an
integrated Ghana Revenue Authority and the launch of an important program of public
finance management reforms. At the same time, progress has been slow in computerizing
public agency payrolls and a review of tax exemptions has fallen behind schedule.

                               The 2010 Economic Program

The government's 2010 economic program seeks a further reduction in the fiscal deficit to
reduce pressures on inflation and reverse the deterioration in public debt indicators. The
program is underpinned by measures to strengthen the management of public finances.

The program assumes a pick-up in economic growth to the 4-5 percent range in 2010, with
new private sector spending linked to the emerging oil sector more than offsetting the impact
of continued fiscal tightening. Tighter fiscal policy and cautious monetary management are
projected to reduce inflation to single-digit rates by end-2010.

The 2010 budget

The 2010 budget approved at end-2009 targeted a fiscal deficit of 7½ percent of GDP.
Measures adopted in the 2010 budget to achieve this goal include a reimposition of import
tariffs on cereals and edible oils that had been eliminated during the 2007­08 global food
price boom; a reduction in import tariff exemptions; a significant rise in public fees and
charges; an increase in mineral royalties from 3 percent to 5 percent (still pending); a
re-introduction of ad valorem excise duties for tobacco and alcohol; and measures to
strengthen revenue collections from the communications service tax. The budget also relies
on sizeable dividend transfers from the Cocoa Board and Bank of Ghana. Subsidies for the
electricity sector will be avoided by an adjustment of tariffs toward cost recovery levels.
Recurrent spending is projected to rise in relation to GDP in 2010, partly as statutory fund
and other spending recovers from a sharp compression in 2009. Investment spending is
projected to decline slightly in relation to GDP.

With outturn fiscal data for 2009 showing weaker tax receipts than anticipated at the time of
the 2010 budget, the authorities now see the approved budget deficit target as unattainable,
and have developed an updated fiscal framework targeting a deficit of 8 percent of GDP. To
achieve this goal, the authorities intend to reduce spending on both investment and recurrent
goods and services below appropriated levels.

In addition, catch-up payments to statutory funds in respect of under-funding in 2009 are
scheduled to be deferred until 2011­12. Notwithstanding this, the government intends to
remain current on revenue transfers to statutory funds accruing in 2010, generating a marked
upturn in incomes in 2010 with which to finance new infrastructure projects. Aside from the

                                             106
statutory funds, a number of domestic expenditure arrears were settled in early 2010 to ease
the liquidity problems of contractors and their lending banks.

The financing plan for the 2010 budget relies less on bank financing than in 2008­09, so a
larger share of credit will be available to support private sector investment. Nonbank
financing, including corporate and other private purchases of treasury bills, is projected to
increase. A residual fiscal financing gap of $275 million for 2010 is projected to be met
through the second tranche of the World Bank budget support loan approved in June 2009
($150 million), plus new concessional support from the World Bank or other budget support
partners.

The outlook for public debt is somewhat more favorable than in earlier projections, in large
part reflecting the recent strengthening of the exchange rate, which implies smaller
revaluation effects for external debt. Notwithstanding this, total public debt is projected at
64 percent of GDP in 2010, up from 60 percent of GDP in 2009, and a low of 42 percent of
GDP in 2006 following debt relief. A marked decline in public debt ratios is projected only
for 2011­12, with the projected reduction of the fiscal deficit to the 3­4 percent of GDP
range.

In the context of the anticipated combined first and second ECF reviews, the authorities
intend to request leeway under the ECF arrangement to contract nonconcessional external
debt for two new projects in a combined amount of $150 million, as well as scope to contract
or guarantee up to $100 million in additional nonconcessional external debt for other
high-return projects during the remainder of 2010.

Preliminary updates to the joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) have been
developed, using the latest debt data and updated financing projections consistent with the
higher baseline for nonconcessional borrowing proposed for 2010. This DSA update suggests
a substantial increase in debt vulnerability, though Ghana would remain among the group of
countries classified as facing moderate risk of debt distress, in line with DSAs prepared in
2008 and 2009. In the baseline projections, external debt indicators remain below the
threshold levels for debt distress. These results depend on the planned sustained reduction of
the fiscal deficit to low levels; debt dynamics based instead on the continuation of fiscal
deficits at the average levels of recent years would relatively quickly exceed the DSA
threshold levels. Stress tests also indicate that the DSA outlook is sensitive to the economic
growth and borrowing costs assumptions. The debt-to-GDP indicator is expected to be
revised downwards over the course of 2010 as a result of the national accounts rebasing
exercise which is projected to result in an upward revision to nominal GDP. Importantly,
however, this would not affect the debt service to export and revenue ratios, which are
projected to rise sharply (while still consistent with moderate risk of debt distress) over the
coming decade.

Structural policies

The government has initiated reforms aimed at strengthening public financial management,
revenue administration, and public administration.


                                              107
At end-2009, the integrated Ghana Revenue Authority was established, marking a key step in
the program to strengthen revenue administration. On tax policy, a comprehensive review is
underway of zero-rate VAT items and of the nature and scope of tax exemptions and
discretionary waivers. The government completed a review of the current financial
management information system, and established a project implementation committee to
manage implementation of the upgraded system.

On civil service reforms, the government assigned responsibility to the Ministry for the
Public Sector to complete a review of subvented agencies in order to determine the future
status of these agencies. While only limited progress was made in migrating the payroll of all
subvented agencies to an integrated database, the government completed an audit of all staff
of the Ghana Education Service and has contained growth in the size of the civil service by
limiting new hiring principally to the education and health services. To avoid risks to the
budget, the administrative ceilings for petroleum product prices continue to be subject to
bi-weekly review to ensure that prices reflect trends in prevailing costs.

On the monetary side, the Bank of Ghana has launched a newly-designed website that
highlights the goal and outcomes of the inflation-targeting regime, and provides more
user-friendly access to key data and publication.

Risks and Vulnerabilities

Possible slippages in fiscal performance represent the key downside risk to the program.

On the expenditure side, the public sector wage bill remains high in relation to both the tax
base and the size of the economy. In 2009, the wage bill exceeded budgeted levels, and,
unless carefully managed, the new "single spine" public pay structure to be phased in from
late 2010 could prove more expensive than anticipated. If planned measures to reduce the
wage burden on the budget do not achieve their intended results, Ghana's high public
administration costs could crowd out the fiscal space created by future oil revenues.

The ceiling on domestically-financed investments has been cut to a very low level in the
2010 budget, which increases the risk of over-runs. Contracting will need to be monitored
very closely to avoid breaches of budget targets.

As noted below, an increase in electricity tariffs to cost recovery level will be critical to
avoiding further large subsidies to the electricity sector. In the event that this increase is not
quickly implemented, offsetting fiscal measures would need to be adopted.

On the revenue side, Fund staff has reviewed the 2010 projections closely with the
authorities with the view to establishing a solid baseline. There are upside risks, if the
economy recovers more strongly than projected. But there are also downside risks arising
from the recently adopted and proposed taxes and fees, if these do not yield their anticipated
returns.

Overall, the authorities need to monitor budget developments closely and be ready to take
corrective fiscal measures, should conditions warrant. The smaller-than-originally-
programmed reduction of the fiscal deficit in 2010 as well as the issue of new public debt

                                                108
equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP in March 2010 to repay state-owned enterprise debts to the
Ghana Commercial Bank and strengthen its liquidity has required increased government
resort to bank financing. Slippage relative to this revised fiscal path could complicate
liquidity management, with adverse implications for the effectiveness of the inflation
targeting regime.

Looking ahead to 2011, it will be important to contain expectations for public sector
spending during the transition to oil producer status. Although oil will generate important
new revenues, the available fiscal space for new projects will depend critically on the
soundness of the non-oil budget. In this connection, Ghana's fiscal deficit going into the oil
era remains large and, in the absence of other revenue or expenditure measures in 2011, the
scope for new projects will likely be relatively modest, at least in the early years of oil
production, and spending plans will need to be developed accordingly.

In the broader public sector, a number of state-owned enterprises pose risks to public
finances. Steps are underway, supported by the World Bank, to return the electricity sector to
financial viability. An early adjustment of the electricity tariff to cost recovery levels will be
critical to achieve this. At the same time, steps are needed to tackle the financial liabilities of
the oil refinery, which will likely require public funding. A common origin of these financial
problems has been under-pricing of energy products. Going forward, it will be important to
maintain the existing market-based pricing formula for petroleum products, and implement
regular reviews of the new electricity tariff structure to maintain cost recovery.

In the monetary and financial sectors, it will be important to maintain sufficiently tight
monetary conditions to consolidate the decline in inflation. Clear communication of the
disinflation strategy will be important to rebuild credibility in the goals of the inflation target
framework. In the banking sector, the rise in nonperforming loans appears manageable, as
capital ratios remains strong. However, oversight arrangements should be strengthened for
institutions with key risk factors, such as rapid credit growth and high funding costs.
