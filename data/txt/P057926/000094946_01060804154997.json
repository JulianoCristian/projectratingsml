Reforms will occur in the areas of land markets,\n            cereals markets, agriculture eterprise privatization,\n            irrigation institutions and legislation, agricultural\n            subsidies and finance, trade and regulations, and forest\n            policy. The reforms enhance market development and increase\n            enterprise competitiveness. This will improve income\n            -earning opportunities for rural producers, contribute to\n            rural employment generation, and help raise rural living\n            standards. Consumers will benefit from improved agricultural\n            product quality and availability, greater choice, and more\n            efficient marketing channels. The most important risks are,\n            first, political resistance by powerful interest groups, and\n            second, that the program will be undermined by a\n            non-supportive macroeconomic environment."}, "docdt": "2001-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
