REPORT AND RECOMIENDATION OF
THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR THE
ANDHFLA PRADESH AGRICULTURAL CI?EDIT PROJECT
1.           I submit the following report and recommerndation on a pro-
posed credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$24.4
million to India.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.           Since 1949 the Bank and the Association have made fourteen
loans and credits totalling some US$213 million to finance agricultural
projects in India including the Agricultural Aviation Project approved
on October 5, 1970.
3.           The proposed credit would assist in the financing of an
investment program for minor irrigation, land levelling and mechaniz-
ation in the State of Andhra Pradesh. It is the third agricultural
credit project resulting from project preparation efforts which began
with a reconnaissance mission under the IBRD/FAO Cooperative Program
in November and December, 1968. An appraisal report is being prepared
now for a fourth such project in the State of Tamil Nadu and a mission
has just completed its field appraisal of a fifth in the State of
Haryana.
4.           This project was appraised in April, 1970 and negotiations
for the proposed credit were completed on November 16, 1970. The Bor-
rower was represented by Mr. G. V. Ramakrishna, Director, Department of
Economic Affairs, Ministry of F;inance and Hr. £4. K. Nukharji, Joint
Secretary, Department of Agriculture, ivinistry of Food and Agriculture.
The Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) was represented by its
Managing Director, MLr. K. Hadhava Das. H4r. B. P. R. Vithal, Secretary,
Department of Cooperation, Andhra Pradesh represented the State of
Andh:a Pradesh. Hr. S. A. H. hazvi, its ilanaging Director, represented
the Andhra Pradesh State Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank (LAB) and a
Director, 14r. E. V. Ram Reddy, who is also Secretary of Agriculture,
Government of Andhra Pradesh, represented the Andhra Pradesh State Agro-
Tndustries Corporation (APSAIC).
5.           The following is a summary statement of Bank Loans and IDA
Credits to India as at October 31, 1970.

Insignificant amount
^* Not yet effective
6.           There have been delays in disbursing against a number of
projects in India. The longest outstanding loan not fully disbursed is
307-IN (Collieries project) to the Indian Iron and Steel Company T'hich
first became effective in 1961. The Company has encountered severe and
unexpected technical difficulties in executing the project, particularly
in the sinking of mine shafts where flooding has delayed progress and
necessitated changes in the work program. The closing-date has recently
been postponed and a mission is now in the field to review progress on
the project. The Power Transmission project (Loan 416-DI) has an actual
balance of US$7.7 million, following the recent cancellation of US$8 million.



When the closing date wqas postponed in March 1969, the Bank said that no
further postponement would be considered. All of the works included in
the project will be completed but some will not be financed under the project
because many State Electricity Boards did not place orders in time to achieve
disbursement by the revised closing date; consequently GOI requested
cancellation of amounts it knew would not be used. Except for certain small
amounts, the balance of the Loan should be disbursed by the revised closing
date of December 31, 1970. Disbursements against the Sixth industrial Imports
Credit program (Credit 182-IN) have been slow to date because GOI was reluctant
to make commitments for the use of foreign exchange resources under the IDA
Credit until it was approved. The flow of disbursements is now expected to
accelerate in early 1971 in order to complete disbursements by June 1971.
7.        Commitments and disbursements on the ICICI Loans (Loans 414-IN,
515-IN and 683-IN) are moving satisfactorily.   A September review mission
to the Gujarat and Punjab Credit projects (Credits 191-IN and 203-IN) reported
that procurement arrangements were proceeding satisfactorily. The first
disbursement request against the Kadana Irrigation Credit (Credit 176-DI) for
works since January 1, 1970 is expected shortly. A mission is now in India
to review progress on the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) and to make recommen-
dations with a view to expediting disbursements. The closing date is
December 31, 1972. No disbursements have been made against the loan for the
Tarai Seeds project (Loan 614-IN) but recent progress has been encouraging.
Tractors have been ordered and many have been received already; and the first
disbursement request is expected to be made shortly. Tenders for farm
machinery have been issued. The consultant to the Tarai Development
Corporation has submitted his report on processing plants and proposals for
tenders will be made shortly. Disbursements should begin to move rapidly
in the next few months. The only recent setback was on land levelling - no
response wias received to the first tender and bids have been invited again.
The disbursements under Loan 615-IN/Credit 153-IN (Telecommunications III)
are lagging behind original forecasts, mainly as a result of a delay of
about six months in awarding major procurement contracts and slow deliveries
of cables from the domestic factory as a result of labor difficulties. A
large part of the loan and credit amounts has been committed in the form of
orders placed, and the Government expects part of the delays to be overcome
and the disbursement of the loan/credit amounts to be completed before the
closing date of December 31, 1972.
8.        Since 1957, IFC has made thirteen commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million of which US$34.2 represent loans and US$8.1 million equity.
As of November 20, 1970 US$21.3 million of this total had been disbursed
and US$6.0 million cancelled leaving US$15 million undisbursed. The
largest commitment is a total of US$18.0 million to Zuari Agro-Chemicals
for a fertilizer plant in Goa.
9.        In addition to the two other agricultural credit projects appraised
in Tamil Nadu and in Haryana, negotiations are being conducted for a wheat
storage project; other projects in various stages of preparation for sub-
mission to Executive Directors before June 30, 1971 concern irrigation
(Pochampad and Tawa), family planning, telecommunications, power transmission
and fertilizer plants.

PART III - THE PROJECT
-1.       An appraisal report entitled "Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Credit
Project: India" (PA-59a) is attached.
12.       The agricultural sector in India, which provides half its gross
domestic product and in which 70 percent of the labor force is engaged, has
been given increased importance in the country's recent developmental effort.
In particular, concentrated attention has been given to increasing the
rapidity with which latest technological improvements are being adopted and
to achieving a wider acceptance of the neti techniques. The main features of
this policy are an endeavor to accelerate the availability of improved inputs
and the creation of more attractive economic incentives to farmers. Good
results have been achieved already and the use of high-yielding seed varieties
and fertilizer has been instrumental in obtaining considerable increases in
food production. Very large numbers of farmers, however, still remain outside
the scope of the new agricultural strategy and need more readily available
and substantial amounts of credit, particularly medium to long-term credit,
which will provide them with the means to finance on-farm investments such
as tubewells, and land levelling, and to mechanize. It is estimated that
rural credit institutions will need additional resources equivalent to more than
US$2,000 million during the five year period of the Fourth Plan if its targets
are to be met.
13.       The project would finance an investment program in minor irrigation,
land levelling and farm mechanization in the State of Andhra Pradesh. It
would be part of a continuing program of support by the Association to the
Government of India and to the State Governments to further their policies to
expand credit facilities to farmers and thus to assist them in taking
advantage of modern methods of cultivation through necessary on-farm investments.
It would increase minor irrigation facilities in the State by the installation
of some 1,350 tubewells and 14,000 dugwells, and by the improvement of some
5,000 existing dugwells. In addition almost 20,000 pump sets would be
financed for installation in existing wells or wells to be developed under
the project. The purchase of some 1,500 tractors with some implement
components would also be financed. In addition to the lending program there
is provision for consultancy services to a State Ground Water Directorate to
be established and for a study of the procedures of one of the lending
institutions - the LMB.
14.       Funds Twill be channelled through the borrower to the Agricultural
Refinance Corporation of India for refinancing the lending activities within
the project of the LMB and its federated primary banks and of those commercial
banks which may participate.
15.       Total project cost is estimated to be US$450. million, of which the
proposed credit would finance about 54 percent, including the estimated foreign
exchange cost of US$7.1 million and approximately US$17.3 million equivalent
of local expenditures. As has been explained on previous occasions it is
necessary for the Bank Group to finance substantial local currency expenditures
if it is to make an effective contribution to agricultural development in India,



- 6 -
which characteristically involves only a very small foreign exchange component.
The more general case for local expenditure financing, in the context of the
foreign exchange transfer problem, has been made most recently in the latest
Economic Report (SA-13a) distributed on April 24, 1970 (see paragraphs 380 -
39L).
16.       Benefits from the project would arise from increased agricultural
production. The proposed investments should enable farmers who enjoy the
benefits of the project to achieve more dependable yields and to increase
cropping intensity to an extent which should expand the cropped area by about
50,000 hectares. Grain production should increase by 160,000 tons a year
making possible reduced imports of commodities in which India is not yet self-
sufficient. There should also be a substantial increase in the production
of several commercial crops. The economic rate of return is expected to be
between 24 and 30 percent and financial rates of return to farmers should
range from 16 to 37 percent.
17.       To ensure that the benefits of the program are available to small-
scale farmers there is no minimum acreaae requirement for eligibility to
purchase a tractor under the project. The credit institutions will use, as
a norm for appraisal of eligibility, the concept that each tractor should be
used to crop 40 hectares a year or in productive agricultural work for 1,000
hours per year. This stipulation should go some way to encouraging the
greater use of tractors for custom service work. Small farmers below a certain
income will be encouraged to participate by being offered loans on softer
lending terms for minor irrigation and levelling; down payments for certain
minor irrigation investments will be reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent and
repayment periods for such minor irrigation and for land levelling will be
increased from 10 years to 15 years. At the same time, care has been taken
to ensure that each investment will be economically and financially viable.
18.       Tractors and an initial complement of spare parts will be procured
under arrangements similar to those which were established for the two
preceding Agricultural Credit projects in Gujarat and the Punjab (see para-
graph 15 of my Report P-798, April 22, 1970). Briefly, farmers would be
allowed their choice of tractors from those for which quotations were offered
by suppliers in Bank member countries which have manufacturing facilities in
India or which have received the Government's approval to establish such
facilities. Tractor implements would also be procured by arrangements similar
to those under the Gujarat and Punjab projects; discs and plough bottoms would
be imported and financed by !DA after international competitive bidding. In
contrast to the Gujarat and Punjab projects, in which the award of contracts
for goods and services were subject to the approval of the Association, it
is stipulated that if any contract should be awarded under procedures
inconsistent with those set out in Schedule 3 to the Credit Agreement or
over the reasonable objection of the Association, an appropriate amount of
the Credit may be cancelled.



PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Credit Agreement between India and the Association,
the draft Project Agreement between the Association and ARC, LMB and APSAIC,
the Agreement between the Association and the State of Andhra Pradesh, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section I(d) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
20.      The draft agreements incorporate the relending terms and procurement
provisions explained in Part II and paragraphs 17 and 18 above. The specific
obligations of India regarding the importation of equipment required for the
Project are included in Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement.
PART V - THE ECONO0MY
21.      An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects of
India" (SA-13a) was distributed on April 24, 1970.  As indicated in para-
graphs 380 to 391 of that report, the balance of payments prospect and debt
service position continue to call for the provision of development assistance
to India primarily on concessionary terms. A basic data sheet is annexed.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.      I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
23.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
