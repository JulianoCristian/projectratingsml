"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Cottage Enterprise Finance\n            Project's objective is to help improve access to credit\n            by cottage enterprises that typically employ 10-20 persons\n            and have total assets of about US$15,000.  The central\n            feature of the project is that groups of cottage firms\n            voluntarily will set up Mutual Guarantee Associations (MGAs)\n            to which they will contribute to form a guarantee fund.\n            This guarantee fund will be deposited with a participating\n            bank, which will then lend some multiple of the fund to the\n            individual members of the MGA.  To initiate the scheme with\n            adequate leverage, the members' subscriptions to the\n            MGAs will be supplemented with a matching loan advanced and\n            held in trust by the Development Bank of the Philippines\n            (DBP).  As the MGAs' resources increase from new member\n            subscriptions and from interest earned on their equity, the\n            matching loan will be repaid and the funds will be used to\n            assist new MGAs.  The average size of subloans to individual\n            enterprises is expected to be about US$10,000. Technical\n            assistance will be provided to help establish and monitor\n            the MGAs; train key staff of the MGAs; provide advice on\n            waste minimization and treatment; oversee the implementation\n            of the program; and train personnel in the retail banks to\n            deal with the MGAs under the programs."}, "docdt": "1990-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
