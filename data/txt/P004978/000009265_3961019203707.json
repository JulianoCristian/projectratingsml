Project\n            complements the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) operation\n            which focuses on the development of the private sector and\n            the reform of public enterprises, public expenditures, and\n            the financial sector. In particular, the project will\n            demonstrate the Bank's and government's commitment\n            to alleviate the social costs of adjustment and support SAL\n            objectives to improve the social safety net system. The most\n            important objective of the project is to create employment\n            and improve infrastructure and services in disadvantaged\n            areas and demonstrate the government's commitment to\n            mitigate the impact of economic reforms on the poor. The\n            second objective is to enhance the effectiveness of\n            Algeria's social safety net system and the third\n            objective is to prepare, on a pilot basis, social\n            development programs aimed at developing social\n            infrastructure and alleviating poverty. The project will\n            consist of three main components: 1) labor intensive public\n            works programs including the following three sub-components:\n            (a) roadside maintenance; (b) agriculture; and (c) water\n            supply and sewerage; 2) social safety net strengthening\n            which will involve: (a) improvement of social assistance\n            programs; and (b) community social service units; and 3)\n            testing and preparation of a social fund consisting of: (a)\n            pilot project for community development; and (b) preparation\n            of the social fund."}, "docdt": "1996-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
