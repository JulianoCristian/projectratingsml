Re:
Social Safety Net Support Project
(Loan No. 4006 AL) - Amendment to Loan Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") relating to the Social 
Safety Net Support Project (the "Project") between the Democratic and Popular Republic 
of Algeria (the "Borrower") and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the "Bank"), dated May 3, 1996. We also refer to the Borrower's request 
dated August 14, 1999, as confirmed on January 9, 2000, to reallocate the proceeds of 
the loan.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank, after due consideration, has acceded 
to the Borrower's request. Accordingly, the table set forth in Schedule 1 to the Loan 
Agreement is hereby amended to reflect the reallocation of funds between categories 
and the conversion into a single currency loan which took place in 1997, and now reads 
as follows:
All sections of the Loan Agreement that have not been amended hereby shall 
remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and dating the 
confirmation on the enclosed copy of this Amendment Letter and returning it to the 
Bank.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
