1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Vietnam continued to evolve from centrally planned to market-economy during appraisal.
Its economy was growing at approximately 7.5 percent per annum. Against this backdrop,
Vietnam’s water and sanitation sector was struggling and was confronted with many
challenges. Water service coverage was generally low. Piped water supply was only
available to 50 percent of the urban population of Vietnam, with higher coverage in larger
cities. Consumers without piped water accessed a variety of alternative sources including
drawing water from shallow unprotected wells, streams or rivers. In 2004, only one
quarter of the 550 district towns had piped water supply. In addition, a number of water
systems needed rehabilitation as these were already providing very poor service and had
high levels of leakage. The level of unaccounted-for-water (UAFW) was high. In Hanoi
alone, UAFW was higher than 50 percent. Water services were also underpriced. Tariffs
were set at very low rates that did not allow water supply companies (WSCs) to recover
investment costs and expand service coverage. Moreover, the high design standards of
the water supply systems led to unnecessarily high capital costs, which adversely affect
tariffs and affordability. Water services were mainly provided by public WSCs, which
were generally characterized as having overlapping roles and responsibilities, multiple
objectives, overstaffing and lack of focus on quality of services. Finally, provision of
sanitation services significantly lagged behind water supply services.

The Government of Vietnam (GoV) recognized the need to improve and expand water
supply and sanitation services to cope with increasing demand as well as to support the
country’s pursuit for more rapid growth. The GoV, with assistance from the Government
of Finland and the World Bank, developed in 1998 its urban water policy. The policy, set
out in the “Orientation for Urban Water Supply Development” and “Orientation for the
Development of Urban Sewerage and Drainage”, mainly sought to provide 100 percent of
Vietnam’s urban population with 120-150 liters per capita per day (lcpd) of clean water
by 2020. In the short term (2005), GoV targeted to reach 180 unserved district towns.
Other objectives of the policy included promoting greater commercialization of the water
supply sector, modernizing technology and equipment, improving protection of water
resources and the environment, enhancing human resource and development, and
mobilizing contributions from all sectors of the economy and community.

The Bank has been a long time partner of the GoV in pursuing development. Through its
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Vietnam (2003-2006), the Bank committed to
support GoV in achieving three broad objectives: (a) high growth through a transition to a
market economy, (b) equitably, socially inclusive and sustainable pattern of growth, and
(c) adoption of modern public administration, legal and governance system. This project
was envisioned to support all three CAS objectives by encouraging the private sector in
infrastructure provision, narrowing the development gap of disadvantaged and lagging
areas, making basic social services accessible to the poor, enhancing environmental
sustainability, and supporting transparency in governance.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The project development objective (PDO) is to improve water and household sanitation
services in district towns and large urban centers in ways that are financially and
environmentally sustainable thus enhancing the health and economic potential of the
resident households.

The project outcome indicators were as follows:
      ‘000 additional people with access to improved water supply
      ‘000 additional people with access to improved sanitation
      Percent of treated water with adequate disinfection
      Number of people exposed to hygiene education campaign
      Improved net operating income of WSCs

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO was not changed. The Results Framework was modified to provide baseline
and target values for the many indicators that were non-existent during appraisal. The
target values reflected the reduction in project scope as a result of restructuring. There
were no changes in project outcome and intermediate outcome indicators. See Section F
of Data Sheet, page 7.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project aimed to benefit (a) an estimated 1.2 million residents in participating
provinces and district towns through improved water supply and sanitation services; (b)
participating WSCs through improved operational efficiency and financial sustainability;
(c) provincial women’s unions through grants for sanitation; (d) local private sector to
participate in the provision of water supply infrastructure through design-build-operate
(DBO) arrangement; and (e) Government through capacity strengthening of the Ministry
of Construction (MOC) -Central Project Unit (CPU) and Provincial Project Management
Units (PPMUs).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had five components:

Component 1: Competition Route (US$ 55.87M) aimed to expand water service delivery
to a total of 135 un-served district towns in 27 provinces through selection of contractors
to design, construct and subsequently operate (DBO) the water supply facilities. This
component also sought to assist households in these district towns to improve their
sanitation facilities through the operation of provincial sanitation revolving funds that
would provide households with access to small loans for such facilities. Considering the

                                            2
large number of participating district towns and provinces, the project sought to carry out
the preparation of subprojects on a phased basis. Phase 1 covered 15 towns in three
provinces. Feasibility studies for these subprojects were already prepared at the time of
appraisal. Phase 2 would cover up to 120 towns in 24 provinces. The project envisioned
mobilizing a consultant to prepare feasibility studies for these towns.

In addition to the developing new water supply schemes, the project intended to improve
household’s sanitation conditions in project participating towns by providing a
“household sanitation revolving fund”, which would be managed by respective provincial
women unions. Under the revolving fund, poor households could borrow on average of
US$ 150 for constructing/ rehabilitating their private toilets/ bathrooms.

Component 2: Performance Route (US$61.86M) intended to expand water supply
services through the rehabilitation of treatment plants, rehabilitation and/or expansion of
distribution systems, and expansion of water production capacity in selected large urban
centers in three provinces (Hai Phong, Binh Thuan, Ha Tinh), and one city (Ho Chi
Minh). Investment funds would be available to these WSCs, which achieved defined
levels of performance based on a 2002 benchmark exercise.

Component 3: Non-Subsidized Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) Lending Facility
(US$10.12M) sought to establish a Development Assistance Fund (DAF) to provide non-
subsidized lending for several water supply and sanitation infrastructure projects of
technically and financially qualified public or private WSCs with a broader aim of
making sector players more familiar with commercial financing. The DAF would charge
close to market commercial lending rates with 5-15 years repayment including grace
period. This lending was seen as a critical element in the development of the water and
sanitation sector given the huge future demand for investments and current reliance of the
sector on official development assistance.

Component 4: Building Capacity in the Sector (US$1.01M) was designed to improve
water sector performance by (a) developing standard implementation practices for
participating WSCs; (b) developing procedures and implementation support to assess the
performance of non-participating WSCs, and identifying areas that can be improved to
promote participation in future projects; (c) strengthening the implementation capacity of
the project provinces and the CPU; and (d) building the capacity of WSCs and bidders to
participate in the competitive bidding and DBO contracting process.

Component 5: Management of Project Implementation (US$6.13M) provided support
to the MOC in the preparation, implementation, monitoring and management of project
activities.

1.6 Revised Components

The project faced major delays in subproject preparation and implementation and
considerable increases in construction costs. These necessitated a reduction in project
scope to allow the project to achieve its development objective. In general, the project

                                            3
retained all its components. However, the scope of components 1 and 3 was reduced to
take into account fewer participating towns and provinces. Component 4 originally
intended to build capacities of project players in the DBO process. However, project
shifted from DBO to Design- Build (DB) arrangement. This made many Component 4
activities irrelevant. Thus, the project revised the scope of this component. The details are
presented below.

Component 1: Competition Route (US$ 40.57M). The scope of this component was
reduced as a result of the substantial delays in recruiting a consultant for Phase 2
subprojects, additional delays faced by the selected consultant in the preparation of
feasibility studies, and substantial increases in construction costs. The original number of
towns and provinces (i.e., 135 towns in 27 provinces) envisioned to be covered by the
project was no longer achievable. Thus, it was reduced to 39 towns in 9 provinces. There
was also a shift from the DBO contracting process to DB only with operations directly
assumed by the water utilities. This shift in arrangement was mainly due to the limited
market or competition among contractors in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of
water supply facilities. The local private sector lacks readiness to participate in long-term
O&M contracts (10 years and more) while the public WSCs have substantial experience
working in this field for many years. Component allocation was reduced from
US$55.87M to US$40.57M. With such substantial reduction in scope, the number of
beneficiaries of this component was reduced from 885,000 at PAD stage to 445,000 at
project restructuring. While the number of provinces and towns participating in the
project was reduced, the scope of household sanitation component was reduced
accordingly.

Component 2: Performance Route (US$57.11M). This component was revised to take
into account the withdrawal of the province of Binh Thuan from the project, as it was
able to secure investment funds from other sources. It was replaced by Quang Ninh
province. The delays in the implementation of Ho Chi Minh City subproject required
some activities to be cancelled. Thus, component allocation was reduced from
US$61.86M to US$57.11M.

Component 3: Non-Subsidized WSS Lending Facility (US$5.01M). Component
allocation was reduced from US$10.12M to US$5.01M because of general lack of
demand for credit at non-subsidized terms. GoV changed the name of the implementing
institution from Development Assistance Fund (DAF) to Vietnam Development Bank
with the same mandates and functions as the DAF.

Component 4: Building the Capacity in the Sector (US$0.65M). Some of the original
activities under this component were no longer relevant because of the change from DBO
to DB contracting arrangement under Component 1. Activities intended to strengthen the
capacity of WSCs and bidders to participate in the competitive bidding and contracting
under DBO arrangement were dropped. Government at the same time decided to refocus
the priorities in sector institutional development from providing assistance to WSCs in
developing their business plans to developing a system for evaluating their performance.
The revised component, therefore, sought to establish a database system of WSCs

                                             4
through regular report regime to gradually improve MOC’s and other state agencies’
management systems. It also intended to strengthen the capacity of (a) the MOC to
manage urban water supply; and (b) the WSCs to improve project management capacities.
Component allocation was subsequently reduced from US$1.01M to US$0.65M.

Component 5: Management of Project Implementation (US$3.37M). Allocation for this
component was reduced fromUS$6.13M to US$3.37M following the reduction in project
scope, termination of the contract signed with an international consultant due to its poor
performance and use of local consultants for monitoring key project activities.

1.7 Other significant changes

   a. A request for withdrawal of Binh Thuan province from participating in
      Component 2 and replacement by Quang Ninh province was approved by the
      Country Director and countersigned by the GoV on December 17, 2007. Binh
      Thuan province obtained financing from other sources.

   b. A Level 2 Restructuring was approved by the Country Director on June 29, 2012.
      The changes included: (i) reduction in project scope; (ii) partial cancellation of
      credit proceeds in the amount of SDR9, 740,000 (US$14.6M) to reflect the
      reduction in project scope; (iii) extension of credit closing date for selected
      provinces and project components from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to enable
      Ho Chi Minh City, Ha Tinh province and MOC to complete ongoing contracts;
      (iv) a change in the DBO contracting process to DB only with operations directly
      assumed by water utilities; (v) change in the name of the implementing institution
      for Component 3; (vi) revision and reduction of the overall financing plan and
      costs by component; (vii) revisions in Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds)
      of the Credit Agreement to reflect actual costs and disbursements and in Schedule
      2 to reflect the revised scope of Component 4 including the names of participating
      provinces; and (viii) revision of the Results Framework to provide target values
      for the project’s outcome and output indicators and at the same time reflect the
      reduction in project scope.

   c. The second Level 2 Restructuring was approved by the Country Director on June
      28, 2013 to reflect an additional partial cancellation of credit proceeds in the
      amount of SDR 8,746,753 (US$13.15M). Revision in Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of
      Loan Proceeds) of the Credit Agreement was approved by the Country Director
      on June 28, 2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The project did not have Quality at Entry assessment.

Soundness of the background analysis. Background analysis was relatively sound. The

                                            5
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and related project documents properly identified and
captured the problems in Vietnam’s water and sanitation sector. Vietnam was in
transition to a market economy and was experiencing rapid economic growth but its
water supply and sanitation sector was struggling. Water supply systems needed to be
constructed and/or rehabilitated to expand provision of basic public services and cope
with increasing demand. The GoV strongly pursued sector reforms by adopting the
principle that water is an economic and social good and setting out an ambitious target of
full water supply and sanitation service coverage by 2020. It sought to achieve this vision
by developing alternative means of providing water services and mobilizing contributions
from a wide range of potential partners ranging from households to the private sector.
The project was informed by the analytical work relating to the development of GoV’s
strategy and policy for the sector as set out in the “Orientation for Urban Water Supply
Development” and “Orientation for the Development of Urban Sewerage and Drainage”.
In addition, the project drew lessons from international experiences, particularly in
developing innovations and new ways of providing water supply and sanitation services
and promoting market competition in the water sector. It also considered lessons from the
implementation of the first water supply project (credit N0260), which enabled GoV to
expand access of households to water supply in major cities and two sanitation projects
(Credit 3211 and 3475).

The project, however, did not provide sufficient attention to the local market conditions
as well as the institutional capacity implications for the key innovations and the scale that
it intended to implement. During project preparation, Vietnam was still in transition to
market economy and the private sector was still growing. In the water sector, the legal,
commercial and regulatory environment for private sector participation was still
premature. In terms of capacity, the local private sector practically had no experience in
water supply provision and lacked readiness to operate water supply systems. Despite this,
the project intended to apply the DBO innovation immediately to a rather large number
and geographically dispersed towns, provinces and cities (135 district towns in 27
provinces under Component 1).

Assessment of the project design. The PDO was too broadly defined. It covered five
areas: improved household water supply, improved household sanitation, enhanced
financial viability, environmental sustainability, and enhanced household health and
economic potential. The health and economic benefits were actually higher level
objectives instead of project level outcomes that can be solely attributable to the project
interventions. On the other hand this practice was often seen in other similar operations at
the time of appraisal. What was more of a problem was the lack of targets for the KPIs,
which was only added when the project was approaching the closing date. The Results
Framework that aimed to capture project achievements in these areas did not show a
logical sequencing of outcomes and outputs , i.e. there were no output indicators at all
(e.g., number of water supply systems constructed, number of sub-loans processed, etc.),
which made the project scope unclear.

The project adequately identified and assessed the environmental and social issues,
correctly determined safeguards classification and triggered applicable safeguards

                                             6
policies.

The project was made up of components that aligned well with government’s strategic
decision to scale up provision of water supply and sanitation. To achieve this, the project
offered a set of modalities (Components 1 to 3) to allow more flexibility in response to a
large number of WSCs, each having different investment needs. It also envisaged
applying many innovations in water supply provisions. It intended to bring private sector
into the provision and management of water supply and sanitation services; implement
sanitation revolving funds in participating towns and provinces through women’s unions;
and providing credit at commercial terms for WSCs to invest in water supply, among
others. This meant working with more than 40 institutions including the CPU, PPMUs,
VDB, WSCs, and women’s unions, among others, which were of varying sizes and
capacities. However, the institutional analysis for coordination, implementation and
management was wanting. The resulting institutional design for project implementation
was weak and became partially responsible for the many hurdles and delays that the
project had to face during implementation. The implications of bringing the private sector
to participate in water supply provision were also not fully studied and tested in terms of
appropriateness and applicability to local conditions. Finally, considering the scale and
complexity of design, the project only intended to implement all these activities within a
six-year period, which meant the implementation timetable was ambitious and unrealistic.
In fact, it was noted that prior to effectiveness, it already suffered a five-month delay
relative to the timetable agreed upon at negotiation.

Risk assessment: The project also did not have a complete and more thorough risk
assessment (as documented in the PAD). The project identified many risks. Among these
include (a) the application of DBO scheme in the development of a more efficient water
supply industry might not work since the scheme is unproven and the market response
largely untested; (b) procurement activities could be delayed due lengthy review and
approval process, lack of knowledge of World Bank procurement procedures and
documentation, lack of knowledge and skills on contract management, and weak
communication capacity; (c) WSC and Provincial Peoples Committee (PPC) would not
maintain tariffs at full cost recovery levels, (d) communities would not honor willingness-
to-connect agreements once the water supply system is complete; and (e) project funds
would not be disbursed on schedule. While the project correctly rated these risks as “High”
or “Substantial”, it did not provide sufficient and effective mitigation strategies that could
have been used to inform project design at appraisal and to focus monitoring and
supervision during implementation. In addition, the project was unable to anticipate the
possibility of project delays resulting from lack of readiness of subprojects (i.e., need for
feasibility studies to be carried out, completed and approved during project start up) and
institutions that would prepare, review, approve, procure and implement these subprojects.
This risk, which turned out to be very critical during implementation, almost
compromised PDO achievement. The project intended to hire an international consultant
to facilitate preparation of feasibility studies. However, the project experienced
substantial delays in procuring the consultant and further delays because it performed
poorly during implementation.



                                             7
Adequacy of government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement and/or
participatory processes. GoV’s overall commitment to implement the project was
adequate. GoV provided policy and institutional support to the project. It carried out
sector reforms and further decentralization of decision making to the local level. During
project implementation, GoV transformed all provincial WSCs from state owned
enterprises operating under the Law of State Owned Enterprises to limited liability
companies operating under the Incorporation Law. It also allowed WSCs to have
autonomy in making investment decisions and improving operational efficiency. With the
new laws became effective since 2005 (Construction Law and Procurement Law) and
following Government’s decrees guiding implementation of these laws, the distribution
of responsibilities between different levels (central/ local) and different units, agencies
(ministries, provincial peoples committees, provincial departments, WSCs, PPMUs)
became clearer and the decision making process has been streamlined.

The project tried to optimize stakeholder participation in project design (i.e., extensive
social intermediation, willingness-to-connect surveys, etc.). It moved from the traditional
supply- driven to demand- driven approach through extensive discussion and negotiation
with potential beneficiaries on willingness-to-pay for water services. However, the lack
of a good coordination mechanism between the CPU and the PPMUs during subproject
preparation and implementation led to the re-design of some subprojects as some designs
were not fit to local conditions.

2.2 Implementation

The project did not have Quality of Supervision assessment by Quality Assessment
Group (QAG).

Implementation delays. The project experienced considerable delays from project start
up to completion. Initially, the project effectiveness was delayed for five months.
Implementation further lagged behind schedule because of the procurement hurdles the
project had to face both at the CPU and the PPMU level. At the CPU level, there was
procurement failure in the recruitment of consultant who would prepare Phase 2
subprojects under the Competition Route. It took more than a year for the CPU to
complete the re-bid and implement this critical contract. Furthermore, the implementation
of this critical contract suffered from substantial delays because of the consultant’s poor
performance. It was only able to carry out feasibility studies for 22 district towns in six
provinces out of the planned 120 towns in 24 provinces. MOC terminated this contract
after two years of implementation and mobilized a number of local consultants to
implement remaining project activities. At the PPMU level, implementation again
suffered delays because feasibility studies and technical designs had to undergo a lengthy
review and approval process. Many PPMUs also faced difficulties in the procurement of
contractors for civil works because of their lack of familiarity with World Bank
procurement guidelines. In most cases, PPMUs took around two years to complete the
process.




                                            8
The innovations introduced by the project likewise delayed implementation. For instance,
in Ho Chi Minh City a NRW reduction program was piloted with a private sector through
performance-based contract was delayed because the PPMU had limited knowledge of
performance-based contracts.

Finally, land clearance and compensation activities were also delayed due to the
following major factors: (a) delayed mobilization of GoV counterpart funding for
compensation; (b) disagreement between District Committees and affected persons on the
amount of compensation; and (c) weak collaboration between PPMUs and District’s
Committee for Compensation, Support and Resettlement (or District’s Land Fund
Development Center).

Considerable increases in construction costs and town populations. The project was
heavily affected by inflation in 2007-08 and 2010-2011. In 2007-08, when some
subprojects were ready for implementation, Vietnam experienced extremely high
inflation, particularly in the construction sector. The spike in construction costs including
labor, cement and steel necessitated a review and subsequent adjustment of subproject
costs. Originally, the project proposed to construct water supply systems 135 towns for
about USD450, 000 per system. Each town had an average population of 6,500. However,
the considerable increases in construction costs coupled with increases in population
particularly of large towns (now averaging 15,000), the total cost of constructing a water
supply system increased to USD1.1 million. This necessitated a significant reduction in
the scope of Component 1. In 2010-2011, Vietnam again experienced high inflation (i.e.,
price indexes increased about 24 percent in just one year). This resulted in further scaling
down of some subproject activities (e.g., expansion in household connections). By the
original project closure, 3 out of 39 towns couldn’t complete their construction activities
and households in those towns couldn’t get access to water supply service as planned.
Those systems could be only fully completed in a year later. The project ultimately was
unable to achieve some of its revised targets (e.g., number of water supply beneficiaries
under Component 1).

Project mid-term review (MTR). At mid-term, the project was already performing
unsatisfactorily and was facing substantial risks in not achieving its development
objective. The MTR in 2008 properly identified key issues that affected implementation,
correctly determined key actions milestones, and focused on addressing implementation
bottlenecks. The Bank and Government agreed on firmer timelines for completing
feasibility studies and procurement activities and non-compliance with the deadline
would entail cancellation of the subproject. Both also agreed to carry out adjustments in
the project scope to address issues relating to slow project implementation and high
construction costs. However, MTR missed the opportunity of reviewing the relevance,
adequacy and robustness of the indicators specified in the project Results Framework and
providing targets for the indicators. This oversight, in turn, limited the ICR team to have
a better assessment of project achievements.

Project restructuring. The project was unable to optimize the benefits of restructuring
because it took place just as the project was closing. Project restructuring was initially

planned to be implemented in October 2010 with the full package submitted to the
Country Director for final approval. However, with substantial project changes, there
were discussions on whether or not the restructuring remained at Level 2 or needed to be
elevated to Level 1 that requires Board approval. Given that the Level 1 project
restructuring would be required only in the case of changing the PDO or introducing a
new safeguard policy, the Task Team had a series of consultations with the relevant units
within the Bank and the Government. The agreement to maintain a Level 2 restructuring
was reached only in April 2012. As a result, the project would be assessed giving more
weight (70%) to achievements before the project was restructured.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. Based on the PAD, M&E would be carried out by the CPU and PPMUs. The
PPMUs would be responsible for data collection while the CPU would take charge of
compiling data and monitoring overall project performance. Unfortunately, the M&E
framework was rather weak. The indicators specified were not well defined to properly
assess project performance and outcomes, and the key outputs were not sufficiently
captured in the framework. Some were also difficult to quantify and monitor. Besides,
most indicators did not have baseline and target values.

Furthermore, the discussion to revise the Results Framework was initiated at MTR, but
formal revision only took place as the project was closing in June 2012 (original closing
date). The reason for the delays was that at MTR, the preparation of phase 2 of
Component 1 had just started and the number of participating provinces was unclear.
Only by middle of 2010, when the project preparation was extremely slow due to the
poor performance of the selected consultant did the Task Team and the GoV have
reached an agreement to stop further preparation and the number of participating
provinces was finally identified. The revised Result Framework was incorporated in the
planned project restructuring, which was expected to be approved by October 2010.
However, with the delay in processing the project restructuring as described in the section
above, this only occurred in June 2012. The revision only introduced project targets. The
project provided insufficient attention in terms of assessing the relevance, adequacy and
appropriateness of outcome and output indicators as well as procedures for data analysis
and reporting.

Implementation and Utilization. During implementation, the project the CPU hoped
that baseline and targets values could be generated early on from the feasibility studies
and through the mobilization of a consultant to help the CPU to develop a monitoring
system for the project. However, the completion of feasibility studies was substantially
delayed and the hiring of the consultant fell through. The CPU instead designated an
M&E consultant to provide guidance to PPMUs in reporting, verifying and consolidating
data at the project level. With those efforts, the project M&E was improved during the
last three years of implementation and was helpful in informing decision and reallocation
of resources. It was a pity though that the target values were only provided near the
project end.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social safeguards. The project triggered Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12). It
anticipated that adverse social impacts would be created as a result of land acquisition for
the construction or rehabilitation of water treatment plants, source works and pipeline.
The preparation of social safeguards instruments followed the phasing of project
activities. At appraisal, four RAPs were prepared for Phase 1 and a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) was developed to guide the preparation of RAPs of subprojects to be
implemented in Phase 2. All social safeguard instruments (including RAPs of Phase 2)
were reviewed and were consistent with OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. Land
acquisition was carried out following the provision stipulated in the RAPs and the RPF.
The project complied with social safeguard policies. However, the project experienced
substantial delays in the implementation of site clearances and compensation (see Section
2.1). These delays had considerable adverse impact on the progress of civil works,
particularly for subprojects in Hanoi, Thai Nguyen, Bac Ninh and Ha Tinh. In addition,
changes in national legislation requiring the project to decentralize land acquisition and
compensation activities from the PPMUs to District Committees contributed to
difficulties in implementing these activities.

Environmental safeguards. The project was classified as Environmental Category B and
triggered Environmental Assessment (OP4.01). The project fully complied with
environmental safeguards policies. It prepared Environmental Assessment (EA) reports
and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for each sub-project and disclosed before
appraisal. The project mainly provided positive environmental and public health impacts
through the provision of clean, and reliable water supply services and improved sanitation.
During construction, the negative environmental impacts mitigated included the
temporary environmental pollution caused by waste and wastewater generated from
construction sites, and disturbance to daily activities of local population caused by
increased traffic on access roads, dust and noise from construction activities, traffic
disturbance and safety risks related to excavation works, etc. The project mobilized
construction management consultants to monitor subproject impacts on the environment.
The mitigation measures specified in the EMPs were incorporated in the construction
contracts and these were adequately carried out during the construction phase. There were
no reported cases of complaints from local communities during construction phase.
During operation, the key potential impacts mitigated include pollution related to sludge
and wastewater generated from the water treatment, and pollution from increased
wastewater generated by users connected to the new water supply systems. The main risk
is increased erosion/land slide potentials when the water treatment plants and drains are
built in hilly areas. While some potential impacts and risks in operation phase were also
addressed through engineering design solutions, some subprojects went further than
environmental safeguards through investments in architectural design and landscaping for
the water treatment plants. The project could have been better designed if it also included
investments to address the issues related to increased wastewater from new water supply
connections.




                                            11
Procurement. The project generally complied with project procurement procedures,
except for two cases that led to a re-bid of consulting services contract for the preparation
of Phase 2 subprojects and another one resulted in a declaration of misprocurement by the
Bank. In terms of procurement implementation, the project experienced a number of
challenges that led to serious delays in construction. These included difficulties and
delays in the preparation of standard bid documents, occurrence of failed bids, and
difficulties in evaluating reasonableness of bids. These problems were mainly a result of
the lack of familiarity and experience of project implementers in using World Bank
procurement procedures. A Procurement Manual was also developed to guide the PPMU.
Procurement training was also provided to the PPMUs and close supervision of the CPU
was carried out to help resolve these issues. A lengthy process also took place in
resolving the issue associated with the participation of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
of the MOC in the project given that MOC is the main implementing agency. This issue
was later resolved. MOC-dependent SOEs were declared ineligible to bid on any contract
under the project.

While the project experienced serious procurement hurdles, it also had achievements. The
high-value contract for NRW reduction under the Ho Chi Minh City subproject was the
first-ever (and only) performance based works contract that involved the participation of
the private sector in the O&M of a part of the public water supply system. This contract
has been successfully implemented. The project was also the first in Vietnam to introduce
and successfully implement the innovative form of bidding using DB contract for
construction of water supply schemes. This approach was replicated in another project
(Red River Delta Rural Water Supply & Sanitation Project). Initial implementation of the
sub-project was slow due to delays in sub-project preparation, including reviewing and
approving of the sub-project feasibility study and delays in procuring consultants and
contractors. Despite a lag in physical implementation, the results of this sub-project have
been impressive with NRW reduction targets already being surpassed. The performance
based contract could serve as a model for improving efficiency and quality of water
supply services in Vietnam, and in particular for reducing water losses. The substantial
impact of this subproject in achieving overall project objectives as well as in providing a
national demonstration effect warranted Bank approval for partial project extension for
one year.

Financial Management (FM). The FM and fund flow arrangements under the project
were complex. As a result, FM implementation was problematic at project start up to
2010. The project faced several FM-related issues including poor contract management,
delayed submission of interim financial reports and low disbursement rate. However, at
the latter part, FM implementation gradually improved as the CPU and the Task Team
streamlined the contract and fund flow arrangements; strengthened the FM capacities of
implementing agencies; and carried out improvements in internal controls. The project
mobilized consultants to support weak provincial WSCs and provided contract
management training for all implementing agencies.

In addition, one of the participating WSCs was allegedly in involved in fraudulent
practices under the project. The province’s State Inspectorate reported cases of poor

                                             12
quality of construction, potential acceptance of incomplete works, and overpayment to
completed volume of works. The Task Team conducted several special missions to
review the status of project implementation and requested corrective measures from
project implementing agency, contractors and consultants. Following the Team’s request,
appropriate corrective measures have been taken and the project implementation in this
province has been successfully and adequately completed. In another province, where a
contract was declared misprocurement, the concerned province refunded the Bank the
amount relating to that contract in a timely manner. By 2011, the project had a
functioning FM system, with adequate staff. Audit reports for 2012 of the whole project
were submitted on time with an unqualified opinion on the total project expenditures. All
WSCs disbursed funds as scheduled

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The water supply systems financed under Component 1 have been operational since 2012.
The respective provincial WSCs are managing these systems. They have already started
the collection of water payments. The project provided training on operation and
maintenance to strengthen their capacities. The provincial women’s unions will continue
to manage and on-lend the sanitation revolving fund (now on-lending second generation
fund) to households in respective provinces. Under Component 2, the WSCs will
continue to manage and operate their rehabilitated and expanded water supply systems
that allowed them to reduce water losses and improve service quality. The performance-
based contract for reducing NRW in HCMC is now widely accepted in the country as an
effective approach for improving the utility’s operational efficiency. Under Component 3,
the VDB will continue to provide new loans to the sectors from the fund collected from
repayments. In Component 4, a unit within the Administration of Technical Infrastructure
of the MOC will maintain the water and sanitation sector database that was established
under the project. The unit is equipped with adequate personnel and equipment. MOC
also issued an order institutionalizing the reporting mechanism for providing the required
performance indicators from water supply utilities for updating the database.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project’s objective remains highly relevant to the development priorities and
circumstances of Vietnam today. The project remains well aligned with GoV’s current
development priorities as reflected in Vietnam’s Socio-economic Development Plan. It is
also consistent with the current World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
Vietnam, which includes the Bank’s support to GoV’s efforts to improve water and
sanitation through the three engagement pillars: (a) strengthening Vietnam's
competitiveness in the regional and global economy, (b) increasing the sustainability of
its development, and (c) broadening access to economic and social opportunity.

In terms of design and implementation elements, the successful piloting of the innovative
NRW reduction program that involves private sector participation in the operation and

                                           13
maintenance of a part of the public water supply system though a performance based
contract was particularly relevant in the overall development of the water supply and
sanitation sector in Vietnam.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Based on the PDO statement, the project intended to improve: (a) household access to
water supply services, (b) household access to sanitation services, (c) participating WSCs’
financial sustainability, (d) environmental sustainability, and (e) household health and
economic potentials. Project achievements were measured based on these sub-objectives.
However, there were no baselines and targets for many of the project outcome and output
indicators. Thus, the ICR team faced limitations in terms of capturing project
performance vis-à-vis its original intent. Considering this, the ICR team rates the overall
project performance using the original Results Framework as Unsatisfactory. Based on
the Revised Results Framework, the project was evaluated as follows:

Objective 1: Improved access to water supply services. This objective was originally
envisaged to be achieved mainly through the (a) construction of water supply systems in
135 district towns in 27 provinces (Component 1); and (b) rehabilitation and expansion of
water supply systems in three provinces and one city (Component 2). Around 885,000
households were expected to benefit from Component 1 while there was no target set for
Component 2. The operational difficulties and the unanticipated inflation during
implementation necessitated the project to be restructured; the scope of Component 1 was
substantially reduced to 39 towns in 9 provinces (see Section 1.6). The number of target
beneficiaries was subsequently reduced to 445,000. At ICR, the project was only able to
benefit 383,654 individuals, achieving 86 percent of the revised target. The project had to
further scale down the number of household connections because of the considerable
increases in construction costs in 2010-11.

For Component 2, there were no changes in the overall scope (3 provinces, 1 city). At
restructuring, the project targeted 553,130 individuals to benefit from improved water
supply access. At ICR, it provided access to 841,927 individuals (152 percent of revised
target). This was made possible because Ho Chi Minh City was able to reduce the volume
of water physically lost from its water system by 101,645 m3/day surpassing by 10
percent the target of 91,726 m3/day (and thus reaching more households). In addition, Hai
Phong was able to connect more households in its water system. While the project
reached fewer beneficiaries in Component 1, this was compensated by larger number of
beneficiaries in Component 2. In total, the project benefited 1,446,648, representing 120
percent of the overall revised target. Finally, all water samples were effectively treated
and complied with Vietnam water quality standards, signifying that water is clean, safe
and potable. Project performance in achieving this objective is rated Satisfactory based
on the revised target.

Objective 2: Improved access to sanitation services. Again, the project did not have
any targets in terms of outcomes and outputs at appraisal. At restructuring, the project
intended to (a) improve access to sanitation of 60,000 individuals, (b) reach 445, 000

                                            14
individuals by the project’s hygiene education program, and (c) target repayment rate
under the sanitation revolving fund at 95 percent. At ICR, it was able to improve the
access to sanitation of 37,375 individuals (62 percent of the revised target). It also
reached 383,654 individuals with hygiene education (86 percent of those with improved
water supply access). Household repayment rate for borrowing from the sanitation fund
repayment rate is 99 percent (beyond the revised target of 95 percent). The performance
of the sanitation subcomponent is rated as Moderately Satisfactory based on the revised
target.

The results of the beneficiary survey supports the figures presented above. It reported that
98.7 percent of the respondents expressed satisfaction with the improved provision of
water supply and sanitation services. Households also indicated that improved water and
sanitation access resulted in (a) declining incidence of water-borne diseases, (b)
additional livelihood and entrepreneurial opportunities for households, (c) time savings
for women in doing house chores, and (c) children being able to go to school because
they saved time in fetching water, among others. The improved access of households to
water also resulted in household investments in sanitation and hygiene improvements.
See Annex 4: Beneficiary Survey Results.

Objective 3: Improved financial sustainability of participating WSCs. While
participating WSCs, in general, are still unable to recover operating costs from annual
revenues because the operation of many new water supply systems has just started, they
already achieved the target working ratio at end-of-project (64 percent against targeted 63
percent). Provincial WSCs under Component 1 registered a net loss of VND 6.884
million while those participating in Component 2 reported a net income of VND 125,322
million. The WSCs have been operational in just one year. Revenues are still lower
relative to target because the number of water connection is still picking up. The expected
improvements in household connection and the lifting of Government regulation to freeze
water tariff, there will be definite increases in the revenues of participating WSCs will
increase. The successful piloting HCMC of reduction in NRW program through
performance-based contract with a private sector has improved its financial sustainability.
It has also demonstrated a new model for improving operational efficiency. Project
performance in achieving this sub-objective is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on
revised target.

Objective 4: Improved environmental sustainability. The project did not have specific
indicators to assess project achievements in promoting environmental sustainability.
However, the project contributed to environmental sustainability through (a)
improvement in access of 37,375 households to sanitation fund to allow them to invest in
sanitation facilities, (b) reduction in NRW that allows WSCs to operate efficiently, and
(c) provision of water treatment plants to treat wastewater and sludge generated from
increased water consumption. Project performance in achieving this sub-objective is rated
Moderately Satisfactory based on associated outcomes.

Objective 5: Improved household health and economic potentials. The project
likewise did not have any indicators to assess this objective. It is also difficult to measure

                                             15
and attribute changes in household health and economic potentials solely to project
interventions. This should not have been part of the PDO as it belonged to higher-level
objectives. On the other hands, the project obviously did contribute to achieving this
objective through the provision of (a) water supply that comply with Vietnam water
quality standards to 1.2 million people, (b) sanitation facilities to 37,375 households, (c)
information and dissemination campaigns that improved health and hygiene of people in
project areas. Project performance in achieving this sub-objective is rated Moderately
Satisfactory based on associated outcomes.

3.3 Efficiency

At appraisal, an economic analysis was conducted. The project sampled 4 provinces
including Ha Nam, Thai Binh, and Binh Dinh (for Component 1) and Haiphong (for
Component 2). The economic benefits were derived from consumer surplus or user gains
resulting from easy access to water at rates lower than more costly alternatives and public
health improvements. The economic analysis showed economic rates of return (EIRR)
higher than the discount rate of 12 percent. It also produced positive net present values
(NPV). A financial analysis was also carried out. The analysis showed that the FIRRs
remained robust even under scenarios of demand shortfalls, higher capital and operating
requirements.

Economic and financial analyses were also carried out at ICR following the methodology
at appraisal. Results show EIRR at completion ranges between 9.7 and 52.0 percent,
showing evident combination of direct benefit, consumer surplus, and public health
benefits. For the subprojects included at restructuring, NPV tends to be smaller than the
projected value simply because this analysis employs the same methodology as that used
at appraisal, i.e., base year in 2006. Benefits for HCMC subproject became significant
because of the combination of successful water loss and water tariff that is higher than
                                            16
when projected. The FIRR, on the other hand, range from -15.2 to 31.9 percent. The
values are generally small because the water tariff level is still stepping up, yet to recover
all the costs including depreciation. But cash flow analysis shows that the current tariff
level is already sufficient in recovering all the operational cost and paying finance cost,
and generating positive annual net cash flow. For the projects included at restructuring,
NPV tends to be smaller than the projected value simply because this analysis employs
the same methodology with that at appraisal, i.e., base year in 2006. FIRR for component
2 is generally higher than component 1 because of higher tariff level and better
operational cost control. FIRR for HCMC project is much larger because of the
combination of successful water loss and water tariff that is higher than when projected.
See Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Moderately Unsatisfactory. The project remains relevant to current priorities of GoV.
There was also evidence that the water supply systems supported by the project are
operating in full cost recovery and are providing economic benefits to society in direct
benefits, consumer surplus and public health benefits. However, the original project
scope was significantly reduced relative to project design. Restructuring happened at a
very late stage so the original targets carry more weights (63%) because disbursement
was 63% at the time of restructuring. Overall the weighted rating is MU given the
original rating is U and the revised is MS.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

During project preparation, socio-economic surveys were carried out in each project town
with specific focus on poverty and gender issues. The poor households were carefully
identified and verified. Women have been specifically interviewed. Connection
commitment surveys were also undertaken to determine the communities’ views in terms
of the scope of investment, technical options, associated costs and tariffs. The project
could only be approved for implementation if at least 60 percent of the households in the
towns endorsed the investment and committed to use the service provided with
predefined tariff. At completion, the project benefited low- income households through
improved access to water supply and sanitation. The sanitation revolving fund
implemented by women’s unions allowed low- income households to access loans for the
construction of improved on-site sanitation facilities. Eighty six percent of the
respondents of the Beneficiary Survey affirmed that the project benefited women and
children because they were generally responsible for house chores. Benefits generally
accrue from time- savings from fetching water.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening occurred at the local and national levels. At the local level, the
project built the capacity of PPMUs to plan, develop and implement water supply

                                             17
systems through learning-by-doing and training particularly in the areas of project
management, procurement, contract management, financial management and construction
quality assurance. At the national level, the project also strengthened the capacity of the
MOC in project management and water sector management and regulation through a
series of knowledge exchanges and establishment of water sector database.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project did not have any significant unintended outcomes and impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A Beneficiary Survey with a total of 757 respondents was conducted in October 2013 to
ascertain project achievements in relation to its project outcome indicators. Results of the
survey show that 99 percent of the respondents are satisfied with the improved water
supply service (42 percent are highly satisfied, 40 percent are quite satisfied and 17
percent are satisfied). In addition, 58 percent of the household respondents stated that the
water supplied for 24 hours per day; 29 percent said the water supplied within 12-24
hours per day and just 13 percent indicated the water supplied less than 12 hours per day.
About 94 of survey household respondents consider water quality as acceptable. When
asked about water tariff, about 88 percent of household respondents stated that the project
water tariff is reasonable and affordable. Eighty percent of the household respondents are
also very satisfied with the service provided by WSCs. Those who were not satisfied
expressed the following reasons: delayed monthly billing, inaccuracy in metering, and
unresponsiveness in household requests to repair broken pipes or leakages. The survey
also revealed that there were significant changes in sanitation behavior of household-
respondents. The percentage of households using flush toilet increased from 76 before the
project to 83 percent after the project. Households using public/shared facilities or using
practice of open defecation reported that they already built their own sanitation facilities.
There was also an increase in the number of households using double septic tanks. Please
see Annex 4: Beneficiary Survey.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcome is rated Moderate. The water supply facilities had
sound technical design and were generally constructed following quality standards. These
facilities are now operational. Households generally expressed commitment to obtain
water services through willingness-to-connect surveys. Water tariff is set following the
full cost recovery principle. However, tariff increases were frozen for certain periods due
to hyperinflation. During the first year of operation, water bill collection rate is relatively
high ranging from 85 to 93 percent indicating that households are willing and able to pay
for the water services. The WSCs have experience in operating and managing water
supply systems. On the other hand, the provincial sanitation fund implemented by the
women’s is likely to be sustained. The rate of repayment is high at 98 percent. The ability
of households to sustain payments for water and sanitation services, particularly the
poorer ones, however, is largely dependent on their ability to access income and

                                              18
employment opportunities, which in turn, is generally influenced by the country’s macro -
economic conditions.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank Team was responsive to the needs of the country and GoV’s pursuit of scaling
up the provision of water supply and sanitation at the time of appraisal. The Team
attempted to incorporate in the project design the lessons from previous projects and
successful international experience in bringing the private sector into the provision of
water supply and sanitation. The project also adequately identified and assessed the
environmental and social issues, correctly determined safeguards classification and
triggered applicable safeguards policies.

However, appraisal had serious shortcomings including the following: (a) the PDO was
too broadly defined and the Results Framework was inadequate in capturing project
performance, outputs and outcomes. There were no baselines and targets, which is a
significant shortcoming for quality at entry and limited the ability of the ICR team to
assess overall outcome; (b) project design was too complex and ambitious- the project
required working with a large number of implementing agencies that are geographically
dispersed and having varying capacities, sizes and investment needs; (c) the project
intended to apply a number of innovations to a large number of WSCs without fully
studying or testing their applicability and appropriateness to local conditions; (d) it also
did not adequately assess the institutional and implementation requirements vis-à-vis
local capacity for carrying out the innovations introduced by the project; and finally (e)
the project did not sufficiently identify and develop risk mitigation measures. These
shortcomings apparently took a toll on project implementation and outcomes.


(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Task Team carried out 17 formal implementation review missions over the 8 years of
project implementation. The skills mix of the Task Team was deemed adequate, with
technical, social, environmental, procurement and financial management specialists
participating in most supervision missions. The Aide memoires and Implementation
Status Reports (ISRs) provided candid assessment of project status. The Task Team
carried out the MTR on time; identified the right issues and sought various approaches to
solve them. The advice of the Task Team was considered by government implementing
agencies as very useful and responsive. While the Task Team successfully helped GoV to
restructure the project, it could have exerted more efforts to expedite the restructuring
process to optimize the benefits of restructuring which included one year of extension for

                                            19
a number of project components and sub-projects. The extension then proved its
appropriateness when it allowed the performance-based contract in Ho Chi Minh City to
substantially complete, Ha Tinh province to fully complete its sub-project and MOC to
complete the establishment of the sector database. The Bank could have also carried out
quality-of-supervision assessment to further help steer project implementation
considering that the project was a problem project for several years. Finally, the Bank
team could have exerted more efforts in helping GoV to review and assess the
appropriateness, adequacy and relevance of the indicators in the Results Framework. This
shortcoming has apparently limited the ICR’s assessment of project achievements and
overall performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Quality at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory while quality of supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Overall Bank performance is therefore rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory given the overall outcome rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government provided policy and institutional support to the project. Sector reforms and
further decentralization efforts were carried out. Government transformed state owned
enterprises into limited liability companies operating under the Incorporation Law.

It continued to carry out sector reforms and further decentralization of decision making to
the local level. During project implementation, all provincial WSCs were transformed
from state owned enterprises operating under the Law of State Owned Enterprises to
operating under the Incorporation Law. It also allowed WSCs to make their own
investment decisions to improve operational efficiency. Government also provided
decrees guiding the implementation of laws that affect the water and sanitation sector.
This allowed a clearer distribution of responsibilities at various levels and a more
streamlined decision-making process among agencies. However, during the transition, the
project experienced delays in decision-making. In 2007, the Government issued a new
decree on production and distribution of clean water in urban areas and industrial zones,
which has set clearer commercial principles for the sector.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The MOC was successful in establishing the CPU, which provided clear guidance and
strong support to provinces during the project implementation. The MOC-CPU regularly
carried out field visits to the subprojects and reviewed implementation progress. The



                                            20
CPU also provided advice in resolving implementation hurdles; and urged participating
Provincial People’s Committees to continue to support and facilitate subproject progress.
However, the MOC faced considerable hurdles in mobilizing the consultant who would
support the CPU in project preparation and implementation.

The project involved a large number of implementing agencies with varying commitment,
capacity to implement and sustain investments, and compliance with project requirements.
While in general, compliance with the project requirements was sustained, several
weaknesses were observed. The PPMU staff had limited technical capacity in
construction quality assurance, contract and financial management, environmental and
social safeguards implementation. This resulted in extremely slow process of reviewing
project documents, several procurement failures, cases of fraud and misuse of project
funds, and a number of contract management issues, among others. During the project
implementation, series of training courses to PPMU staff have been provided to improve
their skills in overall project management, contract and financial management. The
performance of PPMUs was improved in the last year of project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Government provided policy and institutional support to implement the project. However,
the large number of implementing agencies to be coordinated by the MOC, and the
limited knowledge and capacity of local project staff in project implementation
significantly slowed down project implementation and almost compromised PDO
achievement.

6. Lessons Learned

The key lessons from this project are:

Performance based contract could be a good model for improving operational
efficiency of a water supply utility. It was clear from the Ho Chi Minh City non-
revenue reduction sub-project that for the type of works targeting improvement of
operational efficiency of a water supply utility, where the required inputs from the
contractors were not just construction activities, but their expertise and knowledge, a new
model of contract such as performance based one could be an appropriate model. The big
difference in results achieved in 2 zones of Ho Chi Minh City networks with 2 different
models of contracting demonstrated advantage of the new model. The Ho Chi Minh City
and the GoV now seriously considers using this new type of contract model introduced
by the project for similar activities in new projects.

Keep project design simple and realistic. The appraisal team could have been more
selective in the approach and modalities for water and sanitation provision as well as in
the innovations that it wanted to carry out. It could also have proposed to unbundle
interventions or phase implementation to lower project risks and make implementation
manageable. The project was composed of many components; some could actually be

                                            21
stand-alone and be a separate project (e.g., component 3- provision of non-subsidized
credit to WSCs, etc.). Perhaps, the team could have focused on providing support to
public WSCs in rehabilitating and expanding their water supply systems (Component 2)
and/or piloting a few innovations.

Start small and test innovations before scaling up. Following the discussion above, the
team could also have piloted an innovation (e.g., DBO) to a few district towns first to test
its appropriateness and applicability in the local context before scaling it up. If it worked,
the project could replicate this to other district towns or provinces. The pilot cases should
also complete the entire project cycle (preparation to completion) first before these are
scaled up. In the case of VUWSP, the pilot cases (15) for the DBO were only applied to
project preparation and immediately scaled up to 135. The failure to implement the pilot
cases before scaling up did not allow the project to fully test the applicability of the
innovation, extract lessons and anticipate serious problems during implementation.

In addition, the team could have carried out market and institutional analyses particularly
when adopting innovations that involve the private sector. Adopting lessons and
innovations from other countries, as in the case of DBO contracting arrangement, should
take into account their applicability to the local context and the capacities of local
stakeholders to carry them out. Vietnam was still in transition to market economy, its
legal, commercial and regulatory environment for private sector participation was still
premature, and both the Government and the private sector were not fully prepared to
adopt the innovations introduced by the project.

Pay sufficient attention to institutional readiness to implement. In low capacity
context, a thorough assessment of institutional readiness of implementing agencies would
be necessary in order for any project to craft a feasible institutional and coordination
mechanism for project implementation; and design any capacity-building program. The
project should provide sufficient support to areas showing high or substantial risks (e.g.,
procurement and safeguards) and strengthen capacity building activities including more
implementation support by the Bank team. .

The project mobilized a consulting firm to support implementation and beef up local
capacity. There is a need to review this approach. Like some other projects in EAP, this
approach seemed to have not worked well. In the case of VUWDP, it almost
compromised achievement of PDO.

Don’t just identify the risks; exhaust ways to effectively manage them. This is
particularly true in the context of procurement under the project. The project pursued the
hiring of a consultant to prepare 135 feasibility studies in one single (and lumpy) package
despite the fact that procurement risks were considered substantial during appraisal. The
project could have considered clustering towns and provinces into several packages based,
for instance, on geographic location. By doing this, the project could have mobilized a
number of firms all at the same time to prepare the feasibility studies, thereby, avoiding
delays.



                                             22
Ensure a properly designed and functional M&E. At startup, the project should have
immediately set up an M&E system and ensured that M&E arrangements were in place.
The ability of any project to steer implementation in light of many hurdles depends
largely on whether it can (a) monitor and evaluate plans and activities, outputs and
outcomes; (b) inform in a timely manner the key project decision-makers about project
status, issues, and key risks; and (c) obtain feedback on key actions needed to mitigate
risks or resolve issues. Many delays could have been avoided, proactive measures could
have been put in place, and project achievement could have been properly and adequately
measured if the project had a sound M&E system in place.

Follow through on good practices or innovations initiated by the project. The project
demonstrated innovations that are worth pursuing (e.g., sanitation revolving fund and
NRW reduction program). It would be beneficial to have a follow through on these good
practices or innovations

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic and financial analysis has been conducted to the water supply service
subprojects in Component 1 (Competition route) and Component 2 (Performance route).
The water supply service in Component 1 and 2 accounts 87% (USD 117.7 million) of
the total project cost at PAD stage, and 91% (USD 88.2 million) of the total project cost
at completion stage.

A. Economic Analysis
 1. Introduction
The economic analysis calculates projects’ net present value (NPV) and economic
internal rate of return (EIRR), assuming (a) direct benefit, (b) consumer surplus, and (c)
public health benefits for the project period 2006-2016. The same methodology,
assumptions and constant 2003 prices, and economic discount rate of 12%, which were
used at appraisal, were used to make the comparison between appraisal stage and
completion stage viable. However, some modification was made, namely for the
methodology to estimate water supply cost and consumption in without case, and the
methodology to calculate public health benefits.

 2. Methodology and assumptions
Economic analysis was conducted by comparing two scenarios: (a) “with” the Bank
project and (b) “without” the Bank project. Without project scenario for Component 1
assumes that the Project area continues to have no access to piped water, and therefore,
peoples rely water supply on alternative methods such as bore holes, open wells,
rainwater etc. Without scenario for Component 2 assumes no rehabilitation or
reinforcement for each subproject.

The concept of and the methodology for calculating direct benefit, consumer surplus and
public health benefits are summarized below.

Direct Benefit: Direct-use benefits measure the gain in society’s welfare from the
incremental increase in output at a lower price and its value that a consumer attaches to
the output that they receive. It can be measured by the amount a consumer pays for water
after the project has been commissioned.

In this analysis, direct benefit is nearly identical to the financial revenues generated by
the subproject, i.e., the average tariff of water from the water supply multiplied by the
amount of water consumed by customers in the Project area. Data on yearly average tariff
and yearly water consumption in the Project area were provided by the water supply
companies (WSCs) in each subproject.

Consumer Surplus: Consumer surplus is the additional benefit to society’s welfare
arising from a higher consumption with a lower price than the consumption and price in

                                            34
the “without” case. The consumer surplus consists of two parts, one arising from the less
costly water supply, and the other arising from higher use of water with lower prices,
compared to alternative water supply options in “without” case.

In order to estimate the consumer surplus, alternative water supply options including
possible water supply cost and water consumption in without case needs to be identified.
At appraisal, those were determined using information from socio-economic surveys
analyses as part of the feasibility study. At completion, those relied on the latest
estimation submitted by each WSC. Water supply cost varied approximately from 10,000
to 15,000 VND/m3, depending on the types of alternative supply options and conditions
in each subproject.

Public Health Benefits: Water supply projects have often been justified on the basis of
perceived positive impacts on public and private health, e.g., clean water supply reduces
water-related diseases such as diarrhea, worms and skin-infections. Also, people affected
by those diseases lose income when they cannot work and have to spend money for
curing.

Quantification of these benefits is, however, not straightforward because of several
reasons including that (i) improved health cannot be achieved only by clean water, but
accompanied by health and hygiene awareness, (ii) health impacts are sometimes caused
by nutrition issues rather than safe water issues, and (iii) health benefit in monetary terms
is ultimately realized by increased productivity due to reduced number of sick days.

At appraisal, public health benefits for each subproject were estimated by using
information from socio-economic surveys analyses and putting various complicated
assumptions as part of feasibility studies. Reproduction of this procedure at completion
stage is unrealistic, but, as an alternative way, annual public health benefit per capita
(VND/capita) was derived from feasibility study at the timing of the Project restructuring
in 2012. It has been found out that the annual unit value varies from 134,520 VND/capita
to 298,070 VND/capita. In this analysis, the lowest (the most conservative) value of
134,520 VND/capita was used to all the subprojects in order to avoid overestimation of
the benefits.

Salvage Value: The analysis included salvage value of economic assets at the end of the
Project period in 2016. Depreciation rate for civil construction, equipment, and building,
which was reported by each PMU, was used for calculating the salvage value.

Project Cost: Economic project cost is calculated from actual project cost, assuming 10%
for VAT in domestic work and equipment, and 20% import duty for foreign equipment,
which is adjusted by exchange rate of 1.31.

 3. Results
EIRR and NPV for each subproject are summarized in the Table A3-1, showing evident
combination of direct benefit, consumer surplus, and public health benefits. For the

                                             35
projects included at restructuring, NPV at completion tends to be smaller than the value
at appraisal because of the difference in project period assumption. Benefits for HCMC
subproject became significant because of the combination of successful water loss and
water tariff that is higher than the expected price level.

B. Financial Analysis
  1. Introduction
Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and Financial Net Present Value (NPV) with the
hurdle rate of 10% were calculated. FIRR was calculated on net cash flow against
“equity”. At appraisal, 15% of the project cost had been assumed to come from equity
contribution from local stakeholders. But in reality, little equity contribution was made
for Component 1, which makes the direct comparison using the same methodology
impossible. Hence, the financial analysis at completion stage hypothetically assumes 15%
of the project cost was financed by equity even when it came from debt. For Component
2, actual equity injection value was used.

  2. Methodology and assumptions
Operational Data: This analysis used the actual (from 2003 to 2013) and projected (from
2013 to 2016) operational data, such as population, average household size, number of
new water connections, total water connections, water supply capacity, annual water
consumption, Unaccounted for Water (UFW), average water tariff, connection fee, staff
cost, operational cost (electricity, alum and chlorine), and depreciation of fixed asset. The
information was provided by each WSC.

                                                        36
Debt: It is assumed that 85% of the project cost was financed by debt with the term of
3.0% interest rate, 20-year duration, and 3-year grace period. It is also assumed the debt
was injected in accordance with the actual project disbursement profile.

  3. Results
FIRR for each subproject is summarized in the Table A3-2. For component 1, FIRR is
generally small mainly because, as stated in the main text, the water tariff level is still
picking up, yet to recover all the costs including depreciation. But cash flow analysis
shows that the current tariff level is almost sufficient to recover all the operational cost,
pay most of finance cost, and finally generate positive annual net cash flow. For the
projects included at restructuring, NPV at completion tends to be smaller than the value
at appraisal because of the difference in project period assumption. FIRR for component
2 is generally higher than component 1 because of the higher tariff level and better
operational cost control. FIRR for HCMC project is much bigger because of the
combination of successful water loss and water tariff that is higher than when projected.

C. Conclusions
The economic analysis showed that the Project brought sufficient economic benefits to
the consumers in the Project areas by providing better access to clean water with higher
quantity and with lower price. The financial analysis showed that positive cash flow for
WSCs has generally been achieved, and this achievement will be continued if the current


                                                        37
pace of increasing demand and increasing average tariff for cost recovery are maintained.
Financial viability of WSCs is generally dependent on the level of water tariff.

                        Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The main objective of the beneficiary survey is to obtain the perceptions of the project
beneficiaries about the water supply and sanitation services provided under the project,
assess the level of satisfaction for these services. Data was primarily obtained from the
conduct of a survey using a structured questionnaire. A total of 757 household-
respondents were participated in the survey, including 752 households and 5 institutions.

Key Findings
1. Household-respondents have an average size of 4.2. Majority of the households
   respondents have an estimated income ranging from VND 1.6-5.0 million per month
   and averaging VND 3.8 million per month. Based on the current poverty line, HHs
   living in rural area with income below VND1.6 million per month (equivalent to
   VND 400,000 per person per month) can be considered poor, while those with
   income between VND1.6 – 2 million can be considered near poor. The survey
   estimated that 47 HHs have income of VND1.6 million and below per year
   (accounting for 6.3% of total respondents), while 245 HHs have income of VND1.6–
   2 million (accounting for 32.6% of total respondents).
2. All water supply systems are under operation since June 2012. The average monthly
   household water consumption of surveyed respondents is about 15.9m3, or 132.5
   liters per person per day; which is a bit higher than the Government benchmarking
   index of 100 liters per person per day.
3. The average water tariff ranges from VND 6,200 to 8,300 per m3. Collection of water
   payments is registered at 85.1% (from draft PCR). Most households (52.9% pay less
   than VND84,000 per month, for their water usage. On the average, households pay
   VND 121,600 per month for their water consumption.
4. Results obtained from the survey indicate that improved water supply provide
   satisfaction to the local population: 621 respondents (about 82%) expressed their full
   satisfaction; 127 respondents (about 16.8%) stated that it is normal; while only 8
   respondents (1.2%) said they are partially unsatisfied.
5. The household’s satisfaction is also expressed through continuity of service, which is
   illustrated by average hours of service per day for water supply. About 57.5% stated
   that the water supplied for 24/24 hours per day; 29.2% said the water supplied within
   12-24 hours per day and just 13.3% indicated the water supplied less than 12 hours
   per day. The water pressure is high, which reach about 20m height or more. It is also
   confirmed by surveyed households that 442 surveyed household (58.6%) stated that
   the water can reach at about 10-20m height, and 312 other households (30.7%)
   indicated the height that water can reach is beyond 20m.
6. About 93.9% of survey households (equivalent to 709 households) expressed that the
   quality of water supply is acceptable. There rest of the households (about 6.1%)
   claimed that the water quality is not quite good because of un-fresh, has bad smell
   and bad taste.

                                           41
7. When asked about water tariff, about 87.5% households stated that water tariff is
   reasonable and affordable. About 6.4% others expressed it is quite expensive, as
   compared with their current income.
8. Out of 757 respondents participating the survey, 606 respondents (equivalent to 80%)
   showing that they are very satisfied with the service provided by WSCs; 135
   respondents (about 17.8%) stated that the water service is acceptable and just only 16
   respondents (occupy 2.1%) indicated they are a little un-satisfied. The reasons why
   some households were not satisfied with the services of WSCs are: delayed billing,
   inaccurate metering, bad condition (e.g., pipe breaks and leakages) of piped network,
   and weak customer service particularly on information dissemination.
9. The survey also revealed that there was significant change in sanitation behavior of
   household- respondents. The percentage of households using flush toilet increased
   from 76 before the project to 83 percent after the project. Households using
   public/shared facilities or using practice of open defecation reported that they already
   built their own sanitation facilities. The survey also shows that other households
   using public/shared facilities or using practice of open defecation (none of sanitation
   facility) built their own facilities as a result of water supply.
10. In term of sanitation facility types, the septic tank seems to be a common structure,
    for population living in suburban or district towns with no connection to main sewage
    pipes provided by local governments. This is also familiar with project households.
    About 94.3% of the respondents stated that they are using septic tank before the
    project, in which 80.2% using septic tank with double tanks and 14.5% using septic
    tank with single tank. After the project about 86.4% households are using double
    septic tanks. Most households who previously used bucket latrine or using practice of
    open defecation have built their own sanitation facilities. The number of bucket
    latrines decreased and having been replaced by septic tanks.
11. When the households were asked to give their views about benefits obtained from
    improved water supply system, they all indicated that piped water supply enables to
    change their lifestyle and living standards.
       a. 81.8% indicated that benefits from improved water supply and sanitation is of
          crucial importance to the preservation of human health as diarrhea, psilosis,
          typhoid, and cholera, especially among children and women, that the
          improved water supply and sanitation services would largely contribute to
          promoting them.
       b. 47.8% expressed that water-related diseases are the most common cause of
          illness and death, mostly among the poor people, that those with improved
          services would suffer less morbidity and mortality from water-related
          diseases.
       c. 24.5% said that girls and boy have better educational and productive
          opportunities when they have water and sanitation facilities nearby, because
          they can safeguard their privacy in school and save time fetching water.

                                            42
       d. 52.5% revealed that better services resulting the installation of piped water
          supply in houses, and latrines closer to home yield significant time savings,
          especially for housework carried out by woman.
       e. 20.8% showed that the availability of water could be used to start or expand
          small enterprises (as motorbike wash, laundry…) and thus increase disposable
          household income.
12. Beyond reducing the water-borne and water-washed diseases, providing better access
    to improved water and sanitation confers many other diverse benefits ranging from
    the easily identifiable and quantifiable (costs avoided, time saved) to the more
    intangible and difficult to measure (convenience, well-being). The respondents, to
    some extent, provided that the most benefit from the improved water supply is
    woman, as affirmed from 60% of total respondents, because they are key actor for
    housework mostly related to water consumption, then next coming are children,
    reported by 25.8%. In addition, the man is also benefited from the service, for time
    saving related to water collection or accessing sanitary facilities, and the elder, could
    expect to live longer, while access to better water quality.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1. The Management Board of Technical Infrastructure Development Projects
   (MABUTIP) prepared the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Vietnam Urban
   Water Supply Development Project (Credit number 4028 –VN) from July 1, 2013 to
   November 30, 2013. MABUTIP required all subprojects implemented under this
   project to prepare individual completion reports. These reports were reviewed and
   verified by MABUTIP and the PCR consultant and then consolidated at the project
   level.

Project Background

2. The Vietnam Urban Water Supply Development Project aimed to assist the
   Borrower to improve water and household sanitation services in selected district
   towns and large urban centers in the participating provinces, in financially and
   environmentally sustainable manners, thus enhancing the health and economic
   potential of the resident households. The project was approved by the Board on
   December 21, 2004, signed on July 15, 2005 and became effective on November 11,
   2005. The project had five components:

      Component A (Competition Route)- Investment in new water supply systems
       for district towns where w a t e r s u p p l y c o m p a n i e s ( WSCs) are willing
       to contract out delivery of services through the DBO process (Sub-component
       A1), and investments in household sanitation including associated hygiene
       education program (Sub-component A2);
      Component B (Performance Route)- Investment to improve and expand
       services in better performing WSCs;
      Component C (Water Supply and Sanitation Lending Facility)- Establishment of
       a non-subsidized water supply and sanitation lending facility;
      Component D (Building Capacity in the Sector)- Investment in building
       capacity in the WSS sector; and
      Component E (Management of Project Implementation).

Assessment of PDO

    3. Overall, the project achieved the following: (a) 1,446,648 million individuals
       benefited from improved access to water supply systems. This represents 120%
       of the revised target; (b) 37,375 individuals now have access to improved
       sanitation facilities (62% of revised target); and (c) Average working ratio is
       64%, achieving the target value of 63%. Project achievement is rated
       Satisfactory.

Evaluation of the Bank’s Performance

    4. Supervision of Bank staff has substantially contributed to the implementation of
       the Project. The WB review and approval particularly with respect to proposals/

                                           45
       queries by CPU and PPMUs and review and approval of bid evaluation reports
       were provided in a timely manner. In addition, project effectiveness, the Bank
       sent many missions to Vietnam to review the implementation of the project. The
       missions appeared to be very effective with respect to helping solve outstanding
       problems encountered during implementation; hence the project progress was
       expedited and improved. With direct discussions, the missions were able to
       provide useful advice and/or instructions based on the Bank guidelines and
       policies. With this assistance, the CPU and PPMUs ensured that action taken
       were acceptable to the Bank. On completion of each mission, an Aide Memoire
       was provided to record difficulties and problems in each sub-project, specifying
       responsibilities, recommending remedial actions, and timely settlement of all
       problems and obstacles to ensure project progress. Bank performance is rated
       Highly Satisfactory.

    5. Government proposes that the World Bank should:
          Intensify its involvement in giving comments and recommendations to the
            Vietnam authorities for solving the difficulties, obstacles during the
            preparation and implementation of sub-projects.
          Issue the criteria for the assessment of the conflict of interest of the
            bidders to facilitate the selection of contractor.
          Issue the detailed guidance and train the contractors on contract payment
            procedures especially the preparation of Final Statement.

Evaluation of Performance of the Borrower and the Implementing Agencies

    6. The MOC was the focal point among the Government, World Bank and
       participating provincial people’s committees. During preparation of the project,
       the MOC worked closely with the World Bank during project preparation,
       discussed project implementation arrangements and recommended limiting pilot
       initiatives in the project. To support the participating provinces, the MOC in
       collaboration with the World Bank regularly (a) conducted provincial visits to
       review project progress, discuss measures to promptly resolve difficulties, and
       write to urge the participating provincial People's Committee to support and
       facilitate sub-project progress; (b) collaborated actively in the evaluation,
       approval and implementation of the project; (c) provided timely remedial actions
       to revise objectives, scope of work and duration of contracts; (c) facilitated the
       provision of information and necessary documentation to enable agreed activities
       to be performed; and (d) supported international and local consultants engaged
       under this component, provide its own staff to work in cooperation with the
       consultants.

    7. The Vietnam’s provincial authorities have given many supports to their
       respective subprojects. However, it normally took more time (longer than
       expected) for their review and approval of documents including agreements on
       selection of water sources, agreements on selection of project site, feasibility


                                          46
       studies, bid documents and bid evaluation reports, revised basic designs, road
       excavation permits, etc.

   8. In general, the CPU’s staff is qualified in their assigned tasks and managed to
      familiarize themselves with WB guidelines. However, CPU had major
      difficulties in overall management of project implementation. An international
      consultant was to be hired to assist CPU in preparation of Phase 2 of Component
      1 and support to the oversight of activities that focus on the quality of
      construction. However, there was two-year delay in hiring the consultant and
      when the consultant was finally hired, it performed poorly during
      implementation. Thus, subproject preparation was delayed and the feasibility
      studies were not in good quality, which affected project implementation.
      Moreover, fraudulent practices before and during contract award notified by the
      World Bank led to Contract termination in July 2010.

   9. The project had complex implementation arrangements- a decentralized
      approach with multiple components, different implementation arrangements for
      each component and varying staff. The PPMUs had limited staffing capacity and
      competence. Some PPMU staff did not have sufficient manpower and had
      limited competence particularly in term of foreign language capability. This had
      an adverse impact on project implementation.

   10. Overall the performance of the Borrower and the Implementing Agencies is
       considered as Unsatisfactory.

Lessons Learned

   11. The project was designed as a complex development program including a
       number of components with different objectives and different
       implementation arrangements. Investments include new construction and
       renovation and expansion of water supply systems, un-accounted-for water
       reduction, capacity building and operating management. The project was
       implemented under a credit scheme, with an amortization plan. As investors, the
       participating water supply companies borrow and repay the credit proceeds. The
       Provincial People's Committee is the executing agency of the project provinces,
       responsible for implementing the project. The Ministry of Construction, through
       the CPU, is the coordinating agency responsible for monitoring and coordinating
       the implementation of project activities, a point of contact to assist the
       Government and the Bank and the participating provinces, coordination
       relationships between the employers, local and foreign consultants.

   12. The project encountered many problems and difficulties in terms of progress and
       disbursement delays with works items having to undergo re-bidding. During the
       initial implementation period, World Bank’s comments on the project concern
       slow physical progress and disbursement. The Ministry of Construction as the
       project coordinator worked closely with the World Bank, the relevant agencies

                                         47
   and the participating provincial People's Committees to identify problems in each
   sub-project, specify responsibilities, propose corrective measures to ensure
   accelerate the works progress. So far, at the end of the project, the project has
   essentially met the objectives set out in the PAD.

13. The Project financial management arrangement, as well as the Project
    implementation arrangement, are complicated and risky by design. The
    Project has been implemented in a decentralization approach. The components
    A, B and C include various Sub-projects and each sub-project is implemented by
    one participating province through PPMUs. However, the PPMUs’ capacities
    and experiences are lacking. Therefore it is difficult for them to meet the
    requirement that the procurement and management of consulting services and
    Design-build contracts shall be implemented under the Bank guidelines and
    procedures of the Bank. In future projects, the design project implementation
    arrangements, financial management and fund flow management should be
    simple, to enable fast disbursement, reduce pressure and risks.

14. The Financing Agreement did not specify roles and responsibilities of the
    stakeholders in implementing the project, which leads to problems
    reviewing conflicts of interest in procurement activities, thus causing delays
    of the bidding process. WB has revised the Financing Agreement on a timely
    basis to resolve this issue: Revision of project implementation arrangements to
    reflect current obligations of MoC.

15. Loan projects funded by multilateral development banks most often undergo
    multiple phases of development. However, the fact that the changes from the
    original engineering studies take place in the project areas led to time-consuming
    revision(s) and re-approvals of feasibility study reports.

16. The application of new approaches such as procurement for works operations,
    performance-based contracts, credit to invest in water supply systems on
    commercial terms (through a revolving fund for water supply development
    managed by VDB), etc. the proposed mode of procurement, contract type and
    commercial terms applied as a pilot in Vietnam caused delays and seemed not be
    fully appropriate in the Vietnamese water supply context. In particular, the idea
    of competitive selection of contractors to operate and maintain the newly
    developed water supply system in Component A sub-projects could not be
    implemented. The application of new approaches should be carefully evaluated
    in order to ensure that they are suitable to the local conditions.

17. One of the major problems of the Project is the quality of feasibility studies. For
    some Sub-projects (such as in Ha Tay Sub-project, Lam Dong Sub-project), the
    social surveys as well as technical site surveys were inadequate and led to
    unsuitable proposals. The FSs should be carefully appraised with the
    involvement of qualified local engineers.
