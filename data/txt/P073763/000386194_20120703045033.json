Project\n            implementation has improved during the last twelve months.\n            All contracts have been awarded with physical progress of\n            all works combined reaching 70 percent as of May 30, 2012\n            with an overall International Development Association (IDA)\n            disbursement rate of more than 55 percent. It is expected\n            that by June 30, 2012 the project will be substantially\n            completed, with eighty seven percent (87 percent) of the IDA\n            funds (US$ 98.0 million) committed and an expected\n            cancellation of the uncommitted IDA funds (US$ 14.6\n            million). The project currently has an overall rating of\n            moderately satisfactory. Notwithstanding recent improvement,\n            the project has met with implementation difficulties during\n            the previous seven years which have led to the project\n            restructuring. The changes are: (i) partial cancellation of\n            the credit amount; (ii) first time extension of the credit\n            closing date for selected provinces and project components\n            to June 30, 2013; (iii) a reduction in the number of\n            provinces anticipated to participate in component A; (iv) a\n            change in the design/build/operate contracting process in\n            component A to design/build only with operations assumed by\n            the water utilities directly; (v) inclusion of an additional\n            province in component B; (vi) a name change of the\n            implementing institution for component C; (vii) a revision\n            of first schedule, withdrawal of the proceeds of the credit\n            to reflect the actual costs and disbursements; (viii) a\n            revision of second schedule, description of the project, to\n            specify the name of project participating provinces and of\n            the content of component D; and (ix) a revision of key\n            performance indicators of the project to reflect the changes\n            in components A and B. The rationale for the changes is\n            articulated in this project paper."}, "docdt": "2012-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
