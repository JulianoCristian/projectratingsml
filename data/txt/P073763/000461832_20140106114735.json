Urban Water Supply Development\n            Project for Vietnam had a moderately unsatisfactory outcome,\n            with the performances of both the Bank and the borrower\n            deemed moderately unsatisfactory as well. While some of the\n            project development objective indicators and intermediate\n            outcome indicators were achieved fully, five were partially\n            achieved, while two were not achieved. There were no\n            baselines and targets for many of the project outcome and\n            output indicators, and so limitations were faced in terms of\n            capturing project performance with respect to the original\n            intent. The original project scope was significantly reduced\n            relative to project design, with this restructuring\n            happening at a late stage. Significant lessons learned\n            during the implementation of the project were: 1)\n            performance based contract could be a good model for\n            improving operational efficiency of a water supply utility;\n            2) project design should be simple and realistic; 3) a\n            modest start and testing innovations before scaling up are\n            preferable; 4) a thorough assessment of institutional\n            readiness of implementing agencies is necessary; 5)\n            effective techniques to handle risks should be implemented;\n            6) properly designed and functional monitoring and\n            evaluation should be ensured; and 7) a follow through on\n            good practices or innovations initiated by the project\n            should be ensured."}, "docdt": "2013-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
