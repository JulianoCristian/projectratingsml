Among the lessons suggested by the\n            project experience are the following: 1) Careful poverty\n            targeting and sensitive project design can lead to major\n            poverty reduction impacts even under difficult post-disaster\n            circumstances. 2) Relocation of villages that consists\n            mostly of one and two story buildings during post-earthquake\n            reconstruction is usually a mistake in the long-term. 3)\n            Simplicity of message is essential to the adoption of\n            disaster-resistant technologies. 4) Grievance procedures\n            need to be in place from the outset. 5) Damage Assessments\n            need criteria that are carefully tailored to each widely\n            used construction type, and that lead to damage awards\n            closely tied to the actual cost of what needs to be done. 6)\n            Owner-driven construction was more effective in providing\n            culturally and environmentally appropriate housing given the\n            limited range o f options contractors were able to provide\n            for the same cost."}, "docdt": "2005-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
