project sustainability rated as likely.\n            Both World Bank and Borrower performances were assessed as\n            satisfactory to highly satisfactory. These are some of the\n            key lessons learned: Bank assistance for emergency recovery\n            and restoration projects should include long-term hazard\n            mitigation planning and loss reduction measures as the\n            primary development objective. While circumstances may call\n            for some grant assistance for rehabilitation in the\n            aftermath of natural disasters, the amount of grant should\n            be limited so that beneficiaries contribute their own\n            savings and time for rehabilitation, thereby reducing\n            dependence on the state. Damage assessment criteria should\n            be apt for local conditions, include fewer categories, be\n            technically specific, widely publicized, and pared to fewer\n            interpretations. Potential beneficiaries must have\n            \"ownership\" of the project. Partnerships should be\n            fostered with government, beneficiaries, community-based\n            women's organizations and non-governmental\n            organizations to ensure sustainable development. There is a\n            need to address the capacity of local governments and its\n            impact on sustainability as well as to take a long-term\n            approach to maintenance and maintenance funding. Project\n            design for emergency projects should allow for a longer\n            project period than the typical three years for developing\n            and implementing disaster management systems."}, "docdt": "1999-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
