The main purpose of the project is to\n            break the cycle of natural resource degradation and poverty\n            by providing support for improved natural resource\n            management approaches and practices, coupled with\n            agricultural development.  The project is designed to assist\n            the population in making the best use of the limited natural\n            resources available.  The project consists of four\n            components.  The first component is natural resource\n            management which aims to conserve the water, land and\n            vegetation in the area. This component focuses on the\n            effective utilization of surface water flow, through\n            watershed management on about 6000 feddans (2520 ha) and\n            water harvesting, and on the management and sustainable use\n            of land and vegetative cover by the local population and\n            their small livestock.  A second component is adaptive\n            research and extension which focuses on dryland farming and\n            livestock production systems, range management, sustainable\n            agricultural development and training directed to local\n            communities.  A third component is rural finance which gives\n            special attention to the promotion of on-farm and off-farm\n            income-generating activities targeted to small farmers, the\n            landless and rural women. Lastly, a project coordination\n            unit component, aims at strenghtening community\n            participation and the dialogue with existing local institutions."}, "docdt": "1993-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
