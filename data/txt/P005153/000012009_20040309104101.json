development\n            impacts, likely sustainability, and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower. However, there\n            are some concerns about the on-going privatization of\n            Bedouin rangelands, which has the potential to be both\n            inequitable, and a constraint to sustainable range\n            management in a highly spatially, and temporally variable,\n            low rainfall environment. The experience of this project\n            confirms several familiar lessons: Participatory approaches\n            require an initial phase-in period of skills development,\n            and community interaction, even more so if involving women\n            in a highly traditional society. While independent project\n            units aim at immediate implementation benefits in a\n            slow-moving bureaucracy, even bearing the burden of\n            subsequent costs in terms of sustainability (though possibly\n            justified initially in a pilot demonstration), such a pilot\n            however, still leaves the longer-term institutional\n            questions unanswered, with institutional sustainability\n            remaining at the heart of the development process.\n            Notwithstanding, addressing shorter-term welfare, and\n            poverty is an important precondition, ultimately, for\n            addressing longer-term natural resource sustainability.\n            Finally, despite the potential of participatory development\n            processes at village levels to improve public services, yet,\n            coordination difficulties between programs, often limit such\n            processes to only one program, which is neither effective,\n            nor efficient."}, "docdt": "2004-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
