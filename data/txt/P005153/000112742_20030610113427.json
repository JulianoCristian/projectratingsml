{"cdata!": "The Matruh Resource Management Project\n            (MRMP) for Egypt had a satisfactory outcome, with likely\n            sustainability, substantial institutional development\n            impact, and satisfactory performances by both the Bank and\n            Borrower.  Lessons were learned in the areas of overall\n            design and participatory approaches and technical or\n            institutional items.  A multi-sectoral/multi-disciplinary\n            approach in natural resource management and poverty\n            alleviation projects is more likely to achieve objectives\n            and should be a first step towards decentralization and\n            local level institutional integration.  Participatory\n            project implementation requires flexible budgeting\n            unconstrained by predetermined outputs, relying on\n            demand-driven identification of activities, to be fully\n            responsive to beneficiary demands, coupled with a change in\n            monitoring and evaluation.  Adequate initial training and\n            capacity building is a prerequisite to activities requiring\n            beneficiary participation.  Rural credit programs require\n            mechanisms that adapt to constraints of both the financial\n            institutions and the beneficiaries and identify a process to\n            bring the two parties into a situation of mutual trust.  The\n            failure to address problems of collateral, religious views\n            to interest rate payment and need for credit delivery at\n            lowest levels will likely lead to failure and eventual\n            component cancellation.  Targeting the poorest segments of\n            the society can be a challenging process where communities\n            have strong traditional structures, and requires time, clear\n            monitoring mechanisms. and strong engagement with the tribal\n            organization.  Accurate unit cost estimation of\n            infrastructure sub-projects is a prerequisite to\n            implementation.  Community rangeland management may have a\n            higher chance of long-term sustainability through ownership,\n            although requiring greater initial time investment.  The\n            project control unit as an add-on and temporary structure\n            for service provision should be critically evaluated when\n            embarking on new development initiatives.  Many of the\n            lessons learned have been incorporated into the second MRMP."}, "docdt": "2003-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
