          promote the development of an integrated, efficient, and\n            sustainable transport system for the movement of people\n            (especially the poorer sections of society) and goods in\n            Wuhan. The project has the following six components.\n            Component 1) Addresses the immediate need to improve the\n            road network operations within the city, and to expand the\n            bicycle and pedestrian networks. The five programs, within\n            the component, are designed to: provide suitable routes for\n            through or cross-town traffic; improve utilization of\n            existing cross-river bridges; relieve congestion in central\n            down-town areas; provide adequate road networks in\n            development areas; provide safe conditions for pedestrians.\n            Component 2) Aims to build upon the strengths of the\n            existing transport network management to better utilize\n            existing assets and resources. The detailed content\n            includes: pedestrian and bicycle measures, bus priority\n            measures, channelization of junctions, provision of traffic\n            signals at junctions and an urban area traffic control (ATC)\n            system, a road safety and accident analysis program, a road\n            user education program, road marking equipment. Component 3)\n            Will to facilitate an increase in the efficiency and\n            effectiveness of bus services in the city. A key element of\n            the effort related to public transport is support for the\n            ongoing reform of public transport operations. Component 4)\n            Aims to: assist the government's intent to reform and\n            improve the current road maintenance management through\n            training and study for Road Maintenance Management\n            Information System (RMMIS) improve the current road\n            maintenance facilities by purchasing advanced road\n            maintenance equipment reconstruct the most damaged road\n            sections in Wuhan. Component 5) Aims to mitigate the adverse\n            impacts of road construction, minimize vehicle emission, and\n            increase the positive environmental impacts of the project.\n            The detailed content includes: constructing noise barriers\n            and other facilities to mitigate noise from the new roads\n            planting along new roads expanding the vehicle emission and\n            traffic noise monitoring system facilitating implementation\n            of a motor vehicle emission control strategy upgrading the\n            vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) system. Component\n            6) Will strengthen the technical and management skills of\n            the municipal staff, and includes: domestic and\n            international training for officials from project\n            implementing agencies, funding for consultant studies on\n            issues and topics related to the other five components of\n            the project, office equipment to enhance the productivity of\n            the implementing agencies."}, "docdt": "2004-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
