      By virtue of Overall Planning of Wuhan City (2006-2020), Middle Ring of

Wuhan (also known as Three Ring Road) is a rapid traffic ring line in the principal

structure of "Three-ring and Thirteen-radial" road network under planning. It, planned

at the boundary of main urban area and passing through three towns of Wuhan, links

with large-scale industrial groups, economic development zones, high-tech

technology development zones and new dwelling areas around the urban area and is

the key distributing channel for passenger and goods transport along the line as well

as for part of outbound and inbound traffic. The successful construction of the Middle

Ring of Wuhan will dissolve the problem of inconvenient long-distance cross-district

traffic in Wuhan, decrease the effect of through-traffic flow from other cities on urban

traffic, and initially form the rapid traffic network system of main urban area.

      In the design project, the whole Middle Ring including the road in this project is

an urban rapid-traffic road with the design driving speed of 80 km/h and six

bi-directional driveways. The whole line is completely closed, and agricultural

vehicles, non-motor vehicles and walkers are forbidden to enter. The boundary line of

the road is 50m wide, and the section layout is 2.0m (central reserve for planting)

+2*0.5m (side strip) +2*11.25m (road way) +2*2.5m (hardened verge) + 2*0.75m

(earth shoulder) + 2*9m (side slope, side ditch and isolated zone for planting). The

width of cross-trench river-bridge-type bridge with standard cross section is 27.5m

(30.5m for partial section).

1.2 Significance of Project Construction


     The total length of the Middle Ring in Wuhan is 90.lkm, and west and south

sections with traffic mileage of 36.23km have been built by now. Therein,

Etouwan-Sanjintan Section of the North Middle Ring, a sub-project of the World

Bank financed Wuhan Urban Transport Project, is in process of construction and

predicted to be open to traffic in 2007. As for east section, Ping'anpu-Baima Overpass

section of 10.5km long and the section of 7.8km long from old Wuhuang Highway to

Guanshan Second Road are also under construction and predicted to be open in 2007,

and the planning and design of the section of 10.5km long from Baima Overpass to

Old Wuhuang Highway has been completed. Therefore, this project, i.e. North Middle

Ring (Sanjintan-Ping'anpu) of 8.24km long is the last section of the Middle Ring,

which connects to Sanjintan Overpass to the west and Ping'anpu Overpass to the east

and links with Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge at Ping'anpu to meet east section.

     The planning and implementation of Sanjintan-Ping'anpu Section of the North

Middle Ring is a predominant project for realizing full-line penetration of the Middle

Ring. Its construction will ultimately form a complete and unobstructed middle ring

line for rapid traffic in Wuhan, help to distribute through-traffic flow and remit traffic

pressure of central urban area. Besides, it will contribute to upgrading urban functions

and enhancing the status of Wuhan as the logistics center.


1.3 Regional Impact of the Project


     In the design program, the whole line of Sanjintan-Ping'anpu Section with the

total length of 8.24km passes through two districts, three streets and six villages in

Wuhan. See Table 1-1 for affected administrative units.

     According to the results of socioeconomic survey, as for this project,

collectively-owned land of 878.45mu of six villages is to be occupied, private houses

with building area of 70612.43m2 of 294 households with 1268 members to be

relocated, and 5 enterprises and institutions with building area of 3817.62m2 to be

relocated.

      Between two districts affected by the project, Jiang'an District is the main urban

area and Huangpi is the suburban area of Wuhan. However, the streets and villages

affected all are located at the junction of urban area and suburb, which was a lake

district with severe flooding damage in the past. Through the regulation and control

for many years, the hidden danger of flooding damage has been eliminated basically

and the villagers have a relatively large area of cultivated land. Some of affected

persons engage in agricultural production and business, i.e. vegetable planting and

sales relying on urban demands of Wuhan. However, due to special geographic

location of these villages, they may accept more market radiation of the city and hold

more opportunities for nonagricultural activities. Seen from the data acquired through

the survey, main income sources of these villages are nonagricultural activities relying

on the opportunities brought by urban radiation of Wuhan, such as building,

commerce, transport service, and so on. The socioeconomic survey on six villages

along the line shows that, in general, a few incomes of these peasant families are from

agricultural production and business (vegetable planting and sales), and the most are

from nonagricultural activities. Taking Sanjintan Village as an example, gross output

value of the whole village is 59,300 thousand yuan, among which, 4500 thousand

yuan is from agricultural production and accounts for 7.6%. The situation of other

five villages is similar to this. That is to say, land acquisition and relocation of this

project has a little effect on major income sources of these villages. On the contrary,

market and labor demands brought by engineering construction and convenient traffic,

market information and physical distribution caused by project construction will bring

more development opportunities to these villages.

1.4 Measures for Decreasing Land Acquisition and Relocation


      As same as other sub-projects of Wuhan Transport Project, during the process of

planning and design of Sanjintan-Ping'anpu Section of the North Middle Ring, the

Project Office and design department keep close contact with engineering,

environment, resettlement and other related departments for communication and

coordination, so as to optimize engineering design program as much as possible and

control resettlement workload to the minimum while meeting the requirements of

engineering techniques and environmental protection.

     Under the premise of meeting the standards of engineering techniques and the

requirements of environmental protection, the principles that should be followed

while determining line position and direction are specified as follows:

      (1) Keep away from densely inhabited districts and enterprises and institutions

with a large relocation amount, such as school, hospital, industrial and mining area,

large-scale enterprise, and so on.

     (2) Keep away from key organizations of cultural landscape and cultural relics

protection.

     (3) Occupy cultivated land as little as possible, and make full use of

unproductive non-cultivated land, such as barren land and barren waste along the line.

     (4) Keep away from important infrastructures like large-scale waster

conservancy and power facilities.

      (5) Reduce the crossing between the line and railway, arterial road of the city or

key pipeline.

     In the process of project design, the program should be optimized continually

according to the abovementioned principles, so as to reduce resettlement workload as

much as possible. For example, in the initial design project, the line has to pass across

Daishan Village in Houhu Township in the middle, which greatly affects this village.

In March 2007, after listening to the opinions and suggestions of the villagers from

Daishan Village, the Resettlement Office presented villagers' opinions to the design

department in time, and the design program was modified after field survey. Finally, a

new program to make the line pass by the village was worked out, which greatly

reduces relocation amount. Compared with the original line position, in the new line

position, the number of households affected by relocation is reduced by 106, the area

of private houses to be relocated is reduced by 4566m2,the number of enterprises and

institutions to be relocated is reduced by 3, and the area of related buildings to be

relocated is reduced by 1618.58m2.In total, the area of the buildings to be relocated is

reduced by 6184.61m2.

1.5 Socioeconomic Survey


      To hold the details of the impact of land acquisition and relocation of this project

and work out an applicable and feasible Resettlement Action Plan, the World Bank

Financed Project Office carried out socioeconomic survey on this project in March

2007. The members of survey group all are the personnel of Resettlement Office of

the World Bank financed Wuhan Urban Transport Project, who had participated in

previous socioeconomic surveys on the sub-projects that had been completed or were

under construction and were familiar with the policies of the World Bank on

involuntary resettlement and China's rules and regulations on land acquisition and

relocation. Center for Involuntary Resettlement Research, Wuhan University, i.e.

Resettlement Independent Monitoring Organization of the World Bank financed

Wuhan Urban Transport Project sent out supervision personnel for the whole-process

guidance and coordination.

      The contents of this survey are divided into two parts:

      Firstly, survey on social and economic backgrounds of affected villages and wills

of the villagers on resettlement. The data collected include:

      a. Basic situation of affected families within the scope of survey;

      b. Opinions and suggestions of affected persons on the resettlement;

      c. Basic situation of affected villages within the scope of survey, including

population, labor force, industrial structure, cultivated land, and others.

     Secondly, survey on affected substances. The data collected include:

     a. Positions, categories and areas of land occupied by the project construction;

     b. Positions, categories and quantities of buildings to be relocations and other

attachments to the ground.

     c. Categories and quantities of various professional facilities;

     d. Basic situation of affected enterprises and institutions and the impact of the

project on them.

     With reference to and making use of the methods used in the previous

socioeconomic surveys of other sub-projects, the survey group carried out all-round

and carehl survey and registration on all contents within the scope of project impact,

according to 1: 2000 Map provided by the design unit. Meanwhile, survey personnel

carried out door-to-door interview on affected persons, introduced present policies

and regulations on land acquisition and relocation in Wuhan and resettlement policies

and compensation rate of the World Bank financed Wuhan Urban Transport Project,

and held their wills on resettlement. All these lay the solid foundation for the

preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan.


1.6 Project Preparation and Implementation Scheduling


     Sanjintan-Ping'anpu Section of the North Middle Ring is a predominant link for

the penetration of the Middle Ring in Wuhan, and its planning and construction has

been brought into the overall planning of the World Bank financed Wuhan Urban

Transport Project. The employer of the project is Wuhan Urban Construction

Investment (Group) Co., Ltd., Management Office of the World Bank financed

Wuhan Urban Construction Project with foreign investment set under which takes

charge of construction and management of this project, Resettlement Office set under

which takes special charge of land acquisition and relocation of this project.

According the plan of Project Management Office, project preparation and

implementation scheduling of the project are as shown in Table 1-2.

           Table 1-4 Project preparationand implementationscheduling

1.7 Relevant Laws on CompensationRate


     Sanjintan-Ping'anpu Section of the Middle Ring is a component of the World

Bank financed Wuhan Urban Transport Project, and its resettlement policies and

standards should be in line with parallel policies and standards of the whole project.

In 2004, Resettlement Action Plan of Wuhan Urban TransportProject prepared on the

basis of relevant laws and regulations of the PRC, Hubei Province and Wuhan City

was authenticated and approved, relevant policies and compensation rate on land

acquisition and relocation in which will be applicable to this project. Since the

approval on Resettlement Action Plan of Wuhan Urban Transport Project,

compensation rate for houses and land is increased slightly, and then the new

standards and policies will be implemented.

2.3 Impact of Land Acquisition


      According to the socioeconomic survey, the area of the land to be occupied by

the construction of Sanjiantan-Ping'anpu Section of the Middle Ring is 878.45mu,

among which, 350mu is vegetable land, 224mu is used for construction, and 303mu is

water surface and other kinds of land.

      As mentioned in Chapter 1, socioeconomic development of these six villages

mainly relies on nonagricultural production and business, and compared with other

rural areas, these villages have relatively rich cultivated land (except Ping'anpu

Village, cultivated land per capita is over Imu). After land acquisition, the reduction

of cultivated land per capita is quite little. Even in Xinjian Village with the highest

rate of land acquisition impact, cultivated land per capita after land acquisition is still

1.33mu. Therefore, it is thought that land acquisition of this project doesn't have

significant impact on agricultural production and business of these six villages.

Village. In Xinjian Village and Ping'anpu Village, only land acquisition is involved.

According to survey statistics, in the abovementioned four villages, private houses of

294 households and with total building area of 70612.43m2are to be relocated, among

which, the area of the buildings of brick and concrete structure is 69707m2,brick and

     Seen from the actual situation, except that Daishan Inspection Station of Wuhan

Bureau of Public Security is affected severely and needs to be relocated completely,

the impact on other enterprises and institutions is small.

     1. Houhu Pump Station

     The line passes by Houhu Pump Station and one small storehouse and part of

work shed of the Station have to be relocated, as shown in Picture 2-1. Here, the area

of buildings of brick and concrete structure is 830m2,and brick and wood structure

and simple structure 1280.42m2.

     Houhu Pump Station is the largest-scale pump station in Wuhan, and its main

workshop and facilities are lOOm away from the red line of this project. The

relocation of this small storehouse and attached work shed has no impact on the

normal operation of the Station.

     2. Old house of Villagers' Committee of Daishan Village

     In Daishan Village, the old house of Villagers' Committee also has to be

relocated, which is a red-tile one-story building as shown in Picture 2-2. This building

is of brick and wood structure and has the building area of 401m2. It was used by

Villagers' Committee of Daishan Village in the past and now is leased for being used

as the storehouse after being left unused for some time. The relocation of this building

doesn't involve work loss of any person.

     3. Daishan Paper Mill

     Daishan Paper Mill affected by the project is a small-sized village-run

                                            14

papermaking enterprise with 8 staff members. The building to be removed is 540m2

and is used as the storehouse by the enterprise. The field survey shows that this

factory was founded through leasing collectively-ownedbuildings of Daishan Village,

and still has a large area of available buildings in the part not affected by the

relocation. Therefore, the removal of the building of 540m2 has no impact on the

production and business of the factory.




                  Picture 2-3 Affected storehouse of Daishan Paper Mill



     4. Daishan Inspection Station of Wuhan Bureau of Public Security

     The project has the largest impact on Daishan Inspection Station of Wuhan

Bureau of Public Bureau with 21 employees in charge of checking come-and-go

vehicles. As shown in Picture 2-4, the Station is a row of two-story building of brick

and concrete structure with building area of 567m2,and it also has an attached house

of brick and wood structure with building area of 96m2.The Station is an institution,

and now Wuhan Bureau of Public Security has planned to build a new inspection

station across the highway from the original site. The relocation and newly-building

of the Stationhas no impact on its personnel.

     5. Storehouse of Daishan Aquatic Product Supply & Sales Company

     Daishan Aquatic Product Supply & Sales Company, belonging to Daishan

Village, has already closed down, and the workshop is leased for being used as the

storehouse and is under the care of the Villagers' Committee of Daishan Village.

The building is of brick and wood structure and has the building area of 102m2.It is

left unused and leased for being used as the storehouse and doesn't involve anybody's

work post, as same as the old house of Villagers' Committee of Daishan Village,

 2.6 Various Attachments and Professional Facilities to be

 Relocated


      According to the field survey, attachments to the house, attachments to the

 ground and professional facilities to be relocated along the line mainly include

 telephone, air conditioner, network, electricity meter, water meter, enclosing wall, tree,

 water supply pipeline, CATV, wire and etc. See Table 2-6 for the data of various

much as the annual production value of the land;

      @For fish ponds with intensive culture and garden plots, the compensation

should be 8 times as much as the annual production value; for common fish ponds, 6

times; large-area water surfaces, 5 times.

      @For forest land and grassland, the compensation should be 6 times the amount

of the annual production value.

      @For house sites, the compensation should be 5 times the amount of the annual

production value of adjacent land; for house sites elsewhere established, the

compensation should be implemented according to corresponding compensation rates.

      @For requisitioned irrigation ponds, water channels and roads, if they are to be

built elsewhere, the compensation should be paid according to the compensation rate

for the land for reconstruction; if not, the compensation should be 6 times as much as

the annual production value of adjacent land.

calculated in terms of the number of agricultural population to be resettled. The

subsidy for each such agricultural person should be 5 times as much as the mean

annual production value of the three years prior to land acquisition.

      T h e maximum resettlement subsidy per mu of the requisitioned cultivated land

should not exceed 15 times the amount of the mean annual production value of the

previous three years.

      .No  subsidy will be paid for house sites and unproductive land.

      .The   land areas of units of appropriated land, agricultural population and

number of agricultural labor force, cultivated land area, and annual production value

should be defined according to the data provided by the urban statistical management

department.

      I f the original standard of living of peasants to be resettled cannot be remained

after the compensation for land and resettlement subsidies are paid, the resettlement

subsidy may be increased upon the approval of the provincial government. But the

total amount of land compensation and resettlement subsidy should not exceed 30

times the amount of the average production value of the three years prior to land

acquisition.

      .The   land management department should organize the unit using land and

units of appropriated land to provide employment for surplus labor force by

developing agricultural sideline production and township enterprises. Or qualified

labor force could be arranged to work in collective-owned or state-owned units and

the corresponding resettlement subsidies should be paid to these units.

        Upon the approval of provincial and city governments, the agricultural

residence could be converted to non-agricultural residence in case that the land is

completely requisitioned. The original collective property and land compensation and

                                           21

should be used by the units of appropriated land for developing production or

business, arranging employment for surplus labor force, and providing subsistence

allowances for people not involved in employment, and shall not be misappropriated

by any units or individuals. The compensation for individual attachments and young

service life plus one year.

     .For    temporary acquisition of other productive land, the compensation should

be paid by multiplying 50% of the average annual production value of the previous

three years of adjacent cultivated land by the service life.

     mother losses caused by temporary land acquisition should be compensated

according to the actual value of losses.


3.2.4 Compensationpolicies for young crops & fish and attachments on the land

5. Resettlement and Recovery Plan


5.1 Objective, Mode and Principle of Resettlement and Recovery


5.1.1 Objective

     According to operational policies of the World Bank on involuntary resettlement

and requirements of relevant national laws and regulations, general objective of the

World Bank Financed Wuhan Urban Transport Project is to recover and try to improve

life and production of affected persons and enterprises and institutions as soon as

possible. The concrete objectives are as follows:

     @Affected relocated families shall be compensated according to replacement

cost, and areas, structures and living environment of their reconstructed buildings

shall reach the level before relocation and also be improved;

     @Various affected attachments to the ground shall be compensated according to

replacement cost;

     @Labors whose lands are acquired shall be resettled well, and their incomings

   shall be guaranteed and improved by improving working condition, and no peasant

   will losejob permanently due to land acquisition;

     @Public buildings and professional facilities shall be compensated according to

     replacement price, and recovered as per original standard;

     @The production scale, production capacity and staff's employment shall not be

   affected after enterprise is reestablished. No affected labor will lose job

   permanently even if his working unit is affected.

      @Public facilities and environment of affected communities shall recover to the

level before relocation and also be improved.

     As a sub-project of the World Bank Financed Wuhan Urban Transport Project,

Sanjintan-Ping'anpu Section of the Middle Ring takes abovementioned objectives as

its own resettlement objectives naturally.

5.1.2 Mode


     Resettlement and recovery of affected persons will be carried out from life and

production at the same time.

    As for life, it is mainly relocating and rebuilding the houses and recovering

supporting facilities of life, which mainly includes:

     H o u s e s of affected families.

     .Residents'    facilities of water supply, power supply, road and etc.

As for production, it is mainly labors' employment arrangement and rebuilding or

  recovery of production facilities, including:

     Resettlement of affected peasants.

     .Recovery     of enterprises' production facilities. Because enterprises' production

  facilities are compensated according to replacement price, production scale and

  capacity will not reduce due to the project, and former staff can be employed again

  after the enterprises are rebuilt.

     The resettlement and recovery will be carried out mainly through compensation of

  funds, resettlement of labors and recovery of production and living conditions.


5.1.3 Principle

     Affected persons will take part in the whole process of resettlement.

     As for compensation rates of houses and facilities, selection of resettlement

places, arrangement of relocation and recovery time, allocation of funds, resettlement

measures of labors, and etc, there must be affected persons or representatives to

participate and reach an agreement through negotiation. Negotiation with affected

persons will be carried out through representatives' symposia and villagers'

conference.

     .Various    compensation funds will be allocated to the owner completely, and no

enterprise or person can use the compensation fund on behalf of others.

     .Houses,    professional facilities and attachments will be compensated according

  to replacement price. Quantity to be compensated cannot be detained and

  depreciated, and bear tax, and compensation h d s that owners obtain must be

  calculated according to open compensation rates. All possessions of original

  buildings belong to original owner, and no enterprise or person has the right to

   dominate and dispose. As for calculation of compensation rates, salvage value of

   materials of relocated part cannot be deducted, and depreciation of original

   possessions cannot be deducted, either.

     L a n d s are reasonably utilized.

     Because lots of buildings are affected by the project, lands for reconstruction

shall be planned well and shall be reasonably utilized based on negotiation with

affected persons.

     Vulnerable group shall be assisted and attended.


5.2 Resettlement of Relocated Families


    294 families' houses in existence were relocated in total at mid-ring road

Sanjintan-Ping'anpu, which located at Sanjintan Village and Daishan Village of

Houhu Street and Nanhu Village and Shuangqiao Village of Shekou Street. And most

of the relocated families located at Daishan Village and Nanhu Village, and 117

families and 149 families were from these two villages respectively. 26 families were

from Shuangqiao Village, and only 2 were from Sanjintan Village.

    During the socioeconomic survey, staff of resettlement office asked affected

persons for advice on recovery of relocated houses and studied corresponding method

of building reconstruction with the villagers committee cadres together. At last,

following reconstruction methods were concluded:

    Saniintan Village:

    Only 2 families were affected. According to their opinion, the resettlement ofice

would grant compensationfunds to them in cash directly,and they would buy new houses

at Houhu communitynearby themselves.

    Nanhu Village:

    149 relocated families located in this village, so there were many reconstructed

buildings. Meanwhile, influenced by construction of the railway Wuhan-Hefei, 20

families had already been relocated. According to villagers' congress, the village would

reconstruct centralizedlybased on method agreed by villagers. At present, the location is

confirmed, and relocated families influenced by railway Wuhan-Hefei start to build new

houses. Reconstructionof relocated families of this project will be carried out according

to method of that project.

     Under centralized reconstruction method, each affected family will obtain

compensation funds of their houses based on replacement price, and compensation

funds of various attachments. However, location compensation price of house sites

will be dominated by village's collective unitedly, and village's collective will allocate

new house sites for free for building new houses.

     Shuanaaiao Village:

     26 relocated families located in this village. The village has two resettlement

modes for them to choose according to opinion of relocated families and actual way

that is adopted by the village currently:

  If relocated families require village's          collective to arrange centralized

reconstruction site, then affected families will obtain compensation funds of their

houses based on replacement price, and compensation funds of various attachments.

However, location compensation price of house sites will be under the control of

village's collective unitedly, and village's collective will allocate new house sites for

free for building new houses.

  If relocated families buy house sites themselves or they don't need new houses,

then compensation funds of relocated houses and location price will be granted to

them directly, and they will dispose reconstruction of their houses themselves.

    Daishan Village:

   117 relocated families located in the village. According to information of

investigation at present, about 100 families will choose the way that village's

collective unitedly arranges house sites to reconstruct houses. These families will

obtain compensation funds of their houses based on replacement price, and

compensation funds of various attachments in cash. However, location compensation

price of house sites will be dominated by village's collective unitedly, and village's

collective will allocate new house sites for free for building new houses. The other 17

relocated families will not reconstruct new houses because they have another house to

live, and resettlement office will grant compensation funds of relocated houses and

location price to them directly.

5.3 Resettlement and Recovery of Affected Enterprises and

Institutions


     5 buildings of enterprises and institutions are affected in this project, and they

will be compensated in cash (including compensation of houses and operating loss),

meanwhile, shops can be reconstructed and operated before relocation or after

construction. After this project is finished, transport in this area will be greatly

improved, so the supply and sales company and other enterprises will be greatly

benefited and their state of operation will be much better.

5.4 Resettlement of PeasantsAffected by Land Acquisition


     It has been explained in the chapter of project impact analyses that economy of 6

affected villages in this project mainly depends on nonagricultural production and

operation, and compared with other rural areas, cultivated areas in these 6 villages are

relatively ample, cultivated area per capita is more than lmu except Ping'anpu village.

Cultivated area per capita reduces little after land acquisition. It is still up to 1.33mu

after land acquisition even in Xinjian village which is most affected by land

acquisition. Therefore, agricultural production and operation in 6 villages are not

much affected by land acquisition of this project.

     During the socioeconomic survey, the resettlement office have communicated

with affected persons along the line, asked them for resettlement will and knew usage

of compensation funds after land acquisition. The result of survey shows popular

resettlement method in these 6 villages (actually it is also a general way that most

suburbs of Wuhan adopt) is:

     Compensation funds of land acquisition are compensation for lands, resettlement

subsidies and compensation for young crops respectively.

     Resettlement subsidies and compensation for young crops are directly granted to

families losing lands;

     70% of compensation for lands is directly granted to families losing lands, and

30% that is under the control of village's collective will be applied to construction of

public welfare undertaking in the village.

     According to abovementioned method, village's collective will no longer adjust

lands for peasants who lose lands, and families who lose lands can adjust lands

themselves by negotiation with other peasants in the village on the basis of free will if

they want to get lands.


5.5 Resettlement and Recovery of Affected Vulnerable Group


     As for affected vulnerable group in the project, resettlement office will pay

special attention to them. By detailed investigation, there are 18 families of affected

vulnerable group in this project, and they are low-income families who enjoy the

municipal minimum income guarantee and some family members are disabled. See

basic situation in Table 8-2. Because these families are in rural area with big houses,

and there isn't any difficulty for them to use the compensation h d s to build new

houses, so the resettlement office resettles them well through providing service

actively and reduce or exempt relevant tax and etc, offers labors to help during

relocation, gives preference to them when allocating house sites for reconstruction of

houses, and tries to provide them with suitable market and workforce information

during implementation of the project.

Source: Data of socioeconomic survey of Sanjintan-Ping'anpu Project.



     Following conclusions can be obtained through analysis on statistical data in

Table 8-2.

     First, from data of investigation, affected persons know basic situation and

relocation compensation policy of the project. There have been many relocation

projects in Wuhan in recent years, and areas affected by this project also have been

affected by other projects, such as Mid-ring road Project, Wuhan-Hefei Railway

Project, Tianxingzhou Changjiang River Bridge and etc, so affected persons have

already knew something about construction of this project and also knew laws and

regulations and policies of relocation of Wuhan.

     Second, as for attitude of this project, most of affected persons agree to

implementation of this project, and about 90% agree or have no objection to

construction of this project. When talking of advantages and disadvantages of the

project, most of them think that the best advantage is convenient transport followed

by investment opportunity; the worst disadvantage is that the lands may be lessened,

and another disadvantage is influence of the construction on local environment.

Affected persons mainly put forward two suggestions: one is trying to consider

convenience and safety of residents along the line, and the other is reducing relocation

amount.

     Third, Resettlement will of relocation. Most of rural residents agree that village

committee organizes unified planning and reconstruction, which is in conformity with

resettlement policy of relocation of collectively-owned lands in suburb of Wuhan at

present. Some residents accept compensation in cash and buy houses themselves

because they don't only have one residential holding, and relocation of this project

doesn't affect their residence, accordingly, they will not plan to rebuild new houses

after relocation. As for these residents, the project resettlement office will grant

compensation h d s to them according to their will.

     Fourth, as for use and allocation of compensation for lands and labor

resettlement subsidies, the investigation objects are more apt to all compensation costs

allocated to affected families under their own control but not under the village's

control unitedly, and they don't hope lands redistribution. As for employment,

residents are more apt to finding job themselves, and they are not interested in the

nonagricultural employment opportunities.


8.2 Feedback of Public Participationand Consultation


     Since March 2007, the project office has organized the socioeconomic survey on

affected persons and generalized their opinions and suggestions and fed back to the

design unit, and fully taken these opinions and suggestions into consideration when

compiling the Resettlement Action Plan. Table 8- 3         shows feedback of public

participation and consultation until now.

1.Overview

     North Middle Ring (Sanjintan-Ping'anpu) of 8.24km long is the last section of

the Middle Ring, which connects to Sanjintan Overpass to the west and Ping'anpu

Overpass to the east and links with Tianxingzhou Yangtze River Bridge at Ping'anpu

to meet the east section. Middle ring is an urban highway, designed vehicle speed 80

km/h,6 lanes in two ways, exclusive to farm truck, non-motor vehicle and pedestrians.

The red line width of the road is 50 meters, and the project is expected to start in the

second half of the year 2007, open to traffic upon completion in 2008. The planning

and implementation of Sanjintan Ping'anpu Section of the North Middle Ring is the
                                  -


dominating engineering for achieving the completion of the Middle Ring. The

construction of this section will eventually form the complete and smooth middle ring

speed highway, conducive to diverging one-time-passing vehicles thus relieving the

transport pressure within the downtown, meanwhile, it also plays a positive role in

promoting the city's functions and raising the central status of Wuhan as a logistics

centre.

9. Grievance


     Resettlement is a complicated work. It is inevitable that the affected persons may

be dissatisfied at resettlement and compensation and have grievances during the

implementation, since land acquisition and resettlement relates to various aspects and

the vital interests of displaced persons. To ensure the grievances of affected persons

are handled successfully and rapidly, the resettlement office of the World Bank

Financed Wuhan Urban Transport Project will establish a transparent and viable

procedure to collect and handle grievances objectively and efficiently so as to ensure

the resettlement will be implemented successfully.


9.1 Means of collecting grievances


     (1) The report of local resettlement ofice, which includes grievances of the

masses, the progress of resettlement, working measures and existing problems

impacts of resettlement on construction to Wuhan Urban Construction Investment &

Development (Group) Co., Ltd. once a week.

     (8) Information on payment of land compensation shown on the fund transfer list

provided by the bank

     (9) Specific survey of internal monitoring organization


9.2 Grievance Procedure


     Stage 1

    The displaced persons air their grievances in oral and written form to the village

committee or street resettlement office. In case of oral grievance, the village

committee or street resettlement office must keep a written record and give a clear

reply within 2 weeks. If it is a big issue that shall be submitted to the superior

resettlement office, the village committee or street resettlement office shall try to get

the comments of the superior resettlement office within 2 weeks.

    Stage 2

    If the complainant is not satisfied with the reply given in the Stage 1, the

complainant may air hisher grievance to the district resettlement office within 1

the superior resettlement office timely and assist the latter in carrying out relevant

survey.

grievance within the specified period, the complainant has the right of appeal.

     During the resettlement, some special grievances of women may appear,

resettlement team to deal with women's grievances. The local governmental and

non-governmental organizations, such as the Bureau of Civil Affairs and the Women's

Association will supervise the resettlement to ensure the rights and interests of the

displaced persons, especially that of affected women.

be carried out, taking all the affected families involved in the socioeconomic survey at

the preparation phase of the project as the sample bank. The sampling proportion of

the families affected by land acquisition is preliminarily determined to be 10%, and

that of the families affected by relocation is 10%, and that of the families affected by

both land acquisition and relocation is 15%.

baseline survey, the independent monitoring personnel shall establish the database of

the samples of the survey, which will be the basis of the follow-up survey. As to the

objects that it is hard to survey again due to various reasons, they shall be replaced by

similar affected families in the same community after referring to the information

bank established upon the earlier socioeconomic survey.

     The contents of the follow-up survey shall be consistent with those of living

standard baseline survey, so as to cany out comparison analysis of the production and

living conditions of the affected families before and after the resettlement. Meanwhile,
