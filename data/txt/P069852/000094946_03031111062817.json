conduct a quantitative and\n            qualitative analysis of various environmental impacts from\n            the Wuhan Urban Transport Project by investigating and\n            monitoring physical-chemical, biological, and socio-economic\n            environments in the project area with broad public\n            participation. To mitigate the impact of road traffic noise\n            and vibrations, the plan suggests using asphalt-concrete and\n            bitumen as paving material in roads, particularly those\n            adjacent to vulnerable buildings. Daily road maintenance\n            will reduce added vibrations. After project operation,\n            vehicle emissions, oil leakage, and silt left from vehicle\n            tires will form runoff which, when combined with rainwater,\n            will discharge into water bodies. However, the negative\n            impact is expected to be low. During road construction,\n            existing vegetation will be protected, and trees removed\n            will be replanted. A greenbelt will be built and special\n            flowers and plants added for aesthetics. Project\n            construction will have no impact on bird habitats located in\n            the wetlands of East Lake if motor noise is reduced by roads\n            paved with high-quality bitumen. Viaducts are proposed to\n            reduce impacts on fish and other aquatic animals within the\n            ecological system. Temporary exits, crosswalks, bypasses,\n            and underground passages will separate pedestrians from\n            construction areas. Signal lights and speed limits will be\n            used to control traffic flow. Hazardous substances causing\n            risks of contamination, radiation, fire, and explosion, will\n            be stored in troughs and bins, and specially protected\n            during transport, loading, and storage, including special\n            packaging and assembling specifications, temperature\n            controls, added inhibitors, and radiation shields. Emergency\n            procedures will be drafted to handle accidents caused by\n            toxic chemicals. Other countermeasures for risk containment\n            include fastening and sealing containers, requiring\n            personnel to wear protective gear, restricting trucks\n            carrying dangerous loads to underpopulated areas. Drainage\n            systems will divert and treat sewage and rainwater. Solid\n            waste will be handled according to set specifications (water\n            sprayed on dust, providing retaining walls when removing old\n            houses, recycling construction materials, covering waste\n            when being transported, collecting household garbage for\n            treatment, etc.)."}, "docdt": "2003-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
