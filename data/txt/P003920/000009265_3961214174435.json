The overall objective of the project was to\n            improve the economic, technical and institutional efficiency\n            of the power sector. Overall, the Bank's performance\n            has been satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            experience with the captive power and energy pricing\n            covenants indicates that, to be effective, covenants should\n            be (a) realistic, (b) dated, (c) backed up by research and\n            action plans, and (d) systematically pursued and reviewed;\n            (ii) establishment of a central Project Management Unit\n            (PMU) could benefit overall project coordination and\n            accountability; (iii) well-targeted technical assistance\n            programs can be very productive; (iv) there was no regular\n            performance monitoring during supervision; and (v)\n            cumbersome procurement processes were a leading cause of\n            project implementation delays."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
