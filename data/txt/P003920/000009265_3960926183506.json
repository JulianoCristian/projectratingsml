Specifically, the project will: (a) support\n            a program to improve the efficiency of operation of diesel\n            generating units; (b) renovate old hydro plants to extend\n            their life and recover derated capacity; (c) extend\n            distribution facilities to supply about 893,000 new\n            consumers in Java in 1990/91 and 1991/92; and extend State\n            Electricity Corporation's (PLN) telecommunications\n            facilities. Lastly, it will: (e) provide technical\n            assistance to: (1) improve diesel plant efficiency; (2)\n            improve operation and maintenance of steam power plants; (3)\n            improve distribution system management; (4) strengthen\n            corporate and financial planning functions; and (5) improve\n            general accounting and cash management."}, "docdt": "1989-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
