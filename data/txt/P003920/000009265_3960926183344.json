"The  Power Sector Efficiency Project\n            seeks to improve the economic, technical and institutional\n            efficiency of the electricity subsector. It will also\n            improve the welfare of the population through the supply of\n            electric power. Specifically, the project will: (a) support\n            a program to improve the efficiency of operation of diesel\n            generating units; (b) renovate old hydro plants to extend\n            their life and recover derated capacity; (c) extend\n            distribution facilities to supply about 893,000 new\n            consumers in Java in 1990/91 and 1991/92; and extend State\n            Electricity Corporation's (PLN) telecommunications\n            facilities. Lastly, it will: (e) provide technical\n            assistance to: (1) improve diesel plant efficiency; (2)\n            improve operation and maintenance of steam power plants; (3)\n            improve distribution system management; (4) strengthen\n            corporate and financial planning functions; and (5) improve\n            general accounting and cash management."}, "docdt": "1989-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
