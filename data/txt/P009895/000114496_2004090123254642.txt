                        Amendment to our Disbursement Letter
                        dated August 15, 1990
Dear Mr. Radhakrishnan:
      We refer to our disbursement letter dated August 15, 1990 on the
above project.
      In Annex 1, para (3) of the above mentioned letter we had
stipulated that you submit requests for reimbursement under SOE for
expenditures on assistance to technology service institutions under
subloans valued less than US$4,000,000 equivalent.  From now onward
please submit requests for reimbursement under SOE, for expenditures on
assistance to technology service institutions, valued less than
US$500,000 equivalent per contract, instead of US$4,000,000 equivalent
per subloan.
      We have made the above amendment at the request of ICICI.
                                  Very truly yours,
                                   Cecil M. Perera
