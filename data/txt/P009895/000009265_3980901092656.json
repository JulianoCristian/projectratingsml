The goal was to\n            facilitate the acquisition and development of technology by\n            industrial firms in India. This was goal was met by strong\n            leadership that helped to grow the Industrial Technology\n            Development (ITD) program, by adding Technology Institutes\n            (TI) and creating funding for new technology curriculum. The\n            role of the World Bank helped to accelerate reforms, in\n            order for the project to move forward. The results featured\n            different components from the project, the Technical\n            Development Fund (TDF) that had 400 firms were able to\n            import technology. New TI\u0092s were created, and upgrades were\n            made to previous facilities. Sponsored R&D (SPREAD)\n            programs helped to control the borrowing for funding, all of\n            which helped  the success of the project."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
