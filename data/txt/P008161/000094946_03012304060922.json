Sustainability of the project is likely,\n            considering that laws have been approved that will maintain\n            the changes supported by the project. Overall, The World\n            Bank's performance was satisfacotry during project\n            preparation, appraisal, and implementation. The overall\n            performance of the Borrower was satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons lkearned from the project were the following: Strong\n            and continuous government support is required for even the\n            most gradual phasing of health reforms. It is equally\n            important to have flexibility in project design and a clear\n            exit strategy because of the risks of reforms. Communication\n            strategies should be considered from the very beginning when\n            proposed changes are expected to generate significant\n            resistance and opposition from stakeholders. The concept and\n            importance of monitoring and evaluation has to be introduced\n            right from the beginning of the project. Furthermore, it\n            quickly has to be reflected in functional systems being in\n            place. If not, as project implementation advances and the\n            project's cycle shorten, it will become increasingly\n            difficult to correct this weakness. The project demonstrated\n            that, if an innovative pilot program is implemented well and\n            concides with serious government commitment, it is possible\n            to replicate the program in other hospitals and expand its\n            benefits on a sustainable track. A strong working\n            relationship between the central level staff and the PCU\n            advances implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
