{"cdata!": "The Health Sector Development Project\n            addresses the Government's sectoral policy goal of\n            rationalizing health sector spending. Given the complexity\n            inherent in health sector reforms and existing institutional\n            constraints, the project focuses on a limited set of key and\n            attainable objectives to lay the foundation for incremental\n            and sustainable improvements. Its aims are twofold: 1)\n            improve the efficiency and quality of services provided to\n            the poor and uninsured by reducing the Public Health\n            Ministry's (MSP) role in the direct provision of health\n            services; and 2) establish the framework for the development\n            of health sector institutions. To address these objectives\n            the project comprises the following components: 1) The\n            delegation of MSP's service delivery responsibilities\n            will support the reduction of the MSP's role in the\n            direct provision of services, promoting the gradual\n            delegation of MSP service provision responsibilities to\n            eligible entities, primarily in the private sector. 2) The\n            insititutional development component will strengthen the\n            sector's institutional capacity and management\n            practices to support the gradual delegation of the\n            MSP's service provision responsibilities. 3) The\n            establishment of health sector disease priorities component\n            will help adjust the health service model to the\n            country's demographic and epidemiological profile. On\n            the basis of global-burden-of-disease and related cost\n            effectiveness analyses, the component will provide selective\n            support to priority programs."}, "docdt": "1995-02-21T00:00:00Z"}
