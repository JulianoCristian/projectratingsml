PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1619-SW
HICHLIGHTS
At appraisal in 1977, the project was deemed necessary to improve
two important sections u't the road network and to strengthen road
maintenance.  One of these roads, from Big Bend to Nggwavuma River, serving
an important sugar producing area, is an extension of Helehele-Big Bend
road completed under the Seconid Highway Project. The other road, from
Msnzini, Swaziland's largest city, to the Mhkondvo River is a link in an
important route to the south. Traffic on the roads has continued to grow
and the improvements were appropriate and timely. Strengthening road
maintenance has been achieved through technical assistance, a training
program and procurement of equipment. As a result of these additions, the
extent of road maintenance has increased and the quality improved. The
project's objectives were fully achieved as can be seen from the economic
rates of return calculated as part of the project re-evaluation.
The initial request from the Government was to continue the
program, begun under the then ongoing Second Highway Project (Loan
1108-SW), to upgrade priority sections of the main road network to
bituminous paved standards. Project appraisal was made about a year later
and much of the time was devoted to discussions between the Bank and the
Government on ways to strengthen the road maintennce capability of the
Roads Branch of the Ministry of Works and Communications and train
technicians and sub-professional road personnel. Project appraisal was
relatively smooth. The project was prepared and executed satisfactorily
for the most part with no major problem.
Bids were invited for the project civil works after Board
approval of the loan in late 1978. The bids received were much higher than
estimated costs due principally to a construction boom in neighbouring
Republic of South Africa (RSA), which tended to elevate prices both in the
RSA and Swaziland. As a result, it was necessary to make some reduction in
the scope of the works as a basis for obtaining a lower price from the
lowest bidder on one of the two project roads. An implementation problem
occurred on the other project road when a dispute arose between the
contractor and supervising consultants on pavement specifications causing a
delay of several months in completion of the works. This resulted in an
extension of the project closing date by one year. No significant problems
were experienced in implementing the program to strengthen road
maintenance.



The technical assistance, training and equipment elements in the
project have significantly strengthened the capacity of the Po-do Branch of
the Ministry of Works and Communications to maintain the official road
network. The institution biilding elements of the project were carried out
in the RB with particular success and their effects are far reaching.
Although much remains to be done in strengthening the RB, a good foundation
has been laid in the project.
The actual cost of the project exceeded the appraisal cost by 6%,
principally because of the higher road construction costs. The costs of
non-civil works elements of the project, however, were all lower than
appraisal estimates.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SWAZILAND THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. Introduction
1.01      Swaziland, a small land-locked country bounded by the Republic of
South Africa and Mozambique, has a transport infrastructure consisting of
about 2,700 km of roads, 240 km of railway, a cableway for asbestos
transport, an international airport and several airstrips. In 1977, the
quality of the road network left much to be desired as only 8% of the roads
were paved and the gravel roads were not adequately maintained. The Third
Highway Project contributed significantly to the improvement in the quality
of the road network by paving in additional 64 km of relatively important
roads and strengthening road maintenance through a program of equipment
procurement, technical assistance and training. In this way, the project
moved the country toward its basic sectoral goals of improving transport
services and reducing transport costs.
1.02      Two previous transport projects financed by the Bank Group had
also made useful contributions to sectoral development. In 1962, the First
Highway Project (Credit 20-SW; US$2.8 million) helped finance construction
of the Oshoek-Lomahaeha road (181 km) which extends from the western border
throtyh the main economic core of the country to the Mozambique border.
There was no requirement at that tima to prepare a Project Completion
Report (PCR) and the associate Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) but
it is evident from project records that the project was satisfactorily
completed on schedule at a cost close to the Bank estimate. The Second
Highway Project, approved in 1975 (Loan 1108-SW; US$7.0 million), provided
for construction of the Helehele-Phuzumoys road (43 km) and the
Tshaneni-Mlaula road (39 km). During the execution of the letter project,
a devaluation of the Emalangeni and the Rand enabled the Government, with
Bank approval, to expand the scope of the project to include the
Phuzumoys-Big Bend road (24 km). The three roads were completed almost on
schedule and the total cost of the project, including the road added in
1976, was about the same as the appraisal forecast. Traffic growth on
these roads has been higher than expected at appraisal. On certain
sections of the roads, there were some signs of premature pavement failure
in 1984, but the problem was not widespread and appropriate corrective
measures have been taken. The PPAR of June 26, 1981 agreed with the
findings in the PCR prepared in 1980 that the project was for the most part
executed in accordance with plan and the works were built satisfactorily.
The project's objectives were fully achieved and except for one road
section (nevertheless viable), the economic rates of return were estimated
to be high.er than calculated at appraisal.
1.03      The Third Highway Project was proposed by the Government in late
1976 before completion of the preceding project. Bank staff and Government
officials discussed during 1977 various possible elements that might be
included in the new project. The proposed content of the project changed
several times, largely as a result of the issuance, from time to time, of
relevant feasibility studies and engineering designs. It became evident
that the Helehele-Phuzumoys-Big Be.d road financed under the preceding
project should be extended southward to the Nggwavuma River and that
another high priority paved road should be built from Manzini southward.
Along with the upgrading of these major lirks in the road network, there
was a need for major enhancement of the RB's capabilities to maintain the
road system. Accordingly, the project as finally approved comprised the
construction of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River road and the Big Bend-Nggwavums



2 -
River road, a program to strengthen road maintenance and train technicians
and sub-professional road personnel and consultUng services for
construction supervision and certain detailed engineerig. The World Bank
provided a US$11 million loan for the project and tho remaining costs were
covered by the Government.
1.04      This completion report is based on:
(i)  A report on the project prepared, following its completion, by
the Roads Branch (RB) of the Ministry of Works and Communications
as required under Section 3.07(c) of the Credit Agreement; and
(ii) Information collected on missions to Swaziland and a review of
Bank files in Washington.



tI. Project Preparation and Appraisal
Origin of the Project
2.01      A Bank mission to Swaziland in February 1976 sought to identify
elements of a Third Highway Project. Particular attention centered on a
review of several sections of road that had been recommended for
improvement in a transportation planning study prepared in 1971 by
consultants.  One of _hese was the Phuzuioya-Big Bend-Lavumisa road (64 km)
a portion of which was subject to detailed engineering under the on-going
Second Highway Project: the proposed improvemerit of this road was intended
to aid the agriculture and industry based on sugar production and to
improve the southeast international link with the Republic of South Africa
(RSA). A second candidate road for the project was the Hlatikulu-Mahamba
road (43 km), a portion of the p_.anned major link between Manzini, the
industrial center of the country, and Mahambs on the southwestern border
with RSA. A third candidate for improvement was the Mpaka-Maphiveni road
(33 km) linking the major sugar producing area of the northeast with the
main paved road axis of Swaziland; the plan was to pave this gravel road
built under the First Highway Project. Recognizing that the available
feasibility studies for these roads were several years old, the Bank
mission suggested and the Government agreed that consultants update the
studies. When this work was completed in 1976, a timely and useful basis
was available for project formulation. The purposes of the Third Highway
Project were: to assist Government in its goal of improving transport by
constructing two main road sections to paved standard, and to strengthen
the Roads Branch's capacity to maintain its road network by providing
technical assistance, treining and equipment.
Preparation
2.02      Detailed engineering, in 1976, had already been completed on the
Phuzumoya-Big Bend road and it became possible to expand the scope of the
Second Highway Project and construct this road under that project. About
this time, the Nggwavuma - Lavumisa Road was found to be premature for
improvement and thus was excluded from the Third Highway Project; but the
Big Bend-Nggwavuma River portion was found to be viable and of high
priority; accordingly, it was included in the new project. Consultants
were selected by the Government to undertake the detailed engineering for
this segment; in fact, they completed engineering for the entire eastern
corridor road from Lomahasha on the Mozambique border to Lavumisa on the
RSA border, which included the Mpaka-Maphiveni segment -- a section
intended originally as an element in the Third Highway Project; however,
problems arose on that segment over the proposed alignment through a game
reserve and this road was, in the end, excluded from the project. The
detailed engineering on the Lomahasha-Lavumisa road was completed in June
1978 and retroactively financed under the project.



- 4 -
2.03      Detailed engineering had been completed in 1975 on the 110 km
Msnzini-Mhkondvo-Hlatikulu-Mahamba road by consultants financed by the
African Development Bank, and the Government attached a high priority to
the improvement of this route to the south. In 1977, the Government
appointed a different firm of consultants to review the engineering design
with a view to achieving some economy, particularly in the design of the
road pavement. Based on discussions with Government and the African
Development Bsank it was agreed in 1977 that the Third Highway Project would
include the Manzini-Mhkondvo River segment and the African Development Bank
would finance the Mhkondvo River-Hlatikulu-Mahamba portion of the route.
2.04      The need to maintain the existing road network to adequate
standards had been stressed by the University of Natal Transportation Study
if 1971 and this need was recognized by the RB and the Bank. Early in
1977, the Government engaged consultants to undertake, with Government
financing, a study of road maintenance training needs. Also the RB with
the assistance of a British financed technical assistance team assessed its
road maintenance equipment resources and determined its equipment needs; it
also reviewed the workshop capabilities of the Central Iransport
Administration (CTA) and identified workshop equipment needs. Most of the
preparation studies and engineering work was completed satisfactorily prior
to appraisal.
Appraisal
2.05      The project was appraised in December 1977 by Bank staff
concurrently with a team from the African Development Bank (AFDB)
appraising a related project aimed at improving the Mhkondvo River-Mahamba
road. The appraisal was timely and was based on a transport investment
program prepared by consultants in 1971 as part of a national transport
planning study and subsequent update, feasibility studies and detailed
engineering also carried out by consultants and related information
provided by RB and other sources. Although detailed engineering of one of
Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road was not completed, sufficient work had been
done on typical sections to warrant appraisal as scheduled. Some
consideration was given in the field to possible co-financing by the two
Banks under a single project but this approach was found not popular at
that time and was dropped. Thus, each institution processed a separate
project but with close coordination of their activities.
2.06      The economic viability of the Mhkondvo River-Hlatikulu road,
financed by the AFDB, was considered marginal by Bank staff at appraisal
stage but later information confirmed its timelines and viability. This
point was significant because of the linkage of that road to the
Manzini-Mhkondvo River road financed under the project. Because of the
sizeable traffic growth, the extension of the paved road from Big Bend to
Nggwavuma River was also found to be timely.
2.07   - During preparation of the appraisal report, total project costs
were revised downward from US$14.7 million (net of taxes) to US$13.9
million (net of taxes). On this basis, a loan of US$10 million was
approved by the Loan Committee, which was later increased to US$ 11.0
million during negotiations (para. 2.08 below).

Loan Negotiation and Subsequent Processing
2.08      The loan was negotiated in June 1978.  Cost estimates,
particularly for the civil works, were discussed in some oetail during
negotiations and it become evident from updated cost information developed
when detailed engineering was completed on the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River
Road, that the estimates needed to be increased. As a result, the required
loan amount rose to US$11 million, and this was agreed at negotiations.
The project loan was approved by the Board on September 5, 1978, and the
loan agreement was signed on September 27, 1978. The loan become effective
on December 29, 1978.

Start-Up
3.01      Delay of several months was experienced prior to the opening of
tenders on construction of the two roads. One of the reasons for the delay
was that the RB sought, and ultimetely obtained, extra guarantees from tvo
contractors seeking to prequalify. In addition, the Government in its bid
documents required bidders to obtain all their materials and supplies from
local sources which was regarded by the Bank as restrictive and would have
resulted in higher bid prices. The issue was finally resolved by the
nrovernment agreeing to invite bids based on local sources of materials as
well as other sources and to award the contracts to the lowest evaluated
bidders.
3.02      Seven bids were received for the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Rodd
and six for the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road. The number and quality of the
bids were sufficient to provide a competitive basis for contract awards.
Following the receipt of bids, a further delay occurred because the lowest
bid for the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road was substantially higher than the
appraisal estimates and the Government and Bank explored ways of reducing
the scope of the works on the road. These initial problems did not have
any significant effect on project performance and could not have been
anticipated.
3.03      Non-construction project elements were initiated more nearly in
accordance with scheduled implementation. Only in the case of the
technical assistance and training was there a significant delay (6 months)
in the beginning of work; this was caused mainly by Government tender board
delays on the selection of a consulting firm and the time taken to
negotiate a contract with the technical assistance consultants.
Revisions of Project
3.04      Some changes were made in the scope of the project after the loan
became effective. As indicated above (para. 3.01), the scope of the works
on the Big Bend-Nggwavums River Road was reduced in order to lower
construction costs. The Government negotiated these changes with the
lowest bidder which resulted in potential savings of E 1.01 million. The
changes consisted mainly of a reduction of shoulder width from 2.5 m to 1.f
m along the entire length of the road and of the roadway on the bridge
across the Nggwavuma River from 13.5 m to 9.0 m to be consistent with
bridge standards approved for the bridges on the Msnzini-Mhkondvo Road.
Other savings were made by the elimination of concrete safety barriers in
favor of raised unamountable curbs.
3.05      On the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road (32 km), a chanqe was made
during construction in the contract specifications for the base course by
increasing the thickness of this layer along 10 km of the road to
compensate for using material from a particular borrower pit, which had a
strength lower than indicated during detailed engineering. This was the
outcome of the resolution of a dispute between the contractor and
supervising consultants over suitability of base course materials. No
changes in the scope of work were made with regard to the other project
components.

Implementation Schedule
3.06      A comparison is presented in Table I between the expected and
actual dates for various implement ition activities. Among components the
best results were achieved in the implementation of the component concerned
with strengthening road maintenance; the procurement of road maintenance
equipment, workshop equipment and tools was carried out in accordance with
the expected schedule and the technical assi'stance and training were
completed with about 6 months delay. The least satisfactory result for
major components was experienced in the case of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River
road construction and supervision, only 40% built on the expected date of
completion.
3.07      A delay of about 7 months occurred when the contractor on the
Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road suspended base course construction following
disagreement with the supervising consultants over the quality of naturally
occurring materials used in the construction. Briefly, the facts of the
dispute were as follows. The contractor claimed that there were no
suitable materials within reasonable haul distances. He could achieve
specification only by increasing the thickness of base course from 125 mm
to a minimum of 160 mm or by stabilizing with 3-4% cement or by using
crusher run gravel. The consultants argued that (i) it was the
contractor's responsibility to locate suitable materials, (ii) the
contractor did not try hard enough and (iii) the contractor did not have
the right compacting equipment. In the end, the contractor resumed
construction and agreed to bear the costs of the increase in basecourse
thickness of about 10 km of the road.1/

3.08      Construction of the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River road was expected to
require 23 months and the work was completed in only 22 months. In
contrast, construction of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River road which was
expected to be accomplished in 23 months required 44 months. Although
there was a 7 month period when little work was done as the contractor and
supervising consultants were resolving the dispute concerning the base
course material, much of the delay was initially caused by the contractor's
inability to mobilize all his staff and equipment and later by a high meter
table which caused flooding in deep cuts along the first 10 km section of
the road. It was necessary to modify the drainage design during
construction resulting in increased quantities of earthworks.
3.09      The original closing date for the project was December 31, 1982
but the delay in road construction work made it necessary to postpone the
closing date to December 31, 1983. Whether or not the schedule of expected
implementation was realistic depends on one's judgment concerning the
avoidability of various delays that occurred in carrying out the project.
Certainly the delay, due to stoppage and slow-down of construction work
could have been avoided by prompt resolution of the dispute; the solution
ltimately reached should have been recognized early on by the parties as a
basis for resumption of c6nstruction work. Some of the time lost due to
delays prior to construction such as the securing of guaranties from two
contractors and the Bank questioning the validity of the Government's
policy of requiring civil works contractors to obtain materials locally was
unavoidable. Clearly it is impossible to anticipate all problems in
preparing an implementation schedule. In retrospect, the schedule for the
project might have allowed a bit more time for early-stage implementation
steps but was generally realistic.
3.10      The accomplishments under the project were in accordance with the
targets established. All of the road construction work was completed.
Road maintenance equipment was procured as planned and immediately issued
to the RB. Similarly, workshop equipment and tools were purchased as
scheduled and appropriately installed. The 6-man consultant team for
strengthening road maintenance carried out on-the-job training as well as
formal courses on road maintenance resulting in the training of 77
equipment operators and 40 drivers. A Counterpart Training Officer and an
Operator/Driver Instructor were recruited and trained both on the job and
overseas. Twenty-six highway technicians were given both on-the-job
training and formal instruction by staff of the Ministry of Works Power &
Communications, Swaziland College of Technology and Consultants. Short
training courses were also conducted for all Clerks of Works, Construction
foremen and Road Oversears of the RB. The consultants prepared a detailed
inventory of the total proclaimed road network and produced a comprehensive
but simple road maintenance manual. Finally, consultants completed
satisfactorily detailed engineering for the Mafutseni-Mliba road.
Reporting
3.11      Progress reports by the executing agency and its consultants were
generally satisfactory in content and reasonably timely. However,
consultants'reports on the dispute with the contractor on the
Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road were received only in the field and were late.



- 10 -
Procurement
3.12      Contracts for the civil works and supply of the road maintenance
equipment and workshop equipment and tools were awarded after international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines and no problems were
encountered. Although there was provision for the procurement, under
normal Governemtn procedures, of off-the-shelf items up to a limited value,
this provision was not used for financing out of loan funds. While there
were moderate delays in the award of contracts for the civil works, the
procurement of equipment and tools was accomplished within the time
schedule. Table 1 gives details of all procurement under the project.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.13      The performance of the consultants, contractors and suppliers
involved in the project was good except for the consultant and contractor
responsible for work on the Manzini-Mhkondvo River road. Neither of these
firms was sufficiently cooperative and flexible in its dealings with the
other. The contractor was also unable to mobilize quickly and works did
not commence in earnest until after sevel'al months delay. As a
consequence, completion of the road work was delayed and Swaziland may have
suffered in terms of delayed benefits from this project component.
Costs
3.14      Actual cost, as seen in Table 2, was US$16.93 million compared to
the US$15.90 million appraisal cost estimate, an increase of 6%. While
project costs in terms of local currency (E17.12 million) were much larger
than anticipated at appraisal (E12.66 million), a sharp decline in the
value of the local currency relative to the US dollar following appraisal
resulted in project costs in terms of US dollars nearly the same as the
appraisal estimates. Foreign costs actually incurred were US$12.66 million
compared to of the US$12.17 million appraisal estimate of such costs an
increase of 4%. The principal reason for the fact that the actual project
costs exceeded the appraisal cost estimates was that the bid prices on the
road construction components were higher than anticipated.

3.15      Even though some cost reduction was negotiated with the low
bidder on the construction work south of Big Bend, the actual cost was
US$5.85 million, or 17% higher than the appraisal estimate. For the other
road, that is, construction south of Msnzini, the actual cost was US$6.94
million, or 19% higher than the appraisal estimate. The US$6.94 million
reflects the added costs of increased quantities particularly on the
Manzini-Mhkondvo, River Road. In the case of the technical assistance and
training component, the actual cost was US$1.15 million, compared to the
USS1.03 million appraisal estimate, an increase of 12%; the principal
reason for this high cost was an expansion in the magnitude of the services
provided by the consultant. For the other re'atively small project
components, the actual costs were lower than the appraisal estimates.
Disbursements
3.16      Actual disbursements under the loan as compared with the
appraisal estimates are shown in Table 3. Disbursements began in the
second quarter of FY1980 about one half year later than planned. Under the
original plan, disbursements were to be completed in the second quarter of
FY1983, but at that time 19% of the loan remained to be disbursed. The
final disbursement occurred on March 29, 1984, that is, in the third
quarter of FY1984 at which time US$223,138.44 equivalent was cancelled.
Thus, the total amount disbursed was US$10,776,861.56 of the US$11.0
million loan. Disbursements were slow initially due to the Government not
sending in withdrawal applications for reimbursement although equipment
procurement had been completed and civil works had been going on for 12
months. Following a Bank supervision mission in early 1981 which discussed
this matter with the Government, there was a dramatic increase in
disbursements which then continued to be satisfactory.
3.17      The disbursement percentage for civil works expenditures,
originally 55%, was reduced to 45% in 1981 because of anticipated cost
overrun (from the appraisal estimate of US$15.90 million to US$21.60
million) due to higher than expected bid prices for the project roads. In
March 1983, however, it was found that cost increases to date were more
moderate due to the appreciation of the US Dollar relative to the local
currency.  Therefore, the disbursement percentage was raised to 100% for
disbursement of the balance of loan funds for civil works expenditures. In
the end, a small amount of loan funds was undisbursed, as noted above, and
Bank financing covered 63% of total project costs compared to the expected
69% at the time of Board Approval, and none of the local costs.
Covenants
3.18      Under the loan agreement, the borrower was required to comply
with several special covenants. Two of these (Sections 3.03, 3.04) related
to technical assistance and training and compliance was achieved with some
delays beyond established deadlines. Another covenant (Section 3.05)
required certain actions concerning base and area workshop facilities;
again, the borrower complied but with some delay. The requirement (Section
4.04) that the borrower adequately maintain its road network was met.
Finally, a provision (Section 4.05) required that dimensions and axle loads
of vehicles using the road network meet the design standards for the roads;
appropriate regulations are in force and RB is making spot checks with a
portable weigh bridge but because of lack of police assistance it has not
been effective.

IV. Institutional Performance and Development
Performance of the Roads Branch (RB)
4.01      The RB is a division of the Ministry of Works and Communications
responsible for the construction and maintenance of all officially
designated roads in the country. At the time of appraisal, the RB was not
able to maintain the road network adequately and many roads were in poor to
fair condition. This limitation in capability was recognized by not only
the RB but also consultants engaged to study the problem. Insufficient
training of personnel was a major part of the problem both within the road
maintenance units and in CTA, the agency responsible for equipment
maintenance. Lack of sufficient equipment was a serious constraint as
well. A'lso, the RB depended on expatriates for professional, technical and
supervisory personnel in almost all positions.
4.02      As a result of tta Third Highway Project, employees at various
levels are better trained 'ind operating with more and better equipment than
in 1977. RB is now less dependent on expatriate staff for low level
supervisory positions. However, there is a need for experienced engineers
and recently following the damage to the road network caused by cyclone
Domoina in early 1984, the British Government is financing three engin-ers
to fill senior engineering posts in the RB.
Institutional Development
4.03      One of the principal objectives of the Third Highway Project  was
to strengthen the capacity of the RB to maintain the country's road
network. The consultants engaged to study the organization recommended
several changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the RB. One
of the first changes made following the recommendations was the
establishment of a Training Section in the RB, initially staffed by
consultants financed under the project but gradually taken over by their
two ounterparts. Another recommendation implemented in April 1981 was the
incrasse in the number of maintenance districts from 3 to 4. The number of
regravelling units for periodic maintenance was increased from 1 to 3,
resulting in an overall capability of the RB to regravel 200 km per year.
Some 20 new technicians posts concerning all aspects of the RB's work were
created, all of them filled by highway technicians trained at the Swaziland
College of Technology under the training program in the project. A small
design unit was established within the RB aimed at improving the standard
of road design. An extensive training program was carried out under the
project as explained in Section 3.09. In general, significant progress was
made in institution-building during the period 1978-84.
4.04      The project has had a favorable impact on the performance of the
RB. Improved technical skills and management as well as road maintenance
equipment modernization and expansion have led to better standard of road
maintenance, particularly periodic maintenance operations such as
regravelling and resealing.



- 15 -
4.05      Notwithstanding the progress indicated above, much remains to be
done toward strengthening the RB andespecially the CIA. Recently-trained
employees need more experience to improve their capabilities and
performance. Additional training is required both locally and overseas to
assure that future staff needs will be met with minimum dependence on
expatriates. A lack of local highway engineers can only be solved by
providing opporturnities for overseas engineering training. Much remains to
be done in CTA to enhance the organization's capability to repair road
maintenance equipment which is so vital to good road maintenance. Under
the Cyclone Rehabilitation (Roads) Project, approved by the Board in
February 5, 1985, the Bank will finance technical assistance to improve the
CTA organization and management and provide better service to user agencies
such as the RB.
4.06      During implementation of the project, the Government, at the
urging of the Bank, sent three students to study civil engineering in Ohio
State University with USAID assistance. They have completed their training
successfully and have taken up positions in the RB. Three more are now
studying in the United States and this program is expected to continue.
However, for a few years to come, because of the need for practical
training and experience, the senior engineering posts in RB will be staffed
by expatriates.

V.  Economic Reev. 'ustion
Benefits from the Project
5.01      The principal benefits anticipated from the project were the
reduction of transport costs and the facilitation of development of the
country.  Construction of the two roads to paved standard was expected to
result in savings in vehicle operating costs and to a lesser extent,
savings in road maintenance costs.  Similerly, the general improvement
anticipated in the quality of the road network, based on inputs of
technical assistnce, training and equipment, was to be reflected in lower
vehicle operating costs and more efficiency in road maintenance. Since the
project was not completed until 1983, however, and the estimated life of
the main project components (road construction) is 20 years, only the
initial impact of the project can be assessed at this time.
Traffic trend
5.02      Savings in vehicle operatinq costs projected at appraisal for the
two key roads, were based on traffic projections over the 20 year life of
the rusds.  The traffic, in terms of vehicles per day, estimated in 1977
for the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River road in the year 1984 was 704, as shown in
above Table 4. The latest traffic data on the road indicates that the
actual 1984 level at 776 vpd is about 10% above the estimated level. In
the case of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River road, the actual 1984 level is 626
vpd as compared with the 823 vpd estimated at appraisal, about 24% below
the estimate. If, however, account is taken of 250 vpd of traffic
continuing to use an alternative route but expected soon to use this new
route, then the 1984 level rises to 876 vpd or 6% above the appraisal
estimate for that year. Severe damage to the new road caused by an
unprecedented rainfall in January 1984 may explain the deferred diversion
of this traffic.
Vehicle Operating Cost
5.03      Unit vehicle operating costs, by type of vehiele, are shown in
Table 5. VOC for the year 1976 were used in the appraisal in estimating
project benefits. The table also shows the comparable actual figures for
1981. The differences in VOC for these years reflects the considerable
inflation that has occurred in Swaziland in recent years, inflation which
is evident in road construction costs as well. The indicated savings in
1981 between gravel and paved roads for light, medium, and heavy vehicles
are EO.07, EO.15, and EO.20 per vehicle kilometer, respectively. These
unit savings are proportionately similar in both years except for light
vehicles which have a somewhat higher proportion in 1981 then in 1976.

NOTE:  Data for 1981 are based upon information obtained from Project
Completion Report prepared by Government which used data on VOC
in 1982 report (data as of October 1981) by consultants of the
University of Natal; this is Lhe latest available VOC data.
Economic Rate of Return
5.04      At the time of appraisal, the project was found to have an
overall economic rate of return of about 25%. The ERR for the Big Bend-
Nggwavuma River road was estimated at 25% and for the other road, 23%. As
indicated in Table 6, these two construction components together constitute
76% of the total actual investment in the project. In the reevaluation of
the components, all costs were based on prices as of October 1981, the
latest time for which reasonably good VOC data are available.

5.05      The economic cost of the actual capital investment was E 6.3
million for the Big Bend-Nggwavuma Road and E 7.3 million for the Manzini-
Mhkondvo road. Traffic for the opening year was estimated at 600 vpd
(1980) on the former road and 660 vpd (1982) on the latter. Future traffic
was assumed to increase at 6% p.s. as contrssted with 8% p.s. assumed in
the appraisal. Unit VOC used in the reassessment were those shown in Table
5. On the basis of these various factors, the ERR was found to be 18% for
the Big Bend-Nggwavuma Road and 15% for the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road.



- 19 -
5.06      Table 6 shows a comparison of the ERRs at appraisal and based on
the reevaluation. For the eastern road, the rate falls from 25 to 18% and,
for the other road, from 23 to 15%. Significantly, the newly calculated
rates show both roads to be economically viable.
5.07      One of the main causes of these reduced ERRs is that the actual
construction costs are higher than the appraisal estimates, as discussed
above. Another important reason for the lower ERRs in the reevaluation is
that the estimated rate of growth of future traffic was reduced from 8%
p.a. used in the appraisal co 6% p.s. in the reassessment. This may be
pessimistic, because growth rates up to date have been higher than
estimated at appraisal despite the recession in the country's economy.
5.08      The project component concerned with strengthening road
main.enance, which represents only 19% of the actual cost of the project,
had an ERR of 32% at time of appraisal. While detailed data are not
available to derive an ERR based on reevaluation of this institution -
building component, there is reason to believe that the ERR would be more
or less comparable to the relatively high rate found during appraisal. As
indicated above, implementation of this component proceeded well and the
actual costs fell below appraisal estimates. Therefore, it is estimated
that the ERR for this component remains at about 32%. For the projert as a
whole, the ERR is estimated at about 18%.

VI. Conclusions
6.01      The project achieved its basic objectives of improving two
important roads and strengthening road maintenance, iith each major
component showing an acceptable ERR. Preparation of the project was
satisfactory. Although the cost estimates for road constructicn in terms
of local currency proved to be low the added cost was largely offset by the
rise in the value of the dollar relative to the local currency, and
consequently the actual project cost in terms of dollars, was only 6%
higher than the appraisal estimate.
6.02      Implementation of the project was good except for the delays in
construction of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River road caused by the contractor's
inability to mobilize fully his staff and equipment within the allotted
'i-e and when a dispute arose between the contractor and the consultant
supervising the construct 'n over base course materials specification.
This resulted in the opening of the road 21 months later than scheduled and
resulted in the postponent of benefits from the road improvements.
6.03      The institution-building elements of the project were carried out
in the RB with particular success and their effects are far reaching.
Although much remains to be done in strengthening the RB a good foundation
has been laid in the project.
