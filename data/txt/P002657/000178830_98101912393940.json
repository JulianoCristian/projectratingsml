The project faces no\n            special risks, although it is possible the Central Transport\n            Organization will not improve its operations quickly enough\n            to adequately maintain the equipment required by the Roads\n            Branch, or that the Roads Branch's training program\n            will not improve road maintenance operations to the extent\n            originally planned."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
