Bend-Nggwavuma River Road to two-lane bituminous standard;\n            and by strengthening the maintenance capacity of the Roads\n            Branch through the provision of equipment and

The project will also include detailed\n            engineering of the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road and the\n            Mafutseni-Mliba Road. The main beneficiaries will be direct\n            road users, but benefits will be widely distributed among\n            small farmers, traders and consumers. The project faces no\n            special risks, although it is possible the Central Transport\n            Organization will not improve its operations quickly enough\n            to adequately maintain the equipment required by the Roads\n            Branch, or that the Roads Branch's training program\n            will not improve road maintenance operations to the extent\n            originally planned."}, "docdt": "1978-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
