KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting and Its Effect on Transport
1.01      The Kingdom of Swaziland is a small (17,364 km ), landlocked country
bounded by the Republic of South Africa and Mozambique (see Map). The terrain
is characterized by four distinct topographic regions: the mountainous high-
veld (average altitude 1,300 m), the central middleveld and lowveld valley,
and the Lubombo plateau on the eastern border. Apart from the highveld
and the Lubombo escarpment, the terrain does not impose serious difficulties
for road construction. Rainfall varies considerably between the extremes of
the highveld with an annual mean of about 2,300 mm and the semi-arid lowveld
with about 500 mm.
1.02      The population, increasing at an annual rate of 3.2%, totals about
505,000. Almost 90% of the population live in rural areas. The largest urban
centers are Mbabane, the capital, and Manzini, with nearly 30,000 people each.
Average population density is 29 per sq km and does not vary considerably
throughout the country.
1.03      Swaziland has made significant economic progress since achieving
independence in 1968. Average per capita GNP was estimated at US$580 in 1977,
and GDP growth has averaged about 6.8% per annum in real terms since the mid-
1960s. The economy is relatively diversified, producing coal, asbestos, live-
stock, timber, industrial products and commercial crops, the most important
being sugar, cotton, citrus and pineapples. Until recently iron ore was a
major export but mining was terminated in 1977 upon depletion of the ore.
Swaziland forms part of a Customs Union with South Africa, Botswana and
Lesotho; under this arrangement, customs duties on imports into the Union
area are apportioned between the four countries. There are no customs duties
on movement of goods within the Union.
1.04      Major commodity flows in Swaziland are as follows:  (i) sugar cane
from surrounding fields to the mills at Tshaneni and Big Bend; (ii) processed
sugar and molasses from these mills to Maputo for shipping; (iii) citrus from
the northeast to various domestic, South African and overseas markets; (iv)
timber from the highveld forests to the pulp mill in Bunya and to local and
South African sawmills; (v) cotton from the southeast to ginneries in Matsapha;
and (vi) petroleum products shipped from Durban through Maputo and northeastern
Swaziland to various internal market centers. General commodity imports,
largely originating in South Africa, enter Swaziland at various border points,
particularly Oshoek, Mahamba, Lavumisa and Bordergate; the chief market is the
Mbabane and Manzini area.



B. The Transport System
1.05      The transport infrastructure comprises about 2,700 km of road, 220
km of railway, a cableway, an international airport and several airstrips.
The road network carries most import traffic. A 20 km cableway in the north-
west transports asbestos over rugged terrain from Havelock to a railhead in
South Africa. There are no pipelines or navigable rivers. ELxport trade and
petroleum product imports are carried by the railway which traverses central
Swaziland and is linked with the Mozambique railway and the port of Maputo.
Highway Transport
1.06      Details of the highway subsector are discussed in Chapter II.
Railways
1.07      The Swaziland Railway (SR), completed in 1964, extends from an iron
ore mine at Ka Dake, in the extreme west of the country, to the Mozambique
border. A link with the South African Railway (SAR) is under construction
in the southeast and is expected to be operational by 1979. In the past SR
was managed and operated by the Mozambique railway, Portos, Caminhos de Ferro
e Transportes de Mocambique (CFM), but since 1974 the Swaziland Government has
been assuming increasing responsibility for the operation of SR and will have
complete control by the end of 1978.
1.08      Since nearly all of Swaziland's exports are transported by rail to
Maputo for transfer to ships, Government has become increasingly concerned
about the declining efficiency and reliability of rail and port operations
in Mozambique. Swaziland has consequently been interested in developing
an alternative rail route to the sea through South Africa, and in 1977 con-
struction of a rail link between SR and SAR began with Government financing.
The link may have greater strategic than economic significance unless it is
accompanied by newly generated traffic; accordingly, Government is now ex-
ploring the possibility of developing new coal mines along the rail link.
Air Transport
1.09      Because of Swaziland's small size, domestic air transport is minimal.
International air service is provided at Matsapha airport near Manzini. Fre-
quent adverse weather conditions and the proximity of the airport to mountains
led Government to consider a consultant's recommendation to build a new air-
port near Mpaka, some 75 km from Mbabane. This does not seem justified since
the measures necessary to overcome the limitations of Matsapha airport would
cost much less than construction of a new airport; furthermore, the location
of the existing airport is far more convenient than the proposed site. Gov-
ernment has recently indicated its intent to make the necessary improvements
at Matsapha rather than develop the Mpaka airport.



- 3 -
1.10      Foreign carriers provide service between Swaziland and Johannesburg,
Maputo and Durban. Since road transport is generally used to cover these
short distances, air traffic is light, in 1976 consisting of about 26,000
passengers and about 175 m tons of freight. To counter Swaziland's dependence
on foreign carriers and connections through the Johannesburg airport, Govern-
ment in 1977 assisted in the formation of the Royal Swaziland National Airline
which has recently acquired two aircraft and plans to begin service in 1978
between Swaziland and several countries in southern Africa. The investment
is, however, largely for strategic purposes.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.11      Swaziland's present transport policy has two broad aims:  (i) to
aid development, particularly in rural areas, by improving transport services
within Swaziland and expanding the transport network in areas of high economic
potential; and (ii) to reduce transport costs within the country and between
Swaziland and neighboring countries. Accordingly, the proportion of transport
investments included in Government's Third Development Plan (1978/79-1982/83),
which has not yet been finalized, is expected to be much larger than in the
past (about 25% of total investments, compared to 12% in the last plan).
Principal investments will include road construction, further construction of
the southeastern rail link, and improvements to Matsapha airport.
1.12      Investments in the transport sector over the past five years have
already shown sharp increases:

Source:   Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, 1977.
About 80% of total transport investments during the period were made in road
improvements.
1.13      Coordination of transport planning is the responsibility of the
Department of Economic Planning and Statistics which reviews proposals
and determines priorities. Proposals are put forward by the various minis-
tries, most notably the Ministry of Works, Power and Communications (MWPC)
which includes agencies concerned with road, rail and air transport (Chart 1).
Consultants occasionally assist MWPC in transport planning, particularly in



- 4 -
conducting feasibility studies and detailed engineering for specific project
proposals. In order to ensure that economic criteria are aLpplied in selecting
infrastructure projects, the Government has established a planning unit in the
MWPC, staffed by an advisor financed by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP). In recent years, however, Government has proceeded with several
investment projects whose primary justification has been strategic rather than
economic (paras. 1.08 and 1.10).
D. Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.14      The Bank Group became involved in Swaziland's transport sector in
1962 when the First Highway Project (Credit 20-SW; US$2.8 million) helped
to finance construction of the Oshoek-Lomahasha road (181 km) which extends
from the western border through the main economic core of the country to
the Mozambique border. This project was satisfactorily completed at a cost
very close to the Bank estimate. The effect of the project on Swaziland's
economy has been substantial, particularly in lowering transport costs on the
most heavily travelled road in the country.
1.15      The Second Highway Project (1975; Loan 1108-SW; US$7.0 million)
provided for construction of the Helehele-Phuzumoya road (43 km) and the
Tshaneni-Mlaula road (39 km). During execution of the works, a devaluation
of the Emalangeni and the Rand enabled the Government, with Bank approval,
to expand the size of the project to include the Phuzumoya - Big Bend road
(24 km). All three roads were completed almost on schedule, the last one in
June 1978. The total project cost including the road added in 1976 is esti-
mated to be about the same as the appraisal forecast (US$9.9 million).
Traffic growth on the roads has been somewhat higher than expected at project
appraisal.
1.16      In addition, a Rural Development Project (1977; Loan 1375-SW; US$4
million) is helping to finance the construction of about 900 km of new access
and feeder roads in areas being developed throughout the country as well as
the improvement of some existing access roads in the Mahamba area.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The highway network, as officially declared by law, totals 2,709 km.
As indicated in the following table, half of the network consists of earth
roads, about 40% have a gravel surface and only 8% are paved.  In addition
to these declared roads, there are a few thousand kilometers of agricultural
roads and unclassified earth tracks for which no particular organization
is responsible.

Source:   Roads Branch, 1977.
2.02      In the late 1950s, Government made a substantial effort to expand
the main and district road systems using largely local resources. Since then,
development of the network has been helped by assistance from the United
Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the Bank Group (see Table).

Source:   Roads Branch, 1977.
The substantial increase in the road network from 1970 to 1976 resulted not
from new construction, but from a reclassification of roads and the incorpora-
tion of more roads into the official network.
B. Traffic Growth and Characteristics
Vehicle Fleet
2.03      Composition and growth of the vehicle fleet is given below.  The
fleet more than doubled between 1969 and 1976, and grew at an average annual
rate of 5.6% during 1973-1976; it increased by 10.5% from 1975 to 1976.

Source:   MWPC and University of Natal, 1977.
On the basis of vehicle traffic counts conducted regularly by RB on selected
roads, the University of Natal in 1977 arrived at the followLng annual aver-
age growth rates by vehicle type:  11.9% for light vehicles, 8.4% for 2-axle
trucks and 6.8% for 3 and 4-axle trucks. Traffic flows were found to be
highest on the Mbabane-Manzini road which carries several thousand vehicles
per day (vpd); other main roads carry traffic of 200 to 500 zpd while district
roads support less than 200 vpd.
2.04      Most freight vehicles are small trucks and vans of less than 3
tons capacity. Heavier trucks of 3 or more axles, however, are used more
frequently and consequently account for a relatively high proportion of the
total freight traffic.
Trucking Industry
2.05      Entry into the road transport industry is relatively unrestricted;
applicants are required to demonstrate only financial capability and a nominal
demand for transport services. As a result, substantial competition is found
in both freight and passenger operations. Swaziland's road transport indus-
try, studied by Canadian-financed consultants, TRIMAC (Canada) in 1976, was
found to include 77 local freight carriers operating 326 trucks; two of these
carriers accounted for a high proportion of the larger trucks. Average load
capacity was relatively high at approximately 15 tons. In adldition, about 290
trucks of foreign registration operate between Swaziland and South Africa.
Passenger transport was provided by 141 bus operators with 765 buses for
scheduled domestic service, a small number of buses for non-scheduled or
for-hire service, and a few foreign companies operating between Swaziland and
South Africa. The Government, for political reasons, is presently considering
a recommendation made in the TRIMAC study to develop a state--owned trucking
company which would gradually take over the important freight: service between
Swaziland and South African railheads, which is now undertaken exclusively by
South African carriers.



-7-
Regulations
2.06      The Road Transport Services Division of the SAR handles all freight
trucked between railheads in South Africa and points in Swaziland. The rates
on this international service have been reasonable. Motor transport rates
for all other freight services are free of Government regulation and are
competitive. Fares for bus passengers, however, are subject to a reasonable
maximum (fare per passenger-km) established by the Road Transportation Board;
the maximum fare level is revised from time to time as conditions change.
2.07      Regulations governing vehicle dimensions and weights are adequate
to protect the road network. Maximum single axle loads are limited to 11.5 m
tons and maximum wheel loads to 3.85 m tons. Overloading is not a serious
problem; however, Government intends to deploy two weighbridges to areas with
roads recently paved under the Second Highway Project (para. 1.15).
C. Administration
2.08      The Roads Branch (RB) under the MWPC (Chart 1) is responsible for
the planning, construction and maintenance of all officially designated roads.
RB headquarters in Mbabane handles planning, new construction and periodic
maintenance (resealing and regravelling executed by one bitumen and one gravel
unit). Routine maintenance is done locally by the three regional districts
of Manzini, Nhlangano and Mbabane. RB's organization is given in Chart 2.
2.09      Accounting and reporting procedures are generally satisfactory.
Monthly costs of administration, maintenance and construction are reported
to the Senior Roads Engineer by headquarters and field staff, and RB keeps
accurate cost records of all operations. There is a need, however, to im-
prove the processing and analysis of cost data; this would be undertaken
with the aid of technical assistance to be financed under the proposed
project (para. 3.08).
2.10      The Central Transport Organization (CTO) under MWPC is responsible
for procuring, maintaining and repairing all civilian government equipment
and vehicles which are hired out to user agencies at Government-regulated
rates. It operates a main workshop in Mbabane and area shops in Manzini,
Siteki, Nhlangano and Piggs Peak. CTO suffers from poor management, inade-
quately trained mechanics, as well as ill-equipped and poorly located work-
shops. A British-financed technical assistance team arrived recently to
undertake a three-year program (1977-80) to improve (i) the general manage-
ment, administration and organization; (ii) the staffing and training; and
(iii) financial control including financial aspects of the vehicle and equip-
ment hire systems. The seven member team will also plan, design and super-
vise the construction of a new base shop at Manzini and improved area shops
at Mbabane, Piggs Peak, Nhlangano, and Siteki. Within the few months it has
been in the country, the team is making good progress to meet its objectives
and has already slightly increased equipment availability. The proposed
project will support this effort by financing workshop equipment and tools
(para. 3.11).

2.11      In 1977, the Government financed consultants, ORT (Switzerland), to
study RB's functions, organization, staffing and training needs. Their report
proposed certain changes in RB's functions and organization, and recommpnded a
3-year technical assistance and training program to improve RB operations,
particularly road maintenance. For the most part, the report is satisfactory
and its recommendations have been accepted by Government for implementation in
the near future. However, one major proposal, suggesting that RB discontinue
its present reliance on CTO, and instead establish its own mechanical services
division to own, procure, and repair equipment and vehicles, was rejected
since Government feels that the British-financed technical assistance team
will be able to improve CTO operations and benefit RB. The Bank agrees with
Government's view.
D. Staff and Training
2.12      RB's four key engineering posts (Chart 2) are filled by expatriates
financed under a British technical assistance program. Since only two or
three Swazis are studying civil engineering at universities abroad, RB will
probably be dependent on expatriate professionals for some time to come. With
the assistance of the Bank under the Second Education Project (Loan 1478-SW),
Government has embarked on a program to expand secondary school facilities,
including the teaching of science subjects; as a result of ithis project,
more Swazis will be capable of entering universities for engineering studies,
but the situation will only improve gradually. RB's sub-professional staff
of 42 are all Swazis except for one expatriate technician wio serves as an
assistant engineer. In addition, there are 99 equipment operators and drivers,
all Swazis. RB has no training organization, although a Ch:Lef Training
Officer was appointed in 1976 to coordinate all training programs within the
MWPC.
2.13      A training program, based on recommendations by ORLT (para. 2.11) and
found satisfactory by Government, involves the retraining of 137 existing
staff members and training of 110 new staff over a three-year period, as shown
below:

particularly of equipment operators and drivers.

2.14      Thirty qualified school leavers will be admitted as technician
trainees to a three-year course at the Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT),
with six months of each year devoted to on-the-job training in various RB
sections. SCOT's facilities, expanded and improved under the First Education
Project (Credit 518-SW), are adequate for the needs of these courses. These
trainees will eventually provide RB with a source of technicians to be re-
cruited for various positions, including that of overseer. Although the
training program would affect all RB operations, it would primarily benefit
road maintenance rather than construction activities since Government does
not intend to expand road construction by force account. Under the project,
consultants will be appointed to assist the Government in implementing this
training program (paras. 3.08-3.09). Government has agreed to make SCOT's
staff and facilities available for the conduct of the three-year highway
technician course, to commence not later than July 1, 1979.
E. Planning
Planning Capability
2.15      Road planning by the Government and its consultants has been ade-
quate and is leading to the development of a balanced and integrated highway
network. The highway planning capability of MWPC includes staff to perform
both economic analysis and engineering. MWPC has also used consultants
extensively for both long-term transport planning and for project feasibility
and design studies.
2.16      New road construction projects to be included in the Third National
Development Plan (1978/79-1982/83) have not been firmly agreed since the plan
is still in the final stage of preparation. However, MWPC gives high priority
to construction of the following roads:
Project                Length                  Status

Mbabane - Manzini Expansion       40          Not yet studied.
Most of these roads would be built to paved standard; the existing Mbabane-
Manzini paved road, built under the First Highway Project (Credit 20-SW) is
included for construction because it is expected to require some augmentation



- 10 -
of capacity within the next five years. All of these roads, except the last,
have been studied by the University of Natal's Department of Economics, and
their construction has been found feasible. However, Government's tentative
plan to construct all the roads within five years seems ambitious, and a
ten-year program might be more realistic and more likely. In addition, some
rural roads will be constructed by force account, financed under a continuing
British aid program initiated in 1972 and through the ongoing Rural Development
Area Program (para. 1.16). The proposed project will help finance the con-
struction to paved standard of two roads, Manzini-Mhkondvo River and Big Bend-
Nggwavuma River (paras. 3.05-3.06).
F. Financing
2.17      Expenditures on roads have increased substantia'ly in recent years,
as indicated in the following table. Road construction expenditures rose
rapidly during the period since 1975, when the Second Highway Project and
other major road construction projects were in progress.

2.18      Highway investments are financed largely through loans and grants
from external sources and to some extent from the Government's internal re-
sources. Recurrent highway expenditures are financed out of the general
budget. A comparison of budget allocations and recurrent expenditures dur-
ing recent years shows that expenditures have been about equal to or above
budgeted amounts: 1/
1/   The additional funds were made available by a supplementary budget
(1975/76) or by the transferal of savings from other purposes (1976/77).

Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and duties on
vehicles, fuel, lubricants, and spare parts and through licenses and registra-
tion fees. No specific data are available on total revenues collected from
road users because all customs and sales duties on goods imported into the
Customs Union area are paid into a common revenue pool. Only the license
fees, which are not paid into the common revenue pool, are set by the
Swaziland Government; this source yielded about E550,000 in fiscal year 1975.
G. Engineering
2.19      RB has no separate design division, but carries out some engineering
for low standard roads constructed by force account. Detailed engineering and
documentation for nearly all new works, particularly the paving of main roads,
is executed by consultants. Design standards for particular roads vary accord-
ing to the consultants employed but generally conform to the minimum road
design criteria set down by the RB, which are similar to those employed
by neighboring South Africa. To assure the adequacy of these standards, RB
recently appointed consultants, Van Niekerk, Kleyn, and Edwards Inc. (South
Africa), to study and make recommendations for design standards appropriate
for Swaziland, and work is expected to commence shortly.
H. Construction
2.20      All major roadworks are carried out by foreign contractors, usually
from South Africa. Contracts are normally let after competitive bidding
based on priced bills of quantities. RB has a construction unit which under-
takes small works as well as some regravelling works and improvement to dis-
trict roads. Construction of main roads is supervised by consultants, while
RB staff supervise all district road construction. Both are satisfactory.
2.21      The local contracting industry is in an embryonic stage with little
chance of major expansion during the next few years because of the virtual
absence of local management capability and scarcity of local skilled personnel.
However, a team from the Bank/United Nations Industrial Development Organisa-
tion Cooperative Program recently completed a study of the constraints to expan-
sion of the local construction industry and ways to assist local contractors.



- 12 -
The study's preliminary findings are mainly devoted to the building industry,
but long-term training measures proposed are also applicable to the road con-
struction industry. A draft final report to the Government is expected in late-
1978. At present, three small local firms can execute road contracts of up to
US$300,000 each. The present policy of limiting construction work by force ac-
count to current levels is advantageous to the three local iirms which are given
all the work they can handle provided they are competitive with force account.
2.22      Construction and rehabilitation work is done by work methods using
equipment where possible. Labor-intensive methods are not widely employed in
Swaziland because of the country's low population density, the absence of
widespread unemployment, the relatively high wages for unskilled labor (about
US$2.50 equivalent per day) and the dearth of managerial skills at all levels.
However, when volunteer labor is available, attempts are madie to construct
some rural roads with only a few essential items of equipment.
I. Maintenance
2.23      Routine maintenance is organized in three districts with depots in
Mbabane, Manzini and Nhlangano. A clerk of works, in charge of each district,
carries out maintenance works through his depot and road camlps distributed
around the district. In all, there are 14 road camps, 5 each in Mbabane and
Manzini Districts and 4 in Nhlangano. Some regravelling work is let to local
contractors. Periodic maintenance is executed by one bitumen and one gravel
unit under headquarters' control.
2.24      Maintenance of paved roads is not yet a serious problem because of
their small aggregate length and recent construction. Maintenance of gravel
and earth roads, however, is not satisfactory because of inadequate staffing,
lack of training, insufficient and poorly maintained equipment and poor work-
shop facilities; as a result, some parts of the network have deteriorated.
These problems will be addressed under the proposed project (para. 3.07).
Funding for routine maintenance is adequate though periodic maintenance of
unpaved roads has been seriously neglected but should improve with the help of
additional funds allocated in the current budget. Government representatives
have said that funding for road maintenance will not be reduced below current
levels (para. 2.17) and that future allocations are likely to be increased to
meet maintenance requirements, including continuance of the program to clear
the backlog of roads needing regravelling.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      A study of Swaziland's transport sector, carried oujt in 1971 by the
University of Natal, recommended an investment program which included paving



- 13 -
of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road and the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road.
Feasibility studies for these and other roads were undertaken by the same
university in 1976-1977 and confirmed the earlier findings.
Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road. This is the northern section of a
110 km road going south from Manzini to Mahamba on the South African
border. Detailed engineering for the whole road was carried out
in 1975 by consultants Tippetts-McCarthy-Stratton (USA) with the
assistance of the African Development Bank (AfDB). In reviewing
the consultants' cost estimates, Government concluded that some
cost reductions could be achieved; it therefore requested that
the work be reviewed by consultants, COMTEC (Italy), who were
able to achieve some economies particularly in pavement design.
The central and southern sections of the Manzini-Mahamba Road
were appraised by the African Development Fund, at the same time
as the Bank's appraisal of the northern section, and all three
parts were found technically and economically viable.
Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road. Detailed engineering and prepara-
tion of tender documents for construction were completed in June
1978 by consultants, Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnell and Partners (UK).
3.02      Government is finding it difficult to adequately maintain its road
network because of a lack of trained manpower and equipment. Consultants,
ORT (Switzerland), in their 1977 study (para. 2.11), included recommendations
as to RB's staffing, training and equipment requirements which provided the
basis for defining specific needs which Government requested the Bank to
finance.
B. Objectives
3.03      The project has two primary objectives:  to assist Government in
its goal of improving transport by constructing two main road sections to
paved standard; and to strengthen RB's capacity to maintain its road network
by providing technical assistance, training and equipment.
C. Description
3.04      The project consists of:
(i)  the construction and improvement of the following main
roads to two-lane bituminous standards:
(a)  the Manzini - Mhkondvo River Road (32 km); and
(b)  the Big Bend - Nggwavuma River Road (32 km);
(ii) a program to strengthen road maintenance comprising:



- 14 -
(a)  consulting services to provide RB with technical
assistance and training, including training aids
and overseas training for counterparts; and
(b)  procurement of maintenance equipment and workshop
equipment and tools; and
(iii)  other consulting services for supervision of construction
of (i) above and detailed engineering of the Big Bend -
Nggwavuma River Road (32 km) (for which retroactive finan-
cing is proposed) and the Mafutseni - Mliba Road (33 km).
(i) Construction and Improvement of Main Roads
Manzini - Mhkondvo River Road
3.05      The road will extend from Manzini, the country's principal commercial
and industrial center, southward to the Mhkondvo River just past the town of
Sidvokodvo (see Map). The road improvement, which commences near Manzini,
will follow a new alignment, roughly along an existing district road in order
to avoid difficult terrain between Manzini and Sidvokodvo; it will join the
existing road in the valley of the Lusutfu River. Travel distance will be
shortened by about 4 km. The road will serve Sidvokodvo as well as a very
productive agricultural area through which it passes. Current traffic is
about 460 vpd which makes the road costly to maintain in its present unpaved
condition. The new road will have a double bituminous treated surface 6.7 m
wide. The initial design of the road pavement is for a period of 10 years,
after which the pavement would require strengthening with an asphaltic concrete
overlay. New bridges will replace two low-level bridges over the Lusutfu and
Mhkondvo Rivers, which are regularly flooded during the rainy season. The
proposed road design standards, given below, are appropriate for the forecast
traffic and are acceptable.

Pavement design is based on the number of passes of an equivalent 8 ton single
axle load. Although higher axle loads are permitted by law in the country,
the design method employed is satisfactory since it takes into account actual
axle loads on the project roads. Bridge design is based on the British
BS-153 HA loading. This is judged adequate.
Big Bend - Nggwavuma River Road
3.06      This road is a continuation of the Helehele - Big Bend Road nearing
completion under the Second Highway Project (Loan 1108-SW). It serves an
extensive irrigated area producing mainly sugarcane, and provides access to a
sugar mill in Big Bend. Traversing gently rolling country, the road ends at
the Nggwavuma River where a new bridge will be built to serve a small irri-
gated area also growing sugarcane; the old bridge can accommodate only single
lane traffic and is unsafe due to damaged steel girders. Current traffic is
about 350 vpd, 27% of which are heavy trucks; paving of the road is overdue.
The new road, which will follow the existing alignment, will have a double
bituminous treated surface 6.7 m wide. Design standards will be the same as
those for the other project road (para. 3.05). The initial design of the road
pavement is for a period of 10 years, after which the pavement would require
strengthening with an asphaltic concrete overlay.
(ii) Strengthening Road Maintenance
3.07      Maintenance of unpaved roads, which comprise about 90% of the road
network, is generally below acceptable standards mainly because of inadequate
staffing, lack of training, insufficient equipment and poor workshop facili-
ties. Although paved roads were constructed fairly recently and are in
relatively good repair, adequate provisions should also be made for their
maintenance. RB already has a viable road maintenance organization, and
the project's purpose is to improve the efficiency of its operations by
providing:
-    technical assistance and training, including training
aids and overseas training of counterparts;
-    road maintenance equipment and workshop equipment and tools.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.08      The technical assistance included in the project for a three-year
period (1979-81) will consist of one training officer, two district engineers
to supervise road maintenance and provide on-the-job training, two clerks of
works to work and provide on-the-job training in the gravel and bitumen units,
and one instructor for equipment operators and drivers. The consultants would
strengthen the staffing of RB's maintenance districts as well as the gravel
and bitumen units, and assist RB in implementing the training program described
above (paras. 2.13-2.14) and found satisfactory by the Bank. Altogether,
about 168 man-months of consulting services are involved, including assis-
tance to SCOT to organize and conduct courses for 30 highway technicians.



- 16 -
Government anticipates no difficulties in recruiting trainees and has agreed
that about 30 qualified candidates will be recruited for training as highway
technicians, not later than July 1, 1979. The consultants will also conduct
seminars and short courses for supervisors, operators and drivers. Their
services will include the establishment of an RB training uniit and the supply
and installation of training aids (films and slides) and equipment (projectors
and cassette players). About half the consultants' time would be devoted to
training.  Terms of reference for the technical assistance and training are
included in the project file (Annex 2, No. 6). Government has agreed that
suitably qualified consultants will be employed under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank.
3.09      No Swazi engineers are available to serve as counterparts to the
consultants and therefore counterpart requirements will be limited to one
training officer who need not be an engineer and one equipment operator/driver
instructor. Government is not expected to have difficulties in recruiting
for these two positions. Training of the two counterparts will include six
months of courses in instruction techniques abroad. Future training of sub-
professional staff will be provided by the RB training unit with the assist-
ance of its expatriate engineers using materials supplied byr the consultants;
the numbers involved will be small. Government has agreed that by April 1,
1979 it will (i) establish two posts of training officer and instructor of
equipment operators and drivers within RB and (ii) recruit two Swazi counter-
parts to fill these positions.
Maintenance Equipment and Workshop Equipment and Tools
3.10      Road maintenance also suffers from insufficient equipment and
vehicles and poor facilities to service and maintain these items in good
repair. The existing equipment and vehicles assigned to RB were reviewed in
relation to road maintenance requirements estimated by ORT. Procurement of
the supplementary equipment and vehicles needed to meet these requirements
will be financed under the project; details of the equipment and foreign
exchange costs are given below:

3.11      Existing CTO workshop facilities are inadequate, and the main work-
shop is not well located to service and repair the expanding fleet of equip-
ment and vehicles. Under a CTO program, the base workshop at Mbabane will be
replaced by a new shop in Manzini, and area workshops at Mbabane, Piggs Peak,
Siteki and Nhlangano will be improved. This program will be implemented with
the help of the British-financed technical assistance team. However, there is
no provision included in the CTO program for the procurement of workshop equip-
ment and tools which are in short supply. Also, many existing measuring and
testing devices have to be discarded because of their doubtful accuracy and
the introduction of the metric system. Accordingly, US$300,000 has been pro-
vided in the project to meet the improved workshop requirements. Government
has submitted a detailed list of workshop equipment and tools together with
cost estimates, which are acceptable. The Government has taken steps to ac-
quire the site for the new base workshop at Manzini and is expected to appoint
consultants shortly to carry out site investigations and detailed engineering



- 18 -
and to prepare final plans and a detailed program for the execution of the
works. The Government agreed that it will (i) not later than December 31, 1978
furnish to the Bank a program, satisfactory to the Bank, for the construction
and improvement of base and area workshop facilities and (ii) not later than
June 30, 1980, execute such program. In view of these improvements to CTO,
maintenance of RB vehicles and equipment is expected to be adequate.
(iii) Other Consulting Services
Construction Supervision
3.12      Consultants will supervise the construction and improvement of the
two project roads. Government has invited proposals from consultants to
supervise the construction of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road. Detailed
engineering for the road was carried out by consultants in 1975, but in view
of changes made in the original design following review by other consultants,
Government feels that it is not appropriate to ask the original consultants to
supervise construction. Government intends to engage Brian Colquhoun, Hugh
O'Donnell and Partners (UK) to supervise construction of the Big Bend-
Nggwavuma River Road; this firm was responsible for detailed engineering of
the road. Government has agreed that consultants will be employed under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Detailed Engineering
3.13      Big Bend - Nggwavuma River Road.  As stated (para. :3.01), Government
has engaged consultants to carry out detailed engineering of a north/south
road traversing the whole eastern corridor of the country from Lomahasha on
the Mozambique border via Maphiveni, Big Bend and Nsoko to LavTumisa on the
South African border. Detailed engineering is underway on the high priority
32 km section from Big Bend to the Nggwavuma River which has been selected
for upgrading under the proposed project. The qualifications, terms and
conditions of appointment of the consultants were reviewed and found satis-
factory, and the engineering work, including preparation of bid documents, was
completed in June 1978. It is recommended that the cost of the services for
the detailed engineering of this section, not exceeding US$120,000, be financed
retroactively.
3.14      Mafutseni-Mliba Road.  Improvement of this road was found technically
and economically feasible in the study undertaken by the University of Natal
in 1976/77. Detailed engineering will be carried out by consultants to be
appointed under the project; terms of reference are included in the project
file (Annex 2, No. 7). Government has agreed that suitably qualified consul-
tants will be employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
D. Cost Estimate
3.15      Total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$15.9
million with a foreign exchange component of US$12.2 million or 77%. Total
cost excluding taxes of about US$0.8 million or 5% is some US$15.1 million. A
breakdown of the costs (in mid-1978 prices) is shown below:

3.16      Consulting services will involve a total of about 405 man-months of
professional staff (including technicians) at an average cost of about US$4,500
per man-month inclusive. Costs are lower than in other East African countries
mainly because of facilities available in neighboring South Africa. The
manpower requirement for construction supervision is relatively large since
the two roads being constructed are in different parts of the country and
consequently require two supervisory teams. Technical assistance is also
crucial both to advise RB, since the country has no Swazi engineers, and to
train staff, since RB has no training capability. The table below gives
details of each service together with estimated costs:

3.17      Costs for procurement of equipment were estimated by consultants
and the mission on the basis of current prices in Swaziland and are found
reasonable.
3.18      Cost estimates for the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road were prepared by
consultants who completed detailed engineering studies in 1975. Unit prices
were based on an analysis of the cost of labor, materials, depreciation
and operations of equipment and contractor's overheads and profits, and were
adjusted to compare with bid prices for project roads under Loan 1108-SW and
other roads currently under construction. These estimates were revised
following a recent review of the design by other consultants and are found
reasonable. Unit prices for the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road are based on
final costs of the Helehele - Big Bend Road constructed under Loan 1108-SW and
on other recent contracts, and are reasonable. Final engineering quantities
were used in the calculation of cost estimates for both project roads.  The
estimated average construction cost per km (excluding contingencies) is about
US$134,000; this includes construction of major bridges over the Great Lusutfu,
Mhkondvo and Nggwavuma Rivers. There are no right-of-way costs as the road
alignments do not affect improvements for which compensation is required
under law.

E. Financing
3.19      The proposed Bank loan would finance US$11 million or 90% of the
project's foreign exchange component, estimated at US$12.2 million. Govern-
ment has agreed to finance foreign costs of US$1.2 million and local costs,
estimated at US$3.7 million.
F. Implementation
3.20      RB would have overall responsibility for the execution of the
project. CTO will assist in the procurement of road maintenance equipment
and workshop equipment and tools. The project will be executed over a three-
year period beginning in January 1979. An implementation schedule (Chart 3),
progress reporting requirements (Annex 1) and the submission of a completion
report within six months of project termination, in a form satisfactory to
the Bank, were discussed and agreed with Government.
G. Procurement
3.21      All procurement will be carried out by the Government, and the
proposed arrangements are satisfactory to the Bank. Construction of the two
project roads, expected to cost about US$9 million, will be executed under
unit price contracts awarded to prequalified contractors on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's Guide-
lines for Procurement. Road maintenance equipment and workshop equipment
and tools including spares, amounting to about US$1.9 million, would also be
procured under ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Procurement of off-
the-shelf items under US$15,000 each may follow normal Government procurement
procedures and conditions which are acceptable to the Bank; the total amount
of such purchases should not exceed US$100,000. Assurances to this effect
were obtained from Government. Suitably qualified consultants for technical
assistance, construction supervision and the engineering study will be
employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
H. Disbursements
3.22      Disbursements from the loan account will be made to meet part of the
foreign costs on the basis of: (i) 55% of total costs of civil works; (ii)
100% of foreign expenditures or 90% of local expenditures for equipment, tools
and spares; and (iii) 100% of the foreign expenditures or 90% of local expendi-
tures for consulting services. Following is the estimated schedule of dis-
bursements:

I. Environmental Aspects
3.23      The project is expected to have no significant adverse ecological
effects. On the contrary, the improved and better maintained roads will have
more efficient drainage facilities than the existing roads and therefore less
damage will occur in the areas around the roads. Dust will also be considerably
reduced on roads to be paved, thus improving visibility, safety and comfort.
Wider and well constructed shoulders on improved roads will also contribute to
road safety. The roads to be built will largely follow existing alignments,
thus minimizing disturbances to property and persons.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The project will provide significant benefits to diverse groups over
a wide geographic area of Swaziland.  The two roads to be constructed, both
major links in the national road system, are high on the Government's list of
road development priorities. Their improvement will contribute to Swaziland's
principal transport aims of reducing transport costs and aiding development
(para. 1.11). The Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road serves not only the internal
needs of an important area of commercial agriculture but also the needs of
through traffic between the border station at Lavumisa and areas north and
west of Big Bend. Cost of construction and related supervision of this road
accounts for about 31% of the total project costs, and is expected to yield a
23% economic rate of return. Similarly, the Manzini - Mhkondvo River Road
directly serves a relatively productive district and is also an important link
in the transport artery between the central and southern areas of the country.
Construction and related supervision costs of this road amount to about 37% of
total project costs, with an expected economic rate of return of 23%. The
project component aimed at strengthening RB's capability to maintain the road
network will result in widespread benefits in terms of savings in transport
costs. This component, about 23% of project costs, should yield an economic
rate of return of 32% and have a cost-benefit ratio of 1:1.46. In addition,
the project is expected to have a number of benefits, the value of which
cannot be quantified. The project's overall economic rate of return on
quantified components (90% of total costs) is about 25%, and the first year
rate of return is 23%. All the above rates of return reflect benefits to
Swaziland alone and exclude benefits to foreigners, which are discussed in
para. 4.03.
4.02      Although traffic generated by the project is not expected to be
large, the two major road improvements and the better maintained network will
improve access for agriculture and are expected to have some favorable impact
on agricultural development. In the case of the roads to be constructed,
avoided road maintenance costs are also a benefit but net savings in such
costs are relatively small. Unquantified benefits from the project include
improved access to schools, health centers and administrative facilities as
well as greater safety and comfort of passengers and savings of transport
time.
4.03      The main beneficiaries of the project will be the direct road
users but benefits will be widely distributed among consumers, traders and
producers, including small farmers. There is substantial competition among
operators of commercial vehicles which results in savings in vehicle operat-
ing costs being reflected in lower product prices or passenger fares. While
the Swaziland Sugar Milling Company in Big Bend, which is about 50% owned



- 24 -
by foreign interests and 50% owned by the Swazi Nation, 1/ will benefit from
improvement of the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road through reduced transport
costs, the Government obtains substantial revenues through a special levy on
sugar exports. In addition, increased company revenues attributable to the
project are subject to a company income tax of 37.5%, which is collected by
the Government. The residual benefits are shared by the domestic and foreign
owners of the sugar company. In the end, foreign benefic:Laries will receive
only about 10% of the total transport cost savings resultiLng from the Big
Bend-Nggwavuma River Road improvement.
B. Area of Influence of Project
4.04      The area served by the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road (covering
approximately 450 sq km) produces about 520,000 tons of sugarcane annually
or nearly half of Swaziland's total cane production. The cane is hauled by
truck from producing areas lying between Big Bend and the Nggwavuma River
to a mill in Big Bend for processing. Although the new rail link is being
built in the general area (see Map), the transport of sugarcane by truck is
expected to continue. Large and small sugar planters in the Nsoko area (near
the Nggwavuma River) were recently granted an increased production quota which
will result in deliveries of an additional 70,000 to 100,000 tons of cane each
year from 1977 to 1980. Other products of the area served by the Big Bend-
Nggwavuma River Road are cattle and maize which are produced by both large and
small-scale farmers largely for domestic consumption.
4.05      The service area of the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road (covering about
500 sq km) produces mostly maize, cotton, potatoes and livestock. According
to the Ministry of Agriculture, the agricultural potential along much of the
road is good. The northern terminus of the road, Manzini, is the country's
largest and most rapidly growing urban center with about 30,000 population; it
also contains the Matsapha industrial park containing a variety of industries
which include a fertilizer plant, cotton ginnery, brewery and other plants.
Sidvokodvo, near the southern end of the road, is a small mnarketing and
railway center on the Lusutfu River.
4.06      The entire road system of Swaziland will be affected by the increased
capability for road maintenance resulting from the maintenaLnce component of
the project. Therefore, the economy of the whole nation will be favorably
influenced by this project element.
C. Economic Analysis
4.07      The basis for the economic analysis of the civil works component,
set out below, is an assessment of costs and benefits with and without the

proposed road construction to paved standards (para. 4.15), over 20 years,
the estimated economic life of the improved roads. The investment cost is
taken as the net of tax cost of the improvement including supervision and
physical contingencies. The quantified benefits are savings in vehicle
operating costs and road maintenance costs. The estimates show the proposed
investment in the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road and Manzini-Mhkondvo River
Road to be economically sound, both yielding economic returns of 23%.
Each road has a first year return above 10% when using a 10% discount rate.
Road Construction and Supervision
4.08      Costs.  The economic costs are taken to be the estimated net of tax
cost of the road construction, including supervision and a 10% physical
contingency.

Routine (Annual)                    0.020              0.020            0.040
Periodic (every 5-6 years)          0.192              0.192            0.384
These costs of routine and periodic maintenance would be somewhat lower than
those projected for the existing facilities, amounting to EO.046 million
annually for routine maintenance and an average of EO.397 million per year
for periodic maintenance.  In addition to these recurrent costs, an amount of
E 0.394 million would be required for strengthening of the pavement at the end
of the first 10 years of the road life.
4.10      Vehicle Operating Cost Savings.  Savings in vehicle operating costs
(voc) which constitute the principal benefit from the project roads, are
based on estimated vehicles per day (para. 4.12), annual rates of traffic
growth, voc on existing and new roads (para. 4.13) and the difference in
length of the existing and new roads. For the opening year these savings are
estimated at E 686,000 for the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road and E 731,000

for the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road. For subsequent years, the benefits in
this category were estimated by using the opening year benefits as a base and
applying traffic growth rates of 9% p.a. (1981-1990) and 8% p.a. (1990-2000),
which reflect expected traffic growth.
4.11      Traffic on Project Roads in 1976.  Traffic volume on the project
roads during 1970-76, according to traffic counts analyzed by the University
of Natal, increased at more than 15% p.a. on the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road
and 9% p.a. on the Manzini-Mhkondvo River Road; average daily traffic in 1976
was found to total 345 and 389, respectively, and is broken down by vehicle
category as follows:
Big Bend - Nggwavuma       Manzini - ]Mhkondvo

4.12     lTraffic on Project Roads in 1981.  Traffic in 1981 on the project
roads was estimated by the University of Natal taking into consideration
trends in traffic growth, projected economic development in the area of
influence, construction of the new rail link and some diversion of traffic
from the Manzini - Mankayane - Sicunusa Road to the Manzini - Mhkondvo River -
Mahamba Road. Following are the estimates of projected traffic for the 1981
opening year of the two roads:

4.13      VOC on Project Roads.  Economic voc for typical vehicles operating
on different classes of roads in Swaziland have been estimated by the Univer-
sity of Natal on the basis of data collected from vehicle operators, repair
shops and dealers in the area. These unit costs are reasonable and have been
used in the economic analysis; they have been adjusted upwards slightly to
reflect anticipated costs in June 1978 and thus place them on a comparable
basis with capital costs of the project components:

4.14              The anticipated reduction in unit voc, based on the improvement
of the project roads, is likely to be passed on to the shippers, passengers
and other transport users in the area because there is ample competition
among commercial vehicle operators and, consequently, individual operators
cannot fail to reflect cost savings in their rates and fares.
4.15              Cost/Benefit Stream.  The basis for the economic analysis of the
project roads is an assessment of the expected traffic costs and benefits with
and without the proposed construction over the economic life of the roads.
Cost and benefit streams are shown in the following table.

Strengthening Road Maintenance Capability
4.16      The economic analysis of the project's maintenance component, set
out below, is based on an assessment of costs and benefits with and without
the proposed strengthening of the Roads Branch's maintenance capability
over 7 years, the estimated life of equipment to be purchased. The invest-
ment cost is taken as the net of tax cost of the equipment and training
procured under the project component. The quantified benefits are savings
in vehicle operating costs. Estimates show the proposed investment in
strengthening highway maintenance to be economically sound, yielding a 32%
economic return, with a cost-benefit ratio of 1:1.46.
4.17      Costs.  The capital cost of the road maintenance component of
the project, exclusive of taxes and duties, as of June 1978, has been esti-
mated as follows for purposes of the economic analysis:
Cost
T-EnMillions)
Project Preparation                                    0.1
Consulting Services                                    0.6
Road Maintenance Equipment                             1.8
Workshop Equipment and Tools                           0.3
Improving Workshop Facilities                          0.8
Total                              3.6
A 10% physical contingency has been included in these costs.  Implementation
of the project component would require small increases for both equipment and
replacements (about E 130,000 p.a. in later years) and recurrent costs (about
E 225,000 p.a.) to cover costs of repairing the increased equipment fleet and
training, as illustrated below.
4.18      Vehicle Operating Cost Savings.  Savings in voc represent the main
benefit from the maintenance component. Voc savings are based on estimated
average levels of vehicles per day over various elements of the road network
and voc on different road types and conditions. For the year 1979, these
savings amount to E 332,000 (E 181,000 on gravel roads and E 151,000 on earth
roads). For subsequent years, the benefits would rise reflecting not only the
growing impact of equipment deliveries and expanded training on the effective-
ness of the maintenance forces but also growth in traffic estimated at 8% p.a.
over the 7-year period.
4.19      Traffic on the Road System.  On the basis of RB trafEfic counts on
selected roads, average daily traffic in 1976 was estimated al: 390 on paved
roads, 160 on gravel roads and 60 on earth roads. Future traffic levels,
derived from the present vehicle mix and growth rates (para. 2.03), are
expected to increase by about 8% p.a.

4.20        VOC on Project Roads.   Average economic voc for vehicles operating
on different classes of roads were derived on the basis of voc developed
by consultants (para 4.13) and the relative numbers of vehicles of various
types operating on each class of road as indicated in recent traffic counts.
The resulting weighted averages are as follows:

4.21        The expected reductions in average unit voc, based on the improved
maintenance attributable to the project component and consequent better
condition of roads, is likely to be passed on to shippers, passengers and
other transport users in Swaziland as a result of ample competition among
commercial firms.
4.22        Cost/Benefit Streams.   The economic analysis of the road maintenance
component is based on an assessment of the expected costs and benefits
with and without the proposed strengthening of road maintenance capability
over the economic life of the project inputs.   Cost and benefit streams are
given below.

D. Risks
4.23      In general the project is not regarded as subject to unusual risks;
nevertheless, there are risks which could affect the projected economic
returns. One of these is the possibility that the performance of CTO in
maintaining equipment for the Roads Branch may not be adequate to assure
reasonable availability of such equipment for road maintenance activities. It
is recognized that CTO performance in the past several years has been poor,
and improvements could be slow in realization; however, the competent British
technical assistance team of management and technical specialists installed
in CTO in 1977 has achieved notable progress in the initial period of their
3-year assignment.  Therefore, there is good reason to expect that CTO will be
put on a sound operating basis in the next few years. Another risk to suc-
cessful project implementation is the possibility that RB's training program
may not improve maintenance operations to the extent originally planned.
However, the road maintenance component has been found to have a high (32%)
economic return and the possibility of its falling to an unacceptably low
level is considered remote.
4.24      The principal risk relating to the project's civil works component
is that actual construction costs may exceed the estimated costs. Satisfactory
cost experience, however, in the nearly completed road construction financed
under the Second Highway Project, provides some basis for assigning a rather
low level of risk to this factor. Nonetheless, if the construction cost on
both roads increased by 25%, the economic return would still be acceptable at
19% for both the Big Bend-Nggwavuma River Road and the Manzini-Mhkondvo River
Road.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      Agreement was reached with the Government that:
(i) it will make SCOT's staff and facilities available for the
conduct of the three-year highway technician course, to
commence not later than July 1, 1979 (para. 2.14);
(ii) about 30 qualified candidates will be recruited for training as
highway technicians, not later than July 1, 1979 (para. 3.08);
(iii) suitably qualified consultants will be employed under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 3.08, 3.12,
and 3.14);
(iv)  it will by April 1, 1979 (a) establish two posts of training
officer and instructor of equipment operators and drivers
within RB and (b) recruit two Swazi counterparts to fEill these
positions (para. 3.09);



- 31 -
(v)  it will (a) not later than December 31, 1978 furnish to the Bank
a program, satisfactory to the Bank, for the construction and
improvement of base and area workshop facilities and (b) not later
than June 30, 1980, execute such program (para. 3.11);
(vi)  it will finance foreign costs of US$1.2 million and local
costs estimated at US$3.7 million (para. 3.19);
(vii)  the contracts for the supply of road maintenance equipment and
workshop equipment and tools will be awarded in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement except for off-the-
shelf items under $15,000 each, which may be awarded in accord-
ance with Government procurement procedures, the total amount
of such purchases not to exceed US$100,000 (para. 3.21).
5.02      An implementation schedule, progress reporting requirements and the
submission of a completion report within six months of project termination,
in a form satisfactory to the Bank, were also agreed with Government (para.
3.20).
5.03      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$11
million to the Kingdom of Swaziland, for 20 years including a 5-year grace
period.
