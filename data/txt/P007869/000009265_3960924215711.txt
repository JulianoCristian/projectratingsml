SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1736-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Paraguay Sixth
Highway Project for which Loan 1736-PA, in the amount of US$39.0 million. was
approved by the Board of Directors on June 21, 1979. The project was also
supported by US$7.9 million from Loan 2140-PA. The Loan was closed on June
30, 1985. In April 1986 US$3.7 million of loan funds were still undisbursed
because of the Government's decision not to carry out the feeder roads
component of the project and they were canceled.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports for Loan 1736-PA, the draft Appraisal Report for the
proposed First Rural Roads Project, final reports from the consultants
involved in the project, and an economic reevaluation of Route 6 carried out
by the Office of Coordination and Integral Planning of Transport (OCIPT).
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED. The draft
report was sent to the borrower for comments; however, none were received.

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1736-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Sixth Highway Project originally comprised two civil works
components: (a) the construction of a section of Route 6, between Pirapo and
Ciudad Presidente Stroessner (about 177 km) and (b) the construction of a
series of collector and feeder roads (about 500 km). The project also
included, inter alia, technical assistance for establishing and operating a
Feeder Roads Unit, for strengthening the Directorata General for Highways
capabilities, and for continuing the efforts started in previous Bank
financed projects to improve transport planning.
Construction of Route 6 was completed in February 1985 at a total
cost of US$63.4 million, 32% above the appraisal estimate. The additional
funding required by the substantial cost increase was met by supplemental
financing of US$7.6 million under loan 2140-PA (para 3.06). The economic
reevaluation confirms the viability of the road works with an estimated rate
of return of 15% (para 5.02).
Construction of the 500 km of feeder roads was not implemented.
The procurement process for the civil works had reached an advanced stage
(albeit with a three year delay) when the Government decided to stop
construction of all Bank financed feeder roads (para 3.09). Subsequently the
Borrower requested Bank approval for the use of loan funds for the
acquisition of equipment to carry out the feeder roads construction by force
account rather than by contract. The Bank did not agree to the Borrower's
request (paras 3.10 and 3.11).
Achievements under the project in the area of institutional
development have been few and, in general, confined to raising the awareness
among the technical staff in the Ministry of Public Works and Communications
about the advantages of following policies and practices based on efficiency
considerations. The Project Completion Report critically examines the
probable reasons for the minimal effect that the project had upon
institution-building and attributes it to the reluctance to accept change
among the top echelons of Government (para 6.02).
The report identifies the following lesson to be learned from the
project (para 7.02): The Bank should carefully assess the Borrower's
capacity to absorb institutional changes in order to design a project that
maximizes its effectiveness by being tailored to local perceptions and
needs. In particular:
(i) Given the reluctance of the Paraguayan authorities to large
bureaucracies and radical changes, the Bank should refrain from
advocating measures leading to an increase in the number of



- v -
Government agencies and/or the staffing of existing ones. Instead
the Bank should concentrate on strengthening staff capabilities
within the present organizational structure while paving the way
for very gradual institutional changes;
(ii)  the changes mentioned in (i) above should be promoted at two
different levels: the technical and the political. At the
technical level the Bank should continue to increase the awareness
of the benefits to be derived from new practices and procedures and
enhance the support for change from within the institution, At the
political level the Bank shottld engage in a meaningful dialogue
with senior Government officials in order to develop a positive
attitude toward institutional improvements; and
(iii)  the Bank should have a clear definition of which issues can be
addressed in the context of a project within a sector of the
economy and which require country-wide attention. Decisions
regarding civil service salaries are a case in point, since there
exist considerable difficulties for raising salaries in a
Government agency, in isolation from the Government's macroeconomic
policies.

SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (Loan 1736-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Republic of Paraguay, landlocked in the middle of South
America, has as its most important link to the sea the river system formed by
the Paraguay River, which flows north-south across the counrry to join the
Parana River at the border with Argentina.  Because of its primarily
high-volume/low-product-value based economy, Paraguay relies heavily for its
continued economic development upon its land transport system and the
connecting links to major ports in neighboring countries. Domestic traffic
is basically carried by the road network, while foreign trade is carried by
both river and road transport.
1.02      Paraguay's road network totals about 24,000 km, of which some 90%
are unpaved and susceptible to closure, because of rain, for up to 100 days
per year. About 2,000 km constitute the paved highway network; the rest are
dirt roads. The network as a whole provides a fair degree of access to most
populated areas of the country. Improvement of maintenance operations and of
the feeder roads system remain the two main issues to be addressed in the
subsector. Given the extent of the unpaved system, adequate maintenance is
critical, and improvements in this area are required to preserve the capital
investment and provide acceptable service standards. The rapid growth of
agricultural production and the expansion of cultivated acreage during the
last decade have enhanced the need for better designed and maintained feeder
roads.
1.03      The Bank has been involved in Paraguay's highway subsector since
1951, when equipment to build feeder roads was financed as part of an
agricultural project. Since 1961, seven highway projects have been approved
(total lending operations of about US$149.0 million). When the ongoing
projects are completed, these operations will have resulted in the upgrading
or strengthening of about 1,400 km of primary roads, Some work will also
have been done towards the improvement of the Ministry of Public Works and
Communications (MOPC) highway management capability even though the
institution still remains weak through staff shortages.   In addition, four
rural development projects have provided about US$16.0 million for
improvement and maintenance of about 1,500 km of feeder roads.
1.04      This Completion Report is based on information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports for Loan 1736-PA, the Draft Appraisal Report for the
proposed First Rural Roads Projects, and final reports from the consultants
involved in the project, and an economic reevaluation of Route 6 carried out
by the Office of Coordination and Integral Planning of Transport (OCIPT).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The Sixth Highway Project was designed with the objective of
assisting the Government in: (a) providing a road infrastructure to support
the rapid agricultural development that was taking place in the southern
Alto Parana and Itapua regions; (b) improving the Government's capacity to
meet increasing requirements for rural roads and developing better methods
for the design, construction and maintenance of such roads; and    (c)
pursuing the objectives of the previous Bank-financed projects for improving
transport sector management.
2.02      The main civil work element of the project was the construction of
a section of Route 6, between Pirapo and Ciudad Presidente Stroessner, to
complete the third side of a triangle formed by the cities of Asuncion,
Encarnacion and Ciudad Presidente Stroessner (Map IBRD 19712). Within this
triangle lies the mDst developed area of the country, where mDst economic
activity is centered.  The detailed engineering of the Route 6 component was
prepared in 1977-78 by Brazilian consultants, through intergovernmental
financing arrangements between Brazil and Paraguay.  The feasibility study
for Route 6 and the complementary feeder road program (para 2.04) was carried
out late in 1978 by OCIPT and its Paraguayan-Argentinian consultants under
financing provided by Loan 1529-PA and Credit 587-PA. Later during the
project preparation period, the Government and the Bank agreed that some of
the design standards could be mDdified to reduce costs without affecting the
basic characteristics and safety of the road. Accordingly, a reassessment
was carried out jointly by officials f-om MOPC's Directorate General for
Highways (DGV), the Brazilian design consultants and the Paraguayan-
Argentinian feasibility study consultants, resulting in a reduction of the
construction cost of about 20%.
2.03      Originally the project was also to include the continuationi of
upgrading of a section of road to the North of Tacuaral/. However, the
supporting studies could not be completed in time for the scheduled
appraisal and this component was deleted from the project. The section was
later included in the Seventh Highway Project (Loan 2140-PA).
2.04      The project also included construction of a series of collector and
feeder roads (about 500 km) more or less transverse to Route 6. The
preliminary location, length, design standards and cost estimates of these
feeder roads were prepared by the already mentioned Paraguayan-Argentinian
joint venture of consulting firms on the basis of field surveys. The project
provided for the financing of subsequent simplified engineering studies to
define alignments, and prepare cost estimates and bidding documents.
2.05      In the area of institution building, the project was to address two
major objectives; one, the improvement of the planning, construction and
supervision of construction of feeder roads through the establishment of a
Feeder Road Unit (FRU) in DGV; and two, solution of the staffing problems
within MOPC. These problems were thought at the time to be the result of
competition for skilled professionals from the construction of major
hydroelectric works being carried out in Paraguay; they were dealt with, as
in previous Bank-financed projects, through provisions for hiring expatriate
1/  Construction   . ne Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara Road was included in the Fifth
Highway Project (Loan 1529-PA). At the time of preparation of the Sixth
Highway Project, construction of this road had not started.

and local consultants and for topping-up salaries of MOPC counterpart staff.
These interim measures included the continuation, through consultants, of
technical assistance to OCIPT for transport planning and the strengthening,
also through local and foreign consultants, of DGV.
2.06      In addition to the already mentioned components, the project
included funds for the design and construction of a major bridge on Route 6,
the purchase of vehicles and office equipment for DGV, and a study on the
availability of local materials for road construction and maintenance.
2.07      Negotiations were conducted in Washington between May 14 and May
18, 1979. By then, the Borrower had secured a commercial loan from Lloyds
Bank International (LBI) for US$7.0 million, US$3.5 million of Which was
destined to cover foreign exchange requirements s.ad the balance to cover any
local costs. These funds, together with an increase of the Bank loan to
US$39.0 million, were estimated to be sufficient to cover the foreign
exchange component of the project.
2.08      The Board of Executive Directors approved the loan amounting to
US$39.0 million on June 21, 1979. The approved project elements and their
estimated costs, as given in the appraisal report, are shown on the following
page.
2.09      All project elements were expected to be completed by December 31,
1984.

(177 kin)-
(i) Start up-period
3.01      For bidding purposes, works on the project section of Route 6 were
divided into two lots: the Southern section (77 km) and the Northern section
(100 km). The bidding process for the Southern section started shortly after
loan signature. However, as agreed during negotiations and reflected in the
loan agreement, bids for the Northern section were invited only after the
design of the bridge over the Monday River had been completed. In addition,
it was agreed that the contractor for construction of the Southern section
would be invited not to bid for the other section.2/
3.02      The contract for construction of the Southern Section was awarded
to the lowest bidder, a joint venture of one Spanish and two Paraguayan
firms. The contract was signed on July 24, 1980 at a price of US$16,948,644
equivalent, an amount of the same order as the appraisal base cost estimate
plus contingencies. The contractor commenced work in November 1980.
3.03      The contract for the engineering design of the bridge over the
Monday River, for an amount of US$70,000, was awarded to the same Brazilian
consultant who had prepared the engineering for Route 6. The design of the
2/ Project supervision reports repeatedly indicate that this procurement
procedures, although conflicting with Bank guidelines, was agreed during
negotiations. However, no records to this effect are available. The
contractor for the construction of the Southern section did not
participate in the bidding process for the Northern section.

bridge was completed in mid-1979, and in August 1980, bids were opened for
the construction of the Northern section, including the 150 m long bridge
over the Monday River. The lowest bid, amounting to US$33,530,000 equivalent
was submitted by a joint venture of four firms, one Spanish, two Paraguayans
and one Argentinian. Since the base bid price was about 50% above the
appraisal estimate, the Bank suggested a review of the bill of quantities to
determine items where savings could be obtained. However, DGV did not
consider advisable to further reduce design standards (which had already been
significantly reduced at appraisal) in order to fit the lower appraisal cost
estimate. The Bank then agreed to MOPC proceeding to award the contract to
the lowest bidder as evaluated, rightly acknowledging that, eventually, the
financing plan for the project would have to be revised. The contract was
signed on November 1980 and work started in January 1981.
(ii) Civil Works Implementation
3.04      Construction of the Southern Section of Route 6 suffered major
implementation delays during the first two years, because of the contractor's
inadequate resources both in manpower and equipment, heavy rains and changes
in pavement design which required additional work. The latter were largely
on account of problems encountered in lime stabilization of the subgrade
until the Government and the Bank agreed, following the advice of a Brazilian
expert, to use the natural sub-base and compensate by strengthening the upper
layers of the pavement structure. A revised construction schedule, set up by
DGV in early 1983, aimed at the completion of construction work by July
1984. Notwithstanding a substantial improvement in the contractor's physical
and managerial capabilities, execution of the road works was once again
delayed due to an extreme shortage of local funds and the consequent delays
in payments to the contractor. Nevertheless, all works were finally
completed by February 1985 (i.e. eighteen months over the ortginally contract
completion date) at a total cost of US$26.4 million, or about 55% above the
basic contract value. About half of this increase corresponded to additional
works resulting from deficient design and the other half to price escalation
adjustments over the five-year contract period.
3.05      Execution of the civil works on the Northern section of Route 6
suffered a fourteen-month implementation delay because of similar problems to
those mentioned for the Southern section (i.e. bad weather, the contractor's
lack of physical and managerial capabilities and a shortage of local funds).
Construction work was completed in February 1985 at a total cost of US$36.5
million, about 9% above the basic contract price. This increase corresponds
to price adjustments.
3.06      The total cost of the Pirapo-Presidente Stroessner Road was
US$63.43 million, 32% above the appraisal estimate. The additional funding
required by the substantial cost increase was met by supplemental financing
of US$7.6 million3/ under Loan 2140-PA, which was approved by the Bank's
Board of Directors on June 15, 1983.  The resources from Loan 2140-PA were
available because, following Bank advise, the Borrower implemented a new
policy regarding advance payments to both local and foreign contractors, and
partial payments in US dollars also to both local and foreign contractors;
these new arrangements resulted in a dramatic fall of unit prices in
3/ US$7.9 million were finally disbursed for Route 6 from the proceeds of
Loan 2140-PA. It should be noticed that the supplemental financing for
the construction of Route 6 was secured about three years before the
deletion from the project of the feeder roads component, which resulted
in the cancellation, in April 1986, of US$3.7 million of loan funds
(paras 3.09 and 4.11).

Paraguay, reducing the cost of civil works. This cost reduction, coupled
with a cofinancing arrangement for the Seventh Highway Project which provided
more resources than originally envisaged, freed funds from Loan 2140-PA which
were used to cover the financial gaps of the Fifth and the Sixth Highway
Projects.
3.07      Supervision of construction works on the Southern and Northern
sections of Route 6, was the responsibility of a joint venture of Paraguayan
and Brazilian consulting firms and of a joint venture of Paraguayan aad
Argentinian firms, respectively. The performance of the consultants in both
road sections was satisfactory. The total cost of construction supervision
of the Northern section was US$2.9 million, or about 8% of the cost of civil
works. In the case of the Southern section, the supervision cost was US$2.5
million, or 9% of the cost of civil works.
B.   Construction of about 500 km of Feeder Roads
3.08      This project component, which included the preparation of detailed
engineering, the corresponding civil works and supervision for the
construction of about 500 km of feeder roads to Route 6, was never fully
carried out. Almost three years of delays in carrying out tasks preparatory
to construction were explained by successive Bank missions as caused by
problems in establishing the Feeder Roads Unit (a condition for disbursement
of loan funds for the feeder roads component), MOPC's lethargy on the
selection of consultants and later, lack of counterpart funds.
3.09      By 1982, however, the newly established Feeder Roads Unit (FRU)
(para 3.14) had confirmed the feasibility of 419 km of feeder roads in the
area of influence of Route 6 and, in July 1982, a contract was awarded to a
Paraguayan firi to perform the engineering design.  This task was
satisfactorily completed in July 1983 at a total cost of US$716,000. Bids
for construction of the first tranche of feeder roads (about 125 km) were
received in July 5, 1984. However, when the award recommendations were
ready, the procurement process came to a standstill because of lack of
counterpart funds. This decision affected the execution of the subject
project, another Bank-financed project which provided financing for the
purchase of equipment for force account construction of feeder roads, and
projects financed by other multinational lending agencies.
3.10      In March 1985, the Minister of Public Works and Communications
agreed to proceed with construction of feeder roads but requested Bank
approval for the use of loan funds to buy equipment to allow MOPC to carry
out the feeder road construction by force account rather than by contract.
The Minister's proposal included an amendment to the Loan Agreement to permit
purchase of road equipment for construction by force account under DGV's
Maintenance Department, and the extension of the original loan closing date,
June 30, 1985, to December 1987, to permit the use of resources until
completion of the works.
3.11      The Bank, which had previously agreed with technical officials of
the Ministry on the inefficiencies inherent in force account construction of
feeder roads in Paraguay, did not accept MOPC's proposal. The reasons given
were: (a) low capability of the Maintenance Department; (b) past poor



- 7 -
experience in force account construction under Loans 1418-PA and 1674-PA,
caused mainly by shortages of fuel, operators and mechanics, and delays in
releasing budgeted resources; (c) lack of Feeder Road Unit staff for
monitoring the supervision work carried out by consultants; and (d) high cost
of construction by force account because of low utilization of construction
equipment. An exchange between the Borrower and the Bank ensued, each
reiterating its position. Meanwhile the loan closing date was approaching
and the Bank indicated to the Paraguayan Government its willingness to extend
that date if the works on the roads were to be carried out as stipulated in
the loan agreement i.e., by contract. On October 2, 1985, the Minister
informed the Bank that, since the Government was unable to allocate
counterpart resources to build the roads by contract, it had decided to carry
out construction of these roads by force account using only local resources,
as they became available. At the time of compiling this report, work on
feeder roads has not started.
C.   Institution Building Elements of the Project
(i) Establishment of a Feeder Road Unit
3.12       The establishment and permanent functioning of a Feeder Road Unit,
one of the two main institutional objectives of the project, recognized the
fundamental need to create an institution, within MOPC, with
direct responsibility for planning, constructing and maintaining rural
roads--a task that was expected to be undertaken in close cooperation with
several agencies involved in rural development.
3.13      During project preparation it was agreeu that FRU would be
established with the assistance of internationally and locally recruited
consultants, whose salaries would be financed under the loan. Since the
salaries for local consultants were to be competitive with those paid in
hydroelectric construction wirks, DGV expected to attract well qualified
individuals.
3.14      On June 30, 1980 proposals were received from three firms and,
after a delay of almost ten months caused by differences of opinion within
MOPC, a Paraguayan-Colombian joint venture of consulting firms was selected
to staff the Unit. While by January 1981 the staffing of FRU was almost
completed, it took two additional years to appoint a local deputy manager.
This was a key position, introduced to ensure continuity, since the appointee
would later become the head of the Unit (in-line MOPC staff), once the
consultants completed their assignment.
3.15      FRU was slow in starting its operation but nevertheless it
fulfilled its intended program. Among its accomplishments, FRU was
responsible for monitoring studies for a feeder road program in the Alto
Parana-Itapua region; for supervising feeder road construction within a
diversit; of Bank and non-Bank financed agricultural projects; for confirming
the priorities for engineering and works on the feeder roads included under
the subject project; and for producing documents related to; (i) simplified
geometric design for rural roads; (ii) the classifi.-ation of inventoried
roads and later updating of the inventory; and (iii) a proposal for the
organization and staffing of a Feeder Roads Dep?artment within MOPC to replace
the temporary FRU, including functions and responsibilities for programming,



-8-
construction and maintenance of rural roads. In addition, FRU prepared a
National Four-Year Feeder Road Program, the first phase of which was
appraised by the Bank, for possible financing, in early 1985.
3.16       FRU was temporarily attached to DGV and has, through its
consultants, set the basis for initiating a systematic approach to the
development of feeder roads. Based upon the Unit's experience,
recommendations made by consultants and discussions held between DGV and Bank
staff, agreement had been reached at the technical level on the need for the
creation, within DGV, of the Department for Rural Roads. These efforts did
not materialize however, when the support for feeder roads at the highest
political levels was withdrawn. Thus, today FRU exists nominally, staffed by
two engineers and some support staff who can hardly fulfill the intended
functions of the Unit.
(ii) Strengthening of the Staff of DGV
3.17      The project provided for the hiring of consultants to assist DGV in
meeting the extra demands that would be placed on the Ministry by the
construction of Route 6. In particular, two qualified civil engineers were
to be assigned to the office of the chief of the Engineering Department,
which overviews all highway construction works. It was also agreed with the
Borrower that these engineers might be called on to assist in the preparation
of highway design and specification standards.4/
3.18      This technical assistance started about two years later than
originally envisaged, in spite of the fact that DGV engaged in negotiations
with several possible candidates during that period. Finally an Argentinian
highway engineer was contracted in mid-1982. During the course of his
assignment, the consultant reviewed procurement actions for several ongoing
projects, supervised road construction works, prepared highway design
standards, etc. His performance was considered very good, and his contract
was extended until December 1985.
(iii) Technical Assistance to OCIPT
3.19      This project component was to continue the efforts to strengthen
sector planning initiated under the Fourth Highway Project and continued
under the Fifth Highway Project. Implementation of this technical assistance
was delayed because OCIPT was unable to fulfill the condition of disbursement
on this component, i.e., the hiring of three additional local transport
planning professionals satisfactory to the Bank. By late 1980, although one
position remained vacant, the Bank agreed that further progress was virtually
impossible and waived this condition. OCIPT thus was able to hire the
services of the same Paraguayan-Argentinian joint venture which had provided
advice to OCIPT under the previous projects.
3.20      The consultants were mobilized in January 1982 and completed their
contract in May 1983, at a total cost of US$295,320. The work produced
includes feasibility studies, monitoring and updating of the National
Transport Plan and other studies,
4/ This task was to be financed under the Fifth Highway Project (Ln. 1529-PA)
but consultants interested in such a small contract (six man-months) could
not be found.



- 9-
(iv) Survey of Road Materials
3.21      This project element was carried out by a Paraguayan firm and
satisfactorily completed in early 1983. The results obtained from this
investigation should be of c2onsiderable future benefit when design decisions
have to be made in connection with new road construction. The desirability
of extending and continuing the inventory was discussed with DGV authorities
who confirmed their intention to continue these activities as a permanent
task of the DGV's Engineering Department. This positive attitude and
determination may be dampened, however, by staff shortages.
D. Procurement of Vehicles and Office Equipment for DGV
3.22      The Ministry, because of austerity measures across the public
sector administration, decided not to implement this project component.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSFMENTS
4.01      A comparison of appraisal estimates and final costs is shown in
Table 1.  The final cost of the project was US$72.2 million, 10% over the
appraisal estimate. However, these costs are not readily comparable, since
some project elements were not implemented. A comparison of the appraisal
and actual costs of those project components that were carried out results in
a cost overrun of 26%. This is primarily due to a substantial cost
understimation at appraisal for the construction of Route 6.
4.02      Two reallocations of loan funds took place, as shown in Table 2.
The first reallocation was to cover the higher than expected foreign exchange
cost of the technical assistance to OCIPT resulting from an appraisal
understimation of the rate for foreign consultants fees in Paraguay. The
second reallocation was basically to increase the loan £vnds available for
the ongoing civil works on Route 6 and reduce the funds for the feeder roads
under the project because of the already discussed fall in unit prices in
Paraguay affecting later contracts and the reduction in the scope of the
feeder road component.
4.03      Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates from the start,
reflecting delays in the implementation of civil works on Route 6 and the
postponement and subsequent deletion of the construction of feeder roads
under the project (Table 3). The latter resulted in the cancellation, in
April 1986, of about US$3.7 million of loan funds.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The construction of Route 6 and related feeder roads was justified
at appraisal on the basis of quantifiable benefits derived from (a) agri-
cultural value added generated by the road (plus complementary agricultural
investments) and (b) reduced vehicle operating costs and time savings for
traffic not directly related to agricultural activities in the zone



- 10 -
influenced by the project roads. The appraisal estimated an economic rate of
return (ERR) on the investments of 18%.
5.02      The economic reevaluation for the construction of Route 6 was
based on a study carried out by OCIPT consultants following a methodology
similar to the one used In the appraisal. The analysis yielded an ERR of
15%, confirming the economic merit of the project. The lower than expected
return on the investments is mostly explained by a project economic cost 15%
above the originally envisaged and vehicle operating costs below appraisal
estimates (Table 4).
5.03      A comparison between the appraisal estimate and actual agricultural
production for 1983 5/ (Table 5) shows that the former was accurate in the
forecast of total tonnage produced, although with some differences in the
distribution among commodities. The projection used in the economic
reevaluation (Table 6) is made on the basis of surveys carried out by OCIPT
in six different areas within the area of influence of the road. Total
tonnage projected for each year is lower than that expected at appraisal
because the trend started in 1984 to switch from maize to soybean (which has
a lower yield in tons/ha but a higher unit value) is expected to continue.
5.(A      Appraisal and actual traffic projections for different road
sections are presented in Table 7. Only about 30% of this traffic is
considered to be non-agricultural related, serving as a basis for the
calculation of the benefits derived from savings in vehicle operating costs
and passengers time. Current projections are in general below those of the
appraisal because of changes in the transportation pattern that were not
originally foreseen. These changes mainly involve the use of silos along the
road and a heavier truck composition. Farm-silo transportation is carried
out by small trucks, while the silo-port section of the trip (which includes
Route 6) involves large trailer trucks.
5.05      Tables 8 and 9 present, respectively, the streams of benefits and
costs pertaining to the economic reevaluation. The ex-post evaluation
assumes that periodic surface treatments for the Northern section of the road
will take place in 1992, while for the Sourthern road sections periodic
maintenance works will be carried out in 1992. Complementary investments,
both in the appraisal and the ex-post evaluation, take into account the
technologicai changes in agricultural production brought about by the project
road and its effect on transport costs.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01      Achievements in institutional development have been few and, in
general, confined to rising the awareness among the technical staff in MOPC
about the advantages of following policies and practices based on efficiency
considerations. The resulting quest for improvements at the technical level
are, however, seldom supported at senior Government levels.
5/ The appraisal report presented the forecast of agricultural production
for 1983, 1987, and 1991 only. Thus, 1983 is the only year in which
actual and projected data can be readily compared. It should be noticed
that the area of influence of Route 6 experienced a substantial increase
in agricultural output by 1983 and that the project road, although
partially opened to traffic in 1984, contributed tA this development of
agricultural production.



- 11 -
6.02       In general, the main factor hampering institutional development is
the reluctance to accept change among the top echelons of Government.
Further, a limitation of administrative resources due to (a) a conscious
decision to avoid large bureaucracies and (b) a permanent distrust that
prevents top officials from delegating responsibilities enabling Government
agencies to adopt modern public administration practices.
6.03      Despite these attitudes there still is a measure of professional
ard technical competence in line ministries. However, the limited staff
resources of MOPC have been eroded in the mid and late seventies by the
construction of the very large Itaipu hydrolectric scheme, which Paraguay
shares with Brazil. The establishment of bi-national authorities for the
Itaipu dam and for another hydroelectric project with Argentina, provided
Paraguayan professionals with more attractive employment opportunities.
Salaries offered were three to five times those of Government positions and
most of the competent professionals available selected the alternative
provided by the hydroelectric projects. On the positive side, the local
construction industry was substantially strengthened by the hydro power
developments, acquiring the capability to compete on an equal standing with
foreign firms,
6.04      Several Bank projects for highways coincided with the construction
of the large hydroelectric projects. The Bank's view was that the situation
would be of limited duration and thus required interim solutions, These were
mostly in the form of infusions of technical issistance that, together with
different tools and instruments included in the legal documents to try to
ensure adequate permanent staffing of the different relevant Government
agencies, would permit the eventual phasing out of expatriate consultants.
6.05      As it turned out, once the extraordinary demand of the
hydroelectric projects for professional skills subsided, the staffing
situation in MOPC did not improve. Whereas university students had
previously used the Ministry as a springboard for access to the private
sector, in more recent times university students working as assistants in the
Ministry leave after receiving their degrees, because austerity measures
have placed a total freeze on hiring civil servants. The different agencies
in the subsector thus continue to operate short of staff,  helped along by
foreign consultants who carry out in-line tasks at a substantial cast to the
Paraguayan economy.
6.06 The Borrower's performance with respect to the obligations set forth in
the loan agreement was below expectations. Paragraphs 6.07 to 6,08 summarize
the most important covenants and the Borrower's efforts to comply with them.
6.07       Section 3.03(a) of the Loan Agreement obligated the Borrower to
establish and thereafter maintain within MOPC a Fee:der Road Unit and Sections
3.03(b) and (c) gave specific deadlines for achivving adequate staffirng of
the Unit. The Government, although with substantial delays, created the FRU
which, staffed with consultants, carried out its intended tasks. However,
the Banks objective of institution-building by making the Unit become an
integral and permanent part of the Ministry, was not attained. Today the
Unit exists only nominally.



- 12 -
6.08       Section 3.04 obligated the Borrower to create a Coordinating
Committee formed by representatives of the different Ministries and
Government agencies directly or indirectly involved in the construction and
maintenance of feeder roads. The Government complied with its obligation by
issuing a decreee creating the Committee. The Committee, however, never met.
6.09       Sections 3.05 and 3.06 of the Loan Agreement obligated the Borrower
to employ consultants for DVG and OCPIT; prepare and carry out a plan of
action for achieving competent permanent staffing in sufficient numbers for
DGV; and fill the vacancies in OCIPT and adjust OCIPT's salary levels in
order to enable it to attract suitably qualified personnel. The Borrower
only partially complied with these covenants. In the case of the requirement
to increase salaries in OCIPT, the Bank recognized the difficulty of
implementing such a policy for only one Government agency. As discussed
throughout the report, some vacancies were filled but understaffing of DGV
and OCIPT continues to be a pervasive problem in the transport sector.
6.10      In addition to the standard covenants related to road maintenance,
Section 4.05(b) of the Loan Agreement obligated the Borrower to ensure "a
systematic renewal of equipment by means of the establishment and operation
of a fund...with not less than the equivalent of US$1.3 million contributed
annually..." The Borrower understood that it was in compliance with the
covenant by simply having in its annual budget an adequate appropriation.
However, no real transfers were actually made to MOPC for the purpose of
equipment replacement.
6.11       On the brighter side, through the Borrower's limited compliance
with the obligations set forth in the legal documents some changes have been
introduced which may have some longer-term useful effects, even though they
were originally perceived as extraneous exercises which were acceptd only as
a means to secure financing for equipment and/or civil works. Examples of
the benefits from the long term involvement of the Bank in the Paraguayan
transport sector are:
(a)  the carrying out of a planning exercise based on multi-year
rolling investment programs presented to OCPIT by the different
agencies in charge of investments in the sector;
(b)  the dramatic reduction in the unit prices of road construction
brought about by the revision of the Ministry's contracting
policies;
(c)  the recognition, at least at the technical level, of the need for
strengthening and integrating the efforts to develop feeder roads.
In this context, it is worth mentioning the new awareness, again at
the technical level, of the true costs involved in the different
methods (force account and contracts) of constructing feeder roads;
(d) an emerging consciousness, again at the technical level of M0PC, of
the high cost involved in the present ad-hoc road maintenance
practices, which totally avoid periodic maintenance, favor a high
level of routine maintenance on paved sections of the network,



- 13 -
followed later by rehabilitation, and low to nil maintenance of
rural roads; and
(e) the improvements in DGV of the methods for monitoring road
construction implementation and quality control.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The project was successful in achieving its objective of supporting
the consolidation of agricultural production in the Itapua and Alto Parana
regions through the construction of the Pirapo-Presidente Stroessner road and
strengthening the staffing Lf OCPIT and DGV. However, the impact of the
project with respect to its main institutional objective, that related to
feeder roads, was below expectations.
7.02      The Bank's decision not to accept the Government's request to
implement the feeder roads component of the project by force account rather
than by contract was wise. This decision has been validated by the poor
experience with force account in other construction work under ongoing
Bank-financed projects, due to DGV's lack of financial and physical
capabilities.
7.03      Aside from the often reiterated conclusion that a strong Government
commitment toward the institution-building objectives of a project is a
necessary condition for the success of any effort on this account, the
project offers the following lesson: the Bank, incorporating past
experiences with a particular country, should carefully assess the Borrower's
capacity to absorb institutional changes in order to design a project with an
institutional component that, although not necessarily optimal, could
maximize its effectiveness by being tailored to local perceptions and needs.
In particular:
(i) Given the reluctance of the Paraguayan authorities to bureaucracies
and radical changes, the Bank should refrain from advocating
institutional improvement measures which could bring about
increases in the number of Government agencies and/or the staffing
of existing ones. Instead, future Bank projects should concentrate
on identifying, within the existing structures, the most adequate
form and recipients of technical assistance so as to strengthen
present capabilities while paving the way for very gradual
institutional changes. Also, the largest possible use should
continue to be made of private enterprise, to supplement
ministerial personnel and physical resources.
(ii)  The gradual institutional changes mentioned in (i) above should be
promoted at two different levels: the technical and the
political. At the technical level the Bank should continue to
facilitate the transfer of know-how, so as to increase the
awareness of the benefits to be derived from new practices and
procedures. This process will eventually result in the support for
change from within the institution. At the political level, the



- 14 -
Bank should pursue long-term institutional objectives in its
dialogue with senior Government officials, in order to develop a
positive and practical attitude toward institutional improvements.
The Bank should realistically acknowledge that these efforts may
extend over several projects.
(iii) The Sixth Highway Project did incorporate some of the past
experience in Paraguay. The project wisely turned away from the
previously used type of technical assistance provided by large
firms, which consisted in the implementation of ambitious schemes
in isolation from the mainstream of MOPC activities. Instead, the
project financed technical assistance provided by individuals who
were able to work in close association with their local
counterparts and, in the process, made a considerable contribution
to technology transfer. The project, however, was less successful
in its attempt to fully incorporate into DGV's organization a unit
responsible for the planning, construction and maintenance of
feeder roads. It is in this context in which the more gradual
approach already discussed could probably have achieved tangible
and sustainable results.
(iv) The unsuccessful attempts at improving the employment conditions of
MOPC staff suggest the need for a clear definition of which issues
can be addressed in the context of a discreet project within a
sector of the economy and which require country-wide attention.
Decisions regarding civil service salaries are a case in point.
There exist considerable difficulties for raising salaries in only
one Government agency, in isolation from the Government's
macroeconomic policies.

1/ Both the original and ex-post economic analysis take into consideration
technological changes in agricultural production brought about by the
project. These changes involve, in the first few years of the with
project case, investments in machinery above those expected if the project
had not been implemented. In later years, the outlays become below those
assumed for the without project case. Thus the change in sign of the
stream.
