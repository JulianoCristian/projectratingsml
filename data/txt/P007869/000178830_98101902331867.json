        the Government in (a) providing road infrastructure to\n            support the rapid agricultural development of the southern\n            Alto Parana and Itapua regions, in the hinterland of the\n            Parana river; (b) improving the Government's capacity\n            to meet increasing requirements for feeder and rural roads\n            and develop better methods for the design, construction and\n            maintenance of such roads; and (c) pursuing the objectives\n            of the Fifth Highway Project for improving transport sector\n            management. The primary highway and the complementary feeder\n            roads to be constructed under the project will support\n            future rural development efforts and will accelerate the\n            rate of expansion of the agricultural frontier along the\n            Parana river. Readily quantifiable benefits will be a\n            substantial reduction in transport costs, and an increase in\n            agricultural production in the area. The project will\n            contribute to institution-building within the Ministry of\n            Public Works and Communications: the feeder roads component\n            will provide overall support to agricultural programs, while\n            the OCIPT component will help improve transport planning\n            within the Ministry; DGV's staffing capabilities will\n            be improved to enhance the Ministry's effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
