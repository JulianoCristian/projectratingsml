management services,\n            by (i) providing medium and long-term loans for on-farm\n            investments in machinery and infrastructure and short-term\n            loans for incremental working capital and (ii) providing\n            improved management and technical services to the individual\n            farms and estates. The project includes management\n            assistance to be provided by the agricultural Finance\n            Company (AFC) and a private company, East African\n            Acceptances (EAA) with technical assistance also provided by\n            the Ministry of Agriculture. A large-scale farm study,\n            project evaluation and preparation of subsequent phases\n            would also be included. AFC would have specific\n            responsibility for project implementation."}, "docdt": "1975-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
