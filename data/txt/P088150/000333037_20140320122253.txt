F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
In line with the federal government’s goal to significantly strengthen governance and
accountability, reduce corruption and deliver services more effectively, the objectives of the
project were two-fold:
(i) to improve the federal government’s economic and financial management systems and
     processes; and
(ii) to firmly establish a reform process of the federal civil service to improve professionalism
     and the government’s ability to deliver services 2.

These were expected to build a broad framework for good governance and fight against
corruption; significant reduction in corruption over time through system-wide structural changes;
and help put the Federal Government of Nigeria’s (FGN) finances on a path of fiscal
sustainability and enhance efficiency in use of government resources.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
During the restructuring of April 2009, the original PDO was replaced by a revised PDO as
follows:
“Improvement of the federal government’s administrative, financial, human resource and
statistical systems” 3.


a. PDO Indicators
Originally, the PAD had two Outcome Indicators (OI). During restructuring in April 2009, the
PDO was revised and the two OIs were replaced by five “measurable Key Performance
Indicators (KPI)” to reflect the improvement in the administrative, financial, human resource and
statistical systems 4. The assessment below is based on the revised set of KPIs 5.

                 during the 7 year period 2006-12 was 2018 and the number of convictions

The Intermediate Outcome (or Results) Indicators (IRI) were amended during restructurings in
Apr 2009, Feb 2011 and Aug 2012 (the modifications in the indicators over the project life are
detailed in Annex 1). The final revised set of IRIs comprised of 17 indicators – 7, 5, 3 and 2
respectively for components 1, 2, 3 and 4. The analysis below is based on the revised set of IRIs
included in the Credit Agreement in August 2012 12.

                  Templates in some of the contracts reviewed. A circular mandating the use of
                  the NSBD has been issued. The Bank has adopted their use for procurements
                  by National Competitive Bidding in all Bank financed projects. MDAs

                 1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.      Since the appointment of a strongly reform minded economic team in July 2003, the
Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) had taken bold steps to begin to tackle the deep-seated
risks to macroeconomic and fiscal stability and to address key sources of economic inefficiency.
It implemented policies to strengthen economic management and to deal with weak governance
and corruption. Some of these were: reversing the strongly pro-cyclical nature of fiscal policy,
consolidating the budget function in a strengthened budget office, agreeing clear output targets
with key spending agencies to be delivered against their budget allocations, introducing greater
transparency in public expenditure management, eliminating subsidies benefiting better-off
population, putting in place better financial controls to achieve budget credibility and limit
accumulation of new expenditure arrears and stricter enforcement of “due process” in the award
of government contracts.

2.      These steps were critical for Nigeria’s macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability,
and for the government’s ability to deliver key services to Nigerians. The FGN recognized that
additional challenges remained and public expenditure management needed to be further
strengthened to - (i) build an integrated budget based on programs clearly linked to key
development objectives; (ii) ensure greater accountability from budget holders; (iii) allow greater
emphasis on budget outcomes and impact; and (iv) identify and address remaining sources of
leakage in budget execution in order to strengthen efficiency of public expenditures. This
required additional changes in policies and regulations, considerable modernization and
automation of current budget, financial management and procurement practices. The public
service needs to be completely overhauled to focus and streamline the mandate of government,
to re- professionalize staff, introduce accountability and incentives for good performance; and
enhance its capacity to deliver services.

3.       The key sources of weaknesses in the economic management and public sector
governance were identified to be: (a) complex political economy including challenges of being
an oil rich economy and concentration of decision making power; (b) government spread was too
thin characterized by considerable overlap of functions and concurrent responsibilities over
different government entities making it hard for the Federal Government to deliver desired
results and thus there was a need for greater coordination of roles and activities; (c) insufficient
accountability in government reflected in weak accountability from budget holders for the
stewardship of the funds allocated to them; and (d) de-skilled public services lacking
professionalism as the government had not invested in building and upgrading skills of its staff,
training institutes had run down and curriculum was less relevant and the current staffing
structure of the federal civil service was an inverted pyramid with large numbers of non-
professional staff at the lower grades and thin staffing at higher professional levels.

4.      FGN recognized the need for fundamental changes in the way government managed the
economy and this was reflected in the medium term reform and development agenda – the
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS). FGN recognized that
the areas of reform proposed in NEEDS were major and complex, extremely contentious and

                                                                                                 18
implementation was likely to be expensive. Hence, it decided to pursue a reform approach
that was selective, strategic and incremental and it wanted to put the most basic reforms
first and tackling “first things first”. For instance –

•     Establish an IT based financial management system to eventually move towards a Medium
      term Expenditure Framework
•     Test reform approaches in four pilots and then mainstream to the entire civil service based on
      the results

5.     Rationale for Bank Involvement: The PAD cited four key reasons for justifying Bank’s
involvement in Nigeria’s reform process:

(i)   the FGN had clearly and convincingly demonstrated its deep commitment to fundamental
      reform by putting together a reform program and initiated implementing bold reforms;
(ii) involvement of the Bank was expected to signal the support of the international community
      for reform providing reformers the confidence and backing needed to continue and sustain
      the difficult reforms to fight corruption, change the way that government worked and make
      a break with Nigeria’s difficult past;
(iii) the need for Bank’s experience and technical assistance to complement FGN’s effort to
      implement the first phase of reforms and to define future phases; and
(iv) Providing much needed financial assistance to help fund the costs of reform
      complementing FGNs own effort in putting considerable resources into funding these
      reforms.

ERGP was a major component of the Bank’s continuing dialogue and support to FGN for PFM/
Governance reforms at the Federal level, and contributed to the government moving forward
with its agenda.

6.      Project’s Contribution to higher level objectives: A full Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) was being prepared for delivery in FY 2005 based on NEEDS. Till the full CAS was
discussed and endorsed by the Bank Board, the guiding strategic document was a Joint Bank
Group Interim Strategy Update (JISU) and the assistance program for Nigeria for 2005-06
focused on three main pillars of JISU –
(i) improving governance;
(ii) promoting private sector led growth; and
(iii) expanding access to basic services through community driven activities to empower
      Nigerians to be part of their development.

The ERGP was to contribute primarily and most directly to the governance pillar to help
strengthen accountability, transparency and efficiency in key economic management processes
for budget, financial management and procurement including modernizing institutions, laying the
ground for deeper reforms and rolling out administrative reforms. The ERGP was also to
contribute to private sector led growth pillar by promoting sound, predictable and consistent
fiscal policy and financial management, and by creating a platform for a systematic attack on
corruption. A more efficient and focused public sector was expected to create opportunities for
growth of the private sector

                                                                                                  19
1.2    Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

7.      With the overall goal of FGN to significantly strengthen governance and accountability,
reduce corruption and deliver services more efficiently, the original Project Development
Objectives (PDO) of ERGP, according to the PAD (page 4), was to (i) improve the Federal
Government’s economic and financial management systems and processes; and (ii) to firmly
establish a reform process of the federal civil service to improve professionalism and the
government’s ability to deliver services.

8.       In the Development Credit Agreement, the PDO was slightly differently worded as “The
objectives of the Project are to: (i) improve the federal government’s economic and financial
management system; and (ii) launch the process of building an efficient and effective federal
civil service”. The ICR is based on the PDO definition in the Credit Agreement.

9.      The original key indicators to monitor the progress of achievement of these objectives
given in Annex 3 of the PAD (page 22) were:

(a) Basic financial, procurement and human resource system of governance are modernized; and

(b) Pilot MDA re-structuring plans have been implemented, other MDAs have joined reform
    process, and a strategy for reform of central management agencies and for mainstreaming
    reforms to the rest of the service has been approved by government.


1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
       and Reasons/Justifications

10.      The mid-term review of 2008 concluded that the original PDO was defined too broadly.
The Development Effectiveness Unit (AFTDE) also suggested changes to the indicator
framework. The Restructuring Paper in April 2009 reasoned that all activities under the project
could not be grouped under the term “economic and financial management systems” included in
the first part of the original PDO and that the objective of the second part was already covered
under the former. Therefore, during restructuring of April 2009, the original PDO was replaced
as follows: “Improvement of the federal government’s administrative, financial, human resource
and statistical systems”.

11.     The Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the Project was expanded and modified to
account for new agencies and activities through restructurings in April 2009, February 2011 and
August 2012 – indicators were added, dropped, amended and re-worded. The Restructuring
Papers provide the reasons/ justifications for the significant changes, for example i) making the
indicators clearer, more effective and attuned to the project’s interventions; ii) request by
implementing agencies to change the indicators being either beyond their control or not
measureable; iii) to introduce additional or more ambitious targets where the previous targets had
been achieved (assuming original closing date of Feb 2011); iv) designing indicators for
implementing agencies which had none.



                                                                                                 20
12.     The PDO indicators and results indicators as finally revised and adopted are listed in
section H of the Data Sheet and Annex 1summarizes the changes made to the indicators over the
project period and the reasons.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

13.      The project’s primary target beneficiaries were:

     The MDAs directly benefiting under the project as implementing agencies are listed in the
      Data Sheet with one MDA introduced during restructuring

     The MDAs benefiting from the project by way of pilots under Civil Service Reform
      component were: Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF), Federal Ministry of Information and
      Communications, Federal Capital Territory Administration(FCTA) and National Planning
      Commission(NPC) and the following were introduced during restructuring: Nigerian
      Copyright Commission (NCC), Investment and Securities Tribunal, Office of the Head of
      Service of the Federation, National Assembly, and the National Insurance Commission.

     MDAs benefiting by way of piloting of IPPIS were: Education, Information, Works, Finance
      and Budget Office, Foreign Affairs, and National Planning Commission

     MDAs benefiting by way of functional and process restructuring were under the Airport
      Reforms component that was included during restructuring: Nigeria Civil Aviation
      Authority, (NCAA), the Nigeria Airspace Management Authority (NAMA), and the Federal
      Aviation Authority (FAAN).

     Capacity augmentation of government staff was one of the major benefits that accrued under
      the project including the staff of the EFCC and NBS.

14.     Users of public services and the private sector were other institutions that were
expected to benefit from the project as secondary beneficiaries. The project benefited the
MDAs of FGN in terms of improved processes and capacity in the areas of administrative,
financial, human resource and statistical systems and modernizing the government institutions
through reforms in several areas laying the ground for deeper reforms. The objective was
improved accountability and transparency and capacity to deliver better services. Promoting
private sector led growth was also a benefit envisaged in terms of promoting sound, predictable
and consistent fiscal policy and financial management and creating a platform for systematic
attack on corruption.

1.5      Original Components

15.     ERGP was planned to provide support across five components. Components 1 and 4
aimed at achieving the first part of the original PDO (improve economic and financial
management systems and processes) and Components 2 and 3 served to accomplish the second
part of the original PDO (civil service reforms and better delivery of services). Component 5
provided for project execution and Monitoring and Evaluation (M &E).


                                                                                                  21
16.    Component 1 - Public Resource Management and Targeted Anti-Corruption Initiatives:
to support reforms of financial management and procurement policies and processes in parallel
with institutional strengthening of the key public sector management and procurement agencies,
and tax administration reforms. The key activities under this component were:

 modernize financial management and accountability arrangements
 streamline and modernize public sector procurement procedures
 modernize tax administration 28.
 support to targeted anti-corruption efforts

17.     Component 2 – Civil Services Administrative Reforms: to support progressive
transformation of the federal civil service through a combination of initial systemic reforms and
the restructuring, including downsizing of key agencies as pilots for a later broadening of
reforms. Key activities under this component are –

 Strengthening the newly established Bureau of Public Service Reforms
 Designing and implementing an integrated personnel and payroll system
 Reforming pilot MDAs through restructuring, enhancing work processes, and capacity building
 Carrying out diagnostic studies and dialogue on key service wide reforms
 Designing and implementing a Performance Improvement Facility

18.    Component 3 - Strengthening Pension Management and Accountability 29:to support
measures to improve the management and accountability of the pension system including the
following activities:

 Establishment a regulatory and supervisory framework for the pension system;
 Capacity building for the recently established National Pensions Commission;
 Development of an IT strategy and procurement of software applications and hardware;
 Conducting a full scale audit, reconciliation and actuarial valuation of pension entitlements for
  Federal Government employees and retirees, and development of a benefit arrears reduction
  strategy; and
 Public education on pension reform measures to improve management and accountability.

19.     Component 4 – Strengthening of Statistical and Statistical Capacity: to support the
following elements of the Master Plan for the National Statistical System which had the key
objective of strengthening the capacity of the national statistical system to generate reliable,
timely and relevant statistical data to support policy making and monitoring achievement of
Nigeria’s development objectives.

 Organizational and institutional development of the National Statistical System Training and
  re-professionalization of staff;
 Data Development

                                                                                                            22
 Provision of necessary infrastructure

20.     Component 5 – Project Management: To support the incremental operating costs of a
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) for overall
coordination of the project and of the Project Implementation Task Teams (PITT), and M&E of
project activities.

1.6     Revised Components

21.     After effectiveness of the project, FGN decided in April 2006 to fully fund the
component on Strengthening Pension Management and Accountability and based on the request
of FGN this component was dropped. To address the domestic air crashes in 2005 and early
2006, FGN requested the Bank to provide urgent support in the area of aviation safety. The Bank
fielded two air safety missions in Jan-Feb 2006 and accepted the request for funding by FGN. A
component - Airport Safety Reforms and Investments – was introduced as a component in place
of Pension reforms with the Federal Ministry of Aviation designated as the Implementing
Agency. The projects costs were re-allocated without any change in total cost and the Credit
Agreement was amended (March 30, 2006) to reflect these changes. Post-amendment the project
had the following components.

1 - Public Resource Management and Targeted Anti-Corruption Initiatives
2 – Civil Services Administrative Reforms
3 - Strengthening of Statistical and Statistical Capacity
4 – Airport Safety Reforms and Investments (described below)
5 – Project Management

22.     Brief description of the new component, as further amended on July 19, 2007, follows.

Component 4 – Airport Reforms and Investments: Support to airports safety reforms and
investments through provision of technical advisory services, carrying out works, acquisition of
goods and equipment, and facilitation of workshops and training. This included:

 Institutional assessment and audit of the aviation sector
 Functional and process reviews of the key agencies in aviation sector
 Development of restructuring plans
 Capacity building for Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority
 Construction of parameter fences and roads around Port Harcourt International and Abuja
  International Airport
 acquisition and installation of a virtual radar system to enhance total radar coverage of the
  Nigerian airspace 30
 acquisition and installation of four low level wind shear systems for the airports in Lagos, Port
  Harcourt and Kano 31

30
   This activity was introduced in March 2006 but subsequently dropped in July 2007 to be substituted by low level
wind shear systems
31
   This activity was introduced in July 2007 and according to the implementing agency was subsequently moved to
the Regional Aviation Project due to the cost of perimeter fencing being higher than estimated

                                                                                                                23
 Development of a safety management system for the Federal Aviation Authority32

1.7      Other Significant Changes

23.      The key changes, other than detailed in earlier sections, were as follows:

     An amendment in Credit Agreement in March 2006 introduced limited International Bidding
      as a method of procurement and provided for procurement of works; and another amendment
      in July 2006 reviewed the Bank’s prior review arrangements.

     Counterpart funding was eliminated and disbursement percentage changed to 100%
      retroactively and addition of a new category Works (through amendment of Credit
      Agreement in July 2007) –to eliminate the bottleneck of slow/delayed availability of
      counterpart funds due to the “bureaucratic procedures” of the budget office for processing,
      approving and releasing counterpart funds. This change was in line with changes to other
      projects in the Nigeria Portfolio at the time and was not particular to the ERGP.

     Reallocation of credit proceeds (January 2009, February 2011, August 2012) took place to
      provide more funds to good performing agencies from slow/non- disbursing agencies and to
      areas under the current priorities of FGN.

     Extension of Closing Date initially for 24 months in April 2009 (from February 28, 2011 to
      February 28, 2013) and then for 4 months to June 30, 2013 in January 2013 – to compensate
      for the initial delay in GIFMIS implementation and provide more time for completion of the
      activities.

     Introduction of new MDAs for piloting - the Nigerian Copyrights Commission and the
      National Assembly (February 2008) and the National Insurance Commission and Personnel
      Audit and Monitoring Department (January 2009) -to increase the coverage of reforms in
      more MDAs.

     Cancellation of credit of $ 8.2m or SDR 5.5 m. Follow- on operation being discussed with
      the federal government.

                   2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

•     Background Analysis

24.    The ERGP was a consolidation of the Nigeria Civil Service Renewal Project and the
Nigeria Statistical Capacity Development Project. It was also follow-on of the Economic
Management and Capacity Building Project as being “complementary and mutually reinforcing”.
At an early stage, the project was named “Civil Service Renewal Project” for an IDA financing

32
  According to the IA’s implementation completion report (June 2013), this activity was dropped as it was
internally funded by FAAN

                                                                                                            24
of $45 m, co-financing of $25 m and counterpart funding of $5 m. The objective of the civil
service reform was to build a better performing federal public service which is affordable,
properly resourced, well-structured and appropriately sized. It was proposed that the project had
three components – service wide systems reform; reforms in pilot ministries and agencies; and
support to EFCC. The project was subsequently scaled up by appraisal and the contours of the
final project were established.

25.     At the time of project design and preparation, FGN had taken steps to tackle the deep-
seated risks to macro-economic and fiscal stability, address key sources of economic
inefficiencies and deal with weak governance and also corruption. The country was on an
ambitious path of reforms aimed at strengthening macro management and improving PFM at the
federal level. This period also witnessed the debt write off and the introduction of the ECA. It
was therefore decided to follow a sequenced approach and take on the important activities first.
The Government requested a TA credit to support these reforms and in this context the ERGP
was an instrument for continuing the Bank’s support to the government on the PFM and
Governance agenda at the federal level. It was decided to adopt a decentralized rather than a top
down approach so as to empower the various implementing agencies to adopt reform measures
and approaches best suited to the ground to seek ownership, recognizing the difficult nature of
the reforms and mitigate likely resistance to reform measures.

•   Assessment of Project Design

26.     The PAD provides three reasons for selecting the project design for ERGP: one,
consistency with the Federal Government’s reform strategy and approach; two, providing
financing for critical upfront costs of reforms to ensure implementation; and three, following a
decentralized model for implementation by individual implementing agencies so that execution
of activities is not slowed down.

27.     On Institutional arrangements, the project avoided the “traditional approach of
creating isolated project implementation units” and instead aimed at integrating the project
into the regular operations of the respective agencies under the overall oversight of the Steering
Committee on Reforms. This resulted in engaging with a large number of implementing
agencies. A decentralized implementation structure was also chosen to reduce bureaucratic
delays.

28.     The project focused on “doing first things first and getting the very basics right”. So
for instance, GIFMIS implementation was scheduled to be taken up in the third year of the
project after considerable relevant capacity was built up. In the civil service reform component
there were pilots on organizational restructuring as also the implementation of the Integrated
Personnel and Payroll System (IPPIS) with a view to “help test some reform approaches and
provide lessons for mainstreaming to the entire civil service” and “later broadening of reforms”.
This approach proved successful as during implementation the number of pilot MDAs for
restructuring was increased from the original four to eleven.

29.   The project design put the responsibility of procurement on the respective Project
Implementation Task Teams (PITT) in line with the Project Implementation Manual and Bank

                                                                                                 25
guidelines. The procurement capacity assessment conducted as part of project preparation
identified lack of adequate experience in procurement in Bank financed projects. Measures to
mitigate this included engaging an experienced Procurement Consultant in PITTs that did not
have a Procurement Officer for a period of 1-2 years who was to build the capacity of the staff
including transfer of knowledge. The PCU was to have two Procurement Officers. Other
mitigating measures included adoption of the generic procurement manual of the Bank, training
in procurement and capacity building, and adoption of Bank’s bidding documents. The overall
project risk for procurement was assessed as High.

30.     The project also addressed the potential social impacts of the severance payments in
project design by providing funding for the separation costs and including activities to help
separated staff acquire basic skills to help them join the private sector. This included provide
training to separated staff for setting up micro enterprises in a few key areas.

31.     The Bank collaborated with the donor community and the project was co-financed by
DfID (about 13% of original project cost). DfID co-financing covered support to budget reform,
tax administration, civil service reforms, supporting reform of the statistical system, developing
Medium-Term Sector Strategies and facilitating severance. At project design itself, it was agreed
that DfID would assume supervision responsibilities with the Bank and this was documented in
the PAD.

   Adequacy of Government’s Commitment

32.     The most crucial element in a public sector reform program is strong ownership. One
expression of such ownership can be development of reform strategy by government itself (with
donors providing expertise in setting priorities) so that the country understands the reforms in its
own context resulting in higher commitment to self – defined priorities. The crucial aspect of
government ownership was addressed while developing the project design. All the project
components were drafted by the government agencies themselves in close collaboration with the
Bank team. Dialogue was established with “core agencies” playing a critical role in personnel
management. An integrated reform approach was followed by instituting reforms in civil service
parallel to other government institutional changes and establishing “the connection between civil
service management and the framework of controls and incentives embodied in the government’s
budget and financial management systems.”

•   Assessment of risks

33.     The ERGP was assessed as a high-risk project at the concept stage based on the
assessment that maintaining the status quo was beneficial to some stakeholders within and
external to civil service. This was mitigated by placing responsibility on the pilot ministries
themselves to lead reform instead of concentrating this in a lead agency. Another risk identified
was labor unrest expected from “rightsizing” the government. Mitigation measures were built in
project design through equitable and lawful separation programs and provision of severance
benefits into the project cost.




                                                                                                   26
34.     A sustainability aspect that was expressed in the PAD was that “the reform stance of
government that comes into office after elections in 2007 will determine whether these initial
reforms will be sustained and deepened”. The new government that came in power following the
elections in 2007 reiterated its commitment to reforms and embarked on an extensive process for
the development of reform strategies and sector action plans (Restructuring Paper 2009).

35.    Substantial risks in project implementation were identified in the PAD. These included
delays due to insufficient knowledge of Bank’s procurement procedures and the government’s
and PCU’s capacity to coordinate the “multi-faceted reform agenda” in view of the large number
of agencies and activities implemented at the same time. This was sought to be mitigated through
close monitoring by a Steering Committee on Reforms and a strong PCU, though during
implementation these bodies were not very effective.

2.2    Implementation

36.      The project had a slow start on account of some initial problems and by mid-term review
had disbursed only 31%. Given the deliberate choice to foster ownership of the reform agenda,
there were a large number of implementing agencies with varying capacities. This contributed to
a slow start delaying overall implementation and making project coordination more challenging.
Agencies such as NBS and EFCC showed considerable progress and fully exhausted their
allocations, thereby requiring additional funding, while others like the OAGF, the Budget Office
of the Federation and the FIRS got off to a late start. Engagement of procurement officers in the
agencies was a legal covenant prior to disbursement and this was useful to address the issues
faced during implementation.

37.     Project coordination was a challenge due to the large number of implementing agencies
while institutional mechanisms were absent or were weak at the beginning of the project.
Political oversight of project implementation was to be carried out by the technical arm of
the federal government’s Steering Committee on Reforms. However, this Committee was not
functional, and oversight of Project implementation was carried out only by the FMF through the
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). Frequent changes of the Project Manager of the PCU affected
oversight and weakened communications between PCU and the PETs and PITTs.

38.     Several corrective and adaptive restructurings were undertaken to act on the changing
circumstances during project implementation. Specifically, the Project was restructured to align
its contours with these changing circumstances and to provide more flexibility in its
implementation. The original Pension reforms component was replaced with a new Aviation
reforms Component, activities were dropped as the FGN intended to fund these from own
resources, procurement norms were eased, credit proceeds were re-allocated from slow-
disbursing agencies to agencies that required additional funding and additional MDAs were
added in the pilots. These efforts were made to respond to the demands of FGN and the
implementing agencies and to speed up the pace of project implementation.

39.     Disbursement was slow in the early stages but picked up later during project
implementation helped by re-allocation of funds and extension of project closing date by two
years. By the end of the grace period, the project had disbursed over 94% of the original credit
amount. The project had envisaged that the FGN will contribute $ 16.69 m of the total project

                                                                                                   27
cost of $ 179.23 m. However, till mid-2007, delayed availability of counterpart funds remained
a major constraint to project implementation. In 2007, the government requested for elimination
of the requirement of counterpart funding due to difficulties in providing funds and in line with
the then country financing parameters; this was accepted by the Bank. . The project cost was also
reduced mainly under the Severance Pay category 33 and the disbursement percentage was
increased to 100% across all categories.

40.     The mid-term review identified issues in implementation and recommended adjustments
to the project. These primarily related to revision to the M & E framework, reallocation of funds
from slow-disbursing agencies to those that made good progress, engaging M & E specialist for
adequate monitoring of progress and procurement advisors to help in the area of project
management and procurement.

41.      The project benefited from a strong co-financing partner, Department for
International Development (DfID), UK, provided a co-financing grant of GBP 14.3 mn in 2006
covering support to budget reform, tax administration, civil service reforms and strengthening of
statistics. It therefore co-supported, along with the IDA, activities in the NBS, the Budget Office
of the Federation, and BPSR, and was instrumental in supporting reform of the statistical system,
developing Medium-Term Sector Strategies and facilitating severance. The DfID co-financing
grant closed in August 2010 with a disbursement ratio of about 90 %.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
        Overall Rating: Modest

     M & E Design

Pre – PDO restructuring

42.    The Results Framework in the PAD (Annex 3) comprised of two PDO (or Outcome)
Indicators and 19 IRIs. By the mid-term review in July 2008 it was clear that the results
framework needed changes in design to more adequately track performance and expand it to
agencies not covered by the original framework. Hence, the indicators were modified for
OAuGF and OAGF and new indicators introduced for FIRS, Aviation, IST, NCC and BPP.

Post - PDO restructuring

43.     The PDO was revised during restructuring of April 2009. The Restructuring Paper
reasoned that all activities under the project could not be grouped under the term “economic and
financial management systems” included in the first part of the original PDO and that the
objective of the second part of the PDO was already covered under the first part. This also
required changes in the results framework. Five measurable outcome indicators (key
performance indicators, KPIs) and 23 Intermediate Results Indicators (IRIs) were introduced.
The results framework was again amended in February 2011 and August 2012.


33
  Due to reduced requirement, and also the government decided to fund the Severance Pay from own budget for the
remaining useful life of the project (Restructuring Paper January 2009)

                                                                                                            28
44.     The scope of the project expanded over time and newer agencies were added. This made
it imperative to construct a stable Results Framework and this was indicative of the response of
the Bank to changing needs. However, key M&E design issues were noticed while going through
the wording of various indicators, and in some cases baseline data and targets were not available.
The evolution of the design of the indicators weaknesses is summarized in Annex 1.

      Implementation

45.     Monitoring of results was a challenge in part due to due to non- availability of data and in
part due to the baseline being unclear. The PCU in the Multilateral Institutions Department 34 of
FMF was responsible for monitoring and evaluation on an ongoing basis in accordance with the
agreed indicators, relying on implementation reports and staff audits and surveys for reporting
the data. At mid-term review however, the Bank recommended engaging an M&E Specialist to
coordinate efforts of agencies to monitor progress and to provide the baseline to measure the
indicators. A few such studies were available at the close of the project. Supervision missions
also focused on defining or redefining the results framework and/or the modalities of collecting
the data and expressed concern over the availability and quality of data.

      Utilization or Use of Data

46.      The changes to the results framework and data issues limited the use of M&E data for
implementation and supervision. The Aide Memoire of the Supervision Mission, June, 2012
mentioned that the progress towards achievement of the PDO was difficult to rate appropriately
at that time because the project was still missing data for two critical project OIs and three IRIs
and consultancies to measure these indicators were yet to deliver the reports. Data on some
indicators was not available till almost a year before project closure (details in Annex 1).

47.     In summary, there were changes in the M & E design in addition to those done to adjust
the changes in the project contours. Some changes were introduced at the instance of the
implementing entities who thought some indicators were not appropriate, others were introduced
when previous indicators had achieved their targets and the project teams wanted to challenge
themselves to higher goals; while other changes were made on advice by the Bank’s M&E
specialist. The overall M & E quality is therefore rated as Modest.

2.4       Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

      Environment

48.      The PAD noted that ERGP did not envisage funding any activity that could cause an
adverse effect on the environment as none of the project activities involved construction that may
have had an environmental impact. Hence, the project was classified as Category C. In 2006 the
project was restructured and a component on Aviation was included. This component had some
public works activities like perimeter fences and security patrol roads around the operational
areas of two airports, Port Harcourt and Abuja, to increase safety at airport infrastructure. These
activities were undertaken in an enclosed security zone that had neither human settlements nor

34
     Now the International Economic Relations Department.

                                                                                                  29
economic activities. Consequent to this restructuring, the environment category continued to be
retained at C and was not changed. This was discussed with the then Task Team Leader of the
project who confirmed that although an environmental assessment was not carried out during the
2006 project restructuring, the environmental safeguards and resettlement issues were discussed
within the task team and the implications of the public works activities under the Aviation
component were examined from a safeguards angle; consequent to this, it was decided to
maintain the safeguards category at C.

    Social

49.     One of the actions under ERGP was severance of staff and it was noted that “the surest
way to stem social impacts including social unrest from staff separation” was to ensure full
payment of staff entitlements and on time. This was mitigated through availability of funding
under the project, upgrading of staff basic skills to join the private sector or set up micro-
enterprises, developing a communication system and monitoring the social impacts through
tracer studies.

50.     The project resources were utilized for payment of benefits in the severance program
implemented in the Ministry of Finance. A similar program applied in the NBS earlier had to
reinstate many of the severed staff pursuant to appeals. However, in this severance program, a
study commissioned by the Ministry reported that about 64% of the severed staff started their
own business. 35

    Procurement

51.     Lack of familiarity with Bank procurement guidelines led to considerable difficulties in
project implementation in some agencies, especially FIRS and Federal Ministry of Aviation, and
the Federal Ministry of Information and Communication, who were not ready to apply the Bank
procurement rules to their activities. In some cases, procurement processes needed to re-start
from the beginning leading to substantial delays in project implementation. Procurement prior-
review rules were not clearly understood and even contracts for post-review were sent to the
Bank for its no objection.

52.      Nigeria country office procurement specialists provided close hands-on advice to project
staff to address the difficulties. Procurement norms were changed during the currency of the
project through amendments to the credit agreement and support of consultants was sought. A
significant outcome of the project was that the Bank adopted the use of the government NSBDs
finalized under ERGP for procurement in Bank financed projects under National Competitive
Bidding.

    Financial Management

53.    Overall, during implementation, the key FM issue was the inadequacy of submission of
Financial Management Reports (FMR) characterized by delays in submission incomplete

35
  Quick Projects Limited, Tracer Study on the Federal Civil Service Staff Severance and Social Assistance Program
(September 2012)

                                                                                                              30
information, earlier comments not adequately incorporated and quality of the reports were poor
resulting in several revisions before being acceptable. The FM team also undertook FM thematic
missions in early 2008 and April/May 2009 that identified issues such as ineligible expenditure,
unretired advances and lack of supporting documents. Consequently, the FM rating was
downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory in April 2008 and then upgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory in April 2009 except BPSR that was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. An in-depth
review of the OAuGF was done. The review recommended that “with immediate effect the Bank
suspends further disbursements and other project activities until a more representative and
effective PITT is in place”. Action was taken immediately with the reassignment of a former
Project Officer under a new project team. The response to settlement of the findings from FM
review was mixed with the resolution date often extended. At the time of the final
implementation support mission in June 2013, significant number of issues of unretired advances
and ineligible expenditure had been resolved while some are still awaiting resolution.

2.5     Post Completion Operation/Next Phase

54.     FGN is committed to continue the reforms under ERGP in the coming years. The design
of PFM reforms in Nigeria must seek to identify what, amongst the multiplicity of reform fronts,
the authorities consider as most critical to support the consolidation of reforms already achieved,
and against a phased timeframe. A dialogue is ongoing on the remaining PFM agenda and a new
operation is being discussed with the Federal Government to consolidate the activities carried out
under the ERGP, especially those related to GIFMIS, IPPIS and the statistical system.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The overall relevance of the project is rated Substantial in view of the “High” relevance of
objectives but “Modest” relevance for project design and implementation.

     Relevance of Objectives
      Overall Rating – High

55.      The priority of the Nigerian government in strengthening governance continues to be
relevant. The objectives of the ERGP remain relevant as it supported the key pillar of the
Nigerian government’s strategy of strengthening governance to help strengthen accountability,
transparency and efficiency in key economic management process for budget, financial
management and procurement including modernizing institutions, laying the ground for deeper
reforms and rolling out administrative reforms. The project also supported the government’s
efforts to strengthen the institutional and governance structures and to build up the capacity of its
staff besides bringing in much needed legislation and regulations in many areas. The project was
also consistent with the Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals as of
that time. The draft CPS for Nigeria FY 14-17 deepens the Banks previous support to
strengthening institutions and the broader governance environment in Nigeria. Governance
remains a cross cutting pillar of the CPS providing support i) to mainstreaming political
economy considerations and governance throughout the Banks portfolio and engagement and ii)
support to strengthening institutions, including in particular public financial management at

                                                                                                  31
Federal and State levels. The ERGP – and the expected follow-on project, the ERGP II – thus
continues to be relevant to the Bank CPS.

56.      ERGP objectives were also in line with the reform agenda of FGN contained in the
document “National Strategy for Public Sector Reform – Towards a World Class Public
Service”. This strategy sets out 4 main reform pillars for 2009-2020: Pillar 1 seeks an enabling
institutional and governance environment; Pillar 2 strives towards an enabling socio-economic
environment; Pillar 3 focuses on public financial management reform; and Pillar 4 is about civil
service administration reform. Pillars 1, 3 and 4 were directly relevant to the objectives of ERGP.

57.     The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (2010-13) focuses on improving Governance as
one of the themes to transform and diversify Nigeria’s economy. The emphasis was to support
FGN to strengthen its own systems over the long term. Governance, therefore, will be a core
and cross-cutting theme and virtually an integral part in every Bank supported operation in
Nigeria. Governance support was addressed in five areas: (i) transparency and accountability; (ii)
participation; (iii) sector governance; (iv) capacity development; and (v) judicial reform and
democratic governance. Similarly, Governance, including PFM reforms, is at the core of the
CPS for 2014-17. The PDO of ERGP, thus, continues to be relevant and consistent with the
Bank’s current CPS.

   Relevance of Design and Implementation
    Overall Rating: Modest

58.      The design of the project was relevant to the country circumstances and the nature and
scope of the project. FGN recognized that the areas of reform proposed in NEEDS were major
and complex, extremely contentious and implementation was likely to be expensive. Hence, it
decided to pursue a reform approach that was selective, strategic and incremental and it wanted
to put the most basic reforms first and tackling “first things first”. Scheduling of important
activities such as GIFMIS implementation was also done and collaboration with donor
community (DfID) and including intensive training and capacity building in all the components
proved fruitful. The project sought integration with the regular operations of implementing
agencies and hence went for a decentralized project management structure with responsibilities
to the implementing agencies., Although in the final count the agencies and activities were large
in number and content, yet this approach was essential to involve these agencies in direct
implementation of the project and in turn have ownership over the reforms, rather than
concentrating responsibility under a central body.

59.     Responsive restructurings during project implementation reflected the changing
circumstances and needs of the government and included (a) introduction of new
component/activities and dropping those not relevant or proposed to be funded from other
projects or through government‘s own resources; (b) re-allocation of funds between and within
components; and (c) easing procuring norms in view of the capacity constraints in implementing
agencies. The Bank was responsive to the changing needs and even after these changes, the
operation remained important to achieve the global development objective.




                                                                                                32
60.      However, the design of the Results Indicator Framework changed, including those
indicators that were not on account of changes in project contours. This affected the empirical
measurement of the project progress and achievement of results. Given the experience of some
indicators, it would have helped to have clearer linkages between the baselines, targets and
results.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
        Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     As discussed in the Data Sheet section, the project underwent a restructuring in 2009
during which the PDO was modified. The achievement of the PDOs, therefore, has been assessed
for both these phases – pre-restructuring and post-restructuring.

     Methodology followed in assessment of PDO and outcomes:

Pre Restructuring

62.     The original PDO was (i) to improve the federal government’s economic and financial
management system; and (ii) to launch the process of building an efficient and effective federal
civil service. This PDO applied to the period from April 24, 2005 (effectiveness) till April 15,
2009 (effective date of the restructuring). The aggregate disbursement up to this date was 39% of
the total credit. It was difficult to assess the achievement of the original (pre- restructuring)
PDOs based on the results indicator framework due to lack of data, as also the fact that the AM
of the March 2009 mission did not present the Results Indicator Table. Hence, the assessment
for the pre- restructuring phase has been done based on the overall achievements and
disbursements made up to April 15, 2009.

63.    The only outcome indicator that could be reviewed till the restructuring period was
implementation of IPPIS; this resulted in elimination of ghost workers and substantial savings to
the government. Other activities that were completed/underway were i) strengthening of
enforcement capacity of EFCC resulting in enhanced recovery of monetary assets, ii) adoption
and dissemination of nine additional accounting standards, iii) capacity building of NBS
improving quality and timeliness of statistical products resulting in up, iv) adoption of electronic
system for transaction recording as a precursor to GIFMIS, iv) setting up of the BPP and
enactment of public procurement law. The achievement of the PDO and the implementation
progress were rated Moderately Satisfactory by the task team. The overall efficacy of the
project prior to restructuring is therefore rated as Modest.

Post Restructuring

64.     In the April 2009 restructuring, the PDO was revised to Improvement of the federal
government’s administrative, financial, human resource and statistical systems. This was a very
broadly defined PDO which encompassed four distinct systems of the federal government. The
restructuring documentation did not provide any further break-up of the PDO into sub-
components or sub- PDOs or provide a mapping of the KPIs or IRIs to the PDOs/ sub- PDOs.
Therefore, in order to provide a more structured assessment of results, based on the
recommendations of the ICR review meeting of December 2013, the PDO has been broken down

                                                                                                  33
into 4 sub- PDOs (the administrative, financial, human resource and statistical systems of the
federal government) and the achievement of the outcomes with reference to each of the sub
PDOs separately assessed. The ICR team sought assistance of the task team and sector
colleagues present at the review meeting on how best to define each of these four systems with
reference to their key elements, and how the project components and sub- components could be
mapped to the agreed project outcome indicators.

65.    The task team confirmed that the project did not aim to tackle every area of the four
systems, but sought to make a contribution to improving these systems through specific areas of
intervention, and the related performance monitoring indicators were selected to monitor the
impact of the project’s interventions. The assessment of outcomes has therefore been done with
reference to the specific areas that the project intervened, and taking into consideration the
linkage to the indicators provided by the task team as in Table 1 below.

66.     On the basis of Table 1, each of the four themes was assessed individually by linking
them to the project components/sub-components and mapping these to the KPIs and IRIs. The
four sub- PDOs taken are – Improvement in the federal government’s (a) Administrative
systems; (b) Financial systems; (c) Human Resource systems; and (d) Statistical systems. The
ICR attempted to assess whether, as a result of project interventions, there was an overall
improvement in the administrative, financial, human resource and statistical systems, and which
of these improvements could be attributed to the project interventions.




                                                                                              34
Table 1: Linking Sub-PDOs to the Results Framework




67.    The conclusion of the ICR is that the Project Development Objectives were
substantially achieved, as discussed below (refer also Annex 3 for a detailed discussion on the
achievements and incomplete activities).

   •   Achievement towards improvement of Administrative systems is assessed as
       Substantial due to successful restructuring of pilot MDAs, staff downsizing (, re-
       professionalization through fresh recruitment of professional staff especially in NBS and
       capacity building of staff across all components of the project that has resulted in a better
       trained workforce, thereby enhancing the administrative capability of the pilot MDAs, the
       aviation agencies and the other MDAs in service delivery. This is all against a
       background of a weak professional public service at project inception due to inadequate
       investment in professional training and capacity building. Enhanced technical capacity
                                                                                                 35
         also led to an improvement in intellectual property rights enforcements to total reported
         cases by the NCC and in speedier disposal of capital market dispute cases by the IST.
         Aviation safety and security reforms contributed to the Nigerian Aviation industry
         attaining American FAA Category 1 status in 2010.

     •   Achievement towards improvement of Financial systems is assessed as Substantial
         contributed by implementation of GIFMIS, interface with the central bank, migration to
         treasury single account (all resulting in improvement in budget execution including cash
         management), strengthening procurement systems (resulting from the development and
         enactment of a modern procurement law, establishment of a procurement regulatory
         agency which regulates public procurement, design and use of NSBDs and publishing of
         contract information), strengthening the anti-corruption agency EFCC (which is now
         internationally recognized and certified and its strengthening has resulted in recovery of
         significant assets) and interventions in external audit (including elimination of a backlog
         in finalizing audits and submission of audited financial statements to the government) and
         financial reporting (adoption of international accounting standards and setting up a
         regulatory body). However, legal reforms such as enactment of the audit bill and the
         revision of the finance control and management Act and some other activities (see Annex
         3) could not be achieved during the project period.

     •   Achievement towards improvement of Human Resource systems is assessed as
         Modest- The integrated IT enabled HR and payroll system was implemented and gains
         achieved through identification and elimination of ghost workers resulted in significant
         monetary savings to the government, through identification and elimination of 46000
         ghost workers, thereby saving Naira 119 bn. However, by the end of the project the
         average discrepancy between these two modules increased to 29% as the personnel
         module could not be integrated with the payroll one

     •   Achievement towards improvement of the Statistical System is assessed as
         Substantial contributed by enactment of a new Statistics Law, downsizing of non-
         professional staff accompanied by recruitment of more professionals as well as the
         implementation of an appropriate Scheme of Service for NBS staff as stipulated in the
         Statistics Act 2007 , setting up of data centers and modernizing survey instruments.
         Statistical system strengthening led to an improved rating of Nigeria’s central statistical
         agency (NBS) by 20 points between 2006 and 2007 36, and built its capacity in producing
         more regular and validated data.

68.     Overall, the achievements after restructuring are significant. The project helped the
country make significant strides in a number of key areas of public financial management,
procurement, civil service reform and statistical strengthening. Based on the results of the
project as detailed in the Data Sheet, the assessment of the outcomes and achievements in terms
of outputs detailed in Annex 3 and the analysis in this section, the overall efficacy of the
project is rated as Substantial (Modest for the period prior to restructuring and
Substantial for the post re-structuring period).

                                                                                                  38
71.     There has been a significant improvement in the benefits and efficiencies in a number of
areas through the ERGP. Many key activities under this project were completed toward the end
of project implementation and hence the benefits would accrue in the subsequent years. The
expected benefits from an institution and capacity building project like this in terms of efficiency
or fiscal savings can be gauged when the benefits materialize in the medium term, and can be
attributed to a combination of reforms. The benefits under the ERGP can broadly be classified
into the qualitative benefits and the financial benefits.

72.      Qualitative benefits of ERGP: The restructuring program of the civil service through
carefully articulated intervention projects kick started the revival and repositioning of the civil
service. The deployment of the IPPIS in the civil service have enhanced operational processes
and helped improve performance and quality of service delivery. The key qualitative benefits of
the ERGP include the effective use of the payroll module and payroll processing time, improved
personnel cost budgeting, automated third party transfers, reduction/ elimination of ghost
workers (IPPIS), effectiveness of control features, benefits in the areas of increased prosecutions
in economic and financial crime (EFCC), better cash management leading to financial savings
(GIFMIS), savings on account of procurement reforms (specifically, procurement regulation by
the BPP) and availability of better trained and more professional staff in federal MDAs.

73.      Financial benefits of the ERGP:

•     EFCC recovered assets of over $ 9 bn between 2004 and 2012.

•     Implementation of IPPIS in the pilot MDAs has resulted in identification of about 25000
      ghost workers. IPPIS also helped make net average monthly savings of Naira 116 m for the
      7 pilot MDAs after implementation.

•     As a result of implementation of GIFMIS, the monthly average cash balances of the federal
      government reduced from N 106 b in April 2012 to N 19 b in June 2013. The balance in the
      Consolidated Revenue Fund of the FGN improved from a deficit of about Naira 100 billion
      in 2011 to a surplus of Naira 4.16 billion in 2012. Benefits, notionally computed at about the
      equivalent of $97 million, have been realized through savings in interest payments on the
      overdrafts provided by the central bank to finance the budget.

•     The ways and means financing costs over the same period reduced from N 12.8 b to Nil
      while the cash backing time also reduced from 28 days to nil over the same period.

•     The Bureau of Public Procurement reported in June 2013 that there had been a cumulative
      value improvement savings of over NGN 420 bn from the year 2007 till date through the
      Bureau’s prior review interventions.

74.     There were delays in project implementation resulting in extensions of the project and
delays in procurement that contributed to reduced efficiency.

75.    A quantitative assessment of the projects NPV or ERR was not carried out since such an
assessment was not conducted at the appraisal stage and, as an institution-building project it is

                                                                                                  39
difficult to determine the rates of return. Given the progress made towards achievement of the
objectives, the overall Efficiency of the project can be considered Substantial in terms of
qualitative and financial gains made. A further detailed assessment of the efficiency of the
project is reflected at Annex 4.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
       Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.      The project made significant achievements in implementing several activities. Major
achievements include implementation of the budget execution system of GIFMIS and linking
with the central bank and TSA; implementation of IPPIS; strengthening the statistical capacity of
the country; alignment of accounting standards with international standards; strengthening of the
aviation sector to bring it to global standards; enactment of procurement law and setting up
central agency for procurement and downsizing of government through severance scheme. These
achievements resulted in more professional and trained staff, strengthened anti-corruption
efforts, transparent procurement, elimination of ghost workers, and better cash management
practices.

77.     Some activities that could not be completed within project period included enactment of
the audit law, inauguration of the procurement regulatory body NCPP, implementation of the
Budget Preparation Module of GIFMIS (finally implemented post project closure) and the non-
integration of nominal roll and payroll in IPPIS and the increasing discrepancy between these.

78.     Overall, the project is rated Substantial on the parameters of Relevance of
objectives and design, Efficacy of each objective, and Efficiency. Also, as the achievement
of the PDO, when assessed with reference to the 4 sub- PDOs and the outcome indicators
was significant, the overall outcome rating has been assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.
3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

79.    The project was concerned with institutional building and improving economic
governance which improves the capacity to address issues of poverty, gender and social
development. The reforms in Nigeria are leading to a growing middle class demanding better
governance from the government. This could lead to higher growth, less reliance on oil revenue
and a higher proportion of tax - paying public that will help in reducing poverty.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

80.      The development impact of ERGP in this area was significant as it was funded through a
technical assistance product. The project contributed significantly in enhancing the capacity of
staff in all the implementing agencies and pilot agencies. Institutional strengthening was a part in
each of the component/sub component and this is expected to have a positive impact on the
longer-term development of the country’s capacity and institutions in areas encompassing budget
execution, auditing under INTOSAI standards, tax administration, procurement, financial and
statistical reporting and enforcement amongst others.

                                                                                                 40
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

81.     Some of the initiatives under ERGP are being extended to the states. These include
public procurement reforms involving open competition in public contracts, automation of HR
management systems, reducing discrepancy between payroll and nominal roll and automation of
the budget and treasury functions through state level IFMIS systems including producing
financial statements through these systems. 37

3.6     Summary of Findings of the Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
        Not Applicable

                        4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Overall Rating – Substantial

82.     The reform agenda included in the project was built on consensus of and commitment by
the government and the proposed implementing agencies and this factor is likely to enhance the
sustainability of the reforms undertaken. Some of the actions taken under the project are likely
to sustain the momentum of reforms. These include successful implementation of the budget
module of the GIFMIS to cover 78% of the budget and its linkage with the central bank,
enactment of the Financial Reporting Council Act which has strengthened the FRC in its
functions of regulation, compliance and enforcement of financial reporting standards, and the
enactment of a modern procurement law and the statistics law. . These actions have resulted in
far reaching changes to governance and PFM that are embedded in the government operations
and are unlikely to be reversed. It is important to note that the FGN has proposed a sum of N1
billion in its 2014 budget for GIFMIS implementation for the current financial year. This reform
agenda could be further strengthened and reinforced once the enabling audit act and the finance
control and management act are passed by the government, activities that were not done within
the project life.

Key areas that could pose risks to maintaining achievement of development outcomes are:

83.     Non- completion of all the GIFMIS modules: As mentioned earlier, the implementation
of the budget execution module of the GIFMIS was a key success of this project. However, other
modules are yet to be rolled out (Revenue collection, procurement and commitments module,
assets management, HR management). It is important for the FGN to ensure completion of the
complete GIFMIS module so as to derive the benefits of its full implementation. OAGF has also
assessed that other activities such as training and change management may suffer due to
inadequate funding and this needs to be addressed. 38

84.     IPPIS not fully effective: The continued divergence between the Personnel (nominal
roll) and the payroll module in the IPPIS may affect the overall objective of this component, i. e.

37
   Some states are supported in this regard by the Bank under the State Employment and Effectiveness for Results
(SEEFOR) project and the Nigeria Public Sector Governance Reform and Development Project (P097026)

   OAGF, Implementation Status Report, October 31, 2013

                                                                                                                   41
to integrate the HR and payroll modules. While the average divergence between the HR and
payroll modules in the pilot MDAs was 29%, it was as high as 75% and 70% in key ministries
like the FMF and the Ministry of Education respectively, as the two modules could not be
integrated. It is important that this discrepancy be addressed so that the IPPIS application can be
used simultaneously for both functions.

85.     Enactment of the proposed audit bill and revision to the finance control and
management act pending: The audit bill is essential to ensure the independence and authority of
the Auditor General and have the Office perform its role as an independent oversight authority
over public finances. The revision to the finance control and management act is needed so that
the extant law matches with the changes and improvements made in the PFM practices.

86.     Continuity of trained staff: In certain areas such as internal audit some of the trained
staff had either moved on to other functions or had retired, which partly diluted the objective of
the training and the long term sustainability. Better HR planning is therefore required so that an
active linkage can be achieved between training plans and HR plans.

87.     Continued Government commitment: Continuation of government commitment in
terms of enacting policies and making adequate budgetary provisions is essential for
sustainability of other key activities that were initiated under the ERGP. The continued
allocation of funds in the 2014 Federal Budget for continued implementation of GFMIS is
reassuring. It is hoped that the economic team of the current government remains committed to
continued consolidation of Governance reforms as is evidenced in the Mid-Term evaluation of
the implementation of the Governments policy agenda (the Transformation agenda).

88.   In view of the above, the overall Risk to Development Outcome has been assessed as
Substantial.

                    5     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.      The approach of the Bank team was to ensure project ownership of the government and
MDAs through alignment with the government’s own strategy and involvement of MDAs in
developing the reform agenda, and also integration of project activities in the regular operations
by decentralization of day to day management thereby ensuring support from the operating units.
This also made the project objectives strategically relevant in terms of its scope and the reforms
it strived to achieve. Another aspect was focusing on doable things first and therefore for
instance GIFMIS implementation was scheduled for the third year. It was a variable environment
for the Bank team making changes as more learning was available.

90.    A Quality Enhancement Review at preparation was not conducted. The quality at entry
could have been better considering the constraints faced during project implementation like a
weak PCU and a large number of implementing agencies. Also, on- going adjustments were

                                                                                                 42
required during project implementation like the changing of PDO, changing of procurement
methods and thresholds and a changing results framework.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The Bank team undertook regular missions during implementation jointly with DfID, the
co-financier. Thematic fiduciary missions were also undertaken and these pointed to some
fiduciary issues. Significant efforts were made by the team to provide implementation support
and identify, discuss and resolve issues to smoothen out bottlenecks in project implementation.
The Bank team engaged with the implementing agencies early on during project implementation
to review the results framework and confirm that that the indicators were right with correct
baseline data and achievable targets. The Bank was also responsive to the requests of the FGN
and implementing agencies for reallocation of funds, realignment of activities and refinement of
performance indicators, and easing procurement procedures and norms, as this operation was a
major instrument of dialogue with the Federal Government and these requests from the FGN
needed to be attended to in order to maintain the momentum of the dialogue.

92.    Some of the implementing agencies, in the project completion reports, point to delay or
non-clearance on part of the Bank to provide the necessary clearances/approvals. However,
discussions with the task team indicate that there was considerable delay on the part of the
agencies to provide adequate documentation to support the Bank’s reviews hence clearances
sometimes got delayed.

93.     In 2006 the Aviation component was included in the restructured project and this
component had public works activities (perimeter fencing and boundary roads for 2 airports).
Consequent to this restructuring, the environment category was maintained at C. The then Task
Team Leader of the project confirmed that although an environmental assessment was not
carried out during the 2006 project restructuring, the environmental safeguards and resettlement
issues were discussed within the task team and the implications of the public works activities
under the Aviation component were examined from a safeguards angle; consequent to this, it was
decided to maintain the safeguards category at C.
`
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.     Based on the above rating of Moderately Satisfactory both for quality at entry and also
for quality of supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The
Bank team can be credited with intensive supervision and proactive involvement in the later
stages of project implementation that facilitated completion of many activities.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                                                                                  43
95.     The Federal government of Nigeria showed continued commitment to the project’s
development objective over the project’s lifespan and maintained dialogue with the Bank and
also the co-financier, DFID in terms of restructuring of project activities and reallocation of the
credit based on priorities and actual performance. The Government’s commitment and ownership
to reforms was embedded in embracing key changes and implementing key activities and
reforms that have been discussed in the earlier sections. The government continued to support
crucial reforms such as GIFMIS and IPPIS and these were expanded across more MDAs even
after project closure.

96.     The effectiveness and efficiency of the project’s achievements can be enhanced if certain
on-going and incomplete activities are completed at the earliest. These include enactment of the
proposed Audit Bill, amendment to the Finance (Control and Management) Act and inauguration
of the National Council of Public Procurement and these legal and institutional structures were
intended to play a crucial role in entrenching the reforms.

97.      Delayed release of counterpart funds by the Budget office during the early phases of the
project was considered as a bottleneck that hampered implementation, and the project had to be
restructured to eliminate counterpart contribution due to difficulties and delays in the release of
funds from the government side. The strengthening of the National Statistical System and of the
NBS was largely achieved through donor support and it was felt that the government substituted
this for its own funding.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.     The performance of agencies directly entrusted with project implementation was variable
and uneven. While agencies such as NBS, EFCC and NASB (later FRC) showed satisfactory
implementation progress in terms of commencement and completion of activities and utilization
of credit funds, others experienced initial delays and capacity constraints including
administrative and procurement. As a result, the project had to be restructured repeatedly with
changes in activities and re-allocation of funds from slow-disbursing agencies, and cancellation
of credit and extension of project life by 28 months. There were certain concerns on fiduciary
aspects and some issues arose during thematic missions by the Bank’s FM team.

86      The level of spending amongst the implementing agencies was also mixed. Agencies
such as EFCC, NBS and NASB had exhausted their allocations but spending in FIRS, BPP and
BPSR was slow and got delayed. About 25% of the IDA credit was allocated to OAGF for
development of GIFMIS and implementation of other activities and delay in implementation of
this sub-component (only 5% disbursed by MTR) adversely affected the implementation
progress. Procurement problems were faced in some agencies, and this was partially remedied
through the appointment of a procurement consultant. There were instances of fiduciary issues
that could only be resolved partially by end of project/grace period. Moreover, some agencies
could not provide the M & E data timely and this limited its use.




                                                                                                 44
99.    Overall Rating: Moderately Satisfactory: The overall borrower performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory as both Government and Implementing Agencies performances have
been rated Moderately Satisfactory.

                                       6   Lessons Learned

100. Like many other Bank projects, this project too provided lessons on general learning like
the importance of government commitment, support of a key coordinating ministry (like the
Federal Ministry of Finance in this case) and a well-staffed Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), the
need to adapt to a changing environment and address client demand, collaboration with other
development partners and aligning the operation with the project development objectives and the
Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). In addition, this project provided certain lessons
that were specific to the Nigerian country context and environment:

101. Better sequencing of activities and coordinating multiple Implementing Agencies:
The ERGP involved a large number of activities involving multiple implementing agencies,
which resulted in spreading of efforts too thin and coordination and monitoring was a challenge.
The problems in some of the implementing agencies in the program were not just capacity issues,
but incentive and political problems. There was also the problem of the division of agencies into
PITTs and PETs. It was very difficult to monitor the PETs and often adequate information from
the FMF was not forthcoming. It would have been good to focus on crucial reform priorities in
the initial years and consolidate the achievements, and sequence out the complex reforms
thereafter.

102. Robust M&E framework required: The results monitoring framework in the ERGP
changed several times throughout project implementation and there also appeared to be a lack of
communication with the implementing agencies that sometimes used indicators that were already
dropped. Linkages between the outcome indicators and the PDO was not clear and the extent of
achievement the PDO could be assessed only after it was broken down into sub- PDOs and the
indicators mapped to these. It is therefore important that a strong and robust monitoring and
evaluation system and results indicator framework is put in place for any such capacity building
project.

103. Variable/ learning environment: The project design must be flexible enough to adapt
to changing requirements over implementation and this was partly demonstrated in ERGP where
both FGN and the Bank continuously reviewed the relevance and need of the activities planned
and made changes accordingly. Certain activities overlapping with other projects were dropped
and new activities included for agencies that demonstrated good implementation progress and
credit proceeds were re-allocated from slow disbursing implementing agencies to higher
spending ones.

104. Client demand needs to balance with Bank’s overall country strategy and the
project’s development objectives: The Aviation component was added in 2006 in response to
client demand but it was not in line with the CPS pillar of governance and the original project
development objectives of improving the federal government’s economic and financial
management systems and processes and establish a reform process of the federal civil service.

                                                                                               45
The component was to focus on the objective of air safety and the working of key agencies in the
aviation sector. However, the success indicator being measured in terms of the length of
perimeter fencing and roads was somewhat inconsistent with the focus of the component and
seemed to dilute the relevance of the wider aim of the component.


105. Role of PCU: Discussion with the PCU in the FMF indicated that for future projects,
additional clarity is required on the exact role of the PCU vis-à-vis the implementing agencies at
the federal or state level. They felt that if the PCU is not apprised of important issues on a regular
basis, its ability to provide guidance and support, especially to the agencies with weak capacity,
could be limited. Staffing issues were also required to be addressed.

                    Annex 1: Summary of Changes in Results Framework
                                PDO Outcome Indicators

The evolution of the design of the indicators is summarized as follows:

PDO Indicators

   The PAD provided two PDO indicators
   At the time of restructuring in 2009, a set of 5 new key performance indicators was
    introduced
   These were re-worded at the time of the restructuring in August 2012

Intermediate Results Indicators

   The PAD proposed 19 indicators (including for Pension component) out of which 15 were
    included in the original Credit Agreement with many of them re-worded and 4 were excluded
    (reasons for this are not recorded)
   Out of the 16 indicators included in the Credit Agreement, 1 was not included in the PAD;
    subsequently 7 were revised and 9 were dropped
   11 new indicators were added during restructurings, 6 were revised and 4 were dropped
   At the project end, there were 17 indicators - 7, 5, 3 and 2 each for components 1,2,3 and 4
    respectively

These emanated from the changing project contours (e. g. deletion of Pension Reforms
component and including an Aviation Reforms component) and change in PDO, providing
clarity to the indicators, request from the government and implementing agencies for
modifications, bringing agencies under the framework not covered earlier, and recommendations
made by the AFTDE. In case of FIRS, since the targets for the original indicators had already
been achieved, new indicators were agreed. Though the Bank team proactively reviewed the
appropriateness and relevance of the indicators along with the implementing agencies, in
retrospect, and in view of the many changes in the indicators, it may have helped to do a more
thorough analysis at the design stage. The project M&E was the overall responsibility of the
PCU and data on the indicators collected from individual implementing agencies. However,
since there were weaknesses in the working of this system, in the later period of project
implementation, external agencies were proposed to be engaged for measuring the results
indicators.

Till July 2012 (a year before project closure), data on the following indicators were not available.

    a) Discrepancy between the nominal roll and the pay roll in IPPIS pilot MDAs; the indicator
       was introduced in April 2009 but baseline was not available at that time and up to
       September 2012 – the first time the baseline was used was in the ISR of October 2012.
    b) Percentage of staff and ministry service users that cite improvements in the quality of
       services of restructured ministries

                                                                                                 47
     c) Percentage of audit queries answered (there was a request from OAuGF to drop this
        indicator)
     d) Percentage of professional staff in pilot ministries
     e) Percentage of professional staff who have received training in their areas of responsibility
     f) Number of pilot restructuring plans fully implemented; and the number of new MDAs
        which have produced and are implementing restructuring plans

                 New Indicators                                  Remarks/Reasons for dropping
Component 1: Public Resource Management Reform and Anti-Corruption
90% of FIRS staff have the skills to use ICT    Introduced in Apr 2009
tools in the execution of core technical and
support functions across the service
Standard manuals for tax assessment and tax     Introduced in Apr 2009; reported as having achieved the target
audit for each category of tax prepared and in
use
Standard templates for tax collection and       Introduced in Apr 2009; reported as having achieved the target

                                                dropped as this indicator was not found to be a reflection of the
                                                performance of the Federal Ministry of Aviation who requested

            Annex 3 – Project Outputs and Discussion on Achievement of the PDOs

Sub- PDO (a): Improvement in the Federal Government’s Administrative Systems
Overall Achievement: Substantial (Modest pre-structuring and Substantial post re-structuring)

    Reform in Pilot Ministries and Agencies and Strengthening capacity of BPSR to lead
     Federal Civil Service Reform

     Achievement: Substantial (Modest pre-structuring and Substantial post re-structuring)

Reforms in four pilot MDAs (FMF, NPC, FCTA and Federal Ministry of Information) were
planned at start of the project and later on extended to additional five MDAs (National Copyright
Commission, Investment and Securities Tribunal, Office of the Head of Service of the
Federation, National Assembly and National Insurance Commission). The outcomes were
measured by:
KPI 3: Percentage of staff and ministry service users that cite improvements in the quality of
services of restructured ministries (as measured by user and staff surveys). There was no
identified baseline value for this KPI. The results of achievement of 80% are based on a
consultant report (covering the initial four MDAs) 40 says that the “findings are based on the
administration of questionnaires to target officials in the pilot agencies”, it does not make any
mention of ministry service users, whether internal or external. It was critical to get the view
from the actual users of the ministry/ public, as it would be expected that the officials of these
ministries would naturally attest to the success of the indicator. Further discussions revealed that
while external service users of the ministries were not interviewed, the consultants met with the
“SERVICOM ” desks of the MDAs (Service Compact desks in federal MDAs, which receive the
complaints of poor services from MDA service users and are responsible for ensuring the
quality of services provided) and concluded an achievement of 80% as against a target of 50%.

The progress was measured through five IRIs.

     •   Indicator 8 - Number of Pilot restructuring plans fully implemented: the target has
         reasonably been achieved in the initial four pilot MDAs selected for undertaking
         organizational and staffing reforms and use of ICT for improving work processes. The
         restructuring evolved on an on-going basis and changing priorities in government.
         Restructuring included severance of staff. Tracer Study (September 2012) on the
         effectiveness of the severance and social assistance program in 2006 and 2007 was
         undertaken.

     •   Indicator 9 -Percentage of professional Staff in pilot ministries and Indicator 10 -
         Percentage of professional staff who have received training in their respective areas have
         been substantially achieved as reflected in an independent consultant assessment report. 41
         On an average, 85% staff in the four MDAs is professional and has received training in

          their areas of responsibility. The report concluded that the intervention through the
          resources provided under ERGP was efficient and effective in transforming the agencies
          to deliver services according to their mandates, enabling restructuring of the MDAs and
          strengthening professionalism through capacity building and training programs. The
          study cautioned that the success of the reform in these pilot agencies is dependent on how
          sustainable they will be in a couple of years and that resources will have to be provided
          through the Budget for sustained capacity building and training and will depend on the
          political will not to revert.

      •   Indicator 13 - Ratio of intellectual property rights enforcements to total reported cases
          (pilot agency Nigerian Copyright Commission): 55 cases enforced of 62 reported in
          2012 (88%). The percentage of enforcements has progressively increased from 53% in
          2009 to 88% in 2012.

      •   Indicator 14: Capital Market Disputes case disposal rate (pilot agency Investment and
          Securities Tribunal): The case disposal rate at the close of the project was about 74%
          while the overall average was 54% over the period 2006 - 2012.

      Airport Safety Reforms and Investments 42

      Achievement: Substantial (Modest pre-structuring and Substantial post re-structuring)

There are three IRIs of which two have been achieved and one partially achieved. Indicator 15 -
Length of perimeter roads constructed has been achieved in Abuja airport but the road remained
to be completed in Port Harcourt airport till project close. Indicator 16 - Length of perimeter
fences constructed has been completed at both the airports, though with some delay. Indicator 17
- Completion of study on aviation agencies has also been achieved, stakeholder workshop held,
report has been validated and final report submitted to the Federal Ministry of Aviation.

Technical consultancies to support capacity enhancement training, security systems development
and development of safety management systems for the NCAA contributed to an overall
improvement in the safety and security of operational activities and the Nigerian Aviation
industry attained American FAA Category 1 status in 2010 43. The NCAA attained an enhanced
42
   The Aviation reform component aimed to “streamline and strengthen institutions and work processes in the
sector” enabling strengthening the administrative capacity of the aviation sector agencies; hence, taken under the
PDO sub-objective improvement in the federal government’s administrative systems
43
   This was attained from the U.S. Government under the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) International
Aviation Safety Assessment program. This means that Nigeria complies with the international air safety standards
set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations' technical agency for aviation that
establishes international standards and recommended practices for aircraft operations and maintenance.

                                                                                                                     54
level of air safety oversight capacity as civil aviation regulator and physical investments in
perimeter roads and fencing increased safety standards meeting the ICAO’s requirement for re-
certification of the airports.

Overall, the pilot reforms have gone well with increased number of professional and trained staff
and the aviation reform activities substantially completed. Conclusion in respect of achievement
of two pilot activities (IRI 13 and 14) could not be firmed up as the measurement in the
indicators was not unambiguous – though there was progress. Aviation reforms were introduced
after project effectiveness and substantially achieved its objectives.


Sub-PDO (b): Improvement in the Federal Government’s Financial Systems
Overall Achievement: Substantial (Modest pre-structuring and Substantial post re-structuring)

The two KPIs linked to this sub-objective have been achieved.
   • KPI 1- Number of agencies with budget and financial reports prepared from GIFMIS
      within seven days from month end has been achieved. GIFMIS went live in April 2012
      and by project close covered 209 MDAs against the target of 120. Budgetary releases to
      these MDAs are done from the Central Bank through the GIFMIS and for these, budget
      performance reports and monthly financial statements are available on a real-time basis.

       •      KPI 2 - Number of economic and financial crime prosecutions by EFCC. No target was
              set for this indicator. Against a baseline of 263 prosecutions in 2005, EFCC launched 502
              prosecutions in 2012 and 2,018 cumulatively during the period 2005-12 (see Table 3).

           Government Financial Management and Information System Reform Sub Component

       Achievement: Substantial (Modest pre-restructuring and Substantial post restructuring)

The two major achievements of this sub-component are the successful interface of the GIFMIS’s
Budget Execution System (BES) with the Central Bank of Nigeria and the transition to TSA. As
of the date of project closure, BES was operational across 209 MDAs (against a target of 120)
and for these MDAs, the budget performance reports and financial statements was available in
real time. As on October 31, 2013, 225 MDAs are on the system with coverage of 78% of federal
finances. By June 2013, GIFMIS had generated 4.7 m pay orders with a value of Naira 4 trillion;
monthly average cash balances reduced from Naira 106 b in April 2012 to Naira 19 b by project
closure in June 2013, with the result that the Ways and Means financing costs and Cash Backing
Time have been eliminated 44. The Budget Preparation System (BPS) that could not be
implemented within the project period was used for the 2014 Budget in November 2013 (post-
project closure). Despite the fact that GIFMIS implementation was delayed – GIFMIS Steering
Committee was formed in 2007 and procurement process for GIFMIS vendor completed in
2011(leading to project closing date being extended) – the gains achieved so far have been
enormous, as evidenced by the fact that the federal government is keen to achieve full roll-out
across all MDAs in a short time. Much work on related activities is still to be completed

                                                                                                     55
including implementing phase 2 of BES, closing all bank accounts outside TSA, training in the
systems and establishing business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

In the area of financial reporting, adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards
(IPSAS) Cash standards has been approved This is expected to be implemented for government
FY 2014 financial statements with a transition plan for adoption and implementation of IPSAS
Accrual Basis by 2016. Furthermore, the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) by the private sector beginning in 2012 was a major milestone. There are some issues
relating to chart of accounts essential to effectively implement GIFMIS and the transition path to
full implementation to IPSAS, and these need resolution.

Training to the core group of internal auditors on the modernization plan had been done
(although many have either been deployed outside internal audit function or retired) and other
training on GIFMIS, computer aided audit techniques etc. have also been conducted but
sensitization of high level officers on risk based audit approach in MDAs is pending. Auditors
who have completed their training have been assigned audit privileges on GIFMIS to conduct
audit on the system.

ERGP support to capacity building in Public Financial Management through the revamping of
the Federal Treasury Academy (FTA) resulted in the development of a vision document for the
FTA, a PFM Qualifications Framework for the Award of a Professional Qualifications in Public
Financial Management; development of a strategy for the implementation of the Framework and
design of a Quality Assurance Blueprint for the Academy's Examinations. This support was
achieved through a twining arrangement between the FTA, Chartered Institute of Public
Financial Accountants (CIPFA) UK and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria
(ICAN) for PFM tutelage through the production of courseware for students and tutors as well as
an internationally recognized certificate award 45.

    External Audit Reform Sub Component

     Achievement: Modest in both the phases

Indicator 1 – Backlog of audited financial statements of the Federal Government has been
achieved. By 2012, the OAuGF had cleared the backlog (against 4 years backlog at
commencement of the project), although the 2011 audited accounts were placed before the
National Assembly in 2013 with some delay.

There has been less than satisfactory achievement in completing other activities particularly
passing the Audit Bill by the Assembly 46, a crucial step to provide independence to the office of
the OAuGF and paving the way for reinforcing accountability and oversight at the Federal level
– the OAuGF continues to function under an Ordinance of 1956.


45
   Following successful pilots of the Certificate and Diploma programs under ERGP support, the FTA plans to roll
out an Advanced Diploma program in February 2014 and commence the Professional program in August 2014
46
   The Audit Bill was indeed tabled before the National Assembly for the first time in 2001(and re-submitted in
subsequent sessions of the National Assembly) but has not been passed yet.

                                                                                                               56
    Financial Reporting Reform Sub Component

     Achievement: Substantial in both the phases

There is no OI or IRI linked to this sub-component. At project commencement, only 21
accounting standards had been issued by the then NASB, as against 41 issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). However, by project closure, Nigeria had
almost achieved full convergence with the IASB; the highest point being the issuance of the
IFRS for the private sector and IPSAS for the public sector. Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) is progressive being adopted by significant private entities started in
2012, Other public interest entities in 2013 and SMEs would be by 2014. The Financial
Reporting Council Act was promulgated in 2011and the NASB has been replaced with a
statutory body, the FRCN. Its institutional structure is being aligned with that provided in the
underlying legislation including operations being computerized through ERP. Staff of FRC and
SEC has been imparted local and foreign training. Furthermore, Nigerian universities are being
supported by the FRC to impart courses in business ethics and values as well as in International
Financial Reporting Standards.

     Procurement Reforms
     Achievement: Substantial (Modest pre-restructuring, Substantial post-restructuring)

The progress of this project intervention was sought to be measured through three IRIs

     •   Indicator 2 - Effective procurement regulatory body has been established: The Bureau of
         Public Procurement was formed in 2008 under a new Public Procurement law of 2007.
         The BPP has the power to enforce the procurement law, implementing regulations and
         providing guidance for procurement capacity in the MDAs.

     •   Indicator 3 - Percentage of government ministries using National Standard Bidding
         Documents. National Standard Bidding Documents (NSBD) have been developed and
         formally deployed and in use by all Ministries since 2012. However, a Procurement
         Audit and Project Monitoring and Evaluation carried out in selected MDAs found that
         though the Standard Bidding Documents were used there were attempts by MDAs to
         modify the Contract Agreement Templates in some of the contracts reviewed. A circular
         mandating the use of the NSBD has been issued. The Bank has adopted their use for
         procurements by National Competitive Bidding in all Bank financed projects. MDAs
         implementing Bank funded projects therefore use the NSBD 47.
     •   Indicator 4 - Percentage of large government contracts awards published: this IRI has
         been achieved as 100% of the large contracts available on the website of BPP and
         published in the media quarterly/ bi-annually.

As a result of the new procurement regulatory framework, public procurement policies and
practices at the federal level have improved, and become more transparent and there is increased
demand for accountability. This has created a demonstration effect for states – leading to at least

47
 See section 2.4 for discussion on the indicator

                                                                                                 57
14 states subsequently enacting their own modern public procurement laws 48. In 2011, the Bank,
in recognition of the high standards of the government NSBDs, adopted the use of the
government NSBDs for National Competitive Bidding in Bank financed projects. With the
creation of a Professional Procurement Cadre, public service capacity to effectively and
efficiently manage public expenditure is expected to be significantly strengthened.

       Tax Administration Reform

       Achievement: Modest (Negligible pre-restructuring and Modest post-restructuring)

There is no OI linked to this sub-component. There are two IRIs for this sub- component whose
status is as follows:

       •   Indicator 5: Number of registered taxpayers - corporate and SMEs/individuals: the
           number of taxpayers uniquely identified in the tax database recoded 1.06 m by Dec 2012
           (up from 0.48mn in 2005), an achievement of 90% of the target, out of which 540000 are
           corporate taxpayers.

Indicator 6: Real growth in non-oil tax revenue: The target was indicated in nominal terms
(11%) which in real terms translated to negative 3.6%. There was a growth in non-oil tax
revenue collections by the FIRS between 2010 and 2012. In real terms, the growth averaged
about 4.2% from 2010 to 2012.
This component (also co- financed by DFID) supported the successful establishment of a
modernization Department and Change Management Unit in the Federal Tax Office (FIRS),
which implemented a change management corporate plan for the agency. Various advisory
services were supported under the project for the development of new tax administration
procedures to improve transparency and effectiveness and most of these new procedures are in
use by the FIRS.

       Support to Anti-Corruption Agency
       Achievement: Substantial in both the phases

The KPI linked to this sub-component is Number of economic and financial crime prosecutions
by EFCC. Indicator 7 - Amount of economic and financial crime assets recovered by EFCC
cumulatively was USD 9368mn for the period 2004-12 and USD 261 m for 2012 as compared to
USD 447 m in December 2004. No target was set for this IRI for the reasons adduced earlier in
this Report. The cumulative amount of assets recovered has significantly increased. There was
impressive monetary recovery between 2006 and 2009 but there has been a reducing annual
trend between 2010 and 2011 and slight improvement in 2012. 2011 was also the year with the
lowest recoveries (about 5% of the recoveries made in 2010, which is inexplicable). Year-wise
details are given in Table 2.

Project interventions contributed to enhancing the investigative skills of the financial intelligence
operatives of EFCC contributing to higher numbers of prosecutions, convictions and recovered
assets from economic and financial crimes, and reduction in time cycles in complex case
investigation. EFCC in their own report have estimated that funds recovered from five troubled
banks was about Naira 171 bn and substantial value of assets were recovered from government

officials, businessmen and captains of industry and fraudsters returning assets to fraud victims all
over the world. 49 In addition, the time needed to resolve cases had improved. A stronger EFCC
had helped Nigeria to be delisted from the FATF-NCCT list in 2007, as well as gain admission to
the EGMONT Group of Financial Intelligence Units. The EFCC attributes its success to a
significant extent to support of the ERGP, in particular the building of human and physical
capacity.

Sub- PDO (c): Improvement in the Federal Government’s Human Resource Systems

Overall Achievement: Modest (Substantial prior to re-structuring and Modest post re-structuring)

The implementation of an IT based Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System
(IPPIS) in the pilot MDAs has been a significant factor in achievement of the Human Resource
sub-objective of the PDO. ERGP supported piloting IPPIS in six MDAs (Education, Information,
Works, FMF, Foreign Office and NPC) and phase 1 was completed by mid-term of the project in
2008. IPPIS has now been mandated to be rolled out in all the MDAs with a target of full
implementation by December 2013 entirely with government funding. This partial
implementation eliminated about 25000 ghost workers and led to monthly savings of Naira 116
m for the 7 pilot MDAs. . 50

The KPI under this sub-objective, however, has not been achieved. KPI 4 - Discrepancy between
the nominal roll and the payroll in IPPIS pilot MDAs had a target of 5% at project close. It was
reported that this had been achieved at the time of the pilot. However, the discrepancy between
nominal roll and the payroll at the end of the project re-surfaced and was assessed at an average
of 29% by Ms. Quick Projects Ltd engaged by BPSR to assess and ascertain the extent to which
the introduction of the IPPPIS has helped reduce the bottlenecks related to payroll and personnel
records management in the civil service. The average discrepancies in the FMF and Budget
Office and the Federal Ministry of Education were assessed at 75% and 70% respectively.

The study reported significant improvement in the payroll processes within the pilot MDAs, but
also stated that the improvement in the personnel processes did not sufficiently meet up with the
objectives of the IPPIS project. The Study has reservations on the effectiveness on the use of

IPPIS application, and the communication among the IPPIS role players. Inability of FGN to
fully deploy the HR component of the IPPIS application has limited the manpower planning
objective of the government in deploying the IPPIS project and the study recommended that the
HR module of the IPPIS application should be put to full utilization, with the information on
both payroll and nominal roll fully integrated.

Overall, the achievement of PDO sub-objective of improving the human resource systems was
Modest (Substantial prior to restructuring and Modest post restructuring) as the project partly
achieved the objective in this area. IPPIS was implemented in the pilot MDAs prior to
restructuring, but HR module was not deployed and the average discrepancy re-surfaced and was
more than the end target by project close.



Sub-PDO (d): Improvement in the Federal Government’s Statistical Systems
   Overall Achievement: Substantial in both the phases

KPI 5 - Percentage of NBS statistical outputs released within the GDDS time and frequency
limits linked to this activity has been achieved. 83% of the periodic releases of data by NBS are
now in line with the GDDS (General Data Dissemination System) timelines and this is
significant improvement over the 10% baseline in 2005.

The two IRIs 11 and 12 in the Data Sheet linked to this objective have also been achieved.
Indicator 11 - Validation of data sources, processing methods and statistical products has
reached 90% as compared to 40% at start of the project. Due to severance scheme and
recruitment of professional staff, the Indicator 12 - percentage of staff with requisite professional
background and skills has increased to 75% as compared to 25% in 2005. Over 1700 non-
professional staff was disengaged under a severance program and professional staff recruited and
trained.

A new legislation now provides a framework for the compilation of statistics (enacted in 2007),
indicators to monitor the federal statistical systems and a mechanism to report the results to the
legislature. Institutional and capacity building for the NBS has improved quality and timeliness
of statistical products and reducing the backlog of regular statistical products, allowing Nigeria
to improve from the 39th to 19th rank in sub-Saharan Africa in the area of statistics 51. Statistical
data is disseminated through the NBS portal and is linked to other Nigerian agencies and also to
agencies outside Nigeria. These activities were co-financed by DfID and the success can be
attributed jointly to the Bank and DfID.

Overall, the achievement of PDO sub-objective of improving the statistical systems was
Substantial, having achieved its objectives, for both prior to and post restructuring phases.

                         Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic analysis of ERGP:

•   IPPIS: The deployment of the IPPIS in the civil service have enhanced operational
    processes and helped improve performance and quality of service delivery. The payroll
    module has been put to effective use a payroll processes have been streamlined making
    payroll information on the civil service readily available. The use of biometrics data capture
    has further boosted the integrity of the personnel records of the federal civil service and has
    led to the elimination of ghost workers. However, the comprehensiveness and reliability of
    the nominal roll in the MDAs remain a challenge as the personnel module of the IPPIS is
    not being used optimally.

•   Budgeting: Budget discipline has improved as budgets are made on actual parameters
    rather than estimates as was the case earlier. Staff cost computations, deductions and
    remittances to third party institutions have been automated.

•   Other key qualitative benefits of the ERGP include the effectiveness of control features,
    benefits in the areas of increased prosecutions in economic and financial crime (EFCC),
    better cash management leading to financial savings (GIFMIS), savings on account of
    procurement reforms (specifically, procurement regulation by the BPP) and availability of
    better trained and more professional staff in federal MDAs.

Financial analysis of the ERGP:

•   EFCC: The number of economic and financial crime prosecutions increased over the project
    period and the amount of economic and financial crimes assets recovered by EFCC was over
    $ 9 bn between 2004 and 2012. Anti-corruption efforts were also boosted through
    strengthening of procurement governance institutions and systems and implementation of the
    IPPIS.

•   IPPIS: Implementation of IPPIS in the pilot MDAs has resulted in identification of about
    25000 ghost workers. IPPIS also helped make net average monthly savings of Naira 116 m
    for the 7 pilot MDAs after implementation.

•   GIFMIS: As a result of GIFMIS implementation and with the e-payment system in place
    under the TSA arrangement and considering the fiscal management tools employed by FGN
    during the project period, the average monthly balance in Consolidated Revenue Fund of
    FGN improved from a deficit of about 100 billion Naira in 2011 to a surplus of Naira 4.16
    billion in 2012. Substantial benefits, notionally computed at about the equivalent of $97
    million, have been realized through savings in interest payments on the overdrafts provided
    by the central bank to finance the budget.

•   Cash Management: Strengthening the cash management system through implementation of
    GIFMIS contributed to efficiency in government resources– monthly average cash balances
    have reduced from Naira 106 bn in April 2012 to Naira 19 bn by project closure in June

                                                                                                61
    2013. The ways and means financing costs over the same period reduced from N 12.8 b to
    Nil while the cash backing time also reduced from 28 days to nil over the same period.

•   NBS made severance payments to retrench 1794 staff at a cost of $ 5.17 mn. The balance
    amount of $ 2.45 mn was utilized for Severance Payments primarily in the FMF. This
    allowed for recruitment of professional staff.

•   Training activities: The capacity building activities in each component resulted in training
    of a large number of government staff, though exact numbers are not fully available. The
    number of trained and professional staff in pilot ministries under component 2 increased to
    85-90% from the earlier 15-20% and similarly the ratio of professional staff in NBS is now
    75% as compared to 25% at the start of the project.

•   BPP: The Bureau of Public Procurement have reported in June 2013 that there have been a
    cumulative value improvement savings of over NGN 420 b from the year 2007 till date
    through the Bureau’s prior review interventions.

    A quantitative assessment of the projects NPV or ERR is not possible due to the fact that
    such an assessment was not conducted at the appraisal stage. Moreover, as an institution-
    building project, it is difficult to determine the rates of return. Given the progress made
    towards achievement of the objectives, the overall Efficiency of the project can be considered
    Substantial in terms of qualitative gains made.

Summary of observations from the borrower’s completion report:

    ACHIEVEMENTS

a) Adoption of more transparent and modern economic and financial
   management systems and processes less prone to corruption:

i      GIFMIS modules such as Budget Execution System (BES) and Treasury single
     Account (TSA) were successful. At project closure, 209 GIFMIS-based BES and TSA
     were implemented in 209 MDAs, exceeding the 120 MDAs target.

ii. Thee-payment system of the TSA and a number of fiscal management tools
    employed by the federal government has yielded an improvement in the average
    monthly balance in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the federal government
    from a deficit of about N100 billion in 2011 to a surplus of N4.16billion in 2012.

iii. EFCC increased convictions and reduced the time cycles used in investigation of
     complex cases. The Commission recorded several convictions rangingrom
     advance fee fraud, money laundering, corruption, bank fraud, capital market
     fraud, pipeline vandalism, etc and made substantial recoveries.

iv. FIRS was      able to      create a modern and efficient Tax                Revenue
    Administration that will enable the government to diversify and increase its revenue
    sources.

v    The IPPIS helped tremendously to restructure the nominal roll, thereby
     addressing the issue of 'ghost workers' in the Federal Civil Service and saving
     billions of naira for the Federal Government. Many States are already putting
     in place measures to replicate this best practice.

vi Civil Society   Organizations were  empowered to               monitor and     raise
   independent reports   on procurement activities of             Federal and     State
   Governments

vii The Federal Executive Council (FEC) adopted the IPSAS Cash Basis
    Standard for application in three tiers of the federation.

viii.The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the private sector has
     also been adopted for the federation.
x. Adoption of cash model of provides for implementation of IPSAS cash basis for
     the accounts of the federation by 2014, with a transition plan for adoption and
     implementation of IPSAS Accrual Basis by 2016.



                                                                                      66
x. The adoption of a competitive bidding process that ensures an even and
   transparent playing field for all parties has led to the saving of billions of naira
   to the Federal Government as well as improved the quality of procured goods
   and services.

xi. Federal Government has institutionalized the preparation of Training Needs
    Analysis (TNA) to ensure that staff are constantly trained in line with their
    responsibilities.

xii.The project pioneered the preparation of the Medium Term Sector Strategy
    through a stakeholder's participation of both Government and Private sectors
    from which our annual budgets are derived, thereby reflecting a wide range of
    views/priorities.

b. Implementation of restructuring plans in pilot MDAs and initiation of
   reforms in other MD As:

i. The operations of the agencies have been greatly enhanced through
   computerization, acquisition and deployment of Enterprise Resource software.

ii. Project Accountants, Auditors, Procurement Officers and Planning, M & E
    Officers as well as those with responsibility to make inputs into the quarterly
    Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) were continuously trained on better
    understanding of the software. This assisted in improving the quality and format of
    financial management and other related reports.


 CHALLENGES

 i.     The World     Bank was dealing directly with          some    agencies without
        consulting with the PC; this led to issues that the agencies could not manage
        and resulted in further implementation delay and inactivity.

 ii.    The HR module of the IPPIS was incomplete. The personnel and payroll systems
        could not be which according to an evaluation, has given rise to the re-
        emergence of discrepancies between the payroll and personnel roll in the six
        IPPIS pilot MDAs. However, the FGN is in the process of professionalizing
        the Human Resource cadre which will guarantee their autonomy and in turn
        enable the fast tracking of the HR module of IPPIS.

 iii.   Lack of initial/onset training     of project implementing teams in
        understanding of the method of operation of the World Bank resulted in initial
        slow implementation.

 iii.   Project Staff turnover - project teams were reconstituted several times during
        the project lifetime due to internal movement and reshufflement.

                                                                                      67
v.      The pool system which entails movement of staff around the government
        agencies made it difficult to evaluate the impact of the training program in
        all the agencies. Trained staff were posted too soon before they could before
        apply the knowledge.

STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINING INITIATIVES AND REFORMS ACHIEVED UNDER
THE PROJECT

i.      "Statistical Trust Fund (STF)", which will serve as a common basket for funding
        statistical operations in Nigeria has been established and is set to sustain the
        initiatives towards the development of statistics.
ii.     There is an on-going Training needs collation from the various MDA's based on
        career path/grades, developed into annual training plan, properly budgeted for
        and implemented.

iii.    Taxpayers are now being issued Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) by way of
        registering them into the tax net. TIN has now been made a prerequisite for doing
        business in the country therefore sustaining the tax administration reforms

iv.     FIRS is at the point of deploying an Integrated Tax Administration Systems
        Solution (ITAS) with a view to fully automating the tax administration.

v.      Program Management offices (PMOs) have been created to manage all reform
        initiatives, while Change Mgt. functions have also been articulated and are
        being manned

vi.     Yearly budget to recognize and give priority to ongoing and long term projects.

vii.    Executive and NASS to provide sufficient Budget and Funding to continue
        supporting the reform after the Bank ceases to fund the ERGP project.

viii.   Ongoing development of a Tool to Monitor Prices of Tendered items and
        Develop a Catalogue for Standard Prices of items.

ix.     On-going implementation of a Databank Management System (e­procurement)
        for the country.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

All teams pursued a coherent and well-articulated strategy that is tied to the Project
Appraisal Document for the ERGP since the beginning of the project. As at the stage
of project closure, the following conclusions are pertinent:

i.      Although the implementation of the Budget Preparation System (BPS) did not
        start during the life of the ERGP, it is being planned for use during the

                                                                                      68
       preparation of the budget for 2014.

ii.    Project  implementation involved close collaboration with             staff of the
       various MDAs to ensure ownership and continuity.

iii.   In future, consultants should use the services of the employees of
       mainstream units and train them to take over responsibility to ensure
       continuity and sustainability (ownership).

iv.    Sensitization and participation of     staff   on   benefit of   reforms   is very
       important for their buy in.

v.     Capacity     Building    is required for improvement in organizational
       performance. Therefore, there is need for continuous training of staff in
       required and identified fields.

vi.    Professionalism is paramount in an organization for better service delivery. vii.
       Institutional reform is important as it makes an organization more strategic in
       the discharge of its mandate.
