                         The project is finally making tangible progress on its largest component - the GIFMIS. The Government and the contractor have recently signed a two-year contract for deployment of
                         the GIFMIS. The aviation agency is bringing the construction of perimeter fences to closure. Both items should lead to rapid acceleration in disbursements under the project.
