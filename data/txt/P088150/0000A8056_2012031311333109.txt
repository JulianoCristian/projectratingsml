                         project's disbursement ratio had improved to almost 70 per cent (from about 60 percent in June 2011).

                         Under the Public Resource Management Component, the project has been able to make some progress on one of its key elements - the installation and operationalization of a
                         Government Integrated Financial Management and Information System (GIFMIS) for the federal government. Following the award of the GIFMIS contract to Hewlett Packard Nigeria

                         Ltd. in May 2011, the delivery of the various hardware, including interconnectivity, to the relevant agencies, are at various stages of progress. The Office of the Accountant-General of
                         the Federation (OAGF) obtained the necessary sign-off from the Budget office of the Federation on the blueprint for the Budget Preparation Sub-System (BPS) in December 2011.
                         Furthermore, Training-of-the-Trainer and end-user training for the Budget Preparation Sub-system (BPS) commenced in November 2011 and User Acceptance Tests and further
                         training took place in December. Training on the Budget Execution Sub-System (BES) has also taken place and though there has been some delay, both the BPS and BES modules
                         of the GIFMIS are expected to be launched before end-February, 2012. Also, with the the enactment of the Financial Reporting Council Act in June 2011, the new Financial
                         Reporting Council of Nigeria was able to conclude arrangements for the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by publicly listed companies in Nigeria from
                         January 2012. Following the enactment of a federal public procurement Act in 2007, a procurement professional cadre has now been established in the federal public service and all
                         MDAs now use the revised National Standard Bidding Documents (NSBD) developed by the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) and which have been endorsed by the Bank for use
                         in Bank-financed projects. The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has been able to overcome earlier challenges encountered in hiring suitable advisers to support its work
                         program. Furthermore, procurement capacity challenges which previously constituted a drag on project implementation in the FIRS have been surmounted and the agency has been
                         able to accelerate on project implementation. Advisers in support of taxpayer services and large taxpayer compliance are currently in place and the agency has completed the
                         building of Internet network connectivity in the eight pilot sites for a centralized Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) system.

                         Under the Civil Service Reform Component, the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) has proceeded to implement a Performance Improvement Facility (PIF) scheme for the
                         federal public service. In the first wave, sixteen Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) will have their innovative service improvement ideas financed under the scheme. The
                         conduct of three civil service-wide diagnostic studies has been much delayed largely by procurement capacity challenges, but BPSR is now on the verge of launching these studies
                         which aim to help define elements for further civil service reforms.

                         The strengthening of statistics component is essentially completed with virtually all funds expended on activities to strengthen the National Statistical System. The National Bureau of
                         Statistics (NBS) now has a more professional workforce and produces more reliable and timely statistics which are published on its website. While there remains a lot of scope to
                         cover, the NBS is way ahead of where it was before the project intervention in terms of data production.

                         Some components/agencies still have much grounds to cover and would need to accelerate implementation over the next one year. Most notable is the Strengthening of External
                         Audit/Office of the Auditor-General for the Federation (OAuGF) component which lost two-and-a-half years of implementation due to a problem with ineligible expenditures. This is
                         more so because this component contributes appreciably to the achievement of the PDO. The Bank PFM team is working very closely with the OAuGF to ensure speedy
                         implementation of this component. Also, the aviation agency has continued to experience delays in completing the construction of perimeter fences and roads at the Abuja and Port-
                         Harcourt Airports despite concerted effort and concessions made by the Bank and the Project Coordinating Unit . The Bank team is therefore being compelled to review the terms of
                         the civil works contracts to see if these contracts can be conveniently recommended for cancellation from the project and the unused funds (about US$4 million) transferred to
                         another component. The Office of the Special Assistant to the President on Civil Society Coordination which had been implementing Procurement Awareness and Capacity Building
                         of Non Government Actors sub-component of the procurement reform was not re-constituted after the new government regime came in to being in May 2011. Thus, this component
                         has stalled. The Bank has recommended a transfer of the responsibility for implementation of this sub-component to the Ministry of Finance.

                         Over the next year, the project will focus on the full roll-out of the GIFMIS (for which about US$23 million is already committed) and other public financial management reforms, as
                         well as further reforms of the tax administration system and the other civil service reforms being led by the Bureau for Public Service Reforms (BPSR). The successful implementation
                         of the GIFMIS will depend a lot on the level of political support the project is able to garner as its implementation involves a major shift to a regime of greater transparency and
                         accountability in government financial management which makes it prone to a lot of resistance.
