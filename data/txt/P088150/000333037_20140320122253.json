Governance Project (ERGP) for Nigeria were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the project design must be flexible enough to\n            adapt to changing requirements over implementation and this\n            was partly demonstrated in ERGP where both Federal\n            Government of Nigeria (FGN) and the Bank continuously\n            reviewed the relevance and need of the activities planned\n            and made changes accordingly. Certain activities overlapping\n            with other projects were dropped and new activities included\n            for agencies that demonstrated good implementation progress\n            and credit proceeds were re-allocated from slow disbursing\n            implementing agencies to higher spending ones. The results\n            monitoring framework in the ERGP changed several times\n            throughout project implementation and there also appeared to\n            be a lack of communication with the implementing agencies\n            that sometimes used indicators that were already dropped.\n            Linkages between the outcome indicators and the PDO was not\n            clear and the extent of achievement the PDO could be\n            assessed only after it was broken down into sub- PDOs and\n            the indicators mapped to these. It is therefore important\n            that a strong and robust monitoring and evaluation system\n            and results indicator framework is put in place for any such\n            capacity building project."}, "docdt": "2014-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
