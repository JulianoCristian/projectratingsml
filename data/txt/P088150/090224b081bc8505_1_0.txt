                         about 88 per cent. The bulk of the un-disbursed funds relate to post-implementation support for the Government Integrated Financial Management and InformationSystem(GIFMIS)
                         and other related costs. It has been previously agreed that the bulk of this amount would be canceled from the project and transferred to the Public Sector Governance Reform and
                         Development Project (PSGRDP) in order to maintain Bank support to GIFMIS. A final project restructuring in this regard is underway.

                         Under the Public Resource Management and Anti-Corruption Component, the project has made further progress. One of the key elements of this component is the installation and
                         operationalization of the GIFMIS for the federal government. Standing out as the greatest achievement in the implementation of the GIFMIS is the successful implementation of the
                         GIFMIS interface with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for Budget Execution (BES) and cash management (Treasury Single Account functionality) now across 209 federal
                         government ministries departments and agencie (MDAs) as of April 30, 2013. Thus, budgetary releases to 209 MDAs are now done from the Central Bank through the GIFMIS and
                         for these 209 MDAs, budget performance reports and monthly financial statements will now available on a real-time basis. This translates to TSA coverage of 79% of public finances
                         at the federal level - a coverage level, which, by all standards, is significant. The use of the system to link MDA expenditures to budget releases as well as to the CBN is beginning to
                         facilitate improvements in the cash management practices of the Federal Government and the IMF’s recent unpublished report on TSA noted that there has been a significant
                         increase in monetary balances compared to previously (due essentially to the linking of the bank accounts in a TSA mode), implying that the Federal government has made material
                         savings through the progressive introduction of a TSA arrangement, in part by interest savings and it is estimated that the quantum of even a single year’s savings would far exceed
                         the overall cost of implementing the GIFMIS. Although the ‘blue-print’ for the Budget preparation System (BPS) has been signed off since November 2013, system implementation
                         has yet to commence. The consensus reached between the GIFMIS project management and the Budget Directorate is to carry forward the start of implementation of the budget
                         module to the preparation time for the budget of 2014 in 2013. Budget releases through warrants are currently being managed by the Budget Directorate for the TSA MDAs through
                         the GIFMIS BES. As soon as implementation of the BPS begins during the budget preparation exercise in 2013, the dictum of Nigeria having and using an integrated financial
                         management information system will become a reality, since budget and treasury systems will be seen to be seamlessly integrated. Also, through ERGP support to the Federal
                         Treasury Academy, a new Public Financial Management (PFM) qualification framework for the Nigerian public service has been developed under which two of a four-stage PFM
                         curriculum are now being delivered at the the Academy. New batches of students under the Certificate, Diploma and Senior Manager's Programs have been admitted in 2013.
                         Furthermore, the Federal Inland RevenueService (FIRS), through the support of key technical advisers and a strengthened Modernization Department supported by the project,has
                         been able to improve on its tax administration, leading to higher capture in the tax net. The number of taxpayers uniquely identified in the tax database continues to increase rapidly
                         and non-oil tax collections have exceeded their targets in recent years. Furthermore, as a result of the current public procurement regulatory framework that has been supported by
                         the project, public procurement policies and practices have shown some improvements: National Standard Bidding Documents developed by the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP)
                         are now being used by government agencies and can even be used in Bank-financed procurements and the BPP publishes federal government contract awards on its website
                         throughout the year. Also, public service capacity to effectively and efficiently manage public expenditure has been significantly strengthened with the creation of a professional
                         procurement cadre in the federal public service. However, the National Council for Public Procurement (NCPP) which is to consider and approve public procurement policies and
                         more generally oversee public procurement remains to be inaugurated, six years after the enactment of the enabling Public Procurement Law. The project also continues to
                         contribute to enhancing the investigative skills of the Economic & Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Financial Intelligence Operatives; contributing to higher numbers of
                         prosecutions, convictions and recovered assets from economic and financial crimes.

                         Under the Civil Service Reform Component,the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) has been implementing a Performance Improvement Facility (PIF) scheme for the federal
                         public service. Thus far, ten Ministries,Departments and Agencies (MDAs) have various innovative service improvement initiatives (mostly ICT-based) being supported under the
                         scheme.Two civil service-wide diagnostic studies which had been much delayed largely by procurement capacity challenges, have now been concluded. The BPSR held stakeholder
                         dialogue sessions in late 2012 and early 2013 to validate the findings of these studies which aim to help define elements for further civil service reforms. More generally, the project

                         has contributed to an improvement in the professional/non-professional staff mix in the project's pilot civil service MDAs.

                         As indicated in most recent ISRs, the strengthening of statistics component is essentially completed with virtually all funds expended on activities to strengthen the National Statistical
                         System. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) now has a more professional staff mix and produces more timely statistics which are published on its website. While there remains a
                         lot of scope to cover in terms of improving the technical expertise and skills of NBS' professional staff as well as the quality of NBS data, the NBS is way ahead of where it was before
                         the project's intervention in terms of data production.

                         Under the airports safety component, the Ministry of Aviation has succeeded in constructing an operational area perimeter fence of 13 km in length as well as additional perimeter
                         roads of 1.8 km in Abuja airport. After much delay, the perimeter fence for Port Harcourt airport has been completed but the road is still yet to be completed. The aviation sector
                         institutional reform study has been completed but is to be validated through a stakeholder workshop. Due to various challenges, this workshop is still yet to take place but will likely
                         take place within the month of May 2013.

                         Most components have been implemented to a substantial extent, but over the final two months, efforts will still be strengthened to accelerate implementation of pending activities.
                         Notably, strategic communication on the GIFMIS by the OAGF needs to be strengthened. Very importantly too, dialogue with the Budget Office of the Federation and Federal
                         Ministry of Finance needs to be strengthened to ensure the BPS application of the GIFMIS during the preparation of the 2014 federal budget which will soon be underway.
