                        PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



  A. SUMMARY

The proposed changes involve: (i) a reallocation of credit proceeds across disbursement
categories in five implementing agencies and (ii) a revision of the project results
framework. The reallocation of proceeds across categories is intended to respond to
current priorities of the Nigerian Government and for the completion of ERGP activities
in need of additional funding while the revision to the project results framework responds
to a review of the framework by Development Effectiveness Unit (AFTDE) which
identified a number of inappropriate result indicators that require fine-tuning or outright
changes.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

The ERGP was approved on December 14, 2004 and became effective on April 25, 2005.
The Memorandum of Understanding for the UK DFID grant co-financing of fourteen
million, three hundred thousand pounds was agreed on July 4, 2006. The project has four
broad areas of support: (i) public resource management and targeted anti-corruption
initiatives (ii) pilot civil service administrative reforms, (iii) Statistics and statistical
capacity and (iv) aviation safety reforms & investments. Nineteen separate Government
agencies are involved in implementation. The DFID co-financing grant closed on August
31, 2010 with a disbursement ratio of 90 percent. UK-DFID co-financing covered support
to budget reform, tax administration, civil service reforms and strengthening of statistics.
As at July 31, 2012, the disbursement ratio of the IDA ERGP credit was about 74
percent. Audit reports and unaudited IFRs have been submitted to date. There is neither
outstanding external audit report nor IFR for any of the implementing entities.

Progress toward the achievement of project objectives has been generally satisfactory,
with a number of components which had initially been off to a slow start now having
picked up considerably over the last one year. Much of the overall success of the project
now hinges on the implementation of the Government Integrated Financial Management
Information System (GIFMIS), which concerns the majority of remaining resources
under the project. The full GIFMIS blue print as designed by the contractor has been
signed-off by government and the Budget Execution Sub-System (BES) has gone ‘live’
in April 2012. Budgetary releases to 93 government departments are now implemented
from the Central Bank through the GIFMIS system. Thus, for these 93 departments,
budget performance reports and monthly financial statements can now be available on a
real-time basis. The Budget Preparatory Sub-System is however yet to be commissioned.

    C. PROPOSED CHANGES

       Results/Indicators

The restructuring introduces changes to indicators for monitoring the project with the
goal of making them clearer and more effective as well as more attuned to the project’s
interventions. Most of these changes were recommended by AFTDE and all of them
agreed to by the government, and formally requested vide their letter of June 29, 2012.
The specific changes are as follows:

1. Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation (OAuGF)

   Elimination of the indicator: "Percentage of audit queries answered" because audit
    queries are issued by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the legislature and
    OAuGF does not obtain the data on audit queries answered.
   Introduction of a new indicator (which is a better measure of OAuGF's performance)
    namely: Backlog of audited annual financial statements of the federal
    government

2. Investments & Securities Tribunal (IST)

   Elimination of the indicator: "Ratio of capital market dispute cases adjudicated as a
    result of IST public enlightenment" because more cases are reported for resolution via
    the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism (like Moral suasion and
    Mediation between the parties) than via formal filing for court process of
    adjudication.
   Introduction of a new indicator: "Capital Market Disputes Case Disposal Rate".


3. Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP)

   Amendment of indicator "Effective procurement regulatory body established (defined
    as effectively enforcing the procurement bill and implementing regulations and
    providing guidance for procurement capacity in the MDAs)" to now read "Effective
    procurement regulatory body established (defined as enforcing the procurement
    law and implementing regulations and providing guidance for procurement
    capacity in the MDAs)".

4. Federal Ministry of Aviation

   Elimination of indicator: "Percentage of recertified operators in the Nigerian aviation
    industry" because it is not in any way a reflection of the agency's performance under
    the project. The project support does not directly touch on airline operators.
   Separation into two of the following indicator "Percentage of Perimeter fences and
    roads constructed in Abuja and Port Harcourt international airports " thus:
     a. Length of perimeter fences constructed in Abuja and Portarcourt airports (in Km)
     b. Length of perimeter roads constructed in Abuja and Portharcourt airports (in Km)


                                             5
5. Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS)

   Amendment of indicator ""Ratio of non-oil tax revenue to non-oil GDP" to read:
    "Growth in real non-oil tax revenue" because the project has no influence on non-
    oil GDP.

6. Economic & Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)

   Amendment of indicator "Amount of economic & financial crime assets recovered (in
    million US$)" to read "Monetary amount of economic & financial crime
    recoveries from prosecuted cases". This is because there are recoveries from non-
    prosecuted cases also, but it is the quality of EFCC prosecutions that the project has
    had an influence on.

7. Ministry of Finance/PCU

   Amendment of indicator: "Number of pilot restructuring plans fully implemented;
    and the number of new MDAs which have produced and are implementing
    restructuring plans" to read "Number of pilot restructuring plans fully
    implemented" because the former is unwieldy as it is actually two indicators ramped
    up in one. Also, although at the inception of the project, it was envisaged that the
    reforms in the pilots would provide lessons for extending reforms to the rest of the
    service; this is really outside the influence and scope of the project.


       Financing

        o Reallocations

           In a letter of July 25, 2012, the Government requested a reallocation of some
           of the remaining project funds across certain categories in line with current
           government priorities.

           Specifically, the government wants to allocate additional funds towards new
           capacity-building priorities for the pilot civil service reform agencies, whilst
           still making funds available for further restructuring of the Ministry of
           Finance, involving the creation of three new units in the Ministry - Oil & Gas,
           Tax Policy and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) financing.

           Within the Economic & Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) component,
           the government wishes to reallocate funds from the consultancy category
           towards the acquisition of polygraph machines (lie detectors), new operational
           vehicles, and renewal of forensic equipment licenses (goods category) as well
           as towards capacity building in certain operational skill areas (training
           category).

           Also, within the Bureau of Public Procurement Component (BPP),
           government wishes to reallocate funds from its goods category towards

                                            6
various activities that will lead to BPP’s completion of its program under the
ERGP. Many of these activities involve the use of consultants and include the
conduct of a number of stakeholders’ workshops for various government
departments and in various parts of the country aimed at increasing awareness
of stakeholders and the general public on the procurement Law, approved
procurement processes and regulations; the 2012 round of sensitization
workshops in the six geopolitical zones of the country; the year 2012
workshops focused on Procurement Planning and the Use of Standard Bidding
Documents and the Bid Evaluation procedures; and the conduct of
procurement hand-holding training in key government departments.

Lastly, Government wishes to reallocate funds towards increasing operating
expenses of the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF)
in rolling-out the GIFMIS.
