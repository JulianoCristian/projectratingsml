Realignment and Strengthening Program Project for Georgia\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: given the scope\n            and pace of education reforms, the three-phase, 12-year\n            Adaptable Program Loan (APL) approach has been shown to be\n            an appropriate instrument for ensuring achievement of the\n            operation's development objectives and long-term\n            sustainability, however, there should be better planning of\n            the duration of each phase. Good sector work and competent\n            technical assistance at the initial stage are crucial when\n            fundamental reforms are expected. The proper combination of\n            investment operations and policy support is a powerful tool\n            for reform support and systemic changes. The Government\n            commitment, as well as clear vision and reform agenda, are a\n            key for the achievement of project objectives. However,\n            greater attention should be paid to achieving public\n            consensus on reform issues. In order to assure successful\n            implementation of reform initiatives, especially the ones\n            characterized by inconsistent societal support, substantial\n            attention should be paid to formation of public opinion.\n            Therefore, a project of similar pace and scope should have\n            included a well-thought and consistent public relation\n            policy assuring wider public dialogue on reform issues,\n            which on its side should have been supported by clear\n            evidences drawn from quality research. Proactive and timely\n            supervision by the Bank's team are crucial for project success."}, "docdt": "2008-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
