The\n            dignified professor, head of the Center for Social Sciences\n            in Tbilisi, gave them a test that was too easy, a test which\n            only nine out of 200 first-year students failed. Her lesson\n            plan was also affected. \"Last year I had to spend two\n            hours explaining methodology. This year the subject was\n            covered in 10 minutes,\" she says. The students'\n            improved caliber is a credit to the new unified university\n            exam which was introduced in Georgia over the course of 10\n            days in July 2005. \"It raised the bar,\" says Roy\n            Southworth, the World Bank\u0092s Country Manager in Georgia.\n            \u0091Only 17,000 out of 31,000 applicants were accepted this\n            year. The challenge now is to provide viable vocational\n            training for those who didn\u0092t make it.\u0092 A new Law on Higher\n            Education made the unified national examinations mandatory\n            for all potential students seeking to enroll in a higher\n            education institution in Georgia. This new requirement seeks\n            to end corrupt transactions between university\n            administrations and potential students. \"The era of\n            corruption in the educational system of Georgia is over. The\n            time has come when hard work and learning are the only way\n            out,\" said Georgia's President Michael Saakashvili\n            on the first day of the new exams."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
