F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The program seeks to improve the quality and relevance of primary and general secondary
students' learning outcomes to better prepare them to meet the demands of a market economy
and a democratic society. Phase 1 of the program would develop the policy and institutional



                                                ii

frameworks required for an effective realignment of the education system, and develop the
capacity of the sector to meet these new objectives and manage its physical, financial, and
human resources equitably, efficiently, and effectively.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
No changes were made to the PDOs.

During the supervision mission in fall 2007, the Bank team and the Government agreed to revise
the Project Results Framework in order to better measure the originally intended outcomes.
The Bank team and the Government realized that the outcome indicator #2 (Policy makers and
education stakeholders use learning outcomes and reliable statistics in their policy analysis and
strategy development) was a higher level indicator, which could be achieved under Phase 2 or 3
but not under Phase 1, where the goal was capacity building essentially, therefore this indicator
was dropped.

At the same time, in order to document achievements in the Higher Education Sector, which
were supported under the Project and were directly related to the second PDO, the new outcome
indicator was agreed (Share of students that perceive university entrance examinations as
transparent) and several output indicators were redefined as well. This new indicator reflected
the Government's major efforts to increase transparency and efficiency in the education system
by the introduction of the University Entrance Examinations, which played a key role in the
reduction of corruption at higher education system.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background

Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The first years of Georgia's
independence were marked by internal armed conflicts, secessionist movements in South Ossetia
and Abkhazia, and a brief civil war. The economy collapsed, real wages fell by 90 percent,
health and education and poverty indicators worsened as a result of drastic cuts in public
expenditures. In mid-1994, the Government embarked on a comprehensive reform program, with
the support of the IMF and the World Bank. Since then, successful structural reforms had been
undertaken to enable private sector development, accompanied by liberalization of prices and
trade, downsizing of budget sector employees, small scale privatization, establishment of a basic
legal framework, as well as land, banking, and energy sector reforms. Thanks to the combination
of sound fiscal and monetary policies and important strides in the development of the structural
reform agendas, real economic growth resumed in 1995 and exceeded 10 percent in 1997.
However, the economic and financial situation deteriorated significantly in 1998 due to a
combination of internal factors and external shocks. Economic performance did not pick up
significantly thereafter and the governance situation worsened. By the early 2000s, there was a
growing view that economic performance and governance were weaker than need be.

Sector Background

The collapse of GDP to 2.9 percent in 1999 from 10.5 percent in 1997, with a subsequent
decrease to 1.8 percent in 2000 and the drastic fall in funding to education to less than 2 percent
of GDP between 1998 and 2002 had put the education sector in Georgia under a serious
challenge. Nonetheless, the Ministry of Education developed an ambitious program that was
endorsed by the 1997 Education Law. The program had a strong focus on improving the quality
and efficiency of primary and general secondary education, strengthening institutional capacity,
and mobilizing public and private resources.

Through this program the Government aimed to address:
(i)     the misalignment of primary and general secondary education system objectives and the
        quality and relevance of student learning outcomes;
(ii)    inefficiencies in the use of financial, physical, and human resources;
(iii)   growing inequities; and
(iv)    weak governance and management capacity.

In spite of inconsistent and precarious funding, commitment to the sector had been shown in
numerous initiatives undertaken by the Government to address those goals, particularly the
efforts towards teacher certification, adjusting salary compensation to teacher qualifications, and
development of new curriculum. The capacity to carry on these ambitious reforms as well as to
introduce the required changes to have a more efficient, effective, and equitable system, was
largely dependent on access to additional financial and technical resources that could provide a
long-term strategic framework to the Government's efforts.


                                                  1

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The 1997 Georgia CAS indicated that one of the major risks to long-term growth was the
deteriorating human capital stock as a result of unequal access and low quality of public
education. Alleviating poverty through improving access and quality of services to vulnerable
groups as well as improving efficient use of limited resources was one of the CAS main
objectives. The CAS also indicated that achieving these goals would require higher spending for
the social sector and assumed that curriculum reform for primary education would be completed
by 1998. The CAS also expected the education program to develop a system for licensing and
accrediting teachers and educational institutions and revise the scholarship system. The Project
was directly supportive of CAS objectives and was to provide the Government the appropriate
support to undertake a systemic reform while at the same time providing the flexibility to adjust
and refine interventions on an on-going basis. The focus of the Project interventions would
address primary and general secondary education (grades 1 to 11).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project constituted the first phase of a three-phase Program which has the objective of
improving the quality and relevance of primary and secondary school learning outcomes to better
prepare students to meet the demands of a market economy and a participatory society. The
specific objectives of Phase 1 of the Program supported by this project are as follows:
(i)    Developing the policy and institutional framework required for an effective realignment
       of the primary and general secondary system;
(ii)   Developing the Borrower's capacity to meet those new objectives and manage its
       physical, financial and human resources equitably, efficiently and effectively; and
(iii)  Supporting project implementation.

Compliance with key performance indicators under Phase 1 of this Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) would function as "triggers" for consideration of a second phase of Bank support. These
triggers included (a) achievement of targets under project-related output indicators as well as; (b)
satisfactory progress towards the design/implementation of a set of policy-oriented activities
aimed at improving the efficiency in the use of resources and the quality of services provided;
and (c) institutional indicators.

As mentioned before, the program has three phases of about four year each. The first phase was
to develop the institutional conditions and local capacity to design and introduce required
policies and interventions to realign system objectives and make more efficient use of resources.
During the second phase, designed policies were to be introduced, interventions implemented,
and policies to improve equity were to be developed. The final phase would seek the
consolidation of policies and changes introduced generalization of interventions nationwide, and
development of policies to address external efficiency.

Performance triggers under the three phases are:
Phase 1: An institutional framework for the effective realignment of system objectives and a
more efficient use of its resources is developed.



                                                 2

Phase 2: New institutional and policy framework to increase efficiency and quality in primary
and general secondary education is implemented; and equity policies developed.
Phase 3: Extension nationwide, consolidation, external efficiency issues begin to be addressed.

Outcome/Impact Indicators for Phase 1:
(1)     75 percent of teachers of primary and general secondary are familiar with new curriculum
        and assessment targets and begin to reflect those changes in their practices.
(2)     Society at large has positive opinion of initiatives undertaken in education.
(3)     Policy makers and education stakeholders use learning outcomes and reliable statistics in
        their policy analysis and strategy developments.
(4)     The administrative structure of the education system performs its functions more
        efficiently and effectively.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

No changes were made to the PDOs. However, there was a revision of the related key indicators.

During the supervision mission in fall 2007, the Bank team and the Government agreed to revise
the Project Results Framework in order to better measure the originally intended outcomes. The
revision of the Project Results Framework was done by the exchange of letters between the Bank
and the Minister of Education and Science. The revised Results Framework did not include
outcome indicator #2 (Policy makers and education stakeholders use learning outcomes and
reliable statistics in their policy analysis and strategy development).

At the same time, in order to document achievements in the Higher Education Sector, which
were supported under the Project and were directly related to the second PDO, the new outcome
indicator was added (Share of students that perceive university entrance examinations as
transparent) and several output indicators were redefined as well. This new indicator reflected
the Government's major efforts to increase transparency and efficiency in the education system
by the introduction of the University Entrance Examinations, which played a key role in the
reduction of corruption at higher education system.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The direct beneficiaries of the 2001-2013 project investments are children, teachers, and
principals. More broadly, all children in primary and general secondary education have benefited
indirectly from more efficient education services as a result of institutional strengthening
activities supported under component 2. This currently represents about 715,000 students in
grades 1-11.

Indirect medium term benefits of the program have accrued from improved efficiency and equity
in the management and delivery of educational services. Through technical assistance provided
under the program, the capacity for policy analysis, planning, and management have been
strengthened at each level accordingly.




                                                   3

Long term benefits will be derived from the projected improvement in the quality of learning as a
result of a better program of primary and general secondary education.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component A: Realignment of the Primary and General Secondary System Objectives
(baseline cost US$20.20 million)

The objective of this component was to realign the objectives of the primary and general
secondary system to deliver a quality and relevant education to its students and improve learning
for all. The Component was to support:
-        Development of national curriculum and related attainment targets for primary and
         general secondary education; and dissemination of national curriculum to education
         stakeholders;
-        Development of national assessment and examination system;
-        Professional Development of Educational Professionals (teachers, methodologists, and
         principals); and
-        Improving access to quality learning materials

Component B: Strengthening Capacity for Policy and Management (baseline cost US$5.09
million)

This component aimed to strengthen the management capacity at central and local level to make
a more effective, efficient, and equitable use of human, financial, and physical resources; begin
to implement interventions in a few districts to improve efficiency, and develop the required
tools to improve decision-making, transparency, and accountability.

The Component was to support:
-        Development of a new financing formula and funding mechanisms, new staff
         management policy, school mapping and consolidation plans, and new standards for
         school buildings and maintenance;
-        Development of a teaching force restructuring and a strategy for its implementation; and
-        Development and implementation of an effective and reliable EMIS.

Component C: Project Management Support (baseline cost US$5.17 million)

The general objective of this component was to provide necessary support, through the provision
of project management services and through implementation of public information/education
strategy, to ensure that basic environment necessary for successful project implementation has
been provided.

1.6 Revised Components

Most of the triggers for Phase 1 of the APL program had been met by mid 2005. Achievements
include an outline of and beginning the implementation of systemic reform; the adoption of new
legislation; the institution of new examination and assessment systems; refining the financing of



                                                4

the general system; improving teacher performance and empowering schools. However, progress
was not adequate in the areas of equity and efficiency under Component B and the disbursements
were slower than anticipated. Therefore, a decision was made to restructure the Project and
extend the Closing Date in order to tighten the program and move investments into a new phase.
The Project activities were strengthened and the Project components were restructured in late
2005. These changes enabled those activities which moved faster than anticipated to continue,
while allowing more time for those activities which were not quite on track. Thus, the
Development Credit Agreement was amended as of October 12, 2005 to reflect the changed
Project description, closing date, as well as reallocation of credit proceeds. The costing of
revised components was based on and equaled to undisbursed Credit amount as of September
2005.

The revised components were:

Component A: Institutional System Change (baseline cost US$0.45 million)

Objective: To ensure that the reorganization of the education system, as outlined in the Law on
General Education, was implemented successfully and that policy decisions were made on the
basis of accurate data.

This component was to complete the EMIS, teachers' personnel management, and per capita
financing activities, and as well as activities on decentralization, data collection and budgeting.

The component was to support: (a) production and publication of annual statistical reports using
data from EMIS for 2004/2005 and 2005/2006 school years; (b) seminars for MoES employees
on data utilization; (c) training on financial management reporting for school level staff; and (d)
development of a human resource strategy for the teaching force including revised pay and
conditions of service.

Component B: Building Quality Assurance System for Secondary Education (baseline cost
US$5.70 million)

Objective: To ensure that an adequate system of monitoring and evaluation at all administrative
levels of the education system was in place, and that the quality of teaching staff was even across
the country (upgraded and qualified teachers were employed).

The component aimed at developing a coherent policy and strategy for the certification of
teachers, as well as a clear cut mechanism for accrediting training courses and curricula offered
by providers and initial teacher preparation programs at higher educational institutions. This was
needed as mechanisms and regulations were out-of-date and could not motivate teachers for the
change process.

The following activities were foreseen under this component: (a) development of draft standards
and methodology for teacher certification; (b) development of draft standards and methodology
for accreditation (in-service teacher training programs); (c) development of draft standards and
methodology for accrediting training programs and curricula; and (d) design of and preparation
for a National Center for Teacher Certification and Standards.


                                                   5

Component C: Impacting School Performance (baseline cost US$4.20 million)

Objective: To ensure that an adequate system of implementation and monitoring the impact of
the reform on school performance was in place.

The Component aimed at fostering the process of concrete implementation of the new education
philosophy promoted by the MoES at grass-roots level. In this framework, the implementation of
the new National Curriculum was seen as a key factor. Basically, this process was to integrate
curriculum, school-based professional development of teachers and school-based formative
assessment of students. This was why this new component should build on the results attained by
restructuring.

Component D: Project Management Support (baseline cost US$1.38 million)

This component was to continue support to PCU, MoES and their staff for the purpose of Project
implementation, as well as to design and implementation of the long-term public awareness on
education reforms.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

The Development Credit Agreement for the Project was signed on April 17, 2001, but the Project
became effective, with significant delay, in April 2003. The closing date of the Project was
extended three times from the original closing date of June 30, 2005 to June 30, 2008.
-      At the time of effectiveness, the country went through the revolution, and after the
       revolution at the end of 2003, the new Government realized that the original closing date
       of June 30, 2005 was not realistic for achieving the PDOs. Therefore they requested the
       closing date extension. The first extension of closing date was approved in September
       2004 with a new closing date of June 30, 2006.
-      The Project was restructured and extended for the second time in September 2005 with a
       new closing date of June 30, 2007.
-      The last extension was agreed in February 2007 to allow the Government to finalize
       rehabilitation works of a building where the National Examination Center, National
       Curriculum and Assessment Center, Teacher Professional Development Center, National
       Accreditation Center and National Science Fund will be located.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Comprehensive sector work was performed to prepare the project. In the process of completing
the sector work and project preparation, a series of studies were conducted that included several
instances of stakeholder consultation. Lessons learned from other World Bank-financed project
were included, for example: (i) Borrower ownership and stakeholders' participation are essential
to ensure the sustainability of projects; (ii) Institutional strengthening; (iii) Focus on teacher
effectiveness and their professional development; and (iv) Focus on learning outcomes.



                                                6

Given the scope and pace of education reforms, the three-phase, 12-year APL approach was
chosen as an instrument for ensuring achievement of the operation's development objectives and
long-term sustainability. The project was tailored to the needs of the country and its economic
environment, focusing on primary and secondary education realignment and strengthening,
inefficiencies, inequities, and weak governance and management capacities, but limiting the first
phase to institutional framework development.

However, it was a complex project, supporting difficult system changes. Given that the
Ministry's capacity was limited, especially given that it had limited prior experience in managing
change, the 3-year implementation period was clearly insufficient for the first phase of this
comprehensive reform. Thus, it was somewhat ambitious on the part of the Bank team to plan for
a first phase of three years, particularly since this was the first project and the political situation
was not stable.

At the same time, the Government was very committed to the Program and Project objectives
and actively participated in the Project preparation. The opportunity to complete sector work
prior to preparing this investment operation gave time to develop trust and constructive dialogue
between the WB staff and MoES officials. In order to enhance collaboration and develop
opportunities for capacity building and ownership, the MoES's designated representatives were
included as part of the project preparation team.

Since the project was rated as High Risk at the time of preparation, the policy and sustainability
issues, as well as mitigation measures, were properly identified.

The quality at entry was reviewed by a World Bank internal "Quality of Entry Assessment"
(QEA) in May 2001 and was rated as "Satisfactory". The QEA panel highlighted strong aspects
of project preparation, such as: good sector work performed to prepare the project; high quality
preparation team that had excellent grounding in the Georgia education sector; and thoughtful
attention to quality issues. The QEA panel also stressed the areas which needed improvements.
These were: weak stakeholder (especially donor) participation; and Ministry's capacity to lead
reform, especially given that it had limited prior experience in managing change.

It must be acknowledged that without the Rose Revolution, and the emergence of a very strong
and committed Minister of Education at the helm of the Ministry, it would have been difficult to
achieve all of the project's ambitious objectives. As it turned out, the Bank was extremely
fortunate that the new Minister embraced the project's vision and actively used the project to
help the new Government implement its reform program. The success of the project, and its
satisfactory outcome, owe much to this unanticipated change of circumstance in the country.

2.2 Implementation

Although all project documents were developed and a solid ground for the implementation was
prepared by Project Effectiveness in 2003, the Government was passive and not ready for
implementation.




                                                  7

After the "Rose revolution" at the end of 2003, the changed political economy was more
conducive to the Government undertaking a set of comprehensive reforms in the education
sector. As a very strong evidence of Government's commitments, the Georgians gave the
Program a local name, the "Ilia Chavchavadze" Program, in honor of the famous Georgian
intellectual.

After a relatively slow start, the Project, by mid 2005, produced some excellent results ­
particularly on the quality side. Links among the teacher training, grant program, and school
network activities provided a solid core of financial and technical inputs to teachers, which were
highly motivating. These provided a favorable climate for the implementation of the new
curriculum. The new curriculum structure was sound and well thought through and much was
accomplished in a short time. In addition, the activities of the National Assessment and
Examination Center (NAEC) in developing and administering assessments tests and in piloting
the new unified university entrance exams were very impressive. Most of the triggers for the
Phase 1 of the APL program were met, with only a few policy issues outstanding.

Despite this technical progress, disbursements were slower than anticipated. The PCU had a
particular problem with financial management at the beginning of implementation. Until late
2004, the PCU did not use to replenish Special Account on timely basis, or was replenishing it
only partially, which several times led to the extremely low balance on the Special Account, and
due to the lack of funds, certain planned activities had to be postponed. Although it was felt
unlikely that all funds would be used by the new extended Closing Date of June 30, 2006, it was
ironic that the majority of triggers for the Phase 2 were on track to be met. A decision to discuss
restructuring and request a further extension (until June 30, 2007) was taken in order to tighten
the program and move investments into a new phase.

After the restructuring, the Project moved faster partially due to the restructuring and partially
due to the reenergized counterparts in the Ministry. The MoES took active steps to adjust the
Project implementation arrangements as the overall education program expanded, including
transitioning some consultants from the Project budget to the MoES budget.

By early 2007, most of the planned activities were on track, with total disbursements of 76
percent. However, there was a considerable delay related to the rehabilitation of a building to
house the new agencies under the Ministry, due to the problem related to the final selection of
the spaces to be allocated to the new centers (within existing building), the procurement process
for the rehabilitation works of this building was launched after considerable delay. Therefore, a
one year project extension (until June 30, 2008) was agreed in order to finalize rehabilitation
activities.

Overall, the effectiveness of project implementation improved throughout the project period and
this was primarily due to the MoES commitment to implement reforms and also due to the
concerted efforts made by the Bank team to address problems and to maintain flexibility in the
approach.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design: Comprehensive quantitative baseline data for key indicators was not collected
before the commencement of the project. Except for the outcome indicator #2, which was
dropped, the Phase 1 triggers, as well as the Project outcome and output indicators were
appropriate in measuring the PDOs. In addition, as stated above, a new outcome indicator was
added to reflect the Government's interest to support higher education.

M&E Implementation and Utilization: The ability to evaluate the project was gradually
strengthened throughout the implementation. A Monitoring and Evaluation system for the overall
project activities was put in place during the last year of project implementation. Only after
restructuring, the PCU hired a project monitoring and evaluation consultant in order to develop
the M&E capacity within the Ministry. The ICR benefited from the numerous studies and
evaluation reports that had been conducted during Project implementation, such as: Evaluation of
School Grant Program; Evaluation of Professional development Program, Social Assessments,
Reports on the implementation of the Unified National University Entrance Examinations as well
as from the comprehensive evaluation done by the Consulting Company PADECO in late 2007.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The environmental category for this project is C. There were no major environmental issues
during the implementation of the project given that no school repairs or construction of school
buildings was envisaged. However, minor civil works to repair the MoES building and provide
adequate office space to PCU staff were carried out during project implementation.

Project implementation was facilitated by the PCU, established within the Ministry of Education,
to implement the project and staffed with experienced staff. In terms of financial audits, the
project financial statements were audited on an annual basis by independent auditors and all
audit reports were unqualified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Given that the Phase 2 Project was approved in April 2006, which became effective in February
2007, the sustainability of the project's post­completion operation is very likely.
-      Continued support for the key project interventions for impacting school performance,
       such as curriculum and teacher reforms. The two new agencies, the National Curriculum
       and Assessment Center (NCAC) and the Teachers Professional Development Center
       (TPDC) have adequate capacity and resources to carry on the implementation of
       curriculum and teacher related reforms.
-      Continued implementation of all activities supported under this Project for building a
       quality assurance system in education, such as participation in international assessments
       and holding transparent university entrance examinations is linked to a formal agency,
       National Assessment Center (NaEC), public legal entity under the Ministry of Education
       and Science. NaEC, initially supported by the APL I project, has developed excellent
       capacity in terms of human capital for carrying out assessment and examinations. The

        center receives adequate budget from the state and also generates its own income at
        present.
-       The MoES is committed to continue strengthening of policy and management capacity.
        The project supported the development and implementation of the new funding system
        for the secondary education system as well as the development of the initial EMIS system.
        Further fine-tuning of the per-capita financing formula and finalization of the EMIS is
        envisaged through the financial support under the new USAID education project and a
        Japanese grant that is accompanying the Phase 2 project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project objectives of developing institutional and policy framework were and remained
highly relevant and consistent with the country's development priorities, the education strategy
and the 1997 CAS, as well as the follow on Country Partnership Strategy approved in 2005.

The Project addressed structural, quality, and financing reforms which have been reflected in the
new legislation and supported implementation of these changes. The Project design reflected
proper diagnosis of development priorities. Nevertheless, the fact that the Project was
restructured in 2005 might put into question the relevance of the original project design. As
already mentioned, the three phase APL approach was the best for addressing pace of systemic
education reforms, but the planning of the initial phase ­ both in terms of duration and capacity
building ­ was not appropriate.

The Bank's implementation assistance was responsive to changing needs and by strengthening
project components and restructuring project activities so that the operation remained relevant to
achieving project objectives.

Furthermore, parallel efforts supported by the Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSO)
further strengthened and enhanced policy dialogue in the education sector of Georgia. The series
of four development Policy Loans, from 2005 through 2008, supported the Government's efforts
to improve the equity of access; financing, and quality of general and higher education; use of
information to strengthen accountability, and policymaking; as well as management capacity.
The progress in implementing the reform program has been impressive. A new financing system
was introduced, the management of the education system was decentralized granting increased
autonomy to schools, and a wide range of measures to improve the quality of education including
transparent national examinations and a regular cycle of national and international assessments
(PIRLS, TIMSS) was implemented.

3.2 Achievement of Project and Program Development Objectives

Achievement of Project Development Objectives:

Project objectives were: (i) to develop the policy and institutional framework required for an
effective realignment of the primary and general secondary system, and (ii) to develop the



                                                10

Borrower's capacity to meet these new objectives and to manage its physical, financial, and
human resources equitably, efficiently, and effectively.

Objective 1: Policy and institutional framework required for an effective realignment of
the primary and general secondary system developed.

Achievement level: Significantly achieved.

This objective is closely related to the first and second outcome indicators ­ the first outcome
indicator is 75 percent of teachers of primary and general secondary is familiar with new
curriculum and assessment targets and begins to reflect those changes in their practices.

First outcome indicator was substantially achieved as evidenced by progress made against the
following indicators:
(a)    Fully achieving output indicator 1: National Curriculum Framework has been developed.
       Piloting of the new curriculum in grades 1, 7, 10, and 2, 8, 11 was successfully piloted in
       2005/2006 and 2006/2007 academic years and implementation is underway in all schools
       across the country. Piloting of the new curriculum for grades 3 and 9 was launched in
       September 2007 in 100 pilot schools. The second phase of the APL will continue to
       support the implementation of new curriculum in subsequent grades (4, 5, and 6).
(b)    Fully achieving output indicator 2 and 3: Institution for monitoring and evaluation of
       education quality has been established on a sustainable basis. Ninth grade examinations
       in Math, Georgian Language, and Foreign Language were conducted twice in 2002 and
       2003. The national sample-based assessment of 4th graders in Georgian language was
       conducted in September 2003 and in Math in May 2004. Results were widely
       disseminated with education stakeholders.

In addition, the project successfully supported:
(c)    Implementation of the School Networking Pilot Program; school based teacher training;
       and school learning grants;
(d)    Provision of learning materials; and
(e)    Provision of library packets for rural schools.

By contrast:
(f)    Output indicator 8 was only partially achieved: although the EMIS was developed and
       has been institutionalized in the new statistics department, it did not create data collection
       framework required for an effective realignment of the primary and general secondary
       system - major shortcoming is the lack of an overall information infrastructure plan
       underpinning the EMIS. Currently, the EMIS includes only data on general secondary
       education and lacks a strategy on how to integrate the data across the other education
       levels (such as preschool, tertiary and vocational education). In addition, several large
       databases are operational in various departments of the Ministry (budget/expenditure
       data; National Examination Center data; National Accreditation Service on-line database)
       without a clear understanding on how to relate these databases in the future.




                                                11

The second outcome indicator is - Society at large has positive opinion of initiatives undertaken
in education - and this outcome indicator was fully achieved by:
Survey evidence shows that 68 percent of respondents support ongoing education reform.

Objective 2: Borrower's capacity to meet these new objectives and to manage its physical,
financial and human resources equitably, efficiently and effectively developed.
Achievement level: Substantially achieved.

This objective is closely related to the fourth and fifth outcome indicators - the fourth indicator is
the administrative structure of the education system performs its functions more efficiently and
effectively - and this outcome indicator was substantially achieved as evidenced by progress
made against the following indicators:
(a)       Partially achieving indicator 9: The Government developed basic criteria for merging
          schools and approximately 1,000 schools have been merged administratively.
(b)       Substantially achieving indicator 10: New policies have been adopted by the Government
          to provide a basis to strengthen the qualifications and certification of teachers as well as
          accreditation of ITE and TPD programs. Amendments were made to general education
          law, which provides for the development and implementation of teacher certification
          system. But student-teacher ration is still 11/1 average.
(c)       Fully achieved indicator 11: Per capita funding formula was developed for primary and
          general secondary education and is being implemented by the Government of Georgia.
          For roughly 66 percent of schools, per capita is the sole source of financing.

The fifth outcome indicator is ­ Increased share of students that perceive university entrance
examinations as transparent - and this outcome indicator was fully achieved by:
Post­exam public opinion survey on attitudes towards the University Entry Examinations,
conducted by Transparency International, showed that 81 percent of students believe that
University Entry Examinations will help to eliminate corruption in the university admission
process.

Public opinion poll conducted in fall 2007, showed that 78.2 percent of the respondents support
University Entry Examinations.

Summary: The overall achievement of the project development objectives is rated as
substantial.

Achievement of Program Objectives

The overall Program objective to improve the quality and relevance of primary and secondary
school learning outcomes to better prepare students to meet the demands of a market economy
and a participatory society should be fully achieved by the end of the full three-phase Program
implementation.

Progress under the Phase 1 of the project was such that the triggers for the second phase of the
APL were met or exceeded, with the exception of the trigger on the action plan and incentives to
increase the average student-teacher ratio to 16/1 by 2010.

As mentioned earlier, the achievement of PDOs were also supported by parallel efforts of the
Development Policy Loans. The series of four development Policy Loans, from 2005 through
2008, supported the Government's efforts to improve the equity of access; financing, and quality
of general and higher education; use of information to strengthen accountability, and
policymaking; as well as management capacity.

Under the first PRSO, the following measures were achieved: (i) nationwide university entrance
examinations were introduced to ensure accountability at the higher education level; (ii) the
impact of examinations and assessments was expanded through the development of quality

assurance arrangements for the school system, including recommendations for classroom level,
institutional level and national level methods of evaluating quality; (iii) the basis for a more
efficient and equitable use of resources was established through improved legal and
administrative arrangements for the introduction of a per capita formula for education financing,
including the specification of accountability relationships, provisions for noncompliance and
financial reporting procedures; and (iv) a new data collection system was put in place and data
on enrollment, attendance, drop-out and completion rates in basic education at all territorial
levels were collected for 2004-2005.

The second PRSO supported the following measures: (i) Georgia participated fully in the current
TIMSS and PIRLS international assessments; (ii) national assessments were implemented in
selected subjects in the 4th and 9th grades, and work was initiated to develop tools and guidelines
for the schools for conducting interim and graduating examinations; (iii) satisfactory progress
was achieved in developing prototype quality assurance arrangements for the general secondary
system, including student assessments at the classroom level and the establishment of
mechanisms for institutional and staff accreditation and licensing systems; (iv) a per capita
financing formula was adopted and rolled out nationwide; (v) a monitoring system and a
financial and performance monitoring report were being developed; and (vi) collection and the
corresponding analysis of education data including MDG data, were under way and an action
plan of targeted programs was being developed to identify issues and the corresponding remedial
actions.

During the third PRSO, the Government developed an action plan aimed at (i) revising the per
capita financing formula and (ii) adopting the necessary monitoring and accountability
arrangements for the new system.

Under the fourth PRSO, the following was accomplished: (i) Systematic quality assurance
arrangements under implementation for the entire school system, including: (a) transparent
national examinations; (b) a regular cycle of national and international assessments (including
the analysis of the preliminary results of TIMSS and PIRLS and the defining remedial actions as
needed; and (c) the establishment of mechanisms for institutional accreditation and staff
certification, which would provide the education community with reliable information about the
quality of the system; and (ii) Action Plan under implementation for further improvement of the
per capita financing scheme, which will accommodate the needs of various types of schools and
provide for increased accountability and transparency in the system.

3.3 Efficiency

Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return

The Project objectives of developing the policy and institutional framework and building
capacity make it difficult to use a conventional efficiency argument about whether a given
amount of money could be spent more wisely to achieve the same objective.

Nevertheless, the comprehensive reforms in the education sector appear to have contributed to
improvements in the efficiency of using public funds for education. The achievements since 2003
include: (a) the administrative merge of schools process has reduced the number of school


                                                 19

administrations. The number of schools, as legal entities, was reduced from 3,154 to 2,331; and
(b) the new per capita financing scheme has increased transparency and fairness in financial
resources allocations.

The reform efforts have also contributed to improvements in access to education. The
achievements here since 2003 include: (a) gross enrollment rates in basic education are almost
universal at 96.4 percent; and (b) enrollment rates in postsecondary education increased from 45
percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2006. Indeed, Georgia currently enjoys the highest enrollment
rates for vocational and university education in the Caucasus.

The reforms have also contributed to improvements in the quality of education. The
achievements here since 2003 include: (a) the share of children who were absent from school due
to lack of heating at school decreased significantly from 37 percent to 15 percent; (b) only 35
percent of students between 9 and 10 years old mastered tasks that require the process of
retrieving implicitly stated information from a certain part of a text, and interpreting and
integrating ideas and information; this ranking increased to 45 percent (based on the comparison
of PIRLS 2006 and national assessment in mother tongue in 2003); and (c) school approval rates
for basic education improved from 53 percent to 57 percent.

It can be noted; however, that all this was achieved for a relatively small investment of US$26
million and those outcomes far exceeded the costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome is rated satisfactory for the following reasons. First, in terms of relevance,
the project was highly relevant both in terms of the CAS and in terms of the Government's
overall strategy and objectives. Second, in terms of achieving its stated objectives, the first
objective was fully achieved, and the second substantially achieved. Taken together, the project
achieved its objectives with only moderate shortcomings. Third, in terms of efficiency, the
project did demonstrate that for a relatively small amount of money a lot can be achieved.
Fourth, although the project's total expenditure over seven years make up a very small
proportion of the total education budget, it affected every school in the country via per capita
funding mechanism, as well as via curriculum development and teacher training.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project was instrumental in building capacities for institutional change, particularly in the
areas of finance and governance of education institutions. Some of the key activities and
innovations supported by the project have been institutionalized into the new legislation
promoting decentralized management and increased efficiency and transparency of the education
system.




                                                20

These include:

(i) Support for the development and implementation of the per student financing formula for
secondary education system, which was adopted and implemented by the Government across the
country converting schools to autonomous legal entities of public law with Boards of Trustees
and flexibility in budget management.

(ii) Education Management Information System supported by the project continues to provide
education data for the Ministry, relevant institutions, and stakeholders.

(iii) Support for the establishment of National Education Centers, such as National Examination
Center (NaEC), the Teachers Professional Development Center (TPDC) and National
Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC), public legal entities under the Ministry of
Education responsible for carrying out the Ministry's policies in the areas of assessments and
examinations, curriculum and teacher development. The NaEC is now financed by the State
Budget and has adequate capacity to provide reliable information on student learning outcomes
for informed policy making and guarantee transparent access to higher education through
administering standardized national university entrance examinations.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

There is strong evidence that the priorities of the project will remain Government priorities in the
future. Indeed, some of the key project benefits have already been mainstreamed in legislation
adopted during the project life, as outlined above.

One indicator which suggests that risks to the sustainability of the PDOs are moderate is that
strategy and action plan for further development of EMIS is still not in place. Furthermore,
staffing of the EMIS unit continues to be inadequate in terms of numbers of staff and the
available skill sets and knowledge.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

As mentioned earlier, given the scope and pace of education reforms in Georgia, a three-phase,
12-year APL approach appears to have been a very appropriate instrument for ensuring
achievement of the operation's development objectives and long-term sustainability.
Furthermore, the team completed solid sector work in preparation for the project, using wisely
the advice from peer reviewers and paying thoughtful attention to quality issues, including a
focus on classroom- and school-level issues. However, the initial delays and the three extensions
of the Project Closing Date indicate that there should be more careful planning of the duration of
each phase.


                                                 21

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The supervision of the project was not an easy task, particularly because there were frequent
changes in the Bank Team Leaders and particularly given the very volatile and uncertain political
environment in Georgia. In 2003, Georgia underwent the "Rose Revolution" at which time the
project was just beginning to move forward. Therefore, the final achievements of the project are
that much more substantial and the Bank's active and flexible role in the process helped to
ensure this outcome. Throughout the project, the Bank team was proactive in supporting the
main counterparts and the PCU in implementing the project. The permanent presence of the WB
staff in the Country office provided for continuity and helped to support ongoing supervision of
project implementation, as well as a continuous policy dialogue with main counterparts. Problem
areas were identified and discussed realistically in Aide-Memoires and Implementation Status
Results and Reports. Despite the setbacks, the funds were fully disbursed and, as discussed
elsewhere, the objectives achieved.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance during project preparation, appraisal, and supervision is rated as
satisfactory. Good technical expertise was provided and the client was appreciative of the advice
and guidance. The team successfully overcame some significant obstacles and provided practical
solutions to ensure that the project's objectives were met.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the Government varied significantly between the early and later stages of the
project. There were shortcomings in the Government's performance in the early stages of the
project demonstrated in the Ministry's micro-management and problems and delays with
counterpart funding. Nevertheless, with the new Government in 2003, the cooperation and
coordination between the political leadership and project management was strengthened and
improved. The Government demonstrated its full commitment to program objectives by
accelerating implementation of the project and moving forward rapidly with the important sector
wide reform agenda achieving good results. Particularly noteworthy was that the project was
integral part of the Government's vision and reform agenda.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Implementing Agency's performance was also varied between the early and later stage of
the project implementation. During the initial years, both the MoES and the PCU lacked
sufficient capacity in management and coordination. Furthermore, disbursements were slow due
to lack of capacity and experience resulting in several extensions of the project.



                                                 22

However, after the MTR, the staffing of the MoES and the PCU has been strengthened
significantly; and the PCU managed the project well and provided effective communication
between the World Bank and education institutions involved in the project.

The performance of the MoES is rated as satisfactory by this ICR. The implementing agency
managed the Project well and provided effective communication between the World Bank and
education institutions involved in the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory.

Overall, this ICR's assessment of the Borrower's performance is rated as satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Reflecting on the overall project, the key lessons that have been learned and/or reinforced during
project implementation are as follows:

Given the scope and pace of education reforms, the three-phase, 12-year APL approach has been
shown to be an appropriate instrument for ensuring achievement of the operation's development
objectives and long-term sustainability, however, there should be better planning of the duration
of each phase.

Good sector work and competent technical assistance at the initial stage are crucial when
fundamental reforms are expected.

The proper combination of investment operations and policy support is a powerful tool for
reform support and systemic changes.

The Government commitment, as well as clear vision and reform agenda, are a key for the
achievement of project objectives.

However, greater attention should be paid to achieving public consensus on reform issues. In
order to assure successful implementation of reform initiatives, especially the ones characterized
by inconsistent societal support, substantial attention should be paid to formation of public
opinion. Therefore, a project of similar pace and scope should have included a well-thought and
consistent public relation policy assuring wider public dialogue on reform issues, which on its
side should have been supported by clear evidences drawn from quality research.
Proactive and timely supervision by the Bank's team are crucial for project success.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The following comments, received by the Implementing Agency, have been incorporated in the
final ICR.



                                                 23

"Following your letter dated December 18 2008, wherein you presented a draft version of the
Implementation Completion and Result Report for Georgia Education System Realignment and
Strengthening Program (ICR), we would like to communicate to you our approval of the report
overall and suggest a few corrections iterated below.

The Implementation Completion and Results report provided by your party offers an exhaustive
analysis of Georgia Education System Realignment and Strengthening Program implementation.
The appraisal of the indicator achievement was highly objective as well as the performance of
both parties. The report also provides a very accurate account of project implementation process.
The availability and comprehensiveness of the project interim and final evaluation reports made
it possible for the two sides to make comparable judgments on the results achieved throughout
the program implementation. Achievement made in most of the project development objectives
were appraised as satisfactory, few were evaluated as moderately satisfactory or partly
satisfactory. Both sides rated Georgian Government and the Bank performance as satisfactory.
While the sustainability of the achieved objectives is safeguarded by the existence of formal
agencies, the areas in need for continued support have been addressed either under the APL # 2
(curriculum and teacher related reforms) and other donor interventions (voucher financing
formula and EMIS).

We would also like to submit our comments for your consideration in the completion of the final
version of the Report.

1.  Context at Appraisal
1.1.    Education expenditure figures to be revised

In the ICR document, where project context is thoroughly analyzed, it is stated that the
expenditure on education fell to 2% of GDP between 1990 and 1994.

1.1. Comment: We would like to suggest using later dates for reference. This suggestion is based
on two considerations. Firstly, we would think that using later dates which are closer to the
program launching would be more appropriate. Secondly, earlier figures on education
expenditure as a percentage of GDP are more controversial than later ones. Taking into account
these considerations, we would like to suggest using the data about public expenditure on
education for years between 1998 and 2002 which is 2% of GDP. We might also need to
consider that the rate of GDP growth in 1999 fell to 2.9% from 10.5% in 1997, with a subsequent
decrease to 1.8% in 2000. Inflation in 1999 surged to 19.2%, but decreased to 4% in 2000.
Suggestion: The above stated considerations should be accommodated in the report in order to
make the information provided on the context of the program initiation more comparable.

2. Lessons learned


2.1 Greater attention should be paid to achieving public consensus on reform issues.

2.1. Comment: Taking into consideration the level of achievement on indicator 2, which
measures the societal disposition towards the reform initiatives, we would like to suggest adding
one statement as a lesson that we have drawn from the program implementation. In order to



                                                24

assure successful implementation of reform initiatives, especially the ones characterized by
inconsistent societal support, substantial attention should be paid to formation of public opinion
and full understanding of intentions of the reform implementing agencies among reform target
groups as well as the wider public. Therefore, a project of similar pace and scope should have
included a well-thought and consistent public relation policy assuring wider public dialogue on
reform issues, which on its side should have been supported by clear evidences drawn from
quality research.

2.2. Baseline research was not included in the program.

Paragraph 2.3 on Monitoring and Evaluation in the ICR describes the formal monitoring and
evaluation procedures for the activities carried out within the scope of the project.

2.2. Comment: Comprehensive quantitative baseline data for key indicators was not collected
before the commencement of the project. Due to the absence of such data, findings from the
evaluation of Phase 1 of the project could not be effectively used to measure the progress and the
scope of changes after the project onset. These findings can serve as baseline for further studies
and evaluation of the following phases. At the same time, the need for collecting baseline data
for every project component should be emphasized.

2.3. Program final evaluation was incorporated in the program on the request of the
Borrower.

2.3 Comment: The final evaluation was not initially included in the program. However, on the
request of the Ministry of Education and Science, the Bank made necessary amendments in the
program and a study was carried out on the completion of the program. The evaluation served as
a very useful tool for acquiring data to measure the program outputs and outcomes according to
previously set indicators. Another lesson that could be drawn from the same experience is that
maintaining flexibility in the course of the program is very important to assure that the program
adequately responds to newly emerged or identified needs.

2.3. Suggestion: The above suggested comments should be considered for including them in the
lessons learned. We are submitting our comments for your consideration and hope to have them
incorporated in the final report.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The annex will focus on outputs of restructured Components at the end of the Project, but will
consider expected outputs as originally designed. Actual costs of restructured Components are
calculated based on funds spent for each project activities from the beginning of the project.

Component A: Institutional System Change (actual costs US$1.90 million)

Establishing Personnel Policies and Incentives Structure for Teachers

The achievements of this subcomponent were significant.

New policies have been adopted by the Government to provide a basis to strengthen the
qualifications and certification process of teachers. The Teachers Professional Development
Center was established. Amendments were made to the general education law, which provide for
the development and implementation of teacher certification system. Teachers had long suffered
from their meager wage level, which was exacerbated by the frequent and often prolonged delay
in disbursement. As part of the reform, the Ministry introduced the new teacher pay scheme to
calculate the minimum level of remuneration for each teacher with the aim of raising the general
salary level of teachers in Georgia in order to retain and attract qualified and competent teachers.

The new pay scheme for teachers has been in effect for three years now. As a result, the
minimum salary level almost doubled with the current average salary at 200 GEL. The Ministry
intends to increase this figure in response to the changing social and economic circumstances in
the country.

Notwithstanding the above increase in remuneration, teachers remain unsatisfied with the salary
levels as shown in the evaluation report by the PADECO team. The current salary level is still
viewed as unsatisfactory as compared to other public sector occupations.

Implementing Per Capita Financing Formula

The achievements of this subcomponent were significant.

Georgia conducted a massive school network consolidation process in preparation for and as a
precursor to the implementation of per student financing. In conjunction with decentralizing
several aspects of school management down to the school, the closure and opening of schools
was defined as one of the functions of the Ministry of Education. Therefore, prior to introducing
per student financing in the country, the Ministry began a process that remains ongoing on a
smaller scale of reducing the number of schools from 3,153 in 2005 to a target of 1,800 schools
(the number of schools in 2007 was down to 2,227). The target total number of schools was
established based on criteria for network optimization. Examples of these criteria include
proximity to a large school (especially in the cities), unsustainable small schools with possibility
to transport students to a larger school (in particular, availability of roads in the mountains and
countryside), and small primary schools (which were transformed into affiliated schools



                                                 27

subordinated to a larger full secondary institution). In this regard, the Ministry purchased a
number of buses for transportation of children to consolidated schools.

Per capita funding system of general schools was introduced with the aim to ensure a more
transparent and fair allocation of funds to schools and efficient spending, as well as to make the
financial status of schools comparable across school sizes and school types.
-       The introduction of the per capita funding system has had positive effects on the financial
        status of schools;
-       The system was introduced at the same time as the overall increase of funding for general
        education. It is difficult, therefore, to evaluate the effects of this system separately;
-       Schools are receiving funding without delays and distributing staff salaries without
        delays as well;
-       Compared to the old system, schools now have capacity to spend more on non-salary
        expenditures: for the improvement of learning environment and for physical maintenance
        of schools;
-       Most schools are paying incentive bonuses or more than minimal salaries to teachers;
-       Schools in most cases are not spending per capita funding for capital repairs;
-       The ratio of salary/non-salary expenditure has become more comparable now across
        urban, rural and mountainous schools as well as across school sizes. However, sizeable
        disparity still remains;
-       Small schools that are receiving small school subsidies are still spending in most cases
        the whole amount of per capita funding on staff salaries. Their financial status has not
        improved as of the rest of the schools; and
-       Schools in rural and mountainous areas are far less experienced in applying for funds
        from outside sources.

Implementing Education Management Information System (EMIS) and Ensuring that
Reliable Data are Available for Policymaking

The achievement level of this component was low: in many ways. This component was the least
successful of the project because it failed to support both of the project's objectives.

It did not create data collection framework required for an effective realignment of the primary
and general secondary system - major shortcoming is the lack of an overall information
infrastructure plan underpinning the EMIS. Currently, the EMIS includes only data on general
secondary education and lacks a strategy on how to integrate the data across the other education
levels (such as preschool, tertiary, and vocational education). In addition, several large databases
are operational in various departments of the Ministry (budget/expenditure data; National
Examination Center data; National Accreditation Service on-line database) without a clear
understanding on how to relate these databases in the future. An overall information
infrastructure plan is needed to integrate the various databases into compatible modules of the
EMIS.

Therefore, the subcomponent failed to develop the Borrower's capacity to meet these new
objectives and to manage its physical, financial, and human resources equitably, efficiently and
effectively.



                                                    28

Using EMIS-data, the first report, "Secondary Education in Georgia: Education Data and
Trends," was published in September 2007. The report provides data on ten education indicators
related to general secondary education. However, the reliability of the data presented and the
coverage of education related indicators in the report are questionable. Primary enrollment and
completion rates are indicated at nearly 100 percent, which stands in contrast with other
international sources on the same indicator (UNESCO, IMF) and recent report elaborated by the
Government to join the Fast Track Initiative.

Furthermore, frequent turn-over of staff in the department and lack of institutional memory have
been additional constraints.

Component B: Building Quality Assurance System for Secondary Education (actual costs
US$11.29 million)

The achievements of this component were significant.

Within the framework of the program, the Ministry set up the assessment component. The staff
of the component was sent to the Netherlands, where they did the professional training and
participated in preparing the program. Initially, there were two subject groups in the component
(Georgian Language and Mathematics), which were assigned to prepare National Examinations
for primary schools. A Modern Foreign Language (English, German, French, and Russian) group
was added later. In 2001, a nationwide piloting of the Examination tests was carried out in all
three subjects. In 2002, the National Examinations were carried out in Georgia for the first time.
In 2003, new centralized examinations were piloted in two regions of Georgia. The NAEC was
established in 2002.

Although the capacities to carry out national assessment were fully developed within the NAEC,
the MoES decided to transfer responsibility for the assessments to the National Curriculum and
Assessment Center (NCAC) in 2005.

This decision was highly criticized by the Bank at that time. The NCAC does not have the
capacity or strategy to properly carry out assessment activities. Furthermore, the assessment
function should be separated from curricula development to avoid the situation where the same
institution creates the system and evaluates its own creation.

However, the National Examination Center, as a well established institution, continued to be in
charged of international assessments (Georgia participated in PIRLS 2006 and TIMSS 2007),
School Principals' Exams, Teacher Certification Exams, and as a main activity, the University
Entry Examinations.

The University Entry Examinations has been conducted for the first time in 2005. Based on
Transparency International reports, this activity was one of the biggest achievements of the
Project in supporting reforms in governance and anti-corruption policies. Related PDO indicator
was introduced in 2007.

Participation in TIMSS and PIRLS has allowed the benchmarking of Georgia relative to other
countries in the area of education. PIRLS results are being analyzed and will be published in a
report by the National Examination Center; "Literacy ­ Results of PIRLS 2006 in Georgia") in
2008. TIMSS results will be available in December 2008. The ongoing monitoring of service
quality and informal payments in schools, as well as other point-of-service delivery surveys is
giving the Government tools for actively monitoring the impact of the reforms on the quality of
and access to education.

Component C: Impacting School Performance (actual costs US$18.01 million)

Development, piloting and implementation of a national curriculum and related attainment
targets for primary and general secondary education

The achievements of this subcomponent were significant.

The National Curriculum Framework has been developed. The new curriculum is outcomes-
oriented, designed to encourage active learning rather than mechanical transfer of knowledge.
The new curriculum in grades 1, 7, 10, and 2, 8, 11 was successfully piloted in 2005/2006 and
2006/2007 academic years and implementation is underway in all schools across the country.
Piloting of the new curriculum for grades 3 and 9 was launched in September 2007 in 100 pilot
schools.

Teachers acknowledge that availability of new textbooks oriented on integrated learning and
practical tasks enables students to work more independently than before the reforms. They also
stated that the level of collaboration in the classroom have improved among students of different
performance levels during the lesson. The new curriculum enables more opportunities for an
interactive classroom.

Evidence is suggestive that student learning outcomes have improved as a result of implementing
the new curriculum and introduction of new methods during the last 2 years. Eighty-seven
percent of teachers (survey by PADECO consulting team) stated that they agree or strongly agree
that student learning has increased using the new methods. Teachers also note that pupil
involvement has increased when using the new methods. Parents pointed out that students are
more motivated and that they observe improvement of their children learning outcomes. The
survey reinforced the above statement based on teachers' responses. Most teachers (81 percent)
agreed that student learning outcomes improved while implementing the new curriculum during
last 2 years.

One potential area of concern with the new national curriculum is whether smaller schools,
particularly those in mountainous areas that are unlikely to consolidate, recognize sufficient
flexibility in the grade-by-grade approach to the curriculum to become more efficient. For small,
mountainous schools, potentially greater efficiency could take on the nature of using a phased
curriculum across a few grades each year and teaching multiple grades in the same classrooms.

Another issue of concern is that upper grade students headed to the university are studying only
for the university entrance tests.

Textbooks and Learning Materials (renamed to Improving Learning Environment in Schools):

The work under this component provided significant contribution to the development of
standards, mechanisms, and procedures for textbook and teaching and learning materials
provision.

Prior to restructuring, the component provided supplementary materials to all schools in 2002-
2004 through exhibitions held twice in 2002 and 2004. All schools had an opportunity to select
learning materials for their school based on the defined requirements for their schools. Piloting
of textbook rental scheme in 54 districts was also supported under this component. The pilot was
only partially successful and the Ministry is supporting schools who wish to run such schemes
under their own self-government.

At a later stage, the component was merged with the curriculum component and played a key
role in the development of new textbooks. Piloting of the new national curriculum encompassed
an integrated process of textbook development through working closely with the publishers and
teachers throughout the entire pilot year. A wide range of teacher materials (such as, videos on
"Student Centered Teaching"; bi-monthly bulletins; training materials) were developed to
support teachers to gain adequate skills and knowledge to successfully deliver the new
curriculum.

The component also financed provision of primary level of libraries to a selected number of
schools as well as provision of mobile science labs to all Education Resource Centers across the
country.

Teacher Training, School Grants and School Networking

The achievements of this subcomponent have been significant.

The results indicate considerable successes from the school-based teacher training efforts and the
training efforts for new curriculum given how far they have come in very few years.

School-based Teacher Professional Development: By 2005, significant number of teachers in the
country has been trained through cascade training. The cascade trainings of teachers were the
first attempt to really bring to schools some innovation and to attempt to divert from the teaching
methods prevalent in the Soviet Era. The school-based teacher training process started
successfully with the initial training by 100 "top trainers." However, direct mechanism for the
spread of learning to teachers who were not trained was not designed explicitly. The project
provided an annual regional conference for teachers involved, sharing their experiences and
exhibiting their examples for project participants and non-participants who chose to attend.
Further, all participating schools received a copy of all training materials in addition to those
provided to the trained cohort. Directors were not explicitly required or encouraged to attend the
trainings.

School Networking/Resource Centers: The School Network Program, as a part of the school-
based Teachers Professional Development Program was designed and implemented to promote


                                                31

collaboration and information sharing among schools. The schools that succeeded in the School
Grant Program Phase 1, were involved in both the school-based teachers professional
development cycle and establishment of school networks. The idea was to support fostering
further professional development of teachers within and across school communities.

One of the main tasks was to encourage as many teachers at school as possible to become part of
the school network initiative and start communicating and sharing their ideas how to overcome
different challenges associated with the teaching and learning process. The duration of the
program was a year. The number of schools was not expanded after the initial involvement, and
no formal follow-on activities were designed, although anecdotal evidence indicates that some
schools continued networking activities.

The School Grant Program: The Program was established as a related program to the School
Network Program. Its goal was to assist schools with teaching and learning within the school as a
part of teachers professional development effort through providing grants that would allow the
schools to develop novel learning programs. Two hundred ten schools received school grants of
$1,000 for the improvement of quality of teaching and learning as a result of participation in the
first round of the School Grant Program and additional 213 schools were awarded with grants of
$3,000 during the second round of competition. These grants provided the potential for small
improvement of material conditions for teaching and learning in those schools.

By the establishment of the Teacher Professional Development Center in 2005, the Teacher
Training component went to two directions: Curriculum Reform-based Teacher Professional
Development and Teacher Certification.

Curriculum Reform-based Teacher Professional Development: One of the key challenges for the
curriculum reform has been supporting teachers to gain adequate skills and knowledge to
successfully deliver new curriculum. The curriculum-focused training built on the capacity
developed under the earlier school-based teacher professional development. Furthermore, it also
added more discussion on theories of learning, assessment, standards for each subject, portfolios,
and outcome-based learning added to curriculum training.

Teacher Certification and accreditation of initial and continuous teacher professional
development programs: Within the framework of secondary educational reform, the Ministry of
Education and Science of Georgia has assigned the Teacher's Professional Development Center
to develop and implement the Teacher Certification System. The TPDC has developed the draft
teacher professional development standards, which defines the key skills and competencies for
teachers and serves as a basis for teacher certification. The TPDC is supported by the National
Examinations Center, which is in charge of conducting the teacher certification examinations.
For this purpose, the Center hired several experts and prepared a relevant project, which
determines the principles and forms of teacher certification examinations. Based on these
standards, the Center should develop unified and objective methods for teacher certification
examinations. The works for creating teacher certification tests are under way and the
examinations are supposed to take place in 2010. The TPDC, in close collaboration with the
National Accreditation Center, is making good progress in the development of standards for the
accreditation of the initial and continued professional development programs.

Continued support to teacher certification and accreditation of teacher education programs is
ensured under the APL II project.

Component D: Project Management Support (actual costs US$4.93 million)

The achievements of this component were substantial.

A project coordination unit was established to ensure timely execution of procurement, and to
coordinate between the World Bank and the MoES and component heads. Some difficulties were
encountered at the outset since this project was the first IDA-funded education project in
Georgia.

                 Education System Realignment and Strengthening Program


Introduction

Reforming and improving the education system has long been a top priority for the Government
of Georgia. The transition from a centrally-planned economy to a market-based economy has
rendered many aspects of the educational system inherited from the former Soviet Union
obsolete. In a rapidly changing global labour market, an educational system should be able to
prepare students that are flexible, innovative and critical thinking members of the society.
Through the Education System Realignment and Strengthening Program (ESRS), the World
Bank has provided central support to the reform agenda of the Government. The first phase of
the ESRS, launched in 2001, was part of a three phase Adjustable Program Loan (APL). The
Program's broad goals were to improve the quality and relevance of general secondary students
learning outcomes to better prepare them to meet the demands of the market economy and the
democratic society. The first phase of the Program was planned to support 1) the development
of the policy and institutional framework required for an effective realignment of the system
objectives, and 2) development of capacity to meet those new objectives and manage physical,
financial and human resources more equitably, efficiently and effectively.

Objective, Design and Implementation

The project emerged to address the pressing need to realign Georgian education system. The
objective of the project is to improve the quality and relevance of learning outcomes of primary
and general secondary students to better prepare them to meet the demands of a market economy
and a democratic society.

The project was designed to be implemented in three phases. The first phase of the program, now
complete, began to develop the policy and institutional framework required for an effective
realignment of the system, develop its capacity to meet those new objectives and manage its
physical, financial and human resources equitably, efficiently and effectively. Phase one
supported two broad components, realignment of the primary and general secondary system
objectives and strengthening capacity for policy and management. Implementation of the first
component was planned by developing a national curriculum for general education, creating a
national system to assess the student learning outcomes, providing training to teachers and
principals for the attainment of those targets, and providing basic learning materials to support
such attainment. This objective supplemented by interventions aimed at strengthening the policy
and management capacity to improve effectiveness and efficiency in the use of physical,
financial and human resources and guide the design of interventions in subsequent stages. The
focus was on development of new financing formulas, school consolidation initiatives and
strategies aimed at restructuring the teaching force.




                                                 38

Project implementation was coordinated by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established at
the Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia (MoES). Within PCU, various groups of
experts were working on different components of the projects: development and implementation
of national curriculum, development of a national assessment and examination system,
professional development of education professionals, strengthening capacity for policy and
management. These groups later transformed into separate agencies under the MoES ­ National
Curriculum and Assessment Center, National Examination Center and Teacher Professional
Development Center.

A crucial factor in securing the success of the reforms undertaken within the framework of the
project was political situation in the country which was highly conducive to implementing
radical and ambitious reform program.

Project Achievements

School-based Teacher Professional Development
The school-based teacher professional development (TPD) program was designed to respond to
the growing need to change teaching practices. Baseline studies conducted as part of the project
preparation had shown that teaching in Georgia was largely teacher centered: teachers
emphasized didactic presentation of facts, rote learning and memorization rather that
encouraging active engagement and participation of students in the class to help them develop
analytic, problem solving, and critical thinking skills. The main areas of the school-based
professional training program included creating effective teaching environment; monitoring,
evaluation and review; creating an effective teaching culture; classroom management. The
model chosen for the 2003-05 school-based teacher trainings envisioned initial trainings by 100
"top trainers" for a cohort of 5 teachers (2004-05) or 10-15 teachers (2003-04) per school across
different subject types every other weekend. Overall, 1800 schools were covered within the
framework of the initiative.

The training covered a wide variety of areas some with limited breadth. They included theories
of learning; class management; establishing an effective learning environment; monitoring,
assessment, evaluation and review; materials and resources to support active learning;
extracurricular resources and class visits;

Moreover, the project supported an annual regional teacher conference where training recipient
teachers shared their experience and lessons learned with the rest of the participating teacher
community. Further, all participating schools received a copy of all training materials in addition
to those provided to the trained cohort. Directors were not explicitly required or encouraged to
attend the trainings.

Curriculum Reform and Curriculum-based Teacher Professional Development

Development and implementation of the new nationwide curriculum for general schools was
initiated during the first phase of the project. The new curriculum is outcomes oriented designed
to encourage active learning rather than mechanical transfer of knowledge ­ the practice
characteristic of the old educational system. The new curriculum is first piloted in a selected



                                                  39

number of schools and implemented all over the country the next year. Introduction of the
curriculum is currently underway with 3/4 of all school students (grades 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
and 12) already studying according to it.

Introduction of the new curriculum is accompanied by the development of new textbooks.
Textbook development is a part of the curriculum piloting process with authors working closely
with teachers and NCAC throughout the pilot year incorporating changes and comments received.
Together with the implementation of the new curriculum grading system has been changed to 10-
point scale, Followed with the introduction of the concept of the GPA and of Formative
Assessment.

Curriculum-focused training efforts were the first formal efforts that followed on the school-
based teacher professional development. Curriculum-based teacher training is focused on
teaching new curriculum standards in each subject; new assessment system; class projects and
reflective practice. The curriculum-focused training built off the capacity built under the earlier
school-based teacher professional development. It also attempted to improve through building
upon some of the lessons learned by those involved. It also added more discussion on theories of
learning, assessment, standards for each subject, portfolios and outcome-based learning added to
curriculum training. In support of the new curriculum new textbook development system
including the training of the publishers, textbook piloting and evaluating mechanisms have been
set up. The system has enabled to develop new textbooks for every new curriculum and syllabi
introduced in Georgian schools. In support of the raising of the quality of teaching and learning
following major activities have been undertaken: a) provision of the supplementary teaching and
learning materials to the schools b) provision of the library packages to app 1100 schools of
Georgia and c) provision of the mobile science labs to the Educational Resource Centers for the
schools to lend out.

Unified National Admissions Examinations

One of the biggest achievements of the project was the introduction of unified national admission
examinations. The new type of examinations played a key role in the reduction of corruption
prevailing in the old system and reform of higher education admission system. The examinations
were first held in 2005 and they are using sophisticated testing methods across a range of
subjects. The exams are administered by a new agency, the National Examination Center. Along
with the subjects taught at general schools, exams in general aptitude testing assessing verbal and
quantitative reasoning skills of students were introduced. Students can apply for 7 faculties of
one higher education institution or of several HEDs;

Together with introducing changes in admission system, higher education funding changed as
well. Students receiving the highest scores on the entrance exams receive a state grant they can
redeem as tuition at any state institution or accredited private college of their own choosing.

The conduct of the examinations has been monitored by Transparency International. In its report
on the 2006 examinations, together with the American Councils for International Education, the
testing process was judged to be well organized and transparent. Wide support for the new




                                                  40

system was found throughout the country, and a large majority of test takers, parents and
administrators felt confident that it would help to eliminate corruption in university admission.

The School Network Program

The School Network Program, as part of the school-based Teachers Professional Development
program, was designed and implemented to promote collaboration and information sharing
among schools. This was designed to begin to break down the barriers of inter-school isolation
that characterized the Soviet and early independence period. The schools that succeeded in the
School Grant Program Phase One were involved in both the school­based teachers' professional
development cycle and establishment of school networks.

The School Grant Program was established as a related program to the School Network Program.
Its goal was to assist schools with teaching and learning within the school as part of teachers
professional development efforts through providing grants that would allow the schools to
develop novel learning programs. The TPDT found it was necessary to assist schools in
developing appropriate project proposals. 420 schools received school grants of $1000 on a
competitive basis for the improvement of quality of teaching and learning as part of the School
Grant Program. Special manuals were provided to granted schools for managing their grants as
well as developing other project proposals. These grants provided opportunity for minor
improvement of material conditions for teaching and learning in those schools.

Education Management Information System (EMIS)

The Ministry of Education and Science Education Management Information System (EMIS) was
established within the framework of the project. The aim of the EMIS is to promote systemic
reforms in the education system. The purpose of EMIS to provide data and information for
informed policy ­ making, which is essential for monitoring the outcomes of the reform as well
as overall performance of the sector against pre-determined performance criteria.

Data on the number of students and personnel at general public and private schools segregated
by grade, gender, age, language, location and material-technical conditions of these schools are
being collected through education resource centers. Data is transferred from resource-centers to
the EMIS where the data is checked and processed. EMIS receives data on higher education
indicators from the National Accreditation Center

The data collected, aggregated and analyzed by EMIS is being used by the MoES for planning
the medium and longer-term strategies and activities in the field of education. The data are
crucial in developing budget projections. EMIS data is accessible for all the stakeholders in
education, other ministries and all interested parties.

Per Capita Funding System and New teacher Pay Scheme

The financing principle of general schools underwent a fundamental change as well. New
funding scheme for general secondary education was elaborated by the team of experts as part of
the project. After the introduction of per capita funding model in October 1, 2005, schools now



                                                 41

receive funding based on the number of enrolled students. Funds are transferred from the central
budget through the Ministry of Education and Science to schools, which have been established as
public legal entities. Per Student allocations are defined by the special MoES decree, which sets
criteria for determining amount of student vouchers per type of school (urban, rural, mountain).
The objectives of the change was to improve transparency and equality in the distribution of
education financing across different schools in the country, and at the same time to encourage
schools to offer more diversified and quality educational programs so that to attract more
students. The per capita financing formula is currently based on a simple single criterion:
geographical location of schools. Urban schools are getting the lowest rate of per capita funding,
rural schools receive medium rate and highest rate is set for the schools in high-mountainous
regions. Such differentiation in funding rates was planned to make the financial status of schools
of different geographic characters more comparable and equal. Since per capita formula has not
taken into account the difference in size of schools, small size schools with experiencing
financial difficulties are entitled to receive additional subsidies to supplement the amount from
per capita financing.

Together with the introduction of per capita financing, the Ministry of Education and Science
introduced a new teacher salary scale and calculation formula that raised the teacher wage level
significantly ­ on average twice as much. The minimal salary level was set equal to the
minimum of state employee. The new formula was based on three coefficients: years of
professional experience, educational qualifications, and the size of class taught. Following recent
changes in the teacher pay scheme class size coefficient is no longer included as a variable in
calculating teacher salary. The formula only calculates the minimum salary amount for each
teacher, which all the schools are obliged to maintain. Apart from this minimum level regulation,
schools are empowered to determine individual teacher salary based on the available school
budget or incentive bonuses.

Achievement of Project Objectives and Rating of Key Performance Indicators

Project development objective: The program seeks to improve the quality and relevance of
primary and general secondary students learning outcomes to better prepare them to meet the
demands of a market economy and a democratic society.

This development objective is achieved by the project as explained below by the status of PDO
indicators.

Outcome/impact indicators:

    (a) 75 % of teachers of primary and general secondary education are familiar with new
        curriculum and assessment targets and begin to reflect those changes in their teaching
        practices

    Satisfactory: the results of the project evaluation conducted by an external evaluator show
    that based on self-reports of teachers all over the country most of them are familiar with
    national curriculum and assessment targets and have changed their teaching practices
    accordingly (PADECO, 2007).



                                                 42

   (b) Society at large has positive opinion of initiatives undertaken in education

   Moderately satisfactory: although generally agreed that reform efforts were necessary to
   undertake, in many cases people do not approve of particular components of the reform. It
   should also be noted that studies conducted thus far to measure the satisfaction of society by
   reforms lack appropriate level of validity. (BCG, 2007).

   (c) Policy makers and education stakeholders use learning outcomes and reliable statistics
       in their policy analysis and strategy development

   Moderately satisfactory: a recent report on the further developments of Georgian EMIS
   mentions that MoES lack data and information necessary for decision-making. While data
   and information may exist within the system it is not yet available for decision-makers within
   the Ministry. Neither do schools nor education resource centers (ERCs) benefit from the data
   and information (Abillama, 2008). Although not fully sophisticated to provide all the
   necessary inputs for informed decision-making, EMIS is already providing inputs for the per
   capita financing allocations.

   (d) The administrative structure of the education system performs its functions more
       efficiently and effectively

   Satisfactory: the project evaluation report calls reforms undertaken in school management
   and financial capacity "unprecedented in their scope and ambition". Certain components are
   evaluated as successful, although for many aspects it is yet to early to judge. Public schools
   were converted from local-government budget organizations to autonomous Legal Entities of
   Public Law or LEPLs, with Boards of Trustees and flexibility in budget management. Local
   education departments have been replaced by Education Resource Centers, which facilitate
   but do not control schools' educational activities.

Output indicators:

(a) National curriculum for primary and general secondary education developed, disseminated
    among different education stakeholders, published and piloted for grades 1-6 by 2005

Satisfactory: by academic year 2005-06 new curriculum and textbooks for grades 1, 7 and 10
were already piloted and being implemented throughout the country and were being piloted for
grades 2, 8 and 11.

(b) Results of national 9th graders examinations analyzed and disseminated by 2004

(c) National assessment of 4th graders in selected subjects conducted by May 2004 and results
    analyzed and disseminated by September 2004

Satisfactory: the assessment of 1-4 graders in Georgian language and mathematics was
conducted in 2003 and the results were published in 2004 by the assessment group of the project.




                                                43

On this particular indicator initial objectives were exceeded through the participation in two
international assessments ­ TIMSS and PIRLS.

(f) At least 600 schools organized in networks; 4,000 teachers participated in initial school-
    based training, and 600 school learning grants awarded by 2005

Moderately satisfactory: 1,800 schools participated in schools-based teacher trainings, about 200
schools which received schools grants during School Grant Program Phase I were part of the
school networks and the total of 420 schools received schools grants within the framework of the
project.

(g) Pilot textbook rental experience evaluated and generalization plan agreed by 2004

(h) Second round of exhibitions completed and additional learning material distributed to all
    schools by 2005

Satisfactory: the second exhibition of supplementary learning material was held under the
education project in October-November 2003 in Tbilisi. 71 local and 10 foreign organizations
expressed their wish to participate on the exhibition.

Within the scopes of the School Library Program about 600 schools were provided with books.
The resources were mostly focused on rural schools due to equity considerations.

(i) EMIS operating effectively at central level by 2004

Satisfactory: from 2004 EMIS is collecting and processing data on general schools. However
there exist concerns about the reliability of the data.

(j) School consolidation plan and methodology to assist local governments

Partially satisfactory: Consolidation of schools was the major effort taken for improving
efficiency of physical, financial and human resources. Within the scope of the two-stage
optimization procedure the number of public schools in Georgia was contracted by
approximately one thousand.

As schools became autonomous units with their own governing bodies assisting local
governments in schools management was no longer a project priority

(k) Proposals to improve efficient and equitable allocation of financial resources completed and
    approved

Satisfactory: the new school funding scheme developed within the framework of the project has
been widely perceived as successful and highly efficient compared to the previous funding
system although further changes in funding formula are envisaged.

Performance of the Borrower

The Government of Georgia has since the initiation of the Project, remained committed to the
objectives laid out in the Project founding documentation and the strategies to achieve them. The
total estimated Government contribution to the Project implementation has amounted to USD
7,403,184.94.

In terms of performance the project implementation course can be divided into two periods:
before and after 2003. Prior to 2003 project activities were not accompanied by wider system-
wide reform efforts. Starting from the end of 2003 education system at large has been subject to
radical and comprehensive reforms which took place within a relatively short span of time. The
system-wide reforms were crucial in ensuring that project objectives were achieved. Radical
changes were introduced at legislative and operational levels.

The Law on Higher Education adopted in December 2004 and the Law on General Education
adopted in April 2005 both facilitated the process of the implementation of some of the key
project initiatives such as the introduction of national unified admissions examinations,
introduction of new curriculum at schools, introduction of teachers' standards, etc.

Also, the conventional approach of school management and funding has been entirely altered.
The new funding schema developed within the Project has been put into effect by the
Government and its operation guaranteed by the Law. Decentralization of management and
equipping schools with autonomy have been instrumental in implementing all project activities.

Because the reforms were so comprehensive and wide-ranging, the MoES ensured that the
activities implemented within the framework of the Project were regularly coordinated with other
initiatives implemented through other agencies, particularly with Georgia Education
Decentralization and Accreditation ­ a USAID funded project.

The work of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was very effective. PCU staff was composed
of professionals who coordinated their work within various units and with the MoES. At the later
stage of the implementation, in 2005 and 2006 the three groups within PCU working on the
teacher professional development, examination and assessment and curriculum were established
as separate agencies under the MoES.

Performance of the Bank

The Bank has been very effective during the implementation of the project, namely in the
identification of the needs before launching the Project, designing appropriate responses to those
needs, providing thorough supervision to the implementation of project activities.

The Project was designed to respond not only to the needs identified by the Bank, but also to the
general priorities of the Government of Georgia. While designing the implementation plan the
capacity of the Government, technical needs and necessities were taken into account. The
organizational structure of the project was designed to ensure efficient and effective institutional
arrangements for the administration of project activities, as well as to ensure effective
coordination with government, community institutions, and the donor community.



                                                45

In terms of supervising the implementation the Bank's performance was effective as well. The
financial and human resources allocated to this were sufficient to carry out effective supervision
and monitoring. Aide memoirs were regularly prepared by the task team and the team
communicated any new information with the PCU as well as the MoES.

Future Operation of the Project

The second phase of the Project is composed of two components: improving the pedagogical
environment and improving physical learning environment. The first component consists of two
sub-components: National Curriculum and Student Assessment System Development and
Professional Development of Teachers. The agencies directly responsible for implementing these
will be National Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC) and Teacher Professional
Development Center (TPDC) respectively. The Project will support building the capacity of the
staff of these agencies, as well as support in the implementation of regular activities.

The objective of the second component is improving physical learning environment, especially at
schools in emergency conditions and help the Government make sure that no children are
studying at schools that are considered unsafe and that school maintenance system is in place. In
cooperation with the Municipal Development Fund the construction of eight new schools is also
underway within the framework of the second phase of the project.

Final Remarks

The scope and pace of education reforms launched within the Education System Realignment
and Strengthening Program by the Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia have been
unprecedented and ambitious. Financial and technical help and expertise of the World Banks
together with other internationals donor organizations support of the education stakeholders
around the country and the commitment of the reform team at the MoES, as well as politically
highly favourable situation in the country made it possible for the majority of the reform efforts
to turn out successful. However there are indications that some components of the project did not
fully achieve objectives and further actions need to be taken to achieve them.

The Development Objective of the second phase of the project, currently ongoing, is to increase
the quality and efficiency of primary and secondary education in Georgia through the
implementation of the institutional and policy framework developed under APL 1. The project is
divided into two components: improving pedagogical environment and improving physical
environment at schools.
