The\n            structure and subjective nature of the entrance examinations\n            were easy to manipulate by corrupt officials. They favored\n            candidates who either had personal connections or had bribed\n            the members of the examination committee, creating serious\n            equity concerns. A highly-developed tutoring system allowed\n            well-off students who paid the right professors to get\n            advance tips on examination topics. Those old rules no\n            longer apply. In order to ensure the system works in\n            everyone\u0092s interest, a high level of security surrounded the\n            testing process in July. Candidates were identified by a\n            barcode on each exam paper to ensure confidentiality in the\n            grading process. Examination booklets were printed in a\n            secure facility overseas. And each testing center was\n            equipped with surveillance cameras and TV monitors that let\n            students\u0092 relatives observe the examination process."}, "docdt": "2005-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
