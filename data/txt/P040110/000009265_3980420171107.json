the\n            Financial Decentralization and Accountability Project are:\n            1) implementing a sustainable process of self-management in\n            financial administration while instituting sound financial\n            management standards and systems in a critical mass of\n            public entities; and 2) building up a strong public auditing\n            function able to collaborate with private sector auditing\n            firms to continuously review and evaluate financial\n            performance and integrity of operations conducted by public\n            sector entities. The project's components are: 1)\n            implementing decentralized integrated financial management\n            systems (IFMS), developing institutional capacity to improve\n            project auditing, accounting, and reporting;  2) IFMS public\n            sector-wide integration through installing telecom links,\n            linking both the decentralized and centralized financial and\n            budget reporting systems; 3) modernizing the budget\n            transactions payments systems via a private sector banking\n            network; 4) disseminating integrated financial management\n            operations and implementing public financial regulations; 5)\n            project operating costs covering administrative and project\n            management staff, travel, materials, and equipment; 6)\n            strengthening government auditing and decentralized sector\n            evaluations; 7) implementing audit capability for\n            operational and special audits; 8) anti-corruption auditing\n            techniques and public sector ethics dissemination; 9)\n            training in accounting, auditing, and financial management;\n            and 10) contingencies and project preparation facilities refinancing."}, "docdt": "1997-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
