' Given the ineligibility of U.S. based goods or services under the Interim Trust Fund Credit, the Government has agreed to finance those equipment and software
components which are proprietary of U.S. companies and which would otherwise be purchased under sole source arrangements (e.g specialized software operting systms).
The goods required to be purchased from U.S. ources anoant to $0.7 mnn and are included in the counterpart funding commitment, given that they cannot be financed via
the Credit. Oher computer equipment purchases under the Cedit are available from European and Asian suppliers and include the requisite compatibility with UNIX and
IBM based equipment No U.S. consultant ervices are anticipated under the project given the identification of potentially qualified candidates from Europe and South
America.

parallel cofinancier with independent budget programns from IDA's (approx. $1.7 inn from Belgium). In addition, a number of other programs amounting to a total of $33
nmu are in place to support institution building efforts (including financial management) for sub-national governments in Bolivia Sources of fnding for these other
complementary efforts include other IDA projects, IDB funds, German, Danish, Dutch, and other donor facilities. Ilese activities cover support to prefectures, municipal
governments, and administrative strengthening in confornance with the new structures mandated by the Decentralization and Popular Participation Laws. Additional
government counterpart funds not lsted but anticipated under the project, are those equipment contributions from regional and municipal goverments to support the IFMS

Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
(a) Implementing a sustainable process of self-management in financial administration while instituting sound financial
management standards and systems in a critical mass of public entities. This will enable Bolivia to perpetuate institutional
strengthening procedures covering newly decentralized sectors and municipalities, and aim to incorporate at least 90% of
total public funds administered in the country. This will be supported by implementation of integrated financial
management systems (IFMS) under the decentralized Prefectures, decentralized agencies, and municipalities, which will link
into the national budget via the central IFMS network and operated by the Ministry of Finance. The private sector banking
network will be deployed in providing the financial infrastructure for budget payments via electronic transfer;
(b) Building up a strong public auditing function able to, in collaboration with private sector auditing firms,
continuously review and evaluate financial performance and integrity of operations conducted by public sector entities.
This shall include implementation of uniform, professional accounting and auditing standards across the public sector,
auditing operations of the recently decentralized regional governments and municipalities, development & execution of anti-
corruption forensic audits covering large public outlays and contracts, and quality control of private sector audit standards.

3. Benefits and target population:
Institutionalization and self-generating capacity to modernize the Government's financial management infrastructure
and public sector auditing capability during its transition towards a decentralized government structure, covering the new
regional governments, the increasingly autonomous municipalities, and remaining autonomous entities. Target population
would include regional prefecture administrations, municipal administrations, decentralized entities, and the general
population in terms of improved/modernized systems to account for and audit the use of tax-based, and externally financed
public funds. Improved management of government debt (including notes and bonds) would lead to more efficient capital
market development. Supreme Audit oversight will improve the quality of performance of private sector audit firms.
....................................................... ..................I............................... ................................................................................................ ................................
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: January 1998 to December 2001
Executing agencies: (a) Ministry of Finance (MOF) and (b) Comptroller General's Office (CGO)
Project coordination: Project Implementation Unit established in the Ministry of Finance, and a Comptroller General's
Project Unit (represented by the Comptroller General's technical direction and financial/contracting tasks by the CGO's
financial administration office).
Project Implementation: 'Technical Cooperation' agreements with public entities (e.g.: prefectures) will be entered into
with the project unit's technical team in the Ministry of Finance, in order to implement integrated financial management
systems (IFMS) in those entities. Under such agreements, the recipient entities would commit resources for the operation
and maintenance of the IFMS, including specified equipment and long term staffing needs (technical capacity of recipient
institutions will have been evaluated by the MOF's project unit prior to engaging in such agreements). The project unit will
provide technical consultant support administered by the project (in the Finance Ministry) to be deployed at the client field
sites during the systems implementation stage. Under such agreements, the project unit will also arrange hands-on training
sessions as well as 'trainer-training' for staff in each entity which would further disseminate operational requirements of the
IFMS within their institutions.
An IFMS module would be developed and piloted for each specific type of institution including pilot modules for
prefectures, municipalities, central agencies, and decentralized entities, tailored to their specific requirements. Once the
product by type of entity is designed and developed, it would then be replicated and implemented in other similar entities
(under technical cooperation agreements). The sequencing and priority of implementation would cover: (a) the prefectures
(9 entities), (b) decentralized agencies (12 representative entities), (c) central gov't. administrative units (30 representative
units), and (d) municipalities (10 representative local governments). On the Comptroller's component, the regional offices
of the Comptroller would receive professional audit training, assistance to coordinate institution-building activities with its
regional offices, and set up equipment in order to develop a 'decentralized' capacity to audit public institutions and
municipalities in Bolivia's nine regions, and conduct comprehensive audit coverage in all public sector entities.
Project oversight (policy guidance. etc.): Agreements between the Comptroller General and the Ministry of Finance will
be negotiated and put in place with IDA's no objection, to review project progress and coordinate /set up external quality
control and oversight mechanisms for the respective components, including participation of senior representatives from the
prefectures, municipalities, and other entities to verify product deliverables under the technical cooperation agreements.
The respective executing agencies' project units will be primarily accountable for the project's technical progress to
implement IFMS and Auditing systems, having the government's commitment to ensure that these units are headed by
technical directors assisted by professional staff in adequate numbers and with appropriate qualifications.
Accounting. financial repOrtinQ and auditinz arrangements: Multi-year contract to be set up with a qualified audit firm
which audited prior projects in the same sector; or other qualified auditing firms. Project accounting system satisfactory to
IDA, to be in place (see para. 23).
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Bi-annual technical reviews by IDA team composed of (i) audit/accounting
specialist, (ii) budget/treasury specialist, (iii) systems and controls specialist, and (iv) financial consultant. Output

Block  2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by project - Document number/date of latest CAS discussion: P-6095-BO, February 8, 1994
IDA support in assisting the Govermnent in its public sector reform program, in particular, the administrative reforms
mandated under the Popular Participation and Decentralization Laws, which distribute and provide for more
regional/localized public services management and financial accountability in the country's 9 Prefectures and 311
municipalities. Monitoring indicators will include verifiable financial reporting systems for administering public budget
resources and timely submission of public expenditure outcomes and associated deliverables (these will also be reviewed
and verified via financial and operational audit oversight as part of the standard functions of the Comptroller General's
Office). These objectives will in addition, support the increased efficiency of public institutions and ensure more effective
use of the country's tax and other financial resources, to attain more monitorable impacts in poverty reduction and other
development investments.

6. Main sector issues and Govermment strategy:
Under the Government's decentralization strategy, the key priority is the modernization of public financial and budget
reporting systems to ensure accountability at the decentralized level and transparency in the use and expenditure of public
funds. For this purpose, the institutionalization of controls as mandated under the SAFCO Law (Law on Financial
Administration and Control) and monitored by the Comptroller General, is a key 'guaranteeing' factor in this process.
IDA's PSP Department (PSM Unit) has addressed these issues in its sector report titled 'Public Management Lessons for
Developing Countries'.
With respect to financial management, main issues addressed include the decentralization of budget managemnent
including timely/informative financial reporting against operating results, and measurement of performance based on
modernized financial management systems with budgeting and accounting controls. Another report, 'The Budget and
Public Sector Performance in Developing Countries' by Syracuse University in collaboration with IDA, emphasizes the
need to develop basic financial information needed for financial accountability in the public sector, as the first step in
budget and public management reform. Such systems including accounting reporting can be designed to ensure the capture
of public program outputs so as to combine financial and results-oriented monitoring of public programs.
~o.     ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project is intended to address the basic public financial infrastructure, in particular as it is being decentralized to
Bolivia's regional government bodies, decentralized entities, and municipalities. The approach taken seeks to modernize
both the financial-administrative tools for proper national financial/budgetary monitoring and accounting, as well as the
technology used to implement these (which include linkages at all levels of government through telecom networks, in order
to allow for timely reporting and full consolidation of public sector national financial information). As per the above-
referenced sector work, the strategic choice in this approach focuses on the recommendations that any widespread
successful public sector reform must be preceded by the implementation of financial management and reporting tools which
will allow the flow of transparent and auditable public sector financial performance information. Lack of such systems do
not provide the common "currency" of information necessary for the government to make strategic policy choices and cost
effective decisions in monitoring and evaluating reforms and program costs.
Within this context, the governnent is also undertaking a comprehensive civil service reform program supported by
another IDA Credit, recently negotiated. In order to support the civil service reform objectives, the project will ensure that
all human resources deployed during project implementation, conform to the new civil service guidelines, in particular to
avoid the utilization of consultants as line positions. To prevent the latter, the Borrower has agreed that under the Ministry
of Finance, all project consultants will report directly to the project unit and not to any line units. All consultants, with the
exception of the project unit's administrative staff, will be reviewed on technical grounds in their ability to imnplement
objectives and outputs specified under the project. The project unit has for this purpose, instituted pre-qualifying tests of
potential candidates, to ensure their technical competence prior to hiring. Administrative staff in the project unit will be
subject to the civil service reform guidelines, in particular those which apply to government staff working in externally

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The main alternatives considered (which now comprise part of, but not the only component of the project) were (a)
designing the project by solely emphasizing the oversight and public audit function (as conducted by the Comptroller
General's Office) as an "insurance" factor in enforcing Bolivia's SAFCO Law (Law on Financial Administration and
Control), but without the requisite implementation and institutional capacity building measures to modernize public
financial management systems in the central and decentralized public sector. While this alternative would have built up the
capacity for oversight and to some extent ensured compliance with financial management regulations, the effort might not
have been sustainable without further support to implement financial management systems across the public sector,
including the characteristic of these systems to be integrated and linked under a modernized technology platform to assure
adequate and timely public financial reporting capabilities.
The second alternative considered was (b) development of a solely budget based & cash flow system as the basis for the
financial management systems to be implemented in the decentralized sectors. While budget-based systems serve the needs
of many financial management systems implemented in the public sector, it was deemed preferable that this project's design
be based on a comprehensive accounting framework, i.e., including budget expenditure transactions but also asset and
liability accounts for the public sector. While budget expenditure monitoring systems generally capture much of the
information needed for public sector management of funds, they do not capture the assets of public sector entities which
might need replacement after specified life-times. Ignoring such accounts does not allow local and decentralized
governments to plan for needed public investments and/or maintenance of public infrastructure based on expected
depreciation of assets.
In addition, with the decentralized government structure in Bolivia, prudent tracking of debt liabilities (to fund public
investments) need to be included in the IFMS systems as well. While debt service flows are captured by budget based
systems (via annual allocations to fund these), a complete accounting framework includes all debt balances and contingent
liabilities, thus allowing decentralized governments to gain a better understanding of their net asset positions, which is
particularly crucial under more autonomous governance structures. This will assist in mitigating the generation of internal
debt liabilities of sub-national level government entities, and allow the Borrower to better track and monitor such debt
generation.

10 Lssons leared and reflected i the project design:
Given the participation of two key agencies (Ministry of Finance and Comptroller General), prior projects might have
improved their execution by separating the respective components under two implementation agencies. This is particularly
important given the Comptroller General's audit/oversight role in various public financial management processes including
those systems to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance. Thus, the funding of these two functions (audit oversight and
implementation of financial systems), while meeting common objectives, should legally be kept separate under the two
project subsidiary agreements between the Borrower and the executing agencies. In terms of other project design elements,
it was deterrnined in the latter part of prior projects, that any timely and efficient financial management reporting system
requires advanced technology to allow for consolidation of public sector data at a central level. Thus, the use of low-cost

telecommunication networks with adequate security controls, is endorsed as a means to further modernize and allow timely
integration of data across the country's public sector agencies, especially at the decentralized regional levels. Finally,
ensuring appropriate technical leaders on the Borrower's end (to be endorsed by IDA) has made the difference between
project progress or setbacks.
In terms of similar Bank/IDA projects in the Region, the Argentina project serves as a good model for lessons learned,
since it is the only other regional project at a more advanced stage. Key lessons in this regard, which have been applied to
the design of this project include: (a) the need to automate early on, the Governmental accounting system under an
integrated information technology platform; (b) the need for the project unit to actively involve the commitment and support
of the executives heading the Treasury, Budget, External Debt, and Accounting Units; (c) the need to ensure a methodology
of piloting newly developed IFMS systems in selected central government agencies before generalizing the design for the
entire public sector; and (d) once the IFMS is designed under the Ministry of Finance, utilizing one common government
cash account with an electronic book-entry record-keeping methodology for public sector agency sub-accounts.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Minister of Finance and the Comptroller General have officially requested IDA support for the above project. Both
agencies have begun preparation of the activities under the proposed project, and have discussed with the project team, the
activities proposed to be financed as reflected in the components above.
~~~~~~~~~~~......................................................................................................I...............................................................................................................................
12. Value added of IDA support:
Given IDA's assistance under two prior projects, which supported the development of Bolivia's SAFCO Law, the
issuance of related regulations, and implementation of financial management systems in the central government, IDA's
added value contribution and support in catalyzing this final stage covering field implementation, is key for completing such
reforms and expanding them to the newly decentralized sector.
IDA's project team consists of specialists in budgetary, treasury management, accounting, and implementation of
integrated financial information systems. Such expertise has assisted in guiding the design of the prior project at the central
government level (Cr. 2279-0) so that it meets the requirements of automation, timeliness in financial reporting, and
adequate integration of cash, debt, accounting, and budgeting functions. IDA has also invested in Bolivia's public financial
management modernization efforts, and has advised the Government on regulatory matters related to reforms being
undertaken in the public sector, as well as in the financial markets including the securities and pension reforms, and the
implementation of Popular Participation Law initiatives in the municipal sectors.

would conservatively generate an estimated $27

Fiscal impact: Due to the T.A. and institutional strengthening nature of project, a calculated fiscal impact is not directly
quantifiable. Nevertheless, expected real financial costs and benefits include: Costs: (i) Upgrading of automated financial
management equipment due to technology change in the long-term ($0.7 mn. every four years), (ii) change in skills mix and
technical qualifications of staff trained in integrated financial management systems: $0.1 mn./yr. for eight years, (iii)
potential net severance payment costs for existing unskilled personnel or redundancies identified once IFMS systems become
fully automated/computerized ($0.3 mn. per annum, over nine years).
Benefits: Improved investment management of idle budget funds, improved cash management and cash flow netting to reduce
borrowing costs for financing the budget (e.g.: savings on 4% of the budget financed with short term borrowing) . These
benefits as well as the anticipated reduction in misused/diverted public funds (via improved public audit oversight), coupled
with lower requirements for administrative-type government staffing for manual bookkeeping and paper transactions, would
offset the IDA debt service incurred from the Credit and result in net savings to the public sector in present value terms.

14. Financial Assessment - see above
and Annex 4
.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
15. Technical Assessment: Assessment of the accounting and financial management integration module (for cash, debt,
budget and accounting consistency) was conducted by the project team and found to meet financial management
requirements and standards. Technological platform design and linkages to dedicated telecommunications lines for inter-
agency integration of financial information, was considered of high quality and advanced technical design. The proposed
design has incorporated additional financial and system controls to ensure compliance and timeliness in financial
management reporting.
16. I     ion  Assessment This consisted of two parts covering both key institutions (a) the Miustry of Finance, and (b)
the Comptroller General's Office.
(a) The current managers and project units responsible for the technical direction of the project have technical know-how
of the accounting and budgetary systems, and are backed by a cadre of staff and consultants with adequate systems
development skills to implement and apply the integrated systems in all public sector areas. The Bolivian Treasury recently
received, via a twinning arrangement, assistance from the U.S. Treasury in developing appropriate accounting methods for
debt management and setting out Treasury norms and implementing financialcash planning models to minimize borrowing
costs. Overall, the Ministry is well-positioned technically to implement such systems in the decentralized public sector, via
corresponding cooperation arrangements among the relevant public sector entities.
(b) The Comptroller General's Office has undergone substantial upgrading of skills in auditing standards (utilizing
international consultants) and is now one of the more highly rated agencies of this type in Latin America. Due to its recent
practice of perforning qualitative assessment of private sector audit firms conducting work in public agencies, it is well
positioned to extend quality control over financial management practices in the decentralized public agencies.
Incentives for adopting these new systems, procedures and training, are strong in the regional prefectures and
municipalities. With the decentralization of a large share of public resources, many of these entities have a high demand for
implementing organized and efficient financial management structures to administer newly acquired funds, particularly since
the political/administrative functions are subject to the public's review given their newly awarded autonomous status. The
sheer number of potential 'competitors' (i.e.: 9 prefectures and 311 municipalities) provides strong disincentives for sub-
optimal governance given the potential high visibility and likely emulation of newly successful regional governments and
municipalities.
a. Executing agencies: (i) Ministry of Finance, and (ii) Comptroller General
b. Project management: (i) Technical Project Implementation Unit in the Ministry of Finance covering project
coordination, procurement, accounting, and audit contracting (Unit to be financed under the project).
(ii) Project Unit in the Comptroller General's office covering technical direction, contracting for the Comptroller's
component, and project accounting (Unit represented by the Comptroller General's technical direction and the CGO's
financial administration office, financed by the CGO's own budget).

17. Social Assessment:
Assessment not applicable, given that the project itself aims to make participation and decentralization work more
efficiently. However, the participatory approach with regional prefectures and municipal representatives utilized to develop
the project, includes representative beneficiary assessments on the design and execution. For the purposes of beneficiary
participation in the project's development, the IDA team conducted interviews/meetings with Prefecture representatives, a
large Municipality, two small Municipalities, the Secretariat for Popular Participation, the Central Bank, the Ministry of
Finance, and the Comptroller General's Office.

20.Sustainability:
Project will incorporate extensive training in the decentralized sector to ensure both dissemination of financial management
skills as well as operation of technology based systems used to implement these. With the further professionalization of the
civil service in Bolivia, and increased regional career opportunities following decentralization, future public employees will
likely be hired (or kept on board) based on their expertise in financial management, for which the project will support
training and exposure. The Comptroller General's audit oversight function will also provide a form of "insurance" to
enforce compliance with requisite financial management procedures and practices in conformance with the SAFCO Law.
This central and regional presence will provide incentives for public sector agencies to develop positive track records in the
management of public funds, which will be subject to increased transparency and public scrutiny, as well as ad hoc anti-
corruption and forensic audits.
In addition, the new skills mix for public employees operating IFMS systems as well as upgrading technology in the long
term, will require advance planning of budgetary allocations for these costs, to ensure the sustainability of ongoing
operations and institutionalized procedures. The improved management of public monies and minimization of idle funds
and/or nmisuse, will generate net savings and lower debt service interest. Therefore an early demonstration of such benefits is
essential, so that Bolivia's regional and local governments assure their commitment to such processes and systems in terms
of an on-going incremental investment in public financial infrastructure.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects: No major opposition anticipated, however, effectiveness of the program will depend on
collaboration and feedback from prefectures and municipalities to ensure that the objective of implementing nationwide
public financial standards, is achieved. For this purpose, the project will include a dedicated training component, to ensure
that implementation of integrated financial management systems in the prefectures and municipalities has ownership from
local governments. Changes in public sector staffing composition and potential lay-offs, though not required by the project,
may be necessary in the medium-term, to ensure technical competence for sustaining the modernized & automated IFMSs.
Block 4: Main Loan Conditions
23. Effectiveness Conditions
(i) Approval of Credit by Bolivian Congress (following signing), (ii) Execution of Implementing Agency Agreements
for transfer of project funds from the Borrower to the Comptroller General's budget and to the Ministry of Finance's budget,
and (iii) At least four Technical Cooperation agreements entered into, between the Ministry of Finance as executing agency,
and the Prefectures, for IFMS implementation.
Negotiation Conditions
(i) Working prototype of Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) at Central Government level, (ii) working
prototype of telecommunications linked network at central level for subsequent application in decentralized public sector,
(iii) documented project operating and management procedures via an operations manual, and (iv) comprehensive project
accounting system in place to meet IDA requirements.
The Borrower already has a satisfactory project accounting system (PAS) which meets audit reporting requirements.
However, during negotiations, and in line with the project's plans to develop a PAS for other Bolivia IDA projects, it was
ensured that this project's system has integrated links for the automated production of reports already being generated semi-
manually. These include reports on budget execution by component and disbursement category, project financial statements,
statements of SOEs and other disbursements, Special Account reconciliation, statement of sources and uses of funds, and
statement of fixed asset investments.
24. Other
(A) Financial: (i) Project audit arrangements with multi-year contract (ii) Project accounting system in place;
(B) Execution: Project Units and Operational Procedures set up;
(C) Remedies: Conditionality on maintaining suitably qualified technical leadership in the project, satisfactory to IDA.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
1. Project Component 1: Implementation of Decentralized Integrated Financial Mgmt. Systems (IFMS)
US$ 3.9 million (base cost): The first 5 components listed, will be executed by the Ministry of Finance in
collaboration with regional governments. This component would include the development of modernized and
automated integrated financial management systems for the 9 regional prefecture governments, the decentralized
entities and municipalities. The component would assist in the adaptation of budget regulations to the
administrative procedures in those public entities, as well as the institutionalization of operating procedures for
treasury transactions and full implementation of financial accounting norms as required under the SAFCO law.
The systems sub-component will apply these in order to modernize and computerize such operating procedures
in the treasury area (including cash, debt management, and capital market operations), implementation of
accounting systems and procedures, and budget execution and reporting systems. The major financial functional
areas would be designed under information technology platforms assuring their functional integration so that the
final product systems would provide government executives and technical staff with the ability to monitor all
phases of public financial management from upstream budget formulation, through cash, liquidity, and debt
management, to accounting and expenditure monitoring. At the municipal levels such integrated systems would
be adapted for large city municipalities, while for small municipalities, a system of administrative budget and
accounting reporting would be disseminated and implemented within a regulatory framework, to assure that
financial data from small municipalities meets the requirements for national public sector reporting purposes.
This component would, in addition, implement automated systems under the Prefectures and central entities, to
track goods & services inventory, procurement processes, project accounting, the personnel count, budget, fixed
assets, public investment monitoring, and debt. This component of the project will also finance the development,
structure, and dissemination of a generalized project accounting system for application to projects and their
expenditure tracking under multilateral development credits, and for meeting requisite reporting and auditing
requirements. This latter module will support the improvement in the country's project accounting and
administration capacity for IDA projects as well as for the management of other multilateral and bilateral
creditors and grantors. The modules will eventually be linked into the overall IFMS system for integration into
the national public investment and external credit systems at the central government level.
2. Project Component 2: IFMS Public Sector-Wide Integration via Installation of Telecom Links
US$ 0.4 million (base cost): This component would link both the decentralized and centralized financial and
budget reporting systems as implemented in the above component, for the purposes of national accounting
reporting and comprehensive public expenditure monitoring at the aggregate national level. Within the regional
prefecture governments and large urban municipalities, the IFMS systems would first be aggregated via
metropolitan area telecom networks, to ensure aggregation of prefecture/municipal level financial reporting to
cover all public entities in such jurisdictions. At the wider national or regional-to-central level aggregation of
financial reporting, wide-area wireless telecom networks would be installed in order to allow consolidation of
data and/or distribution of budgets on a real-time (overnight) basis. This component would also allow for
remote entry of expenditure transactions to record budget movements on an on-line basis. The architecture for
implementation of the above would be based on that implemented in the La Paz area for the central government
sector.
3. Project Component 3: Budget Transaction and Payment Systems Modernization via Banking Network
US$ 0.2 million (base cost): This component would involve linking the public budgetary funds transfer
procedure via the private sector banking system, to allow more efficient budget distributions to the prefectures
(general budget funds), to municipalities (public participation investment funds), and to central government
agencies. The component would include the requisite development of regulatory and control norms to ensure
appropriate application and accounting of funds, and would include the elaboration of automated voucher entry
systems to expedite budget expenditure transactions and reporting. The architecture would utilize the private
banking electronic funds transfer network which will be linked via the central bank cash accounts to the



Ministry of Finance (MOF). The MOF would be the initial executor/receiver of resource transfers, and any
such transactions will be captured by the central IFMS.
4. Project Component 4: Dissemination of Financial Management/IFMS Operations, and
Operationalizing Public Financial Regulations - US$ 2.0 million (base cost): This component comprises the
implementation in a sustainable fashion, of the central and decentralized IFMS systems designed under the
project. Given the complexity involved in the computerization of the integrated accounting structure, covering
the other financial and administrative regulations in the public sector, this component reflects the practical
hands-on training in the information technology based financial systems, and their specific method of application
and administrative support in each agency. Supporting this hands-on technical assistance, to be provided by the
project unit in the Finance Ministry, would be the organizing of workshops at regional and national levels to
disseminate the proper applications, controls, regulations, disclosure requirements, and financial procedures to
be utilized under the automated financial management systems. Such workshops would be earmarked for
specific managers and employees of public institutions responsible for the financial management functions.
Such applied training would be complemented at a broader public sector level under project component 9
(below) which would cover all public sector employees but focus more broadly on SAFCO law regulations, and
financial/administrative procedures to ensure proper execution of the law.
5. Project Component 5: Project operating costs - US$ 1.4 million (base cost): This component covers the
project unit's operating costs including administrative and project management staff, requisite intra-country
travel, cost of dissemination materials/publications, and equipment support for the project unit. The component
also covers the costs of the project unit's financial administrator, the technical Director/coordinator, a legal
specialist (to review inter-agency technical cooperation agreements, consulting and equipment contractual
provisions), an accountant, and project auditing contracts.
6. Project Component 6: Government Audit Function - Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Central
and Regional Comptrollers' Offices, and evaluation of decentralized and municipal sector operations
US$ 3.7 million (base cost): Components 6-9 will be executed by the Office of the Comptroller General.
This first component will build up the institutional capacity as well as scope and type of public audits to be
undertaken by the Comptroller General's Office (CGO). Currently the CGO has significant capacity for
undertaking financial audits of public sector entities in the central, decentralized, and municipal sectors, as well
as evaluating audits undertaken by private sector audit firms. This has greatly improved the country's quality of
audit services, and has established an effective oversight audit body which will help ensure the enforcement of
the SAFCO Law in the public sector. This component would provide technical assistance to further build up the
CGO's capacity in the areas of (a) evaluation of private sector audit operations conducted for public agency
operations, (b) setting up and institutionalizing procedures for auditing public sector procurement and
purchasing systems, (c) building up professional auditing skills and organizational sustainability to ensure long
term auditing capability for evaluating compliance with SAFCO Law implementation. This would include the
institutionalization of periodic audits of public sector IFMS systems, budgeting procedures, treasury & cash
management operations, and compliance with accounting norms, as well as the institutional strengthening of the
regional sub-Comptroller offices to undertake these tasks. This component is a key area in the project in that it
would disseminate and institutionalize the country's public auditing capability in the decentralized sectors. The
design of this component would involve the participation of the regional sub-Comptroller Offices so that these
may build up their capacity to conduct the public audit and oversight function at the decentralized level,
including the review of municipalities' financial management procedures as well as the 9 prefecture
governments. The technical assistance required for this component would involve international expertise in
audit operations combined with the existing capacity-building to be provided by the central CGO's office in La
Paz. This effort would be complemented by installation of modernized information technology systems in order
for the central CGO's office to share and transfer procedural and audit information to the regional offices, and
vice versa, thus improving the quality of the audit operations and review process at the decentralized level. At a
minimum, the project would seek to implement sustainable government audit capacity in the 9 decentralized
regions and potentially in additional areas where there are concentrations of small municipalities. This
component would provide a key control framework and "insurance" function to stimulate the successful



implementation of financial management systems in the decentralized sector, and assuring their compliance with
prudential financial procedures/regulations.
7. Project Component 7: Implementing Audit Capability for Conducting Operational and other Non-
Financial Audit / Evaluation Techniques - US$ 1.5 million (base cost): This component focuses on
operational type audits which include the ex-post and in-process evaluations of the execution of investment
programs, large public works, environmental operations, and other special audit areas. This area supplements
the traditional financial audits by focusing on operational execution and performance including the evaluation of
output results for given operations. This is particularly critical under the decentralized govemment structure
since it provides tools for monitoring investmnent programs and real sector project execution under prefectures
and municipalities which now utilize funds provided via the Decentralization and Popular Participation Laws. It
also reinforces the prudential execution of environmental operations including clean-up works or
environmentally-preventive industrial operations. Complementing the above, the program would also include
the development and implementation of other sector/industry-specific audit techniques which would interface
both with financial and operational audits. This component would also include special audits of privatization
and/or capitalization procedures followed under the government's reform program. To complement the
modemization of financial administration procedures, the development of information technology system audit's
would also assist in ensuring that traditional audit techniques are adapted to take into account features of
automated financial transactions processing. The main focus would, as mentioned, be on operational audit
techniques which assist in the impact/performance evaluation of publicly funded programs and investments.
8. Project Component 8: Development - Anti-Corruption Audit Techniques / Ethics Principles
Dissemination - US$ 1.2 million (base cost): This component will include development and implementation of
forensic audit techniques (anti-corruption, detection methods) which would interface both with financial and
operational audits. The objective would be to institutionalize professional capacity within the Comptroller
General and its regional offices, to conduct anti-corruption forensic audits for selected and substantial public
expenditure contracts and financial management procedures. In addition to this capacity building, the
component will finance the execution of a number of public investment audits, bidding process audits, and other
interventions within the course of the Comptroller General's audit reviews, to determine any potential
embezzlement of public funds. The component would incorporate six separate sub-components covering the
following outputs: (a) long term on-the-job capacity-building in anti-corruption audit techniques for public
auditors, (b) executing specific audits on bidding, selection, and contracting procedures of large public works,
(c) audit exercises in detection of possible embezzlement actions and wrongful use of public funds, (d)
conducting special audits on large purchases and procurement actions in the public sector, (e) developing and
conducting anti-corruption and forensic auditing seminars and workshops for auditors in the Comptroller
General's office and in the public sector at large, and (f) dissemination of ethics and transparency principles for
public administration, including coverage of the effects of corruption on civil society and public services, and
targeting executives in the branches of the Judiciary, Legislative, Executive, Municipalities, and Comptroller
General's Offices.
9. Project Component 9: Public Sector Training in Accounting, Auditing & Financial Management
US$ 1.4 million (base cost): The above eight components will be supported by this component in order to
ensure wide-spread dissemination and sustainability of modernized financial management procedures
incorporating proper accounting and auditing norms. This component, to be carried out via the Comptroller
General's National Training Center (CENCAP), will finance both continuing professional/technical education
and training to build up the public sector's skills base and organizational effectiveness, as well as further
development and coverage of the national training program to disseminate the application of financial
management, auditing and accounting systems to the country's legal requirements and procedures. The training
will cover both the normative operational understanding of budget, accounting, and treasury procedures as
adapted to the decentralized government level, as well as training in the application of financial controls under
financial management and auditing systems. The audit portion of the training will assist in the build-up of
public agencies' internal auditing capability as well as complementing the institutionalization of state-of-the-art
accounting practices in the public sector.

Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
$US Millions
Credit Financing
Cash Flows and Present Value            Other Fiscal Impacts and Medium Term Costs
Note: Given that this project is for the most part, a technical assistance operation, the parameters listed
reflect reasonable (but not targeted) estimates of potential financial and fiscal impacts. These are not meant
to reflect a full analysis of all indirect costs and alternative scenarios. The primary objective is the improvement
of central, regional, and local financial management through institution building and technical modernization.
Present Value of Credit Disburse-     Present Value of financial management savings from investing
ments of $15 mn. based on            idle budget funds, reducing short term budget borrowing, and
estimated disbursement               improved tax collection (yrs. 8-17) = $17.1 mn.
profile (yrs. 1-5) = $11.3 mn.
Present Value of equipment upgrading costs (computer platform,
Present Value of repayments on        software) starting every 4 years after end of project (yrs. 9 - 37
Credit (40 yr. maturity), and        every 4 years) = -$0.9 inn.
service charges (yrs. 10-40) al
= -$0.8 mn.                          Present Value of savings from government staff reductions due to
implementation of automated financial management systems
a/ (service charges for yrs. 6-40).  (yrs. 6-8) = $1.2 mn.
Present Value of severance costs payable to terminated govern-
Net PV of Credit = $10.5 mn.          ment staff following irnplementation of integrated financial
at long-term gov't cost of           management systems (yrs. 6-14) = -$1.0 mn.
capital (c.o.c.) discounting
Present Value of incremental costs of new technical personnel
Net PV of Credit using cost of        to match skills mix for computerized financial management
IDA funds as c.o.c. = $0.0 mn.       systems requirements (yrs. 6-13) = -$0.3 mn.
Net PV of fiscal costs and savings = $16.1 mn.
a. Aggregate Net PV of project assuming long-term gov't. cost of capital = $26.6 mn.
b. Excluding IDA concessional funding subsidy = $16.1 mn.
c. PV at concessional rate as cost of capital = $48.0 mn.
Assumptions
a. Discounting rate used for PV =12%. This reflects the government's cost of capital (dollar adjusted) for
long term bonds, market-rated cost of external debt (assuming that over a 40 year period, Bolivia will
no longer rely on concessional financing as a major source of funding), and projected investment returns.
b. IDA commitment fee assumed waived as at present. Service charge continues at 0.75%. Maturity is
40 yrs. with 10 yrs. grace.
c. Adjustment for inflation on price of foreign procured equipment (informatics) = 3.5% annually.
d. Short-term dollar savings rate on government funds invested due to financial management efficiencies and
less dependence on short term borrowing for budget financing = 5% annually. This is applied to 4% of
the total government budget assumed to be invested pending disbursement (i.e., previously idle funds).
e. Total government budget (central & decentralized) assumed to be reduced by 67% following privatization
and capitalization of public enterprises. After that, government budget growth assumed at 3% per year.

Note:  Figures in parenthesis are the amounts to be financed by the Bank loan/IDA credit. Other figures include government counterpart
funds.
a/ Given the ineligibility of U.S. based goods or services under the Interim Trust Fund Credit, the Govemment has agreed to finance those
equipment and software components which are proprietary of U.S. companies and which would otherwise be purchased under sole source
arrangements (e.g.: specialized software operating systems). The goods required to be purchased from U.S. sources amount to $0.7 mn. and
are included in the counterpart funding commitment, given that they cannot be financed via the Credit. Other computer equipment purchases
under the Credit are available from European and Asian suppliers and include the requisite compatibility with UNIX and IBM based equipment.
No U.S. consultant services are earmarked under the project given the identification of qualified candidates from Europe and South America.
Goods financed under the project include, for the Ministry of Finance component, computer equipment, software, telecommunications
equipment, office supplies/equipment, and training equipment/materials (e.g.: projectors, printed material, brochures). For the Comptroller
General's component, goods under the project include computer equipment, rough terrain vehicles for accessing rural municipalities to conduct
on-site audits, and training materials.
b/ For training and operating expenses, procurement methods for goods and consultants apply, as for similar items specified under those
categories. For Training Costs, LIB and Int'l. short list procedures would be used for 39% of goods & consultant expenditures respectively, with
the remaining 61 % utilizing local shopping and national short list procedures. For Operating Expenses, LIB and Int'l. short list procedures would
be used for 16% of goods & consultant expenditures respectively, with the remaining 84% utilizing local shopping and national short list
procedures.
