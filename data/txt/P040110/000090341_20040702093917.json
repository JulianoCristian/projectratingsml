project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that system\n            technology and software are constantly evolving. Therefore,\n            a proper project design should include budgetary space for\n            system and technological changes and the possibility for\n            upgrades should be built into the design. Project\n            indicators, as defined at entry, were not specific enough to\n            provide meaningful results. Within the first year of\n            implementation the SIGMA system was linked to a parallel\n            broader institutional reform project. While we normally\n            emphasize the importance of having strong and constant\n            technical leadership by the government, it is equally\n            important to minimize turnover by IDA in the task management\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2003-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
