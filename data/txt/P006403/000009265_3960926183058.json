Attainment of\n            these objectives should contribute to improved health status\n            of rural residents in the project states, and serve as an\n            example of sectoral reform for other low income states and\n            countries. The project's two components are 1) a Health\n            Services Development component to assist in the delivery of\n            a package of three basic health services including a) care\n            for women and children including family planning, b) a\n            program for infectious disease control, c) a program for\n            ambulatory and hospital based medical care and 2) an\n            Institutional Development component to improve a)\n            administration and delivery of basic health services, b)\n            decentralization of a public health network."}, "docdt": "1989-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
