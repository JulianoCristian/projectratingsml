Project\n            will finance individual subprojects in the agricultural,\n            industrial and service sectors.  Over the two-year\n            commitment period for the ADB and IBRD loans, it is\n            estimated that the IBRD funds will finance some 1700\n            subprojects creating significant employment and foreign\n            exchange savings and earnings.  The project also provides\n            for measures to support the institutional development of\n            FDB.  There are no major risks associated with the project.\n            FDB is in sound financial condition and staffed with\n            qualified personnel. FDB's management is competent in\n            selecting and approving viable projects and, with the\n            planned hiring of a qualified engineer, this ability will be\n            further enhanced."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
