Loan\n            Project in Lithuania are as follows: overall outcome of the\n            project was rated as fully satisfactory, and the performance\n            of the Bank and the Borrower were rated as fully\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) the appointment of advisors to the project\n            implementation unit (PIU), to provide overall project\n            management support and expertise on procurement and\n            disbursement, is critical to the success of any operation\n            involving new borrowers. In this case, the advisors\n            performed an important function of training and knowledge\n            transfer to both PIU staff and a broader set of local\n            counterparts, which contributed to the sustainable impact of\n            the loan. The role of the advisors also evolved and\n            eventually decreased over time, resulting in a change in the\n            skills mix of the advisors; due to this experience, the\n            Borrower was encouraged by the Bank to develop the capacity\n            to manage the consultants; 2) active coordination within the\n            international community is necessary to deliver the\n            technical support to assist the Government to achieve policy\n            targets. The structural program outlined in the Memorandum\n            of Economic Reform Policies (MERP) provided a useful\n            framework to which the international community could anchor\n            its support at this early stage when the needs of the\n            country were not yet well understood; and 3) the Bank has an\n            ambiguous policy on used equipment; developing a clear and\n            consistent approach may be useful for future operations.\n            Used equipment would be an appropriate solution to meet some\n            of the needs of transition economies. However, in the\n            proposed used bus procurement to be financed under this\n            loan, the Bank's excessive restrictions."}, "docdt": "1996-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
