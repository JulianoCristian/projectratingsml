Its goal is to maintain a stable\n            macroeconomic environment while introducing the structural\n            reforms necessary to make productive sectors efficient and\n            internationally competitive. The objectives of the\n            Rehabilitation Loan Project are to support the economic\n            reform while at the same time providing critically needed\n            foreign exchange finance for essential imports. The loan\n            finances the following: (a) imports of inputs essential to\n            control further declines in output of the energy and\n            agricultural sectors, as well as vitally-needed\n            pharmaceutical products; (b) purchases with local currency\n            in commercial banks for the import needs of individual\n            productive enterprises; and (c) procurement of and\n            disbursement operations for the loan, as well as critical\n            elements of the reform program, which are being supported\n            with technical assistance in a number of areas."}, "docdt": "1992-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
