The Grant funded activities covered the preparation of two reports-a Biodiversity Strategy/Action Plan (BSAP) and a
National Report. The BSAP component involved the formulation and adoption of strategies and actions necessary for the
protection and sustainable use of the Recipientâ€™s biodiversity, through a participatory process that includes public and
private sectors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The BSAP included:

(a) existing information on biodiversity in the Czech Republic;
(b) objectives, strategies, and actions formulated by a steering committee and working groups; and
(c) finalized objectives, strategies, and action based on discussion within a national workshop.

The National Report component covered the full range of activities undertaken by the Recipient in accordance with its
obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

Implementation of the Project started in March 1998. The Project Completion Date was extended to September 30,
2000.
