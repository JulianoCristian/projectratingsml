Czech Republic - Biodiversity Protection - Global Environmental Facility (GEF)                                              April 28, 2004
The Czech Republic Biodiversity Protection Project was designed as a project for the former Czechoslovakia and was first identified in late
1992 and early 1993, when it was then divided into two related but separate projects for the new Czech and Slovak Republics. The
project was approved on October 19, 1993 and declared effective on January 6, 1994.

A key objective of the GEF Pilot Phase was to seek innovative and replicable solutions to global environmental challenges. The project
was one of five Bank-managed GEF projects in the region to provide assistance to countries in transition by improving the management
and protection of transboundary ecosystem biodiversity, with a focus on international collaboration. The other four projects were in Poland,
Belarus, the Slovak Republic and Ukraine.

Czech Republic has a number of internationally recognized National Parks and protected areas. While many sites would have benefited
from GEF financing, three priority zones of threatened biodiversity were highlighted for GEF Project financial support for, among others,
the following reasons:

(i) location in transboundary areas, providing the opportunity to explore cooperative relationships with neighboring park administrations of
Bavaria, Poland, Austria, the Slovak Republic and Hungary;

(ii) opportunity to conserve a large number of important wild animal and plant species, many endemic, rare, endangered or historic
varieties of commercial plants;

(iii) location in recently opened military or border areas that had escaped the pressures faced by ecosystems in neighboring regions during
the past 50 years, and for which a window of opportunity existed to introduce long-term protective management systems; and

(iv) potential for experience to be transferred to other protected areas within the Czech Republic and elsewhere.

The three ecosystems selected were:

(a) the PaIava floodplain remnants, which include the internationally significant RAMS AR wetlands of the Morava and Dyje rivers abutting
Austria and the Slovak Republic, and which were under increasing visitor and agricultural pressure since the removal of military border
restrictions;

(b) the Krkonose mountain ecosystems, which are adversely affected by transboundary air pollution as well as significant overuse by
recreationists; and

(c) the Sumava mountain forests abutting the German Bavarian forests and newly opened to recreation after years of tight military
restrictions, and in which, although not yet suffering from overuse, had a window of opportunity for the establishment of sustainable
protected management systems.

Together, the areas represent a variety of ecosystem types and habitats and are considered important centers of species evolution. All
three zones were already theoretically protected by National Park or reserve status, but were in need of increased support and improved
management



Objective

The overall project goal was to protect and strengthen forest and related ecosystem biodiversity in the Czech Republic. Three objectives
were identified to reach this goal:

 Protect three representative ecosystems: mountain meadows (Krkonose), mountain forest (Krkonose and Sumava), and lowland forest
and wetland (Pa lava);

 Support three transnational biodiversity protection networks: the Krkonose Reserves (Poland), the Sumava National Park (Austria, and
Germany), and the Morava Floodplain Forests and Wetlands (Slovak Republic and Austria); and

  Develop systems of financially sustainable biodiversity protection in the Czech Republic through the introduction of alternative
sustainable uses, user fees, related charges for visitors, and concessions to manage the areas within their determined "carrying
capacities'."



Project activities were divided into three programmatic areas:
  The Biodiversity Protection Program: to develop a range of activities including management techniques for a variety of representative
ecosystems, environmental education and community support for protected areas and sustainable management of contiguous forest
systems, ex situ conservation where in-situ efforts were inappropriate, and biodiversity research and management;

  The Conservation Program: to develop revenue generation mechanisms for the protected areas, interactions with local communities and
land managers, sustainable development strategies and demonstration activities; and

  The Institutional Infrastructure Improvement Program: to support project management coordination efforts between the Ministry and
project areas, professional development and training, the improvement of infrastructure and operations of protected areas, and the
administration of an NGO biodiversity small grants program.

The GEF Biodiversity Protection Project closed on June 30, 1998.
