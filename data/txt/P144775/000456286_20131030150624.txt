                    The second single tranche operation of a two-year programmatic DPL series. However, the
Operation Type
                    Government has indicated the likelihood for an extension of the series to three years.
Main Policy Areas   Poverty reduction, health, social assistance and of public Finance.
                    This is the second in a series of INSTANSI DPLs that supports the broader goal of the 2013-15 CPS,
                    which is to enhance Indonesia’s capacity and institutions for reducing poverty and boosting shared-
                    prosperity. In particular, the INSTANSI DPL series is expected to contribute to the Government of
                    Indonesia’s (GoI’s) objectives in the following CPS engagement areas: (i) pro-growth: promoting
                    prosperity by strengthening the public sector’s ability to promote a stable medium-term macro and
                    fiscal environment; (ii) pro-poor: promoting communities, protecting the vulnerable and improving
                    health outcomes, by expanding the coverage and improving the targeting of social assistance
                    programs, expanding the national social security health programs, and empowering communities to
                    take charge of their development needs; and (iii) pro-jobs: enhancing skills and technology, and
Program             improving social protection, by strengthening the public sector’s poverty alleviation and public
Development         financial management capacities, and also through an expansion of affordable and sustainable social
Objective(s) and    insurance. Policy reforms supported by this operation focus on the following two pillars:
Contribution to
CPS                 (i)   Enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts through improvements in the
                          design and targeting of social assistance programs aimed at poor and vulnerable households, as
                          demonstrated by the comprehensive compensation package for the subsidized fuel price increase,
                          and implementation of a new national social security system (Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional,
                          SJSN); and
                    (ii) Strengthening public financial management (PFM) for improved service delivery through
                         improvements in the medium-term results orientation of the budget process, the introduction of a
                         more efficient and effective automated budget and treasury system, and improved accounting,
                         audit, tax administration and sub-national fiscal management.
                    The second INSTANSI DPL is expected to contribute to the achievement of the following results by
                    mid-2014:
                    1. An expansion of targeted social assistance measures for the poor following an increase in the
                        price of subsidized fuel prices, from 8.5 million households to 15.5 million poor and vulnerable
                        beneficiary households (about 70 million individuals) identified through the national registry
                        (PPLS11);
                    2. Implementation of a participatory mechanism through which communities can update beneficiary

Indicators
                    3. Establishment of a main regulatory framework for implementing the national health insurance
                        program;
                    4. Improved budget transparency and planning by strengthening the use of the MTEF, with
                        publication of the details in the 2014 budget;
                    5. More efficient and effective public financial management following the introduction of a
                        Presidential regulation governing new procedures and the introduction of a new integrated budget
                        and treasury system in 2014;
                    6. Modernization of the core tax system through the establishment of individual e-filing for a

                 Macroeconomic risks: Recently, Indonesia has seen increasing pressures on its external accounts,
             with the current account deficit widening after a negative terms-of-trade shock and international
             financing conditions becoming more uncertain. Recent shifts in market sentiment have resulted in
             sudden, large and potentially disruptive reversals of capital inflows. The external accounts and
             growth outlook remain sensitive to softening global commodity prices and demand, particularly from
             China. With portfolio investors focusing on near-term policy responses, there is a risk that this diverts
             attention from longer-term reforms. However, the GoI has adopted key policy measures aimed
             towards protecting the poor and improving quality of expenditure, as supported by the ongoing DPL
             series, which are expected to help shield the risk of a crisis, and mitigate the impact of any economic
             downturns on households. The Government has developed a track record in precautionary and
             proactive measures to try to counter such shocks. This includes, for example, policy measures
             supported under the PERISAI DPL-DDO, approved in May 2012, which, along with parallel facilities
             from other development partners, also explicitly aims to mitigate GoI financing concerns in the face
             of a crisis. The Government has also been quick to introduce a package aimed primarily at longer-
             term structural measures to support exports and employment, moderate import growth, while limiting
             food price pressures. This has been accompanied by a tightening in monetary policy. There remain
             questions over the implementation of the policy package and it is likely that further policy
             adjustments will be required. However, there is the potential that the current macro-economic
             pressures that Indonesia is facing could allow policymakers the opportunity to make progress on
             medium-term structural reforms, although this must be offset against the political pressures in the
             run-up to the 2014 elections.
                 Fiscal and subsidy reform risks: Weakening revenue growth as activity moderates, and high and
             volatile energy subsidy costs, could significantly reduce fiscal space for other priority programs and
             undermine medium-term plans. Fuel subsidy spending was projected to rise significantly in 2013,
             reflecting increased consumption, imposing a substantial budget opportunity cost in terms of
             spending on key development priorities, as well as contributing to the current account deficit. Despite
Risks and
             the political pressures from elections in 2014, a revised Budget incorporated a long-awaited increase
Mitigation
             in subsidized fuel prices (although the subsidy remains significant), along with a comprehensive
             compensation package to reduce the impact of higher fuel prices on the poor, was approved on June
             17, 2013. The macroeconomic impact of the fuel subsidy reform package is expected to be
             manageable and largely short-term in nature, with a spike in inflation (although the recent exchange
             rate depreciation may prolong the upward pressures on inflation). The DPL will seek to build on these
             measures by promoting more medium-term budgeting, which should better highlight some of the
             policy trade-offs of fuel subsidies, as well as strengthening the ability of compensatory programs to
             protect the poor and vulnerable groups, while the broader social insurance programs start to come
             into effect in 2014.
                 Implementation risks: The focus of PFM reforms on enhancing expenditure controls and oversight
             will continue to make budget spending difficult in the short term, potentially undermining support for
             the reforms. Indonesia has made significant strides in PFM with increasing transparency, expenditure
             controls, and independent oversight. However, this has exacerbated existing problems of budget
             execution, particularly for capital spending, and increased the risk aversion of government officials,
             delaying much needed spending. To mitigate this risk, the DPL seeks to balance further strengthening
             of expenditure controls, with efforts to streamline procedures and improve the quality of spending as
             policymakers look for more rapid results.
                 Coordination risks: The multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional
             capacities create a challenge in coordinating and implementing reform efforts. Under the poverty
             pillar, the National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) has taken the lead in
             the overall policy planning and coordination of social assistance programs; whereas the Ministry of
             Health is the main counterpart responsible for the preparation and implementation of the new national
             social security system (SJSN). Actions under the PFM pillar are undertaken by various Directorate
             Generals under the MoF. Nevertheless, the reforms supported by the INSTANSI DPL are driven by
             priorities developed and articulated formally through a platform of dialogue and consensus building
             within the Government, which the DPL helps to provide. Hence, their implementation helps to further

                                                ii
               enhance coordination between various ministries and agencies. The overall commitment to and
               ownership of reforms also remain strong, and the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs
               ensures consistent and effective cross-ministerial coordination. While the challenge will increase as
               the election period approaches and uncertainty over institutional roles in the next administration
               increases, past experience has demonstrated continued GoI commitment to reforms, regardless of
               election outcomes. The DPL program will also continue to support the capacity of the various
               institutions involved, for example with direct support for the development of the next
               administration’s medium-term plan (RPJMN) and social insurance reforms (SJSN), which are
               complemented by other Bank instruments, including investment projects, technical assistance and
               AAA.

    1.     This proposed Second INSTANSI DPL (INSTANSI DPL-2) to Indonesia for USD400
million continues the series of the first single-tranche INSTANSI DPL that began in 2012. The goal of
the INSTANSI DPL series is to assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to achieve its medium-term
growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity objectives, by supporting measures to enhance Indonesia’s
capacity and institutions for targeting poverty reduction measures, introducing a major social insurance
program, and enhancing the management of public finances for better service delivery. The proposed
operation was previously envisioned to be the second of a two-year, programmatic DPL series. However,
the Government has recently indicated the possibilityd of continuing the engagement by extending the
INSTANSI DPL series from two to three years. Therefore, a set of tentative triggers for a third INSTANSI
DPL operation has been developed, which will need to be adjusted and refined, as progress is made and
discussions with the GoI counterparts evolve.

    2.      Significant progress has indeed been achieved since the beginning of the current Indonesia
DPL series in 2004, which led to a deepening in the focus of the World Bank program lending to
Indonesia.1 Initially focused on supporting the Government macroeconomic stabilization efforts, the DPL
series has evolved into separate sectoral DPLs, with the aim of maximizing synergies across the Bank’s
program in Indonesia, increasing ownership of the reforms by the relevant institutions, and improving the
targeting of complementary technical assistance programs. Three sectoral DPLs emerged in 2012: (i) the
Institutional Strengthening for Social Inclusion2 Development Policy Loan (INSTANSI DPL-2), which is
largely a continuation of the previous DPL series that focused on poverty reduction and social delivery, and
public financial management (PFM); (ii) the Connectivity DPL, which supports reforms to reduce domestic
logistics costs and strengthen inclusive development; and (iii) the Financial Sector and Investment Climate
Reform and Modernization Development Policy Loan (FIRM DPL), which aimed to promote the
development of a sound, efficient and inclusive financial sector and support improvements in the investment
climate in Indonesia. To date, the GoI has made formal request only to continue with two of these three DPL
series, namely the Second INSTANSI DPL and the Second Connectivity DPLs.

    3.      Overall progress achieved under the DPL program continues to be satisfactory. The DPL
program has established a good track record in advancing key policy and institutional reforms to support
Indonesia’s economic growth and poverty reduction. Supporting Indonesia’s relatively ambitious policy
reforms is at the core of the World Bank’s program in Indonesia.3 Over the past few years, in addition to the
DPL series, the World Bank has also been supporting policy reforms in the infrastructure sector (through the
Infrastructure DPL, closed in FY11), the Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF DPL-DDO) and the
PERISAI DPL-DDO, which provide critical support during periods of heightened global financial
uncertainty.

     4.    The INSTANSI DPL continues to be led by and based on GoI priorities. The GoI continues
to take the lead in outlining the policy actions supported by the proposed INSTANSI DPL-2, based on its
reform agenda. To date, all policy actions have been completed.Continuous policy dialogue took place

  The previous DPL series consisted of: (i) first DPL series (DPLs 1-4), which was implemented from 2004 to 2007 and anchored to
the FY04-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): (ii) second DPL series (DPLs 5-6) that was implemented from 2008-2009; (iii)
third DPL series (DPLs 7-8). This series was initially set out as a three-year DPL series (DPLs 7-9) to be implemented from 2010-
2012, but was terminated one year earlier, in light of the GoI’s request for a renewed three sectoral DPLs (INSTANSI, Connect ivity
and FIRM DPLs); and (iv) a two-year INSTANSI DPL series (INSTANSI DPLs 1-2).

  Note that the original name of the series was the Institutional, Tax Administration, Social and Investment (INSTANSI) DPL. The
full name has been changed to better reflect the objectives of the series, with INSTANSI the Bahasa Indonesia word for
“Institution”.

  The World Bank program in Indonesia is split approximately equal between program support (DPL), investment loans and results
based operations (such as the ‘Local Government and Decentralization’ programs).

                                                                 1
between the different GoI counterparts and the World Bank, through a series of formal dialogues throughout
the preparation of the INSTANSI DPL-2, in order to formulate the supported policy actions and to assess
their progress. Other development partners also participated actively throughout the policy dialogue.
Technical assistance is often provided by different development partners in support of the policy actions
identified by the Government. The INSTANSI DPL-2 was negotiated with the GoI in October 2013 and is
expected to be presented to the World Bank Board in November 2013.

    5.      Following a resilient economic performance since the global financial crisis, Indonesia’s
economy and policy settings are now adjusting to a number of domestic and external pressures. These
include weak export performance contributing to the notable deterioration in the current account balance,
volatile external financing conditions, higher subsidized fuel prices and associated temporary inflation, and a
moderation in domestic demand growth. Monetary, exchange rate and fiscal policy adjustments so far have
been significant, but more may be required, combined with strong communication and coordination of
policies. Ongoing pressures on the external balances, and the prospects of a less supportive international
environment with higher global interest rates and less buoyant commodity demand, underscore the need for
more policy reforms in a number of areas to support faster and more inclusive growth and poverty reduction,
notably the regulatory environment and in manufacturing and trade policy.

    6.     Indonesia’s fiscal and monetary policy settings will need to continue to adjust to a shifting
macroeconomic outlook. The GoI has taken a number of measures to address the rising domestic and
external pressures. Since June 2013, the monetary policy stance has shifted markedly towards tightening and
the exchange rate policy has remained flexible. The Government also announced a comprehensive policy
package in mid-August. Yet the key risk remains that external funding needs continue to place a strain on
the rupiah or reserves, for example due to a further weakening in key export commodity prices or weak net
inward investment dynamics, requiring additional monetary policy tightening, denting confidence and
further crimping growth. The risks of such a scenario resulting in a loss of macroeconomic stability are
mitigated by the fact that the policy framework is proving generally responsive to the risk of
macroeconomic imbalances. Policy buffers, although reduced, remain ample, and the structural
underpinnings of resilient growth remain in place, suggesting a favorable medium-term outlook for
Indonesia. Hence, the overall macroeconomic policy framework remains adequate for continued support
through a development policy operation.

  7.     A set of policy actions have been identified to be supported by the proposed INSTANSI
DPL-2, surrounding the following two pillars:

    (i)     Enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts through improved governance
            and institutional accountability, better measurement and targeting of the poor and vulnerable in
            social assistance programs, and implementation of a new national social security system (Sistem
            Jaminan Sosial Nasional, SJSN); and

    (ii)    Strengthening public financial management (PFM) through improvements in the medium-
            term results orientation of the budget process, the introduction of a more efficient and effective
            automated budget and treasury system, streamlining of budget execution procedures, and
            improved accounting, audit, tax administration and sub-national fiscal management.

     8.     The proposed INSTANSI DPL-2 supports the significant increase in social spending under
the revised 2013 Budget, in part to help shield poor households from the impact of higher fuel prices.
The design of the social compensation package also demonstrates the important steps that have been taken
towards developing a more comprehensive, integrated and well-targeted social support system, supported
under previous DPLs. The approved package of compensation measures totals IDR 29 trillion (USD2.7
billion), or about three-quarters of the estimated total fuel subsidy savings in 2013. The compensation
package comprises two main components: (a) an unconditional cash transfer (Bantuan Langsung Sementara

                                                      2
Masyarakat, BLSM) for 15.5 million of Indonesia’s poorest households (around 90 million people) for a
period of four months, the provision of additional rice to beneficiaries of the Rice for the Poor ( Raskin)
program, and additional spending on infrastructure programs; and (b) financial assistance for poor students
and conditional cash transfers for health (Program Keluarga Harapan, PKH) is being expanded.

    9.      The proposed operation also supports the strengthening of social protection in Indonesia,
through the establishment of a new national social security system (Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional,
SJSN) commencing implementation in 2014. The SJSN aims to provide all Indonesians with the same
health coverage, pension (defined benefit), old-age savings (defined contribution), death benefits and work
accident compensation. If well implemented, the SJSN programs can help to reduce vulnerability, protect
against economic shocks, facilitate job mobility, reduce elderly poverty, help reduce some forms of
inequality, and mobilize scarce savings. However, the success of the new system depends on how well it is
designed, implemented and managed. The Government’s efforts to implement a well -designed, fiscally
sustainable, robust and comprehensive national social protection system will prove challenging and will
require a series of major actions from the Government, some of which are supported under this DPL, and
relevant administrative bodies in order to succeed.

    10.     PFM reforms are an important complement to the DPL because of the impact they can
have to improve the quality of service delivery, especially through those programs and services aimed
at poverty alleviation and shared prosperity. In Indonesia PFM reforms would support smoother flow
of funds to front-line service delivery units, greater transparency in the use of resources by central and local
authorities, better links between resources and outputs/performance, more effective accountability
structures, and higher rates of execution for critically needed public infrastructure. As Indonesia embarks on
a period of second generation reforms to provide, for example, more sophisticated services in infrastructure,
better education, and sustainable social insurance and social delivery systems, it is particularly important to
assure macro fiscal stability, as well as improve the quality of spending if growth is to accelerate to 7
percent and higher.


                                       II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT


    A. The Current State of the Indonesian Economy

    11.     Following a resilient economic performance since the global financial crisis, Indonesia’s
economy and policy settings are now adjusting to a number of domestic and external pressures: weak
export performance contributing to a notable deterioration in the current account balance, volatile external
financing conditions, higher subsidized fuel prices and associated temporary inflation, and a moderation in
domestic demand growth. Monetary, exchange rate and fiscal policy adjustments so far have been quite
significant, but more may be required, combined with strong communication and coordination of policies.
Ongoing pressures on the external balances, and the prospects of a less supportive international environment
with higher global interest rates and less buoyant commodity demand, underscore the need for more policy
reforms in a number of areas to support faster and more inclusive growth and poverty reduction, notably the
regulatory environment and in manufacturing and trade policy.

    12.     The Indonesian economy has performed strongly over the past decade. Real annual GDP
growth averaged 5.7 percent from 2003 to 2012, lifting real GDP per capita by 54 percent to USD 3,563 (in
2012 US dollars). This solid performance was underpinned by sustained domestic private demand growth,
fueled by favorable demographics (a growing labor force and falling dependency ratio), accompanied by
rapid urbanization and a growing domestic market. Consumer and investor confidence levels, and the
availability of investment funding, were supported by prudent macroeconomic management which, along

                                                       3
with strong economic growth, resulted in greatly improved private and public sector balance sheets.
International demand for Indonesia’s abundant natural resources, particularly from emerging economies
such as China, also played its part, with around two-thirds of exports commodity-related.

     13.    The economy proved resilient to the 2008/9 global financial crisis and the subsequent slow
and uneven recovery in high-income economies. Growth slowed from 6.0 percent in 2008 to 4.6 percent
in 2009, but subsequently rebounded and has remained in the 5.8-6.5 percent range in every quarter since
the beginning of 2010. This resilience can be attributed to strong initial conditions going into the crisis, the
related availability and deployment of sizable fiscal and monetary buffers to cushion the shock, and
Indonesia’s lower dependence on external demand relative to many of its regional peers. Consumer inflation
also moderated, from an average of 8.7 percent per year in 2003-08 to 4.9 percent in 2009-12, helped by the
absence of any major food or administered price shocks through mid-2013. This solid performance, which
contributed to Fitch and Moody’s returning Indonesia to investment grade status in late 2011 and early 2012,
attracted strong investor interest, fueled by abundant global liquidity. However, portfolio investment
inflows, although generally strong, were prone to bouts of significant volatility, providing a reminder that
Indonesia remains susceptible to external shocks through the financial channel, given high foreign
ownership shares of both stocks and bonds. Inbound foreign direct investment also trended higher,
contributing to rapid investment growth rates through 2012 (with fixed investment expenditure reaching one
third of nominal GDP).

    14.      Indonesia’s economy, having been hit by a negative trade shock as global commodity prices
and demand have fallen since 2011, is now showing signs of a slowdown. Over 2012, the major drag on
growth was net exports, with export volumes rising just 2.0 percent but import volumes increasing by a
more robust 6.7 percent, reflecting the strength of domestic demand; net exports consequently reduced
growth in 2012 by 1.5 percentage points. Investment growth also fell over the second half of 2012, and by
the start of 2013 had become the main driver of the overall GDP growth moderation, decelerating from 12.5
percent yoy in Q2 2012 to 4.7 percent yoy in Q2 2013. The main cause of weaker investment growth has
been a sharp slowdown in machinery and equipment spending, reflected in falls in capital goods imports.
Fixed investment has shown a strong historical link with commodity sector conditions, and the softening in
international commodity prices since early 2011 has likely now filtered into investment. On the production
side, weakness is concentrated in commodities sectors, such as mining and quarrying (contracting 1.2
percent yoy in Q2 2013), compared with more robust performance in manufacturing (up 5.8 percent),
construction (up 6.9 percent), and especially the services sector (up 7.5 percent).

    15.     The negative commodity-related shock to exports has resulted in a sharp weakening in the
trade balance. The annual goods trade balance declined from USD 34.8 billion in 2011 to USD 8.6 billion
in 2012, reflecting weaker merchandise export values (down 6.0 percent in 2012) coupled with ongoing
growth in merchandise imports (which rose by 8.0 percent in 2012). Pressure on the trade balance has
persisted so far in 2013, with export revenues down 6.1 percent yoy in H1 2013, and import values down a
more modest 2.2 percent yoy, resulting in a cumulative trade deficit of USD 3.3 billion (compared with a
USD 512 million surplus in H1 2012). Initially, most of the swing in the trade balance could be attributed to
the erosion of the non-oil and gas trade surplus, but since mid-2012 the oil and gas trade deficit has also
widened substantially, having previously tended to be close to neutral.

     16.    This has contributed to a marked deterioration in Indonesia’s current account balance
since 2011. In 2012 Indonesia recorded its first annual current account deficit since 1997, of USD 24.2
billion or 2.8 percent of GDP, compared with a small surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2011. Pressure on the
current account has persisted in 2013, with quarterly deficits of USD 5.8 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) and
USD 9.8 billion (4.4 percent of GDP) recorded in Q1 and Q2. While the bulk of this swing has been due to
the erosion of Indonesia’s historically strong goods trade surpluses, sizable structural deficits on the services
trade and, especially, income sub-accounts, which have been broadly flat over recent quarters, also continue
to weigh on the overall current account balance.

    17.     The re-emergence of current account deficits has placed an increased focus on the
availability and quality of external financing, with Indonesia having tended to run a basic balance of
payments deficit on a quarterly basis since late 2011, despite robust FDI inflows (of USD 20 billion in 2012
and USD 8.3 billion in H1 2013). Portfolio investment remains volatile and reported private external debt
has also risen significantly, almost doubling since 2008 to be USD 131 billion in May 2013, and while
external debt solvency metrics remain sound (with total external debt to GDP standing at 28.7 percent of
GDP at the end of 2012 according to official estimates), gross external funding needs have consequently
increased significantly. External debt disbursements and principal repayments totaled USD 184.4 billion and
USD 164.3 billion, respectively, in 2012.
    18.     Indonesian asset markets have been significantly affected by the recent pullback in
emerging asset markets globally, following the pricing-in of QE “tapering” in the US since early May.
Particularly sharp falls in Indonesian asset prices were seen from mid-August (with an 8.6 percent decline in
the equity market over 19-20 August). The rupiah has been under pressure, depreciating by 12.2 percent
over August and September, to IDR 11,532 per US dollar (down 19.2 percent since the start of the year).
Rupiah-denominated government bond yields have been volatile and, though off their recent peaks at the
end of August, remain up 220 to 300 basis points since the start of 2013). The context for these market
moves has been one involving the release of weak domestic data, particularly on the second quarter balance
of payments, and ongoing domestic and international policy adjustments.

    19.     The macro policy adjustments to these recent pressures are ongoing, but have been seen in
both fiscal and monetary policies. On fiscal policy, the revised Budget for 2013 increased the targeted
deficit by 0.7 percentage points to 2.4 percent of GDP, on the back of weaker revenue growth (in line with
moderating nominal GDP growth and weak export revenues). Most notably, the Government increased
subsidized fuel prices in June for the first time since 2005, increasing the subsidized petrol price by 44
percent to IDR 6,500 per liter and the subsidized diesel price by 22 percent to IDR 5,500 per liter (still well
below the market price at the time of over IDR 9,000 per liter). This price rise, which followed the missed
opportunity to follow through on proposed reform in 2012, marked a major step forward in increasing the
quality of public spending and safeguarding fiscal sustainability. The impact on the poor was cushioned by a
significant temporary compensation package for 2013, amounting to just under IDR 30 trillion.

    20.    The increase in subsidized fuel prices, while welcome, has contributed to a rise in inflation.
Headline inflation rose sharply to 8.6 percent yoy in July and then 8.8 percent in August, up from 5.9
percent yoy in June and well above the ceiling of Bank Indonesia’s 3.5-5.5 percent target band. These
moves also reflected the seasonal impact of Ramadan. Prices fell and yoy inflation came down to 8.4 percent
in September. The one-off impact of the subsidized fuel price increase is expected to abate fairly rapidly in
the coming months (in month-on-month terms, before dropping out of the base by Q3 2014) although
pressures may remain from second-round effects or from the exchange rate pass through. Core inflation,
although moderate, has picked up somewhat, moving to 4.7 percent yoy in September, from 4 percent in
June.

    21.     In response to the deterioration in financial markets, and significant pressure on the
rupiah, the Government announced a policy package in mid-August. The package has four pillars: (1)
Improving the current account balance. This involves measures to encourage exports, such as fiscal
incentives for export-oriented firms in labor-intensive sectors and relaxing the quota on mineral exports, and
measures to reduce import growth, such as increasing the required use of bio-diesel in the domestic energy
consumption mix. (2) Maintaining economic growth and employment, including fiscal incentives to support
labor-intensive sectors, aiming to limit lay-offs. Notably, revisions are also proposed to the setting of the
minimum wage in support of a more rational process and fairer outcome. (3) Lowering inflation, including
replacing quotas with tariffs for imports of beef and horticulture products. (4) Enhancing investment to

                                                               6
support both growth and capital inflows, including measures to simplify licensing, to expedite the approval
of the Revised Negative Investment List, and to move forward with “debottlenecking” key strategic
investment projects. While focused on many of the important structural issues faced by the economy, the
implementation, both in terms of timing and substance, will clearly be key in determining the impact of the
package.

    22.      Ahead of the recent period of adjustment, monetary policy was highly accommodative. Key
policy rates remained unchanged from February 2012, when Bank Indonesia cut the lower bound of its
interest rate corridor to a record low of 4 percent, and June 2013. In mid-2012, however, BI announced new
loan-to-value limits for vehicle and real estate lending, and this appears to have contributed to a decline in
credit growth from a peak of 26 percent in May, to a still robust 22 percent in August 2013. These
macroprudential adjustments also reflected the pronounced price pressures in some pockets of the property
market (e.g. residential apartments, commercial office, and industrial space, in Jakarta up 45 percent, 43
percent and 22 percent, respectively, yoy in December 2012). The macroeconomic stability risks posed by
such sharp property price increases are mitigated by the fact that overall property-related exposures in the
banking system remain comparatively small at 14 percent of total bank assets, and by BI’s prudential
measures.

    23.      Since June 2013 the monetary policy stance has shifted markedly towards tightening, in line
with the focus on facilitating the adjustment in external balances and limiting inflationary pressures. Pre-
empting the increase in subsidized fuel prices, and with pressure on the rupiah intensifying since May, BI
surprised markets on June 11 by increasing its overnight deposit facility (FASBI) rate by 25 basis points,
followed by a 25 basis point increase in its reference rate at its subsequent June policy meeting. This was
followed by a 50 basis point increase in these key policy rates in July. However, policy rates were left
unchanged in August and this raised some concerns in the markets, even though new macroprudential
measures were also announced. Following the release of weak second quarter balance of payments statistics
and intensifying downward pressure on the rupiah, the FASBI and reference rates were lifted by a further 50
basis points at an extraordinary policy meeting held on August 29 (in addition, the upper bound of the
interest rate corridor, the BI lending facility rate, was also increased by 25 basis points). This was followed
by a further 25 basis point increase in the FASBI, reference and lending facility rates at the scheduled
meeting on September 12. Thus, since June 2013, BI has raised its overnight deposit facility (FASBI), and
reference, rates by 150 basis points (to 5.5 and 7.25 percent, respectively), and its key lending rate by 50
basis points (to 7.25 percent). A number of macroprudential measures with a tightening bias, and steps to
facilitate liquidity management, have also been taken: loan-to-deposit limits have been lowered from 100 to
90 percent, both government bonds and BI certificates of deposit have been allowed to be counted against
banks’ secondary reserve requirements, and shorter tenor BI deposit securities have been introduced.

     24.     Exchange rate policy has remained flexible in as much as the rupiah has been allowed to
depreciate through mid-2013, but improving currency market liquidity and transparency remains a
challenge. Foreign currency reserve growth stalled in 2012 (compared with growth of USD 14 billion in
2011), and the rupiah has weakened materially, with the nominal effective exchange rate trending lower
since late 2010, to lose 11.8 percent between its late 2010 peak and July 2013. August has seen further,
pronounced currency weakness, as also seen in many other major emerging markets (such as Brazil, India
and Turkey), taking the rupiah’s depreciation over 2013 through the end of August to 15 percent, and 19.2
through the end of September. While the depreciation has mostly been gradual and orderly, there have been
some periods (in mid-2011, early 2012, early 2013 and July and August 2013) of very tight foreign currency
liquidity, leading to a wide spread between official and market-quoted rupiah spot rates. Foreign currency
demand in the commercial currency markets was cut early in 2012 by BI’s decision to meet the US dollar
needs of the state-owned oil company (Pertamina) directly, a move which coincided with a stabilization of
the USD/IDR exchange rate, but was also followed by a substantial drawdown in currency reserves, which
fell from USD 112.8 billion in December 2012 to just below USD 105 billion in March 2013. Following the


                                                      7
bout of global emerging market volatility and outflows beginning in May and continuing into the third
quarter, reserves have subsequently fallen further, to USD 93 billion in August 2013.

    25.     Recent measures by BI may help somewhat to improve currency market conditions. These
include: initiating US Dollar swap auctions to deepen hedging opportunities and, potentially, dampen spot
US Dollar demand at times of market uncertainty, reversing the 2011 regulation that imposed a minimum 6-
month holding period for foreign investors purchasing BI bills (SBIs) by cutting the required holding period
to 1 month, and increasing official foreign exchange buffers, by extending a USD 12 billion-equivalent swap
facility with the Bank of Japan (in late August) and USD 16 billion-equivalent swap facility with the
People’s Bank of China (in October), and announcing a new USD 16 billion-equivalent swap facility with
the Bank of Korea (also in October).

     26.     Despite the recent pressures in the financial markets, slowdown of growth and depreciation
of the rupiah, Indonesian banks have shown resilience to the impact of recent developments. Bank
credit growth is slowing with the rise in new loan approvals weakening. Overall aggregate level banking
health indicators remain sound, with low non-performing loans of 2 percent, and high capital adequacy of 18
percent have proven to serve as buffers. Another factor limiting the impact has been banks’ relatively low
foreign-currency exposures. However, despite this sound financial performance to date, the banking sector
could still face pressure from further decelerating growth or additional market turmoil in upcoming months.
Such pressures may well impact on smaller banks more markedly, with reports of some tightening in their
liquidity in recent months, leading them to raise deposit rates. Substantial efforts have been made to improve
crisis communication and protocols among the various institutions (BI, MoF, the new unified financial
supervisory authority, OJK, and the deposit insurance agency). However, the transition to the new unified
financial supervisory agency, OJK, and the absence of a financial sector safety net law do raise potential
risks on the policy response should any systemic bank enter liquidity difficulties. Financing conditions for
non-bank corporates have also tightened. Again, while leverage levels remain low, the concern is more of
the potential for increased borrowing and repayment costs, particularly for those corporates with external
debt without a natural currency hedge, or who have been impacted by declines in global commodity prices.

    B. Macroeconomic Outlook

    27.     Growth prospects have dimmed appreciably and risks to the outlook have risen. In the base
case, GDP growth is expected to shift down fairly moderately, responding to weaker terms of trade, higher
interest rates and the negative impact of higher inflation on consumption. This expected, moderate
deceleration would be broadly positive for safeguarding macroeconomic stability, and particularly for
reducing the current account deficit to more sustainable levels in the context of subdued export performance
and tighter international liquidity conditions. However, a more severe growth deceleration cannot be ruled
out, with specific risks including a more disorderly currency adjustment and financial market volatility
having a more pronounced impact on real economic activity.

                                                           9
    28.      GDP growth in 2013 is projected to be 5.6 percent, down from 6.2 percent in 2012, and
moving down to 5.3 percent in 2014. Private consumption is expected to remain the main driver of growth,
potentially boosted by early pre-election spending towards the end of 2013 and into 2014. Investment is
expected to expand at a much more moderate pace than in 2012. Unlike 2012, net exports are not expected
to be a significant drag on growth over 2013, as import volume growth decelerates in line with slower
investment growth, and export volume growth remains positive, albeit sluggish. The 2013 growth projection
of 5.6 percent is higher than the IMF assessment letter projection of 5.4 percent, reflecting a difference in
the profiling of the feed-through of recent policy tightening, moderation in credit growth and financial
market developments to growth (with the IMF figure expecting a sharper slowdown in the second half of
2013). Based on recent higher frequency data, the World Bank expects such impacts to flow through with a
slightly longer lag. Looking forward to 2015, growth is expected to rise to 5.8 percent, although there is a
substantial range of uncertainty around this baseline and risk of moving to a lower growth trajectory. Such
risk could materialize in the absence of progress in addressing well-known impediments to medium-term
growth in Indonesia and sufficiently supportive external conditions (in terms of trade and FDI inflows in
particular).

    29.     The current account deficit is expected to widen in 2013, to USD 29 billion, or 3.4 percent of
GDP, before narrowing in 2014 to 2.6 percent of GDP. The overall balance of payments is expected to
record a sizable deficit in 2013, reflecting a shortfall in net investment inflows relative to the current account
funding need, and resulting in a drawdown of about USD 20 billion in foreign currency reserves. The overall
balance of payments deficit is expected to shrink significantly in 2014, reflecting a smaller current account
deficit and sustained overall net investment inflows.

    30.     Inflation pressures are expected to abate after the mid-2013 price surge triggered by the
June subsidized fuel price increase and the seasonal impact of Ramadan. Headline inflation in Q4 2013
is projected at 9.8 percent compared with 4.4 percent in Q4 2012, and inflation to average 7.3 percent in
2013 and 6.7 percent in 2014. This base case assumes that second-round inflation will remain contained,
allowing the price impact of the June fuel price increase to drop out of the base by mid-2014. However,
while core inflation has so far remained little-changed, there is a clear risk of some second-round effects
from the recent spike in headline inflation, particularly given other cost-push inflation pressures.
Exceptionally high minimum wage increases for 2013 were granted (including 44 percent for Greater
Jakarta), and while the direct impact of this on the CPI basket is very small, such increases may feed into
higher wages across the economy and hence spill over into consumer prices, particularly if reinforced by
sizable additional minimum wage increases for 2014. More pass-through from the significant nominal
depreciation of the rupiah can also not be ruled out. A further uncertainty for inflation is the possibility of
additional reforms to administered prices, notably fuel subsidies. While welcome on equity, efficiency and
fiscal grounds, the possibility of additional measures adds upside, albeit largely temporary, inflation risk.
Bank Indonesia will need to gauge the risk of these supply-side factors feeding through into higher
generalized inflation, which may necessitate further tightening monetary policy.

    31.     Risks to the growth outlook are to the downside, given uncertainties over consumer and
investor confidence, and downside risks to domestic demand growth. While domestic demand has
remained resilient so far, the headwinds have mounted since June: higher fuel prices and higher generalized
consumer price inflation in recent months (eroding purchasing power and consumer confidence), higher
interest rates (dampening hitherto rapid credit growth), and potential negative wealth and corporate
investment activity impacts from the stock price declines seen since May. These increased challenges are
occurring against the backdrop of a continued weakening in international commodity prices, with the US
dollar price basket of Indonesia’s top six commodity export products declining by 8 percent in 2013 through
August (down 35 percent from the post global financial peak reached in February 2011). Commodity prices
are a key driver of domestic demand conditions, due to their importance for export revenues, company
profits, and for household incomes in parts of the country where the resources sector is important for labor

                                                       10
income, such as oil palm growing regions. Looking further ahead into 2014, investment is likely to face
some headwinds from the ongoing failure to address regulatory issues, some policy missteps, and general
uncertainties surrounding the electoral process and outcome as the 2014 elections draw nearer. Indonesia
also continues to face competition from its peers in the region for export-oriented investment, at a time when
labor costs, at least for minimum wage workers, have risen sharply.

     32.    Indonesia’s fiscal and monetary policy settings will need to continue to adjust to a shifting
macroeconomic outlook. Monetary policy faces the challenge of recalibrating interest and exchanges rates
so as to improve the external balances, and guarding against a build-up of inflationary pressures due to
supply-side price increases (from higher subsidized fuel prices and the weaker currency), without unduly
crimping economic growth and weakening public and private sector balance sheets. The interest rate and
exchange rate increases seen so far over 2013 argue that the monetary policy stance has indeed been shifting
in the right direction, although more will likely be needed. On the fiscal side, policy planning will need to
account for the persistence of slower revenue growth and higher nominal debt-financing costs, placing
further focus on the need to lift the quality of spending, in terms of its technical and allocative efficiency,
and so as to meet the Government’s development objectives. The 2014 Budget, scheduled to be approved by
late October 2013, will provide an important gauge of how fiscal policy is adjusting, with the adoption of
realistic macroeconomic assumptions, continuation of the hitherto prudent overall fiscal stance, and
continued emphasis on redirecting spending away from energy subsidies and towards capital expenditures,
being desirable (including a move towards further subsidy reform, although this may prove difficult to
achieve given the 2014 elections).

    33.     Management of the external balance will be a particularly key challenge and the projection
of stable macroeconomic performance is predicated on the avoidance of significant policy missteps in
this area, as well as more clarity and implementation progress on the Government’s response package
(outlined above). With many of the policies likely to realize an impact only in the medium term, many
investors and commentators felt they did not go far enough to bring about a near-term adjustment in the
external balances through dampening domestic demand. These fears appear to have been allayed, at least in
the short term, by the subsequent rate increase by BI. However, more information on the substantive content
of the proposals is still needed, and the degree to which they are seen as being mutually consistent across
government, and the manner in which they are implemented, will matter. Investor risk perceptions will
likely hinge, in particular, on the extent to which policymakers are seen to be tolerant of somewhat lower
domestic demand growth in order to ease balance of payments pressures, making policy coordination and
communication paramount, particularly against the backdrop of an intensifying political cycle. Should they
be implemented, a number of specific measures mooted in the policy package to encourage investment, such
as a less restrictive negative investment list (DNI, governing the restrictions on foreign investment by
sector), have the potential to send a positive signal to the market by helping create positive expectations in
terms of future FDI flows, and thus bring more stability to the currency market.

    34.     In the event of further negative external shocks, Indonesia will feel the effects through the
trade, financial and domestic confidence channels, but is in a relatively strong position to respond.
Monitoring and coordination mechanisms are in place to facilitate a flexible response to major market
dislocations, with the Forum for the Coordination of Financial Sector Stability having met to discuss
developments since financial market conditions began to deteriorate in May 2013, and the BOP monitoring
task force of the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia having been reactivated to monitor bank liquidity,
FX liquidity and short-term debt exposures.

    35.    On both the fiscal and external sectors, the focus is more on ensuring adequate near-term
financing than concerns over medium-term debt sustainability. Private external debt has trended
upwards, but was under 30 percent of GDP at the end of 2012, supporting external debt solvency metrics.,
However, as mentioned, Indonesia’s gross external financing needs are substantial, and those arising from
the servicing and repayment of external debt are considerably larger than those generated by the current

                                                      11
account deficit. Gross external debt repayments in Q2 2013 totaled USD 43.1 billion versus a quarterly
current account deficit of USD 9.8 billion. Tighter external financing conditions and Rupiah depreciation
make for a more costly and challenging environment for refinancing existing external debt, over half of
which (or 15 percent of GDP) now consists of private external debt. This is particularly the case for
corporates without access to natural currency hedges (through US Dollar revenues) and those heavily
exposed to the recent weakening in global commodity prices. Official gross reserves of USD 95.7 billion at
end-September, while well down from their recent high of USD 124.6 billion in August 2011, remain more
than sufficient to cover Indonesia’s short-term external financing needs, despite the ratio of short-term
external debt to official reserves having risen from 40 percent to around 50 percent at end-2011. However,
more importantly, external liquidity risks have risen, with the debt service ratio rising to 80 percent in June
2013, from around 30 percent in mid-2011. Bank Indonesia projects that repayments of external debt
excluding trade finance, revolving loans and currency and deposits will total USD 32.6 billion over August
to December 2013, of which USD 28.8 billion is private debt, with a further USD 33.4 billion in gross
repayments expected in January-July 2014. As mentioned above, in support of contingency arrangements,
Bank Indonesia has recently extended bilateral currency swap arrangements with China, Korea and Japan.

    36.     Gross fiscal financing needs do remain substantial but the overall fiscal balance sheet
remains strong. Central government debt was just under 24 percent of GDP at the end of 2012, with its
downward trajectory in recent years supported by strong nominal GDP growth, exchange rate appreciation
and relatively low deficits. Debt sustainability analysis points to the debt-to-GDP ratio picking up somewhat
(by 2-3 percentage points) over the next couple of years due to declining nominal GDP growth, the weaker
exchange rate and projected higher fiscal deficit (albeit still less than 3 percent of GDP). The baseline
projection is for debt-to-GDP to remain in the range of 25-30 percent of GDP over the medium-term, absent
significant shocks. Turning to fiscal financing risks, in the event of major disruption to local or international
bond markets, crisis management protocols and continent financing facilities with development partners
have been set up to support financing of critical public expenditures. The World Bank PERISAI DPL-DDO
operation, in addition to supporting short-term policy measures aimed at enhancing crisis preparedness,
provides contingent budget support through end June 2014, which the Government intends to draw down
only in the event of a significant worsening of the financing conditions. The Government has also secured
additional contingent financing of around USD 3 billion from the Government of Japan (JPY 120 billion),
Australian Treasury (AUD 1 billion) and the Asian Development Bank (USD 500 million). The
Government continues to view the contingent budget support as last resort financing to be used only if the
required financing cannot be raised due to a fiscal financing crisis. For 2013, as of 8 October, the
Government had reached 82 percent of its revised annual securities issuance target of IDR 331 trillion.
Efforts are also being made to support the financing position through, for example, additional funding via
program loan operations such as the World Bank DPLs.

    37.     Overall, Indonesia’s macroeconomic framework is adequate for the proposed operation.
Economic growth is moderating, and in the base case this is projected to stabilize at a pace which is still
solid but more commensurate with a sustainable current account deficit. The key risk is that external funding
needs continue to place a strain on the rupiah or reserves, for example due to a further weakening in key
export commodity prices or weak net inward investment dynamics, requiring additional monetary policy
tightening, denting confidence and further crimping growth. The risks of such a scenario resulting in a loss
of macroeconomic stability are mitigated by the fact that the policy framework is proving generally
responsive to the risk of macroeconomic imbalances. Policy buffers, although reduced, remain ample, and
the structural underpinnings of resilient growth remain in place, suggesting a favorable medium-term
outlook for Indonesia, predicated, as discussed above, on the implementation of supporting reforms, for
example on the investment climate, on enhancing skills and improving infrastructure provision.

       C. Poverty, Vulnerability and Shared Prosperity

     38.    Sustained growth has allowed poverty reduction to continue, with the national poverty rate
falling to 11.4 percent in 2013, but the rate of reduction in recent years has slowed. Since recovering
from the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC), Indonesia’s national poverty rate has halved from 24 percent in 1999
to 12 percent in 2012.4 Despite sustained strong economic growth, however, the rate of poverty reduction is
slowing. The 0.5 percentage point fall in poverty between 2011 and 2012 was the smallest decline in the
past six years. One of the reasons for a slowing rate of poverty reduction in recent years is that the poverty
basket inflation has been considerably higher than both headline and core inflation. In 2013, the fall in
poverty picked up slightly as the rate dropped to 11.4 percent, 0.6 of a percentage point from 2012 levels.
Even so, about 28 million Indonesians—out of the current population of 246 million—still live below the
poverty line (for 2013, the poverty line was set at IDR 271,600 per person per month). Approximately half
of these households can be considered as being chronically poor, or consistently measured as poor in three
consecutive years.


4
    Indonesia’s national poverty line is the weighted average of the provincial urban/rural poverty lines.

                                                                    13
     39.    Extreme poverty has also been falling, but at a slower pace. Indonesia identifies those
households living below 0.8 times the official poverty line as being extremely poor. Since the AFC, the
national extreme poverty rate has fallen from 9.39 percent in 1999 to 3.79 percent in 2012. This reduction
has occurred at a slower pace than the drop in the official poverty rate. Based on international comparisons,
however, the rate of extreme poverty is higher. In 2010, 18 percent of households in Indonesia fell below the
international benchmark for extreme poverty set at PPP$1.25 per day.5 Despite methodological problems
with calculating an international comparable rate of extreme poverty, this indicates that Indonesia continues
to face challenges in eradicating extreme poverty.6

    40.     The falling poverty rate masks a high degree of vulnerability among many non-poor
households in Indonesia. Despite a relatively low official poverty rate, much of the population is clustered
near the poverty line. In 1999, 39 percent of households lived below the official near-poor line of 1.2 times
the poverty line. This fell to 23 percent by 2012. Despite this drop, about 55 million people lived below the
official near-poor line as of March 2012, at which point the line was set at IDR 298,400 per person per
month. More alarmingly, 94 million Indonesians lived below 1.5 times the poverty line (IDR 373,000 per
person per month). This bottom 40 percent of the population is highly vulnerable to small shocks, such as
food price increases, that can send these households into poverty. Consequently, Indonesia experiences a
high rate of churning in and out of poverty. Half of the poor in 2010 were not poor in 2009, with over 80
percent of them coming from the poorest 40 percent the year before. As such, many households have
experienced poverty: during the past three years a quarter of all Indonesians have been in poverty at least
once.7

    41.     Female-headed households, in particular, experience much more volatile poverty rates than
the male-headed households. Currently, the labor participation rate of women is substantially lower than
that of men (Female: 51.2%; Male: 76.3%, based on WB data), and there is a large gender wage gap with
women earning only about 70 percent of what men earn. While poverty rates for female-headed households
(FHH) and male-headed ones (MHH) experienced a similar reduction over the 2000s, the FHH poverty rate
was much more volatile than the MHH rate over the first half of the decade. This suggests that FHH interact
with labor markets differently to MHH, face different risks to income and consumption, or have differential
access to coping mechanisms and are less able to smooth consumption when shocks occur. The Maternal
Mortality Rate (MMR) is still high, and there is a risk that this key MDG target may not be reached (MMR
2015 target of 102 per 100,000 live births, vs. 220 in 2010, according to WB data). Data also suggests that
FHH tend to adopt the negative coping strategies through child labor. Despite tangible progress (e.g., gender
parity in enrollment rates at all levels of education), persistent gender disparities remain.

     42.    Inequality of household consumption has been increasing since 2000. The Gini coefficient
fell from 0.33 in 1997 to 0.30 in 2000 with the AFC having a more deleterious effect on the non-poor.8 The
Gini, however, has steadily increased since 2000, reaching 0.41 by 2012.9 This level is high by OECD
standards, and while around the lower middle income average, is high for the East Asian region and amongst
the fastest rising. This recent increase in equality is being driven by stronger consumption growth at the top
end of the distribution. After the equalizing effects of the AFC and recovery, the 90th percentile of household

  The calculation of extreme poverty in Indonesia for 2010, based on the PPP$1.25 measure is likely an overestimation due to
methodological challenges related to the survey data used to calculate the CPI. The data was predominantly based on Jakarta prices,
and some of the survey data was collected during a period of high inflation following an increase in the price of subsidized fuel in
the fourth quarter of 2009.
7
  Further analysis and discussion on the nature of poverty and vulnerability in Indonesia, and the effectiveness of social assistance
programs in addressing them, can be found in recent World Bank's major reports (2012), Targeting the Poor and Vulnerable in
Indonesia, and Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable in Indonesia.

                                                                 14
per capital consumption had fallen from 3.7 times the 10th percentile in 1996 to 3.1 in 2003, and 2.1 times
the 50th percentile to 1.9. However, since then, the trends have reversed, with the 90th-10th ratio increasing
to 4.7 by 2012, and the 90th-50th to 2.5. The relatively stable ratios for the 50th-25th and 50th-10th indicate that
it is the increasing consumption at the top end of the distribution relative to the rest, which is driving most of
the increase in the Gini coefficient, rather than the middle also pulling away from the bottom.

    43.     The relatively low consumption growth of Indonesia’s poorest 40 percent, and resulting
inequality, may begin to adversely affect social and political cohesion. Despite strong economic growth,
and official poverty approaching 10 percent, there is still a strong public perception that many more
Indonesians are not well-off, and that growth has not been shared by all (a perception supported by the data).
Moreover, around half of poor and vulnerable households do not receive major social assistance programs,
while half of benefits go to the non-poor. There is some evidence that these inequities in access to social
assistance have increased crime and decreased social capital.10

       D. The Political and Social Context

     44.    Over the course of 15 years of political and institutional reforms, Indonesia has made
remarkable progress towards the goal of becoming a vibrant multi-party and decentralized
democracy. However, at this particular juncture the country is moving towards an election year in 2014.
Next year will see the election of a new president by direct vote for only the third time in Indonesia’s reform
era, and this forthcoming changeover of power is creating tensions within the political system. For most of
the life of this second Yudhoyono administration, tensions within and between the three branches of
government—the legislative, judicial and executive branches—have been building. Nevertheless, there is
commitment by reformers within the Government to push forward on important reform agendas.

    45.     The political outlook is clouded by uncertainties over who might become the next president.
Adding to the uncertain political outlook is the limited choice of potential candidates for the post of
president in 2014 and uncertainties over the prospects for the continuation of market-oriented policymaking.
The current Jakarta governor has increasingly gained popularity, as a clean governance reformer with a
focus on improving public service delivery, especially to the poor. However, despite the relatively strong
political support for presidency, his formal candidacy has yet to be declared. Meanwhile, as election year
approaches, the political pressure for the government to take more populist policies is mounting. Resistance
for reduction in fuel subsidies, regulatory uncertainties in the extractive sectors (i.e., mining, oil, and gas),
and pressure to increase regional minimum wage rates are among the politically sensitive issues that the
government is currently confronting.

    46.     There has been a trend towards more interventionist policy making, many of them have
involved restrictive measures. In the past couple of years, economic policymaking has become more
driven by aspiration to increase domestic value addition through facilitating investments in agro-industry
and downstream processing of commodities and natural resources. Given Indonesia’s large pool of labor and
increased exposure to commodity and natural resources activities, such aspiration has a strong development
dimension. However, many of the policy instruments used to promote the aspiration may have caused
adverse results on trade and investment. The decision to restrict exports of minerals by the mining sector
together with the forcing of mining companies to invest in high-investment downstream processing in
Indonesia had the effect of stifling the mining sector—one of Indonesia’s most important drivers of
investment and earners of foreign exchange. Furthermore, interventionist policies in the agricultural sector,
especially restrictions on imports of beef and horticultural products, had served to stoke inflation and eroded
consumer purchasing power at a time when the economy was largely being driven by consumer spending.

                                                        15
     47.    As a result of the recent market downturn, the Government responded with a package of
measures to reassure market on the medium-term economic reform agenda. Given the potential costs
and consequences of not following a reformist path in policymaking, a silver-lining could be that the
reformer agenda has been strengthened in the short term by the recent macro volatility. In August 23rd, 2013
the government announced economic stabilization package containing measures intended to achieve the
following: (i) improve current account; (ii) safeguard purchasing power and facilitate growth; (iii) contain
inflationary pressure; and (iv) maintain investment flows. Some the reform measures involved retracting
interventionist policies on trade and proposal for improving certainty in business environment. However, it
remains to be seen whether the measures go far enough to achieve the required adjustment in the external
balances to alleviate financing pressures and provide confidence to financial market investors. Strong
political interests in policymaking as the election approaches may undermine confidence in the reform
process.


         III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM PROGRAM AND BANK SUPPORT

    48.    The INSTANSI DPL-2 continues to support the authorities’ reforms to enhance Indonesia’s
institutional capacity for reducing poverty and boosting shared-prosperity, but gives greater
prominence to the policy reforms related to social assistance and social security than the previous
DPL. Substantial policy breakthroughs under the poverty reduction pillar have enabled GoI to focus
INSTANSI DPL-2 on a robust set of social inclusion measures, and to allow more time for PFM related
reforms to show demonstrable progress. The INSTANSI DPL-2 focuses on a set of medium-term policy
measures underpinned by a wide-ranging program of longer-term reforms that the Government has been
implementing over the past decade. The World Bank has supported these reforms through a range of
programs, including the DPL program since its inception in 2004. Key elements of the Government’s
longer-term institutional and structural reform program are outlined below, while the proposed INSTANSI
DPL-2 program is described in Section V.

    A. Indonesia’s Overall Development Agenda

    49.     A series of five-year development plans have provided the framework for reinforcing
economic stability and initiating structural reforms. Within the first five years after the 1998 crisis, both
economic and political stability were largely in place. When President Yudhoyono came to power in late
2004, plans for macroeconomic and fiscal consolidation and a series of structural reforms to restore
confidence in the Indonesian economy were included into the National Long-Term Development Plan for
2005-2025. In its second term, the GoI adopted Indonesia’s Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN)
2010-2014, with responsibility for monitoring progress assigned to the newly established Presidential
Working Unit (UKP4). With the target of increasing economic growth to 7 percent and reducing the poverty
rate to 8-10 percent by 2014, the RPJMN highlights the need for growth with equity and a range of cross-
cutting policies to ensure that development is both sustainable and inclusive. The RPJMN places a special
emphasis on increasing investment in infrastructure and strengthening the poverty agenda. Further, it
commits the Government to a more equitable and inclusive development for, among others, women and
children. The Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection embodies this commitment.

    50.    A new Master Plan for Economic Development seeks to accelerate growth and increase
equity with a goal of becoming one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2025. In May 2011, the
GoI launched the Master Plan for “Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development
2011-2025” (MP3EI) based on three strategies: (i) fostering centers of growth in each major island group by
developing leading resource-based industrial clusters; (ii) building synergies between those centers of
growth, including international connectivity for trade and tourism; and (iii), complementing connectivity by
improving human resources capabilities and increasing investments in research and development. Under the
plan, business enterprises have a central role in economic development, particularly in generating

                                                     16
investments, creating employment opportunities and fostering innovation. The Government is responsible
for creating conducive macro-economic and regulatory conditions for the acceleration and expansion of
investments.

     51.    A draft Master Plan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Poverty Reduction (MP3KI)
that aims to eliminate absolute poverty by 2025 is being prepared by Bappenas. The plan identifies
three main strategies: (i) development of a comprehensive social protection system; (ii) improvement of
basic services for poor and vulnerable citizens; and (iii) development of sustainable livelihoods for poor and
vulnerable citizens. The social protection strategy consists of social security reform, continued expansion
and integration of social assistance, and the development of a short-term shock response system. The plan
also includes a target to reduce inequality – measured through the Gini – from 0.41 in 2012 down to 0.32 in
2025. While the strategies have a clear link to ongoing poverty reduction efforts, it is not clear how the
strategies and activities will contribute to the reduction of inequality.

    52.     The Government’s approach to economic policy is based on its four strategic objectives of
pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-poor and pro-green development. Equity remains a basic principle for
balancing economic growth and development amongst large cities and smaller cities and more isolated parts
of the country to deliver more even economic development in collaboration with the private sector and job
creation across the country. It also includes a focus on reaching Indonesia’s poorest. The Government
concentrates on 13 programs, which include education, health, poverty reduction, employment creation,
infrastructure development, food security, energy, good governance, electoral reform, anti-corruption
enforcement, inclusive and equitable development, climate change and environmental protection, and
cultural development. Collaboration with the private sector to complement Government’s efforts through
investments, job creation and innovation is prioritized. Reducing reliance on external finance and
maintaining a low debt-to-GDP ratio is also a key GoI priority. In some, but not all of these areas, the
Government has sought assistance from the World Bank Group.

    B. Key Reform Directions Supported by the DPL

     53.    The proposed INSTANSI DPL-2 continues to support the Government’s development
agenda, particularly in enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity, and strengthening PFM
for improved service delivery, as outlined in the RPJMN 2010-2014. The INSTANSI DPL-2 is expected
to be complemented by reform efforts pursued under the Second Connectivity DPL, which focuses more on
supporting reforms to reduce domestic logistics costs and strengthen inclusive development, as outlined in
the MP3EI. This section describes the key government reform achievements and directions under the two
pillars supported by the INSTANSI DPL-2.

    B.1. Poverty Reduction: Social Assistance and Social Security Reform

     54.    The GoI remains committed to accelerating the pace of poverty reduction. After assuming
office in 2010, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono adopted a pro-poor approach for his administration,
alongside pro-growth, pro-jobs and pro-growth strategies. As such, poverty reduction was identified as one
of the highest development priorities in the medium-term development plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka
Menengah, RPJM, 2010-2014). In the plan, the Government set a target to reach a poverty rate of 8-10
percent by 2014 through maintaining strong growth and job creation, and continuing implementation of the
national poverty reduction framework. This approach is based on four clusters of programs: (i) Cluster I
focuses on social assistance that targets individuals and households; (ii) Cluster II emphasizes interventions
at the community level, largely consisting of the national community-driven development program Program
Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Mandiri Perdesaan (PNPM-Mandiri); (iii) Cluster III seeks to support
enterprises and micro-entrepreneurs; and (iv) Cluster IV provides housing and electricity for the poor, and
improved livelihoods.


                                                     17
    55.     The strategy to reduce extreme poverty, poverty and vulnerability has largely relied on
Indonesia’s national social assistance programs. In 2007, the GoI launched Program Keluarga Harapan,
(PKH), a conditional cast transfer program designed to address inequalities in health and education services
and to provide a direct cash transfer for extremely poor households (i.e., households with per-capita
expenditure levels of approximately 0.8 times the BPS-defined poverty line) that meet demographic
eligibility requirements. Yet at the same time, these social assistance programs have not reached their
potential in contributing to efforts to accelerate poverty reduction. Despite Indonesia’s sustained and strong
economic growth, the rate of poverty reduction has been slowing. One of the likely contributing factors is
low spending on social assistance programs. Indonesia spends 0.5 percent of GDP (2010) on social
assistance, which is low in comparison with regional peers and middle-income developing countries. The
average for East Asian countries was 1 percent, while Latin American countries —where safety nets are
more comprehensive—spend, on average, 1.3 percent of GDP. Low coverage, inadequate benefit levels,
poor targeting outcomes, and a high degree of fragmentation across programs are all factors that undermine
the effective of social assistance in reducing poverty.

     56.   Social assistance programs, a key component of the national framework, have not reached
their potential in contributing to efforts to accelerate poverty reduction. Despite Indonesia’s sustained
and strong economic growth, the rate of poverty reduction has been slowing. The 0.5 of a percentage point
fall in poverty between 2011 and 2012 was the smallest decline in the past six years. About 29 million
Indonesians continued to live below the poverty line, as of 2012, which is set at IDR 248,000 per person per
month. About half of all poor households are chronically poor, or consistently measured as poor over three
consecutive years. One of the likely contributing factors is low spending on social assistance programs.

across programs are all factors that undermine the effective of social assistance in reducing poverty.

    57.     In order to boost the potential for social assistance programs, the oversight of national
poverty reduction programs was elevated to a cabinet-level national team led by the Vice-President.
The Government recognized that there was a need to reform programs across all clusters in order to improve
their performance in contributing to poverty reduction. Therefore, in 2010, the President decided to elevate
the overall policy planning and coordination of the national poverty programs to a newly created National
Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (Tim Nasional Percepatan Penanggulangan Kemiskinan, or
TNP2K). The Vice-President chairs TNP2K, which includes all government agencies responsible for the
planning, financing and implementation of poverty reduction programs, including the Ministry of National
Development Planning, the Ministry of National Education and Culture, and the Ministry of Social Affairs.
TNP2K is supported by a Secretariat, housed in the Office of the Vice-President, and responsible for
preparing reform policies and monitoring their implementation

    58.     The TNP2K Secretariat was tasked with the mission to improve and integrate poverty
reduction programs to enhance their performance in reducing poverty. This mandate was stated in the
decree that established the National Team and its Secretariat, as well as the RPJM and a series of
Instructions issued by the President during the beginning of his second term. The main reform aims of the
Secretariat were to: (i) reform existing social assistance programs that were identified as government
priorities, namely the conditional cash transfer program (Program Keluarga Harapan, PKH), financial
assistance for poor students (Bantuan untuk Siswa Miskin, BSM), the subsidized rice distribution program
(Beras Miskin, Raskin), and health service fee waivers for poor and near-poor households (Jaminan
Kesehatan Masyarakat, Jamkesmas); (ii) help ensure the transition of individual programs towards an
integrated social assistance system, through the establishment of a national targeting system that helps
improve and unify targeting methods; and (iii) continue efforts to improve and consolidate community-
driven development programs. A series of working groups was created under the TNP2K to commission

                                                     18
research, formulate reform policies, and support government agencies responsible for implementation of the
reforms. Among these working groups included one for Cluster I programs, another focusing on
Jamekesmas, another on targeting, and a Cluster II working group.

    59.     The DPL series has supported key reforms that aimed towards developing a more effective
and integrated system of poverty reduction programs. Analytical findings on the performance of social
assistance programs, generated both by the TNP2K Cluster I Working Group and the World Bank, helped to
develop a series of policy actions focusing on the improving the design and delivery of the priority social
assistance programs. At the same time, another series of actions supported the development of a national
registry of poor and vulnerable households to improve program targeting, the foundation of a national
targeting system. To prepare for the reform, the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) conducted a large-scale
assessment of 25 million households (PPLS11), or just over 40 percent of all Indonesian households during
July-August 2011. Households to be assessed were identified using a mix of census-based pre-listed
households, community referrals, and updating of existing lists. Proxy-means test (PMT) models were
developed to estimate household consumption and applied to the PPLS11 data as a basis for the registry of
about 25 million poor and vulnerable households. Other DPL actions focused on improvements of the
PNPM-Mandiri program based on the PNPM Roadmap.

    60.     One of the Government’s strategies to address widespread vulnerability is to e xpand social
assistance programs to also cover the near-poor. Social assistance programs such as Jamkesmas are
extended to both the poor and near-poor populations. Other programs, due to budget and capacity
constraints, only reached a share of poor households and few vulnerable households. The development of
the unified database, however, allows government programs to reach the bottom 40 percent of the
population, which are at most risk of falling into poverty. Social assistance reform strategies, therefore,
became a mechanism not only to address poverty eradication, but also to share prosperity with the
vulnerable households that fall just above the poverty line.

     61.    The second strategy to reduce vulnerability includes implementation of the universal social
security programs. In 2004, the Indonesian Parliament passed landmark legislation—the Sistem Jaminan
Sosial Nasional or the National Social Security Law (SJSN Law)—for the development of a national social
security system. The law stipulates the principles and goals of the national social security system, and
establishes a series of social insurance funds financed by employer, worker and government contributions,
including five programs – health, pension, old age savings, death benefit and worker accident – that cover
all Indonesian workers in both the formal and informal sectors. Moreover, the law stipulates that the
Government will subsidize program costs in the health program for the poor. In 2011, the Indonesian
Parliament approved the Social Security Administrator Law (BPJS Law) that establishes two nationwide
social insurance administrators. BPJS Health is responsible for administering the SJSN Health program and
is often referred to as the Indonesian universal health care program, while BPJS Employment is responsible
for administering the other four SJSN programs. The BPJS are responsible, among other duties, for
registering employers and workers, collecting and enforcing contribution payments, processing claims and
paying benefits, and investing social insurance fund assets.

    62.     As per the BPJS Law, by January 1 2014, the Government of Indonesia plans to merge all
existing social health insurance mechanisms into a single-payer system with common basic benefits
package. This will include the contributory schemes currently administered by PT Askes (Indonesia’s social
insurance program for the public sector) and PT Jamsostek (the private sector insurance program for the
formal sector), as well as the non-contributory schemes by 2014, including the non-contributory Jamkesmas
scheme which targets the poor and near-poor. All those currently not covered are expected to have social
health insurance coverage by 2019, to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). However, this goal may
prove challenging to meet. Although health insurance coverage has increased significantly in Indonesia over
the past decade and the Government has made progress in its plans to implement the BPJS Law, almost 60
percent of the population still remains without any coverage, and out-of pocket spending remains high even

                                                    19
among those with coverage. At present, household data estimates indicate that 22 percent of households
have coverage from the non-contributory Jamkesmas scheme; 8 percent of households are covered by
Askes; 7 percent are covered under Jamsostek; and 4 percent are covered by other forms of insurance
coverage; 59 percent of all Indonesian households did not have any form of coverage in 2010.

    63.     Improving the performance of Jamkesmas will be key to attaining universal health
coverage in Indonesia by the stated goal of 2019, yet several key challenges remain. On the positive
side, about 40 percent of poor and near-poor households are covered under the program, outpatient and
inpatient utilization rates have increased among program cardholders, levels of catastrophic payments have
declined, and there is generally a positive perception with regard to the program among those who are
enrolled. On the negative side, there is evidence of high levels of mis-targeting and leakages to the non-
poor, low levels of socialization and awareness of benefits, low utilization and relatively low quality of care,
regional inconsistencies in the availability of the basic benefits package, relatively shallow levels of
financial protection, and poor accountability and feedback mechanisms. Overall, the biggest challenges
relating to the implementation of UHC in Indonesia are those related to ensuring supply-side readiness and
the financial sustainability of the program. Further expansion of insurance coverage is expected to be
especially challenging since many of those currently not covered are in the informal sector. In addition,
ensuring access to quality health services remains an issue, especially in remote, rural areas of the country.

     64.    The Bank uses a number of instruments to support the Government’s efforts to reform the
design and delivery of social assistance and social security programs. Starting in 2010, a multi-donor
trust fund supported by AusAID was established to support the Government in making informed and
evidence-based decisions about poverty reduction policies and program design. The trust fund has also been
used to build the analytical capacity of local universities and think tanks for research and assessing poverty-
related issues. This Partnership for Knowledge-based Poverty Reduction (PKPR) uses a three-pronged
strategy in its engagement with the Government that focuses on: (i) providing poverty/vulnerability analytics
and building analytical capacity to inform poverty and social protection policies, programs and strategies;
(ii) supporting the Government in the design, implementation and evaluation of key poverty and social
protection programs; (iii) improving the quality and accessibility of data needed for poverty analysis and
policymaking; and (iv) supporting the Government with the implementation of the SJSN employment
programs (pension, old age savings, death benefit and work accident), including development of an
implementation roadmap, the design and financing strategy for each program, building government
computer modeling and risk management capability, assisting the Government with the development of a
strategy for contribution collection, and assisting the Government with consensus building and program
socialization. Since 2005, the Bank has also been using the DPL series to support government reforms
aimed at improving poverty reduction outcomes.

    65.     The Bank is also working with other development partners to support the Government’s
goal of universal health coverage (UHC). With support and direct inputs from the MoH, Indonesia’s
Jamkesmas program has been assessed in a cross-country standardized manner with regard to financing and
provision of health care coverage for the poor. The MoH’s National Institute of Health Research and
Development requested Bank support to analyze the first ever national health facility census (Risfaskes
2011), to optimize their utility for helping inform ongoing policy reforms in the country. Together the Bank
and the MoH are using the World Health Organization’s Supply Availability and Readiness Assessment
(SARA) toolkit to systematically and comprehensively assess district-level variations in the availability of
Jamkesmas benefit package across Indonesia. The proposed analysis will assess the scope of benefits
available for several tracer conditions that are currently or projected to be high burden in Indonesia. In
addition to assessing variations in the scope of key health services across the country, the analysis will also
assess the extent to which such variations might influence actuarial estimates of the costs of providing these
services based on data derived from Jamkesmas claims, as well as district-level utilization rates and key
population health indicators. The Bank is also working with the MoH to analyze human resources for health
availability, distribution and performance to meet UHC requirements. Building on its prior work on fiscal

                                                      20
space for health in Indonesia, the Bank will work with the Government to assess the fiscal implications of
UHC, by evaluating the different sources of financing that might potentially be available for increasing
government health spending to expand and improve coverage.

    66.    Meanwhile, the Bank continues to support the Government’s community-level poverty
reduction program, through the PNPM-Mandiri. The Bank retains the mandate from the GoI and
development partners to serve as trustee for the PNPM Support Facility (PSF), which consolidates and
coordinates grant support from the development partners to PNPM-Mandiri. Over the past four years,
PNPM-Mandiri continues to benefit the poor, and it receives consistent political support at all government
levels. The GoI and national parliament have initiated discussions on a plan for full national budget
financing for PNPM, a trend that has already been reflected in the decreasing portion of Bank loan support
during the past 3 years. The resolutions from the first PNPM National Congress in 2011 have been
formalized by TNP2K through the PNPM Roadmap, which presents two main directions of PNPM, i.e.
consolidation and integration of the overall program. The Roadmap comprises five pillars with 12 priority
agendas for ensuring the sustainability of PNPM-Mandiri. Lessons and key features from PNPM-Rural are
to be adopted into the new village law, which is currently being finalized by the parliament, following close
dialogue with the PNPM Oversight. Bappenas is now also finalizing the new Mater Plan for Poverty
Alleviation (MP3KI), which foresees the expanded use of the PNPM community-based platform to improve
livelihoods.

     B.2. Public Finance Management

    67.    Since issuing a White Paper in 2002, the Government continues to demonstrate strong,
persistent commitment towards building a modern PFM system. A new regulatory framework has been
established,11 and there have been improvements in the business processes and systems throughout the entire
budget cycle, including audit, legislative oversight and supportive civil service reforms, which have
addressed a multitude of risks related to capacity constraints, poor infrastructure, and weak governance. In
the medium to long term, it is expected that improvements in PFM systems will lead to better targeted and
more responsive allocations of public funds to priority development needs and more efficient, transparent
and accountable spending. This is fundamental to improving public service delivery and desired
development outcomes.

    68.    The breadth and depth of PFM reforms, which have been supported under the DPL series,
over a relatively short period, are commendable. Most notable are the introduction of performance-based
budgeting (PBB) and a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF); the strengthening of monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems; the development of an integrated budget and treasury system (SPAN); full
implementation of a Treasury Single Account (TSA); strengthening of cash and debt management functions;
development of accounting standards to provide for a ‘full accrual’ framework; an inventory and appraisal
of Government assets and the introduction of a state asset management information system; the introduction
of e-procurement systems and establishment of a new procurement agency (LKPP); and adoption of the
COSO control framework and strengthening of external audit.

    69.    Progress in PFM has been substantial over the DPL series and reforms are moving in the
right direction, but the impact is less pronounced this year and considerable challenges remain. The
Government’s commitment to PFM reform remains high, but the inter -institutional coordination challenges
and the technical complexity of some of the reforms (e.g., information systems and performance
management) have not enabled GoI to keep pace with the reforms in social security and social assistance.
Among others, the Central Government budget modernization reforms (MTEF and PBB) need to be
completed to improve the link between policies and budget allocations. The revised regulations and

11
  The most noteworthy laws issued include the State Finance Law No. 17/2003, the State Treasury Law No. 1/2004 the State Financial Audit Law
No. 15/2004 and the Procurement law (54/2010).

                                                                     21
procedures for budget execution need to be fully implemented to address the delays that are particularly
affecting infrastructure projects. Relevant and reliable financial reporting needs to be strengthened,
including at the subnational level. The COSO control framework needs to be fully implemented and the
internal audit function strengthened.

     70.   Improving the performance of the tax system also remains a key medium-term reform
objective. The GoI plans to increase tax revenue from its current low level of around 12 percent of GDP, to
around 15 percent (closer to the non-OECD regional average).12 This is well within the estimate of an
additional 2-5 percentage point of GDP that could be collected through better coverage and improved
compliance.13 Given that tax policy has already been simplified and rates are broadly in line with regional
comparators, this objective needs to be achieved through the next stage of tax administration reforms. The
first phase is focused on modernizing tax offices, improving governance, and strengthening the legal
framework and was largely completed by 2009. The Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) has restructured,
moving from a “tax type” to a functional organization with a field office network targeted to specific
taxpayer segments—i.e. large, medium, and small taxpayer offices. The DGT has also introduced new
corporate values, a code of conduct and a whistleblower system.

    71.     Strengthening the transparency and accountability of the subnational fiscal framework, by
ensuring the availability of subnational fiscal information, is another substantive reform objective.
With the ‘big-bang’ decentralization of 2001, Indonesia went from being one of the most centralized
countries in the world in administrative, fiscal and political terms, to one of the most decentralized; yet the
transition is far from complete. Overlapping responsibilities without a coordinated decentralization
framework undermine the effectiveness of service delivery, and there are limited accountability and
transparency mechanisms at the subnational government level. Ensuring the availability of subnational fiscal
information is a step towards ensuring accountability and transparency at the subnational level, which in
turn would help create a more coordinated decentralization framework. At the moment, subnational
governments constitute about 40 percent of all public expenditures, yet information on subnational fiscal
operation is still sparsely available. While the DG Fiscal Balance in the MoF has introduced the regional
financial information system (SIKD), progress in establishing a centralized database of fiscal information
has been uneven. Recent initiatives, such as stricter enforcement of sanctions for regions that do not submit
their budget data in a timely manner and establishment of electronic data transfer mechanisms, have helped
expedite progress towards establishment of the centralized database for subnational fiscal information.

    72.      Overall, public financial management reforms are technically complex and involve large
amounts of data, new procedures and ICT systems. The size of Indonesia, the scope of its central
government PFM systems (covering 29,000 spending units), the number of stakeholders, and the ambitious
nature of its reform agenda are particularly challenging and will continue to require significant expertise,
coordination and capacity building. Nonetheless, the Government has shown commitment to complete the
planned reforms, through annual and medium-term plans and strategies that present the proposed agenda and
phasing. The GoI’s strategy is also informed, and adjusted, by considerable analytic works that help to
prioritize the reforms.

    73.     The World Bank uses a number of instruments to support the Government’s PFM reform
agenda. The DPL helps to reinforce the Government’s ownership of and commitment towards the
achievement of reform milestones. Through the Government Financial Management and Revenue
Administration Project (GFMRAP), the Bank also provides support to design and implement the
aforementioned budget and treasury system (SPAN), which has involved a comprehensive reengineering of
business processes, institutional reform and change management. Implementation of SPAN is expected to
significantly improve the timeliness, reliability, integrity and transparency of budget spending and reporting

12
     The MoF has a more ambitious medium-term target of 18 percent of GDP for tax revenues.

when fully implemented in 2014. As a cross-cutting reform, it should also enhance the capability of
managers to more efficiently manage service delivery. The Public Financial Management-Multi Donor Trust
Fund (PFM-MDTF) provides additional resources to support critical reform activities and is financed by
development partners—the European Commission, the Governments of Canada, the Netherlands and
Switzerland, and USAID.

    C. Analytical Underpinnings

Poverty alleviation and service delivery

    74.    The World Bank provided analytical services to the Government to better understand the
challenges facing the poverty reduction and social protection programs in order to inform courses of
action for policy and program reforms. These analytical services included the following:

     75.    In 2012, the Bank released Protecting Poor and Vulnerable Households in Indonesia, a
comprehensive review of the performance and delivery of Indonesia’s eight main household social
assistance programs and a public expenditure review of the social assistance sector . The report
reviewed the national programs and found that they do not go far enough in protecting the bottom 40 percent
of the population that is at greatest risk of falling into poverty. In addition to significant gaps in both risk and
population coverage, all of the household-based programs have been limited in their effectiveness due to (a)
an insufficient ability to find and prioritize poor or vulnerable households; (b) a total benefit package that is
sometimes underfunded, sometimes inadequate for addressing the particular household need or risk, and
sometimes delivered with less-than-optimal timing; (c) a passive and implicit reliance on poorly-equipped
local implementation partners combined with little explicit financial or technical support; (d) weakly-
monitored and insufficiently-detailed implementation procedures; or in many cases a combination of all four
of these. The report finds that Indonesia spends 0.5 percent of GDP on social assistance, which is low in
comparison with regional neighbors and other middle-income developing countries. Increased fiscal space –
a result of starkly declining debt payments – has left room for further increase in social assistance spending.
However, regressive energy subsidies, which in some years cost as much as 4.5 percent of GDP, continue to
dwarf spending on social assistance programs.

    76.     The report outlines the main challenges related to coverage and adequacy that face
Indonesia’s priority social assistance programs. While cash transfer programs offer the right type of
benefit, the amount is often not enough for households to invest in education services. Neither scholarship
programs nor conditional cash transfers provide sufficient benefits for the needs of target households. For
example, secondary education expenditures (including placement fees, transportation, and uniforms among
others) can be as high as 20 percent of a poor household’s annual income, which puts it well beyond the
reach of beneficiary households even after transfers. The report found that the current range of household-
centered social assistance programs do not go far enough in protecting income and promoting healthy
behaviors in chronically poor households, nor do current programs protect all households that are highly
vulnerable to shocks. To cover all vulnerable households with some basic protection, the social safety net
needs a broader reach. The Bank recommended that social safety nets should target all chronically poor
households with greater assistance and be able to provide basic protection to the 40 percent of all households
that are most at risk of becoming poor in any given year. Beyond the permanent social assistance programs,
the report also recommended the use of quickly-deployable temporary programs to respond during future
crises or difficult policy reform. Unconditional cash transfers were identified as an effective temporary
safety net that was successful in easing policy reforms and providing beneficiaries with the right benefits to
help them cope with shocks. The program provided beneficiary households with cash amounts equal to
approximately 15 percent of regular expenditures. These transfers were more than enough to cover increased
expenditure on fuels.



                                                        23
     77.    In the same year, the Bank also released an analytical report on Targeting Poor and
Vulnerable Households in Indonesia. The research found that while the poorest households are most likely
to receive program benefits, many are excluded while many non-poor households participate. Less than half
of the poorest 40 percent of households received unconditional cash transfers ( Bantuan Langsung Tunai,
BLT) and health fee waivers for poor households (Jaminan Kesehatan Masyarakat, Jamkesmas), while
many non-poor also benefit from programs, with a quarter to a fifth of total benefits going to the richest 40
percent. While over 70 percent of the poorest 40 percent receive Raskin, high population coverage levels
are due to sharing the rice among many non-poor households, as well as the poor, resulting in a substantial
dilution in benefits to each household. Poor socialization and mistargeting have undermined support for
social assistance programs. The percent of communities experiencing protests over the programs ranged
from 25 percent for Askeskin (now Jamkesmas), to 56 percent for BLT, with those not receiving assistance
being the most likely to complain. Mistargeting, nepotism and a lack of transparency in, and poor
socialization of, beneficiary selection were the main sources of complaints. The nature of the community
protests suggests that improved targeting of programs would improve satisfaction and buy-in.

    78.     The report recommended the development of a National Targeting System (NTS), featuring
a beneficiary registry, which could improve targeting effectiveness and ensure program satisfaction and
acceptance. This has already been done in many other countries and has several benefits: (i) the registry can
be built using the best targeting methods, providing quality data for all programs, at a lower cost; (ii) social
assistance can be coordinated across programs; (iii) duplication, fraud and corruption can be reduced. The
unified registry is an important part of an NTS, but is only part of a broader system. It needs to reach the
right people by being used by all programs. It needs to stay current because of the fluid nature of poverty in
Indonesia, so updating the registry is vital. It also needs to be managed well to ensure effectiveness and
legitimacy. The report also documented the findings from field experiments, which demonstrate that
incorporating a well-designed and facilitated role for communities in targeting can increase both accuracy
and community satisfaction, as can self-targeting. An NTS is only a small part of the cost of social
assistance. Constructing the unified registry will cost about IDR 600 billion, which is just over 1 percent of
the combined annual program costs of BLT, Raskin and Jamkesmas.

    79.     In 2009, the Bank released Health Financing in Indonesia: A Reform Road Map, which was
part of the inputs prepared at the request of Bappenas to inform the development of the National
Development Plan 2010–14. Other inputs included reports on human resources for health, fiscal space for
health, health public expenditure review, and assessments of maternal health and pharmaceuticals. Health
Financing provided a road map for the reform effort, including an analytical assessment of the Indonesian
health system and its strengths and weaknesses. It assessed key policy parameters needing resolution and
plausible transition options based on the goals of maximizing health outcomes, financial protection, and
consumer responsiveness.

    80.    In 2011, the Bank released Actuarial Costing of Universal Health Insurance Coverage in
Indonesia: Options and Preliminary Results, which provided estimates of the likely spending needed
for a range of possible transition paths to achieving UHC. It illustrated the impact of key policy choices
on the costs of the program, and provided technical policy staff with both a methodological basis and a tool
for undertaking future estimates. The study highlighted the type of data adjustments that need to be made to
develop a sound actuarial model, as well as approaches for estimating the impacts of alternative policies.

    81.    In 2013, the Bank released The Nuts & Bolts of Jamkesmas: Indonesia’s Government-
Financed Health Coverage Program, a case study based a standardized World Bank protocol to
analyze the nuts and bolts of health insurance programs that have expanded coverage from the
bottom up. The study described and assessed Jamkesmas and provided a detailed description of the scope,
depth, and breadth of coverage provided under Jamkesmas, and highlighted ways in which the program
interacts with the rest of Indonesia’s health system. The study also summarized and discussed evidence on
whether Jamkesmas is attaining its stated objectives of removing financial barriers and improving access to

                                                      24
health care by the poor and near-poor, what could be improved, and what lessons can be learned from the
experience of Jamkesmas that could help inform Indonesia’s quest for universal coverage .

Public Financial Management

    82.    Indonesia’s proposed public finance reforms address the findings and recommendations of
recent assessments, including those of the World Bank. A repeat assessment of the Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) was conducted in 2011, following a first assessment in 2007. The
results showed that Indonesia has made steady progress in strengthening the quality of its PFM systems. The
figure below compares the average PEFA ratings for each of the six main characteristics of the budget cycle.
Substantive improvements were made in five of the six categories, namely: the comprehensiveness and
transparency of the budget, policy based budgeting, predictability and control in budget execution,
accounting, recording and reporting, and in external scrutiny and audit.


                                   Figure 5: Indonesia 2011 PEFA ratings




Note: The figure above shows the simple average of the PEFA ratings in each category, with a maximum rating of 4 for
an ‘A’ and 1 for a ‘D’ and half a point is given for a ‘+”.

     83.     The Bank’s 2012 DIPA Tracking Study - Identifying the Constraints to Budget Execution in
the Infrastructure Sector also identified challenges surrounding the issue of slow capital budget
disbursements. The survey tracked the implementation process of infrastructure projects and identifies the
causes of delay in spending (around 85 percent of the annual allocation was commonly disbursed) and year-
end back-loaded payments. The analysis pointed to a multitude of issues, such as lack of synchronization
between various regulations, inefficiencies in budget allocation decisions, delays in complying with
procurement regulations (e.g. most line ministries have not yet established procurement units), blocked
“marking” of budget implementation documents (Bintang) and cumbersome budget revisions and new
initiatives processes.

    84.    The IMF’s Tax Administration Reform and Fiscal Adjustment: The Case of Indonesia (2001-
07) found tangible results from the first phase of tax administration reform efforts . It was estimated
that administrative improvements accounted for over half of the 1.1 percentage points of GDP increase in
tax collection over the period 2002–06. Investment climate surveys conducted by the University of

                                                        25
Indonesia also revealed that the compliance costs for filing returns, obtaining VAT refunds, and customs
clearance have improved since 2005–07 (although this was not the case in the Doing Business surveys). The
Tax Office has also shown consistent improvement in the Corruption Perception Index score, measured by
Transparency International Indonesia (TII) every two years. In 2012, the TII’s Bribery Index, which
measures corrupt interaction with the public service, placed the national tax administration as the lowest
(best) among government institutions. Nonetheless, the IMF estimated that an additional 2-5 percentage
points of GDP could be collected “based on broadening the tax bases and increasing compliance” (IMF,
2011, Indonesia: Selected Issues) and Indonesia still ranks at 131 in the Doing Business survey component
of Paying Taxes (2013) due to cumbersome compliance requirements.

    85.    The Bank’s study on Sub-National Public Expenditure Review 2012 shows that decentralized
service delivery and finance has not resulted in major improvements in service outcomes . The weak
service delivery outcomes across all sectors can be explained to a large extent by inefficient subnational
government spending. First, sub-nationals spend too much on administration and not enough on service
provision. The latest subnational fiscal data show that local governments spend more than 25 percent of their
budgets on general administration (the international standard is around five percent). Second, sub-nationals
allocate too much to personnel across all sector budgets and not enough specifically to operations,
maintenance, and capital (spending on personnel now makes up over 40 percent of total expenditure
budgets). One of the policy recommendations suggested by the study is to move toward more performance
based inter-government transfer system. This would require a more formal monitoring and evaluation
system to assess the performance of local governments. One of the pre-requisites for better monitoring of
local government performance is the availability of social, economic and fiscal data from the sub national
governments. Timely, updated, and complete sub-national fiscal information is necessary to serve as a base
for a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation function.

    D. Other Related Reform Priorities and Areas of Development

Civil service/bureaucracy

     86.    Outside the main pillars of reform covered by the DPL, the World Bank also supports the
GoI’s reform efforts in civil service/bureaucracy, which is relevant to the success of this DPL series.
Strengthened poverty alleviation programs and PFM systems will not by themselves resolve the weaknesses
in the implementation of public policies, as delivery also depends on improving the institutional capacity
and capability of the public sector. Hence, in recognition of this, the Government placed Bureaucracy
Reform (BR) as the first priority of the RPJM 2010-14. The MoF has been at the forefront of such reforms
for some years. More generally, the President approved a Grand Design for Bureaucracy Reform 2010 -
2025 and Roadmap for Bureaucracy Reform 2010-2014 in late 2010 and the President’s Working Unit
(UKP4) and a BR Steering Committee, chaired by the Vice-President, are closely monitoring progress. By
2012, some 52 ministries and central agencies (K/Ls) are anticipated to be implementing BR, with the goal
of all 78 K/Ls implementing BR by 2014. The Government has also announced the first pilot of BR in
selected subnational governments before rolling it out to all 33 provincial and 491 city/district authorities. A
new M&E self-assessment system for BR was rolled out in 2012, namely the Bureaucracy Reform
Implementation Self-Assessment System (BRISA), an online system to help monitor BR progress and
achievements in BR agencies. The system under the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucracy Reform
(MenP AN-RB) also includes a public dashboard measuring the BR progress of all K/Ls. Further, the
Government started to recruit civil servants nationally this year after one-year moratorium (January -
December 2012), and a draft Civil Service Law (ASN) replacing Law No. 43/1999 on Civil Service
Ordinance, which would improve the current institutional arrangements and human resource management
for reform, is being discussed with the Parliament, with some expectations that the bill will be passed end of
this year. Just recently, the Government has also undertaken a review of organizational structures of selected
16 ministries and agencies, for the purpose of improving efficiency and effectiveness.


                                                      26
Procurement

    87.    In recent years the Government has also made significant progress on the regulatory side of
government procurement, which is a core element of the overall PFM reform agenda. Specific steps
include the creation in 2007 of LKPP, the national procurement policy and regulatory agency, enactment of
Presidential regulations Perpres 54/2010 and Perpres 70/2012, mandating establishment of dedicated
Procurement Service Units (ULPs) and use of e-procurement, and issuance in 2013 of updated standard
bidding documents for e-procurement. The priority now is to enable effective implementation of the
procurement regulations so that the goals of competition, economy, efficiency and transparency envisaged
for the new framework are actually achieved. This would entail several actions such as strengthening
oversight institutions and mechanisms to ensure that procurement regulations are followed at all levels of
government; developing capacity of staff working on procurement so that executing agencies can get the
most benefit out of procurement rules through a wide range of implementation options; introducing modern
procurement tools such as framework contracts/e-catalogues for enhancing efficiency and getting greater
value for money; and establishing a procurement performance monitoring system to enable collection and
analysis of actionable and reliable data to inform procurement policy-making as well as to monitor and
evaluate results. LKPP has initiated work on some of these areas which are currently at varying levels of
progress. Going forward, establishing a fully functional public procurement system will require the
Government to continuously assess the performance and outcomes of the system, obtaining feedback from
the stakeholders, and making the appropriate adjustments in policies and implementation tools for further
improvement.

Governance and Anti-Corruption

     88.     The Government has made progress towards combating corruption during the second term
(2010-2014) of the President. Evidence for this has been identified in performance review or evaluation
reports of state agencies/institutions, which were undertaken by KPK (Anti-Corruption Commission) and
BPK (Supreme Audit). For instance, KPK's Annual Integrity Survey highlighted that improvement in the
Integrity Index has substantially improved from 5.42 in 2010 to 6.37 in 2012. At the same time, BPK's
summary of annual audits during the 2010-2012 period mentioned that the majority of findings reflected
mis-administration. Moreover, as part of efforts to move forward with the National Anti-Corruption agenda,
the Heads of KPK, AGO and National Police agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2012,
outlining the strategic actions necessary for strengthening coordination, supervision, support to pre-
investigation and investigation, as well as the prosecution proceedings of high-profile corruption cases. To
address the human resources challenges within KPK, the President had also issued an instruction in October
2012 to KPK-AGO-National Police, to ensure the availability of investigators in KPK. Specifically, the
instruction postpones the withdrawal of AGO and the National Police investigators from KPK, and
facilitates KPK to start recruiting its own investigators for greater independence.


           IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROGRAM

    A. Links to the 2013-2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)

     89.   The proposed INSTANSI DPL-2 supports the broader goal of the 2013-15 CPS, which is to
enhance Indonesia’s domestic capacity for reducing poverty and boosting equitable and sustainable
prosperity. In particular, the CPS highlights the INSTANSI DPL series as a key World Bank Group
instrument for the following engagement areas: (i) pro-growth, by promoting prosperity through macro and
fiscal development and strengthening of the public sector; (ii) pro-poor, by protecting the vulnerable and
improving health outcomes through poverty targeting and rural health; and (iii) pro-jobs, by improving
social protection through more generalized social insurance. Overall, the INSTANSI DPL program is
expected to enhance the GoI’s ability to meet its financing needs and maintain critical public expenditures,
                                                    27
and use monitoring and evaluation to inform budget allocation. The proposed INSTANSI DPL is also
expected to enhance local capacity for detecting and responding to shocks that threaten vulnerable
households, increase the number of poverty programs using the national registry of poor and vulnerable
households, and increase participation of children from poor families in early childhood education and
development programs.

                          Figure 6: 2013-15 CPS alignement of engagement areas




    B. Relationship to Other Bank Operations

     90.    The Bank is supporting the GoI’s reform agenda using mutually supportive instruments.
While with the DPL series the Bank supports the GoI’s ownership and commitment towards the
achievement of reform milestones, with other technical assistance and financing instruments it supplements
that support through the necessary advisory, human and financial capacity to carry out the reforms.
Initiatives such as the GFMRAP, the Tax Administration Reform Project and the Public Financial
Management-Multi Donor Trust Fund (PFM-MDTF) directly reinforce changes to the underlying
institutional, incentive and organizational frameworks for core functions of the MoF and other related
institutions, including fiscal-policy formulation, budgeting, treasury, internal audit, procurement, revenue
dispute resolution and legislative oversight.

    91.     The DPL series support to the reform of government institutions and systems directly
contributes to the effective implementation of the other investment lending operations in the country.
The reform of PFM systems seeks to address some of the core issues faced in the delivery of key investment
in social sectors. Examples include the unpredictable release of funds and cumbersome budget adjustments.
The proposed INSTANSI DPL-2 will also complement efforts being undertaken through the Second
Connectivity DPL, by increasing the transparency and efficiency of the Government’s spending and
strengthening inter-governmental fiscal relations and reforms that foster accountability.

                                                    28
    C. Collaboration with Other Development Partners and the IMF

    92.     The proposed INSTANSI DPL-2 reflects a harmonized approach towards meeting the GoI
and development partners’ agenda.           GoI counterparts have appreciated the development partner
harmonization, which led to a notable reduction in the transaction cost of policy dialogue. Moreover,
development partner harmonization around the Government’s own program has bolstered country ownership
of the reform process and has helped change the nature of the relationship with these development partners
to one of a reliable partnership. Harmonization around the DPL has allowed development partners to build
upon the natural synergies and complementarities that exist across their respective portfolios. The DPL
program has also provided a solid foundation to deepen the harmonization agenda in Indonesia with other
development partners around this or other initiatives and programs.

    Total                      5,100            1,000                1,200              7,300


    93.    Other development partners were also engaged in policy dialogue on different areas of the
INSTANSI DPL series. Other development partners such as the European Commission and the Australian
Government have participated as observers during the joint consultation session with the GoI. This has
helped ensure that the various reforms supported through the policy dialogue of the DPL series complement
and are reinforced by other development partners’ programs. Underpinning the policy dialogue is advisory
technical assistance (TA) that the Government has drawn upon. Furthermore, there continue to be synergies
between the DPL and bilateral support provided by development partners through trust funds. For instance,
the PFM MDTF complements the DPL policy dialogue, supports some of the PFM-related institutional
reforms and closely complements the ongoing GFMRAP and Tax Administration Reform projects.

    94.     The IMF has also been closely involved with the overall operation. The IMF and the World
Bank in Indonesia continue to consult regularly on macro and sectoral issues, and the Bank coordinates
closely with the Fund in its missions, which help ensure that continued DPL support is warranted. In
addition, the Bank, the Fund and development partners have worked closely on the PFM agenda and the
DPL’s indicative triggers have been developed in close coordination. The DPL has thus provided a platform
to support and, where necessary, push the reform agenda in these crucial areas where both institutions are
working.




                                                       29
    D. Lessons Learned from the previous Development Policy Loan (DPL) Series

    95.     Important lessons have been learned over the course of the core DPL and IDPL series,
which are relevant for the INSTANSI DPL. These lessons stem from the nature and evolution of the
relationship between the Bank and the Government, and also from the characteristics of the DPL program as
a means of offering policy support, together with the changing policy environment on the ground. Some of
the lessons may be particular to the Indonesian case because of the broad scope and depth of the Bank’s
engagement with the Government, supported by a range of resources that include significant development
partner trust funds. As highlighted in the Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report for DPLs
(7-8), Indonesian DPLs benefit from a large field team presence that is actively engaged with the
Government through various other instruments in addition to the DPL. The socialization on both sides is
deep and the processing has become standard. As a result, although the task team leaders for the DPLs
change, the lessons learned from previous DPLs are seamlessly incorporated into future operations, and the
series has become more mature and efficient. The following lessons are particularly worth highlighting:

      Lesson 1: The application of a set of basic principles has contributed greatly to the successful
implementation of the Indonesian DPL series. Based on earlier experiences processing the DPL series,
the Bank team had outlined a few principles to guide them when selecting policy areas and prior actions.
First, there has to be a robust engagement and relationship with key high-ranking counterparts who were
“champions” of reform, had reasonably well-defined agendas, and the authority to advance their agenda,
thereby ensuring strong government ownership and execution of the reforms. Second, the GoI counterpart
has to see some value to adding some element of their reform agenda or work program into the DPL process
and would therefore make the time and reform commitment to participating in the process. Third, there also
had to be a champion on the WB side for including the reform in the DPL process, which incentivized staff
to engage in the DPL if it was in parallel support to their work program. These three basic principles ensured
that the prior actions would be actively monitored by both sides for completion in a timely way.

      Lesson 2: For a mature DPL series, a broad program scope limits the breadth of the reforms
that can be taken. Given the coordinating nature of the DPL program across the three distinct pillars, in
order to keep it operational, the number of implementing agencies engaged has to be kept limited. This in
turn affects the policy areas and actions that can be selected. Also, as the key value of the DPL process is in
elevating reforms—a broad DPL is kept manageable by limiting the number of reforms selected. Therefore
to deepen the reform agenda it makes sense to move to a sectoral DPL, which allows involving a broader set
of institutions and increase the number of reforms in the policy area. This approach maximizes synergies
across the Bank’s program in Indonesia, increases ownership of the related policy reforms by the relevant
institutions, and improves targeting of complementary technical assistance programs. A similar action was
done in the first DPL series, when the infrastructure component was spun out into its own DPL series. This
allowed the management of the DPL for PREM-related actions to be set in the core DPL and the
infrastructure-related items to rest with the SD team.

     Lesson 3: The splitting of the DPL series is a positive reflection that the value of the DPL
series extends beyond the financial disbursements. Although the new DPL series will provide a combined
financing similar to the core DPL series, the Government’s willingness to invest more of its time to process
three DPLs highlights the benefits gained from the DPL process. DPLs have provided a convening forum for
the various units within the Government, but also within the Bank, to discuss reform priorities, progress, and
cross-agency issues, e.g. M&E. Development partners, even with no financial involvement in the DPL, have
attended the DPL meetings as a useful means of gauging the priorities and issues in the Government’s
reform agenda.

     Lesson 4: The DPL series can serve as a useful incubator to test out new reform agendas and
counterparts. The DPL has served as a tool to test out reform agendas, like the connectivity, education and
finance agendas, to test whether or not a counterpart champion would be able to drive future reforms

                                                      30
through the DPL process. In these cases one or two prior actions (or sometimes just benchmarks) would be
selected, the new institutions socialized to the DPL process, and this experience helps guide future program
support.

     Lesson 5: A gradual approach should be taken when working with newly created institutions.
In the case of DPL-7, there was a great sense that the creation of the new task force TNP2K would help
energize the policy reforms areas of Pillar 3 and an ambitious reform agenda was envisioned. However,
there were complications in the relationship between TNP2K and Bappenas that contributed to a complex
environment for achievement of the prior actions. Moreover, it also served to distract from other poverty
reform areas that the Bank and Bappenas/TNP2K were working on, as more time was spent resolving DPL
issues. Therefore, although Pillar 3 was an established reform area, and both government counterparts had
committed champions, it would have been better to have gradually introduced the reform agenda to test out
the political dynamics of the two units.

    Other lessons are:

      Lesson 6: Strong government ownership and committed counterparts are vital, but just as
important is ownership over the pace of the reform process . As a growing middle-income country,
Indonesia can access domestic and international capital markets, thus offering it a range of financing
choices. While the Bank’s financing is attractive, the driving reason for the Government’s engagement with
the Bank through the DPL program is the utility of the instrument in bolstering, locking in and accelerating
critical reforms. To succeed, DPLs not only need the commitment of the Government at the highest level but
also that of mid-level officials responsible for implementing the reforms and following progress on a daily
basis.

     Lesson 7: Reflecting on the previous IDPL series, ongoing Bank collaboration with
counterparts and support from a high-level on policy dialogue are crucial for the success of DPL
operation. Such level of Government support also helps increase commitment from the mid-level officials
responsible for delivering the policy reforms. Finally, constant dialogue between the Government and the
Bank is fundamental and is best facilitated by a strong field presence across sectors that view policy
discussions as a natural part of ongoing support.

     Lesson 8: As in IDPL and other DPL operations, progress on institutional reforms need not
be linear and there should be sufficient flexibility for modifications and increased complexity as the
reform program evolves. Institutional reforms that involve changing the way the Government works,
especially in the face of entrenched interests and organizational cultures, are complicated, often
unpredictable undertakings for which there are no simple recipes. What is needed in this context is
commitment to reform, a continued sense of urgency, and preparedness so that when the right opportunity
presents itself, reforms that had otherwise been apparently slowed, may be advanced rapidly. This approach
can allow for progress through incremental reform.

     Lesson 9: DPLs are only one instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted
engagement, and the choice of instrument should be contingent on the issue, the political context and
the institutional circumstances. This is related to Principle 3 of the Good Practice Principles on
Conditionality but is particularly applicable in the Indonesian case because of the size and scope of the
World Bank program here. The Bank program in Indonesia is one of the largest of any country in terms of
number of staff and overall resources. Large teams are working closely on a daily basis with government
counterparts on a wide range of issues from public financial management and trade and investment, to
finance, public expenditures and poverty. In this context the DPL is not the only instrument for supporting

     Lesson 10: Policy-based operations provide an important instrument to convene policy
makers, policy implementers, donors and others stakeholders for ongoing dialogue on sector issues.
As highlighted in the previous IDPL operation, across the board, and particularly in the areas of PPP, the
water sector, and land acquisition, the convening power of the program was important to integrate related
programs and foster peer learning among unrelated activities. The land working group successfully brought
a complex land acquisition law to Parliament through an “action plan” developed by the inter-ministerial
working group (as part of IDPL). Cross-fertilization across sectors took place in the case of Output-Based
Aid (OBA). The water sector’s success demonstrated to the road sector how OBA could be applied to road
maintenance.

                                V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

    A. The Second INSTANSI Development Policy Loan

    96.     The proposed INSTANSI DPL-2 continues to support the Government’s development
agenda, particularly in enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity, and strengthening PFM
for improved service delivery. While Indonesia’s growth has allowed poverty reduction to continue, the
rate of reduction has slowed in recent years, and many non-poor households remain vulnerable to small
shocks. At the same time, significant improvements are still needed in PFM systems, in order for the
allocation of public funds to become better targeted and more responsive to priority development needs, and
more efficiently and transparently spent. Addressing these poverty and PFM issues are fundamental to
improving public service delivery and desired development outcomes. The INSTANSI DPL-2’s focus on its
two core areas is underpinned by the rationale that expanding poverty alleviation efforts is essential if
Indonesia is to bring about more broad-based improvements in welfare for the poor and near-poor, while the
social insurance program will provide a more stable basis for sharing prosperity. Strengthening PFM is also
essential for enhancing government effectiveness and governance, particularly in a relatively deconcentrated
fiscal and political environment, which is necessary to delivery better levels of public services and
infrastructure that are being demanded in an emerging middle-income country. The two pillars are therefore
complimentary. Progress achieved under the previous DPL series has been satisfactory overall, which
warrants the continued program support for the INSTANSI DPL-2.

    97.     The proposed prior actions are well aligned with the Government’s strategies and
priorities, as outlined in the RPJMN 2010-2014. The supported prior actions are well aligned with the
thrust of the Government’s RPJMN 2010-14. Changes were made to some the indicative triggers identified
in the first INSTANSI DPL last year, to better reflect the Government’s emerging reform agenda. In
particular, a set of new prior actions were introduced under the poverty pillar to support the significant
increase in social spending under the 2013 Budget, largely to help shield poor households from the impact
of higher fuel prices. These new prior actions build upon previous DPL actions that were aimed towards
developing a more comprehensive, integrated and well-targeted social support system. Hence, continuity of
the DPL program as a whole is largely maintained, as the proposed prior actions continue to advance those
reforms that were initiated in the previous DPLs. To date, all of these proposed prior actions have been
achieved.

                                           package for the fuel price increase in June 2013. This new prior action
                                           builds previous prior and benchmark actions towards the development

                                           package for the fuel price increase in June 2013. This new prior action
                                           is a continuation of previous prior and benchmark actions towards the
                                           development of the national registry of poor and vulnerable households
                                           (PPLS11). Given the dynamic movement of households in and out of
                                           poverty, updating mechanisms are required to maintain the accuracy of
                                           the targeting system. The Bank’s analytical work found that
                                           communities are more effective in identifying poorest households,
                                           which provided the basis for developing the community targeting
                                           updating mechanism promoted through this new prior action.
Not previously specified                   3. Issued the FY 2014 Financial Notes and Draft Budget, which

     98.    In addition to the prior actions, the INSTANSI DPL-2 also acknowledges a set of
benchmark actions. Although these benchmark actions do not represent requirements with regards to the
disbursement of the DPL financing, the GoI has requested that the INSTANSI DPL-2 still acknowledges
these benchmark actions during the DPL policy dialogue and program document. Indeed, the benchmark
actions represent reform steps that need to be taken before more substantive reforms can take place over the
longer run. The classification of prior and benchmark actions allows more prioritization and focus over more
critical prior actions, while still acknowledging the GoI’s broader reform process. Such classification
therefore helps ensure sustained GoI ownership and the mapping out of a comprehensive multi-year DPL
program.

    A.1. Policy Area I: Enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity efforts

     99. The proposed INSTANSI DPL-2 supports the GoI’s reforms that work towards developing
an effective and integrated social protection system. This emerging social protection system consists of
two main policy challenges: (i) reforming and integrating social assistance programs to both protect those
at risk of falling into poverty and promote them so that they are able to share the benefits of Indonesia’s

                                                            35
strong growth; and (ii) preparing for the implementation of universal social security programs—starting
with health insurance programs—that provide adequate protection from risks faced by all households, but
are financially and institutionally sustainable.

      100. The GoI has undertaken major reforms of long-term social assistance programs, financed by
a reallocation of budget savings from a reduction in fuel subsidies. The 2013 budget revision included a
reduction in fuel subsidies, increasing the price of subsidized fuel from IDR 4,500 to IDR 6,500, which was
a major policy reform that was years in the making. From the savings, Parliament allocated IDR 29.05
trillion (about USD 2.8bn), or about 74 percent of the total fuel subsidy savings, to a compensation package
that targeted 15.5 million poor and vulnerable households. Of this, 28 percent was re-allocated for the Social
Protection Acceleration and Expansion Program (Program Percepatan dan Perluasan Perlindungan Sosial,
P4S), a major expansion in the coverage and benefit levels of permanent social assistance programs. This
expansion, which will remain in effect until the end of the current government administration in December
2014, also provided an opportunity to introduce reforms to integrate and improve the targeting of individual
programs, taking a major step towards developing an integrated and comprehensive social assistance system.
Hence overall, public expenditures became more beneficial and targeted towards the poor, as the reduced
spending on poorly targeted subsidies allowed for increased spending on better targeted social protection
programs.

     101. The fuel subsidy compensation program includes short-term safety nets to protect poor and
vulnerable households from inflationary shocks. World Bank projections estimate that, in the absence of
compensation, an increase in the fuel price from IDR 4,500 to IDR 6,500 would temporarily halt any further
decrease in the poverty rate. These projections suggest that the forecasted poverty rate of 11.4 percent at the
end of 2013 would remain fixed at the same level for the first quarter of 2014 (assuming, conservatively,
that average inflation increases by 2.5 percentage points in 2013, moving to 8.0 percent year-on-year). This
would result in halting the positive trend in Indonesia’s poverty rate t hat has moved continually downward
over the past decade (with the exception an increase in the poverty rate in 2006 due to the global food price
crisis). To prevent this, Parliament allocated some of the fuel subsidy savings towards a Special
Compensation Program (Program Kompensasi Khusus) covering the 15.5 million households, or the poorest
25 percent of the population. Forty-seven percent of the total fuel subsidy compensation program was
reallocated to finance this temporary program.

    102. Meanwhile, the GoI is also committed to implement a new national social security system
over the next four years that will radically change the social protection landscape. Following the
National Social Security (SJSN) Law enacted in 2004, and the Administrators (BPJS) Law enacted in
November 2011, the GoI intends to enroll the entire Indonesian population in a public health insurance
system. The new social protection program will cover all Indonesians for five benefits, namely health,
pensions, old-age savings, death benefits and worker accident.

    Reform Aim: Expansion of targeted compensation measures for the poor following subsidized fuel
price increase

    103. The GoI has expanded targeted compensation for the poor following the increase in the
subsidized fuel price. Representing a major step towards integrating social assistance programs, the GoI
has issued integrated social protection cards (KPS) to fifteen million five hundred thousand (15,500,000)
poor and vulnerable beneficiary households identified through the Borrower’s national registry (PPLS11),
entitling them to subsidized rice allocations (RASKIN), temporary unconditional cash transfers (BLSM),
and financial assistance for poor students (BSM). With the launch of Program Kompensasi Khusus and P4S,
the Government is taking the opportunity to issue a Social Protection Card (Kartu Perlindungan Sosial, or
KPS) to the poorest 15.5 million households drawn from Unified Database of potential beneficiaries ( Basis
Data Terpadu, or BDT), which was created by the TNP2K Secretariat with the assistance of Central Bureau
of Statistics (BPS). The careful design of the database and incorporation of international best practices

                                                      36
means that many of the previously excluded poor households will now become program beneficiaries. The
KPS card is the basis for receiving the short-term safety net compensation programs until the end of 2013.
The card also entitles households to benefits for an expanded BSM under P4S until the end of 2014, when
the cards expire. Indeed, the use of a single card for multiple programs marks an important first step towards
an integrated social assistance framework in Indonesia. This will be the first time Indonesia has coordinated
social assistance programs and beneficiaries using a single registry, and paves the way in the future for
integrated delivery of benefits, as well as complaints and grievances.

    104. The Government is introducing innovations in community targeting to update social
protection card beneficiary lists in order to minimize inclusion and exclusion errors. The Ministry of
Home Affairs has issued an instruction for local governments to improve the targeting accuracy of the KPS
beneficiary list, through the use of a transparent and participatory community-based mechanism. The
Government will be coordinating with local communities to help identify poor households that are currently
excluded from the BDT database. Recent field research by the Government, the World Bank and the Abdul
Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL, from the Economics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology) has shown that carefully facilitated community involvement can improve targeting outcomes,
particularly amongst the poorest. These findings were based on controlled experiments, using trained
facilitators. Successful implementation of community targeting methods, however, will depend on designing
and delivering methods that can be scaled up and replicated in communities across the country. If
successful, not only will community targeting processes help identify additional poor households to receive
compensation, but it will also contribute to the planned 2014 update and expansion of the database, as these
households will be incorporated into the recertification process, which is required to keep the BDT updated
over time.

     105. The INSTANSI DPL-2 supports the GoI’s effort to help cushion the poor and vulnerable
from the immediate effects of the fuel price increase, by entitling them to receive temporary safety net
programs. To that end, the GoI has issued the FY 2014 Financial Notes and Draft Budget, which includes a
report on the 2013 budget allocation for the implementation of temporary safety net programs, which consist
of an unconditional cash transfer program and a subsidized rice program for fifteen million five hundred
thousand (15,500,000) poor and vulnerable households identified through the PPLS11 to compensate for the
fuel price increase of 2013, represents a key reform achievement. The Special Compensation Program
includes two temporary social assistance measures to protect poor and vulnerable households from the
inflationary shock of the fuel price increase. First, an unconditional cash transfer ( Bantuan Langsung
Sementara Masyarakat, BLSM) in the amount of IDR 150,000/household/month for a duration of four
months will be provided to 15.5 million households in two payments. Second, in addition to the 15kg of rice
per poor household per month that is already being distributed through the Raskin program, the Government
will provide an additional 45kg of subsidized rice to the same households that will receive BLSM. This will
be provided in 15kg bundles once a month for three months.

    106. Although the issuance of unconditional cash transfers is controversial, research shows that
they have been effective in providing protection to households that are vulnerable to shocks.
Unconditional cash transfers have been controversial in Indonesia. Therefore, the decision to re-launch such
transfers as part of the Special Compensation Program is a critical success in protecting vulnerable
households from potential negative impacts associated with the fuel subsidy reduction. Research on
Indonesia’s past experience with unconditional cash transfers supports this policy decision.14 Following the
increase of fuel prices in 2005, the Government launched the Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT), which
provided cash compensation totaling IDR 1,200,000, delivered in four installments, to a total of 19 million
recipient households. The program was again deployed in 2008 when fuel prices temporarily increased
further, and 18.4 million households were compensated with a total of IDR 900,000, divided into three
payments. Research conducted by the World Bank on the implementation and effectiveness of unconditional

cash transfers in Indonesia found that BLT was effective in preventing poor households from being
negatively affected. The transfers, equal to about 15 percent of monthly spending, were sufficient to keep
targeted households from falling further behind. Also, there was no evidence that beneficiary households
misspent the transfer; spending on tobacco and alcohol did not increase in BLT households relative to poor
households that did not receive the transfer. Similarly, there is no evidence that BLT induced laziness or
dependency. In fact, BLT households were more likely (by 10 percentage points) to report that they had
found new jobs and moved into employment, perhaps using the BLT money for transportation to more
distant but better jobs, or to assist with childcare.

    107. With the provision of temporary unconditional cash transfers, poverty reduction is
expected to continue. The provision of BLSM to poor and vulnerable households will help Indonesia
maintain advances in reducing poverty. With the provision of the unconditional cash transfer for a period of
four months, the Bank estimates that the poverty rate will fall to 9.5 percent by March 2014, instead of
stagnating at 11.4 percent in the cases of price increases but no BLSM compensation, a similar experience to
2008.

    108. Previous research found that the Financial Assistance for Poor Students (BSM) program
did not provide benefits to the right households at the right times. BSM is the third-largest household-
based transfer, by central government expenditure, behind Raskin and Jamkesmas, the Government’s in-
kind food transfer and health fee waiver (respectively). BSM spending has increased in line with the rapid
expansion in target beneficiaries. In 2010, IDR 3.6 trillion (around USD 397 million) was spent on the
program, equivalent to 4 percent of central government education expenditures. Previously, distribution of
assistance was carried out by school-based committees based on local quotas that were not aligned with
regional poverty rates. The resulting targeting performance was poor; a student from the richest 60 percent
of households was equally likely to receive assistance as a student from the bottom 40 percent of
households.

    109. During the past several years, the TNP2K Secretariat worked together with the Ministry of
Education and Culture to reform its scholarship programs. Reviews of the design and performance of
the scholarship programs have been used by the TNP2K Secretariat’s Cluster I Working Group to identify
actions for a program reform strategy. This strategy has been used as the basis for engaging with the
Ministry of Education and Culture and specific units responsible for the implementation of individual
scholarship programs. Several advances have been made in initiating reform actions, including a pilot to use
the national registry to target new entrants to junior-secondary school (SMP) who were excluded from the
BSM program in the past. Due to budget limitations, however, the pilot was restricted to targeting the
poorest 5-10 percent of households.

    110. Under the current reform, the Government has almost doubled the coverage of the BSM
program to now extend to over 16 million beneficiaries. The GoI issued a Presidential Decree (No.
37/2012) to provide budget allocation to increase the adequacy of benefit levels for the BSM program and
expand the coverage of the BSM program using the PPLS11 to identify beneficiaries of the BSM. Through
the reforms implemented through the Social Protection Acceleration and Expansion Program (P4S), the
coverage of BSM will almost double from 8.7 million to 16.6 million beneficiaries. The delivery mechanism
for this program has also been reformed so that beneficiaries can take an active role in receiving their
entitled benefits. Under the new system, students from eligible families can directly approach schools,
carrying their Social Protection Card and supporting documentation, to claim their entitled assistance. By
empowering beneficiaries in this way, it is expected that the expansion of BSM through the P4S program
will help to ensure that a greater share of assistance will reach students who are at the greatest risk of
dropping out.




                                                    38
    111. The reform will also improve the adequacy of BSM benefit levels so that poor and
vulnerable households will be able to afford to keep their children in school. In the past, assistance was
not adequate for poor families to keep their children in school for the mandatory levels of primary and
junior/senior secondary education. Typically, the benefit levels were equal to about 30 percent of education
out-of-pocket costs faced by families. Also, BSM amounts were not indexed to inflation; therefore
beneficiaries saw the value of the transfers erode over time. To correct this, the Government has
significantly increased benefit levels through the current reform: primary school (SD) benefits will increase
from IDR 360,000 to IDR 450,000 per year per student, while junior secondary (SMP) benefits will increase
from IDR 550,000 to IDR 750,000 per year per student. By expanding financial assistance for poor students
and increasing benefit levels, the subsidy savings can help to mitigate the problem of rising inequality in
Indonesia by improving the mobility of the next generation. Benefit level increases and advances in program
targeting address some of the main program challenges identified in the World Bank’s review of this social
assistance program.15

     112. The Government introduced the PKH program in 2007 to address inequalities in health
and education services and to provide a direct cash transfer for very poor households. Conditional
cash transfer programs provide cash disbursements to families that fulfill basic obligations related to
utilization of health and education services. The cash transfer contributes to immediate poverty alleviation
while the continuing commitments to preventative health care practices and education contribute to breaking
inter-generational poverty by increasing productive investments in children so that they have better
opportunities for the future.16 The Government launched Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), the
conditional cash transfer program, to improve household health and education outcomes. PKH accounts for
a large and growing share of Ministry of Social Affairs spending, but remains the second smallest of the
Cluster I programs, consuming less than 5 percent of the total budget for social safety nets in 2010.

    113. PKH is a social assistance program that has proven to be effective in tackling chronic and
extreme poverty. An impact evaluation of the program conducted by the World Bank in 2011 found that
beneficiaries were significantly more likely to use local health services and adopt healthy behaviors
including: pre-natal care, birth deliveries at health facilities, post-natal care, immunizations, and growth
monitoring check-ups for babies and infants.17 Program impact on improving school enrollment and time
spent in school, however, was statistically insignificant (with the exception of hours spent in school, which
only saw a 5 percent improvement over baseline values). As with BSM, given existing PKH implementation
issues identified in the World Bank’s review of Indonesia’s social assistance programs, the reforms that will
be carried out through the P4S program are also likely to increase the effectiveness of the PKH program.

     114. Under the current reform, the Government will increase the coverage of the PKH program
and improve integration with other social assistance programs. The GoI issued a Presidential Decree
(No. 37/2012) to provide budget allocation to increase the adequacy of benefit levels for the conditional cash
transfer (PKH) program and expand coverage of the PKH using the PPLS11 to identify beneficiaries of the
PKH. PKH will be expanded from the current level of 1.5 million households to 2.4 million households in
2013 and 3.2 million households in 2014. Beneficiary lists are extracted from the UDB by the TNP2K
Secretariat, and therefore will also include KPS cardholders. By receiving this card, PKH beneficiary
families will automatically have access to the BSM program, BLSM and Raskin allocations. This will be the
first time that individual programs in Indonesia are deployed as a system to provide comprehensive support

   These two objectives—reducing current poverty and improving the quality of human resources within poor households —are the
GoI’s stated goals for the PKH program. The GoI has identified four more -specific desired outcomes under these two objectives: (1)
improving the socio-economic conditions of the poorest households, (2) improving the educational level of children, (3) improving
the health and nutritional status of pregnant women, post-partum mothers, and children under 6 years, and (4) improving the access
to and quality of education and health services especially for the poorest households. PKH is expected to also contribute to progress
towards achievement of six of the eight MDGs.

to extremely and chronically poor households. Taken together, this assistance will allow them to better
afford to invest in health and education services, increasing the chance that their children can better help
themselves escape poverty.

     115. Under the P4S program, minimum benefit levels will substantially increase. Average benefit
levels will increase from IDR 1.4 million to IDR 1.8 million per year per household. Minimum benefit
levels will increase from IDR 600,000 to IDR 800,000 per year per family, and the maximum benefit level
will increase from IDR 2,200,000 to IDR 2,800,000 (the calculation is based on number of number and age
of children, and the inclusion of pregnant or lactating women in the family). The increase took effect
immediately in June 2013 for existing beneficiary households, while new beneficiary households added
through the expansion will receive the revised benefit levels in November 2013. It is likely that this increase
will help the program to improve its impact on beneficiary household behaviors. In the past, benefit levels
did not match the expenses faced by families in order to afford health and education services. For example,
benefit levels were sufficient to cover the total expenditures for one year of junior secondary education, but
less than half (43 percent) if transportation costs were included. Similarly, mid-wife delivery charges range
between IDR 200,000 – 800,000 (based on a 2008 SMERU study), which at the high end is equivalent to the
previous PKH transfer for pregnant mothers. Also, the benefit levels have not been adjusted for inflation,
which has eroded the real value of the cash transfers over time; this resulted in a 22 percent decline in the
real value of the benefit levels between 2007 and 2010 (adjusted using the poverty basket inflation).

    116. The reforms of the permanent social assistance programs are financed until the end of
2014, but the Government has indicated a vision to sustain the reforms in the future. These reforms
will be in effect for the duration of the current administration (i.e., until December 2014). Moreover, there
are indications that the reforms will be sustained in the medium-term future. The government’s draft
Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Poverty Reduction (MP3KI) prepared by the National
Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) outlines a social protection strategy that extends until 2025. The
plan includes an expansion of PKH to cover the poorest 5 percent of households, an expansion of
scholarships to cover all students from households included in the national registry, and increases in benefit
levels based on estimated needs. This improves the likelihood of sustaining the reforms introduced through
the fuel subsidy compensation programs.

    Reform Aim: Commence preparations for national social security health programs

     117. The Government is currently implementing a series of health system reforms aimed at
attaining Universal Health Coverage (UHC) for its population 2019. These reforms include a planned
merger of all existing contributory and non-contributory social health insurance schemes with streamlined
uniform benefits under a single-payer umbrella beginning in 2014, followed by a gradual expansion in
breadth of coverage to those currently uncovered. There are likely to be several challenges to effective
implementation of UHC in Indonesia, both from institutional health financing, as well as service delivery,
perspectives. The ambition to achieve universal health care coverage is indeed an ambitious and long-term
reform agenda, extending far beyond the DPL timeframe. From a health financing perspective, high levels
of out of pocket spending continue to be a problem for the sector, as this poses significant financial barriers
to accessing health care as well as a lack of financial protection for those who do utilize health care. High
out of pocket payments are a prominent “risk factor” for impoverishment, especially given that a large
proportion of Indonesia’s population is vulnerable and lives just above the poverty line. Although household
health insurance population coverage rates have increased in the past decade or so—from 15 percent in 1995
to more than 40 percent in 2010—almost 60 percent of the population still remains without any coverage
and, at 40 percent of total health spending, out of pocket spending remains high (even among those with
coverage; half of all out of pocket spending comes from those already covered). There are also considerable
institutional and organizational transformations required to merge all existing social health insurance
mechanisms into a single-payer system with common basic benefits package.


                                                      40
    118. Recent health system reforms included a number of key measures to help ensure efficient and
effective UHC scale-up starting in 2014. In 2013, the GoI issued Presidential Regulation to provide the
main regulatory framework for implementation of the national health insurance program. This marks a
significant regulatory milestone for UHC implementation, covering qualification and participation,
registration, contribution, health service organization, service provision and quality, payment administration,
complaint management, and dispute settlement. The Ministry of Health also signed a critical Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on the transformation of Jamkesmas, with PT Askes as the appointed future
administrator of BPJS Health. The MoU strengthens coordination and collaboration between the parties,
covering the transfer of management and administration of Jamkesmas to BPJS Health, for successful
implementation of this health insurance program for the poor and near-poor, by January 1 2014. The MoU
covers a multitude of Jamkesmas transformation processes, including updating membership, financing
outstanding claims, utilizing the independent verificator team, utilizing claim verification software, and
implementing the monitoring and reporting system. Ensuring the availability of medicines and medical
supplies in sufficient quality, quantity, type, efficacy, and safety in health care facilities is a particular UHC
implementation challenge. Based on PerPres No. 70/2012 on procurement of government goods and
services, the Ministry of Health together with the National Public Procurement Agency (Lembaga Kebijakan
Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah – LKPP) developed and began using a new online e-catalog for
medicines and medical supplies, to streamline and support central and sub-national procurement. The
Ministry of Health has also issued Guidelines for Socialization for UHC implementation, to help
policymakers inform citizens about key UHC aspects, including membership enrollment, premium, health
providers, benefits package, and organization and feedback. The near term will include additional
comprehensive and detailed reforms to implement universal health coverage.

    119. The Government’s commitment to UHC will marginally increase government expenditures.
Indonesia has a high level of fiscal space accessible through better use of tax, and reducing poor value
expenditures, particularly those related to subsidies. A comprehensive 2011 World Bank actuarial study of
Indonesia UHC estimated the likely spending needed for a range of possible scenarios, assuming gradual
expansion toward UHC to 2020, factoring in aging and epidemiological changes as well as advances in
medical technology and increased demand. In real terms, the ‘Low’ case scenario for UHC sees an increase
in annual expenditures to a total of IDR 65 trillion with 75 percent coverage in 2015 and IDR 127 trillion in
2020 with full UHC, representing 0.59 percent and 1.15 percent of projected 2014 government budget,
respectively. Under the ‘High’ scenario, total expenditures are estimated at IDR 82 trillion in 2015 and IDR
159 trillion in 2020, or 0.74 percent and 1.44 percent of projected 2014 government budget, respectively.
Indonesia is actually characterized by relatively low levels of total and government health spending per
capita (USD77 and USD38 per capita, respectively). In the broader global context, Indonesia’s public
spending on health at only around 0.9 percent of GDP in 2011 is one of the lowest levels in the world. By
contrast, Cambodia’s ratio is 2.1 percent, Malaysia’s 2.4 percent, Vietnam’s 2.6 percent, China’s 2.7
percent, and Thailand’s 2.9 percent. At least for now, the issues are not so much of fiscally feasibility and
sustainability, but those of under-financing. Regardless, UHC cost containment and efficiency
improvements are and should be key parts of the Government strategy to expand UHC.

    120. The SJSN employment programs are designed to have no impact on the APBN. The
contributions are fully paid by employers and workers and the Government is not obligated to pay for the
poor as they are in the health program. There are three conditions under which the SJSN employment
programs could have an impact on the budget: (i) the programs become underfunded and the budget must
contribute to make up for the deficit; (ii) the Government agrees at some point in time in the future to make
contributions for the poor and near poor as is done under the health program; and (iii) the Government
decides to start a tax-financed social pension as part of its program to avoid elderly poverty.

       Reform Aim: Empowering communities to take charge of their development needs

    121. The GoI is moving forward with implementation of the PNPM Roadmap and integrating the
approaches into regular planning and budgeting system. Finalized in 2012, the PNPM Roadmap covers
the strategic directions and action plan for the program up to 2014 and beyond. The Roadmap presents two
main directions of PNPM, i.e. consolidation and integration of all PNPM programs, and ensuring the
sustainability of PNPM-Mandiri through five pillars with 12 priority agendas. As PNPM-Mandiri will "exit"
in 2015, the PNPM Roadmap is critical in helping the Government ensure that all of the approaches used at
the central to local government levels and at the community levels, are sustainable and can continue up to
2014 and beyond. Among the most critical agendas are full adoption of key success characteristics and
results frameworks by all government stakeholders, mainstreaming the block grant model into regular
budget system, adoption of community participatory planning as a non-separate part of local regular
planning, stronger self-reliant community institutions, and continuation of technical assistance and facilitator
support.

       A.2. Pillar II: Strengthening Public Finance Management for improved service delivery

    122. The Government continues to modernize its PFM in order to improve the integrity,
accountability, transparency and performance of the budget, and improve public service delivery.
These efforts were guided by the 2002 White Paper that provided the overall framework for the subsequent
implementation of PFM reforms in Indonesia. They are part of a broader public sector reform agenda to
improve governance, enhance public service delivery and ultimately achieve sustained economic growth and
poverty alleviation. The initial reforms focused on consolidating the budget, improving expenditure controls
and strengthening oversight, particularly through financial audits. The Government has simultaneously been
developing a new Financial Management Information System called SPAN, aimed at improving the quality
of budget and treasury operations, while enabling more timely and robust budget reporting and oversight.

    123. In the past year the Government has achieved a number of milestones in PFM reforms
including:
     Completing the development and testing of the SPAN system;
     Further strengthening of the use of the MTEF in the budget preparation process;
     Initial steps to improve the systematic monitoring and evaluation of government expenditures as
        part of the annual budget cycle;
     New regulations to improve budget execution, including steps to streamline the approval of Budget
        adjustments during the year; and
     New regulations18 and a training plan to support the implementation of accrual accounting in 2015.

    124. The INSTANSI DPL-2 supports PFM measures designed to enhance the quality of public
spending and modernizing the core tax system. At the forefront of the agenda are measures to improve
budget transparency and planning through the use of the MTEF in preparing the budget. Reflecting progress
in improving expenditure controls, the Government is also placing increased emphasis on more efficient and
effective budget execution procedures to address constraints that are especially affecting infrastructure
spending. A particular focus is on modernizing the core tax system to reduce compliance costs faced by
taxpayers where a number of initiatives are supported by INSTANSI DPL 2.

       Reform Aim: Improve results orientation and medium-term focus in the budget process

     125. The 2003 State Finance Law mandated three pillars of budget reform: (i) a unified budget
to remove the previous distinction between development expenditure and routine expenditure, and allow for

18
     PMK 1/2013

                                                      42
prioritization across all kinds of expenditures in the budget; (ii) a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF), which aims at strengthening the capability to plan and prioritize expenditures for the medium
term; and (iii) performance-based budgeting (PBB), which would restructure the budget according to
programs and activities and introduce non-financial performance indicators, and allow for a results-based
evaluation and budget allocation.

    126. While the unified budget was implemented in the 2005 budget, PBB and the MTEF are still
in quite early stages of implementation. However, notable implementation milestones have already been
achieved. In particular, supported by previous DPLs, and following a joint circular from the MoF and
Bappenas in 2009, a revised program structure has been introduced by all line ministries and ministry-level
agencies. From the 2012 budget the work plans and budget submissions incorporate performance indicators
for all programs and activities.

     127. The MTEF also implies a fundamental change in the budget preparation process.
Regulations have been put in place to incorporate medium-term budget forecasts and the treatment of new
initiatives during the budget preparation process. The new initiative procedure was first introduced with the
preparation of indicative budget ceilings for 2012. As part of INSTANSI DPL 2 a further step has been
taken to enhance the credibility of the MTEF. To that end, the GoI, in the preparation of the 2014 budget,
clearly identified the fiscal changes that impacted the MTEF and facilitated the reconciliation with the prior
year forward estimates in the draft budget law. This is a major implementation milestone for MTEF reforms,
as it helps ensure that the MTEF information is publicized and used in all major aspects of the budget
preparation cycle. Ultimately, this will help ensure that the MTEF is integrated with the annual budget cycle,
rather than operating as a separate planning exercise. A further development will occur with the use of
SPAN to prepare the 2015 budget where the intention is to introduce new approaches that will make the
budget discussion and documents more strategic, around programs, rather than the current detailed
allocations for each spending unit.

    128. In an important move that supports the MTEF and PBB reforms the Government is
examining the way in which the costing of transactions and activities is regulated in both the
preparation and execution of the budget. The aim is to replace the existing framework of input focused
regulations and establish a control framework that provides increased flexibility for spending units while at
the same time encouraging economy in spending. The Government prepared a draft white paper for a new
and simplified costing methodology in 2012, and has implemented regulations establishing a new costing
methodology, which addresses the roles of the MoF and line ministries and a number of specific costing
procedures. It is intended that the costing framework will be further improved as progress is made in a
number of associated areas such as simplifying the performance management structure.

    Reform Aim: Strengthen the use of monitoring and evaluation in the planning and budgeting cycle

     129. The annual budget cycle is also being strengthened by gradually introducing new
procedures for performance monitoring, evaluation and management. The importance of reviewing
past expenditures as part of the annual budget cycle has been recognized by both Bappenas and MoF and a
number of developments have taken place. In 2012, the MoF introduced a new regulation (PMK 249/2011)
that requires line ministries to report on budget implementation performance across all programs. Reflecting
their joint responsibility for planning and budgeting it has now been agreed that the MoF and Bappenas will
build on this initiative by developing a performance review process that feeds into the setting of the
baseline. The new process brings together MoF regulation PMK 249 with separate work by Bappenas.

    130. In addition, a number of steps are being taken to develop processes for in-depth reviews of
the effectiveness and efficiency of spending. This spending review approach has two streams. First, the
use of detailed expenditure analysis to improve efficiency, which is led by the Directorate General of
Treasury and began with a general review of the 2012 budget. Second, targeted assessments of the

efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure, which is being piloted in the infrastructure sector
with a process led by Bappenas but involving the MoF and the executing agencies. The latter approach looks
to operationalize some of the findings from recent World Bank reviews of expenditure in the sector. These
efforts to strengthen the link between the review of budget expenditures and the planning for the subsequent
budget are critical, but challenging, and it is expected that they will take a number of years to be fully
developed.

       Reform Aim: More Efficient and Effective Financial Management

    131. One of the main objectives of the PFM reform is to unlock the bureaucratic bottlenecks
that impede implementation of infrastructure projects that are critical for rapid and sustainable
growth. While the DPL measures support more efficient and effective budget execution in general, the
need for streamlining procedures is especially acute for spending units and line ministries in implementing
public investment projects. The Government has taken steps to address delays in disbursement caused by
certain budget execution procedures, which were identified in a recent World Bank study.19 The SPAN
provides a critical foundation for streamlining procedures while retaining sufficient controls, as it will
facilitate the full budget cycle process from preparation, allotment, execution and M&E in one integrated
system.

    132. The issuance of a new Presidential Regulation (PP) to support enhanced budget execution,
as supported by the INSTANSI DPL 2, has addressed a number of obstacles to budget execution
alongside other measures. These include:

           Removing the requirement to appoint spending unit (Satker) officials annually: Although the multi-
            year appointment of officials was introduced in 2010, most Satker officials still assume that their
            appointment is only effective for one fiscal year and are reluctant to execute the budget for the new
            year until they receive a new appointment letter. This PP clarifies that the appointments of Satker
            personnel (proxy budget user/head of Satker; commitment maker; payment verifier; treasurer) are
            not limited to one fiscal year.
           Confirming the rule of advance (early) procurement before the fiscal year started: Although
            Presidential Regulation No. 53/2010 on Procurement permitted line ministries to start the
            procurement process prior to the beginning of a new fiscal year, many Satker are reluctant to apply
            this flexibility since it is not yet regulated by the MoF. This PP will give assurance to the Satker
            staff that they are allowed to conduct advance procurement and cover any related costs in processing
            a contract that will be signed the next fiscal year.
           Integrating the State Financial Information System (SPAN): This PP requires the MoF to organize
            an integrated State Financial Information System that will cover both the line ministries’
            information system for state finance, and the local government information system for local
            government finance.

    133. Beyond the new budget execution regulation a number of other steps have been taken to
improve the regulatory environment. In-year adjustment (virement) regulations are viewed by spending
agencies as overly complex and a major source of spending delays. The MoF introduced in FY 2013 a one-
stop service in which the budget management (allocation, allotment, and in-year virement) will be approved
by one unit (DG Budget). New regulations build on that change by streamlining the approval process within
the MoF. Additional steps are envisaged in coming years to devolve more authority to line ministries and
use SPAN to replace existing steps in the approval process.

    134. The MoF has also taken steps to eliminate the use of blocked budget lines (“bintang”) by
placing greater reliance on ex-post controls. Considerable delays often occurred during the budget year as

                                                                 44
spending units cleared blocks prior to executing expenditure. In future, the spending unit will be responsible
for ensuring that the necessary requirements for the expenditure are met —subject to audit oversight.

     135. The implementation of SPAN represents a major milestone in the PFM reform agenda. It
will enhance not only the controls over financial transactions but will also provide a basis to improve the
performance across the entire budget cycle from planning to reporting.           Despite some difficulties
encountered during the application development stage, SPAN made good progress in 2011 and 2012. During
the last year this involved:
      the completion of an Integration Test which tested all the developed (standard and customized)
         programs of individual modules; and
      a User Acceptance Test where the system is examined by the end users through use of a number of
         case scenarios to confirm that it is meeting the specified needs.

    136. The INSTANSI DPL-2 has supported the development of SPAN as reflected in the expected
roll-out of the core treasury solution to pilot locations in November 2013. Over the course of 2013, a
link between individual spending units and the SPAN application located in Treasury offices will be
developed, and the implementation of the budget preparation module is also expected to occur. These steps
will complete the SPAN system.

    137. In addition to the SPAN development, the MoF continues to integrate ICT services across
the ministry to enhance coordination and efficiency. The creation of the ICT shared services unit for the
MoF (Pusintek), and the gradual adoption of the ICT blueprint recommendations have been supported under
previous DPLs in order to promote greater integrity, security, interoperability and efficiency of the ICT
systems. Consistent with this the MoF has advanced ICT integration by establishing a single Data Center
(DC) and consolidating five existing DCs into a new facility in Jakarta. This consolidates DCs that were
previously run separately by DG Debt Management, DG Customs, DG Budget, DG Treasury and State
Revenue Module. Pusintek is also enhancing security awareness, focusing initially on SPAN. During 2013
a major achievement was made with the completion of a disaster recovery center (DRC) in Balikpapan.
This provides enhanced support for the MoF ICT users in case of a major incident.

    Reform Aim: Improve government accounting and audit functions

    138. A strong internal control system is essential if budgeted resources are to be used as
intended. Through the issuance of Government Regulation (PP60/2008), the Government has adopted the
international standard (COSO) as its internal control framework. The regulation and the Presidential
Instructions issued subsequently have also clarified the roles and responsibilities of various players in the
internal audit arena. The next critical step is to formulate an internal audit strategy and the development of a
code of ethics, audit standards and peer review guidelines. As mandated in the regulation, an association of
internal auditors has been established to perform these functions, and a draft code of ethics and audit
standards have been prepared.

    139. To implement the internal control system, a Control Self-Assessment (CSA) manual has been
prepared and socialized in line ministries and local governments. CSA is one of the key tools for carrying
out risk mapping in the line ministries. It is expected that all the line ministries will carry out a risk-
mapping exercise, identifying the major risks and how they can be mitigated. To date, the assessments have
been carried out in seven ministries.

    140. Indonesia continues to move towards accrual-based accounting. Financial reports prepared on
an accrual basis are more useful both from accountability and decision-making perspectives. The target is to
switch to full accrual accounting by 2015. The draft standards have been prepared and the Government has
issued new accrual based accounting policies and chart of accounts to support this important change.


                                                      45
Furthermore, the Government has issued a Minister of Finance Regulation on the procedures of depreciating
state assets to support the implementation of accrual accounting.

    Reform Aim: Improve sub-national fiscal management

    141. Comprehensive fiscal information is important for policymakers trying to decide and
monitor the quality of spending, especially with respect to service delivery. Subnational governments
constitute about 40 percent of all public expenditures in Indonesia. However, comprehensive information on
their fiscal operations is not yet available. Although the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance, the MoF has
been establishing a Regional Financial Information System (SIKD) since 2001, SIKD is still not
comprehensive in terms of the number of subnational government covered, the level of detail of fiscal
information presented, and the years published. The main reasons are insufficient compliance by subnational
governments in submitting timely budget information, and the absence of an electronic data transfer system,
which necessitates manual data entry of expenditure information by staff of DG Fiscal Balance.

     142. The MoF DG Fiscal Balance is taking steps to improve the availability of subnational fiscal
information. Starting in 2012, DG Fiscal Balance began to implement sanctions for the regions that did not
submit their budget information in a timely manner—particularly by delaying disbursement of the
unconditional transfer. DG Fiscal Balance also introduced an electronic data transfer platform called
KOMANDAN SIKD which will enable electronic data submission by subnational governments, although
this platform is still not fully operational. In conjunction with these reforms DG Fiscal Balance is manually
updating the publicly available data for the years leading up to the introduction of KOMANDAN. It is also
publishing a consultation document on the routine production and publication of detailed data in order to
reach agreement on procedures with data users.

    Reform Aim: Improve the organization structure and human resource management in DG Taxes

    143. Since 2000, the Directorate General of Tax (DGT) has taken a number of major steps to
transform the tax administration system. While significant progress has been made in terms of increased
numbers of taxpayers and compliance, the Directorate General of Tax (DGT) is still facing challenges in
optimizing the tax revenue performance and putting in place the right operating model. The recent
economic developments have provided a further reminder of the need for these reforms to support the
Government’s fiscal requirements.

    144. Ongoing constraints for DGT include ineffective systems and weak human resource
management. Modernizing human resource management, improving professionalism and staff integrity,
and strengthening governance are a priority. DGT currently has around 33,000 employees, but lacks staff in
key areas, such as tax audit and HR organization. The business rules need to be strengthened in a number of
areas to promote greater controls between tax functions and taxpayers. In addition, DGT will need to
undergo restructuring and is assessing various alternatives to the current organization structure. DGT will
focus on a few priority areas to reform, including developing the organization and procedures for
strengthening the data processing centers, procurement services and taxpayer call centers.

    145. Strengthening the performance management system is another of the priorities of DGT’s
reform agenda. A new performance management system is being developed to help focus auditors’ work
to more priority cases and monitor them, taking a more risked-based approach. To achieve the 2013 revenue
targets, the business rules need to be strengthened in a number of areas to promote greater controls between
tax functions and taxpayers. Each year, DGT will develop an annual audit strategy based on the revenue
target for every Regional Office to measure the quality of work and provide a reward mechanism for
auditors.

    Reform Aim: Modernize the core tax administration system by reducing compliance costs

                                                     46
    146. Alongside the internal reforms, a number of steps have been taken by DGT to modernize
the core tax system and reduce compliance costs. Major outreach programs and simplification efforts
have increased the number of registered taxpayers from a total of about 4.8 million in 2006 to more than 22
million by 2013. However, the increase in the number of registered taxpayers, who are mostly individuals
and small businesses, has not resulted in a significant increase in revenues, as substantial coverage gaps and
systemic administrative weaknesses remain.

    147. With the support of INSTANSI DPL-2 an electronic filing mechanism for individual
taxpayers has been established.20 The GoI has issued regulations (Minister of Finance Regulation No.
100/PMK.03/2013 and Director General of Tax Regulation No. PER-28/PJ/2013), to establish procedures
and an application for VAT refunds for tourists through a website (e-invoice).The main objective of the
online system is to provide individual taxpayers with legal certainty, and improved services. Taxpayers can
now access the application for registration and currently this mechanism has been used by about 278,000
taxpayers who submitted their returns for tax year 2012. In the near future, this number is expected to
increase significantly.

    148. INSTANSI DPL-2 has also supported the establishment of a VAT refund application for
tourists. Since 2010, DGT has run a VAT refund mechanism by establishing VAT refund counters at five
airports in Indonesia. With the objective of improving services to taxpayers, DGT has issued a regulation
(Director General of Tax Regulation No. PER-26/PJ/2013) to establish procedures of individual e-filing for
simple tax return and has issued a form for very simple tax return. The VAT refund application allows
registered retail stores to participate in the VAT refund mechanism.21 Foreign passport holders who have
been staying in Indonesia for less than 2 months and have purchased goods with value more than IDR
500,000 from participating retail stores are eligible to collect VAT refunds at the five international airports
across Indonesia.

       B. Participatory Processes and Consultations

     149. Democratic consolidation and decentralization of authority in Indonesia have translated
into a political preference for wide buy-in and participatory, consensus-building approaches to
decision-making, not only in terms of regulatory reforms but also planning and budgeting processes.
While this is believed to have slowed or blunted some reform measures, it is believed to mitigate against
radicalism, steadily improve public participation, and contribute to more democratic, accountable,
professional and responsive governance. This commitment has been formalized and endorsed through
several regulations (e.g. Law No. 25/2004 on National Development Planning and Joint Ministerial Decree
2006 and 2007 on Musrenbang), including those institutionalizing the creation of multi-stakeholder
consultation forums—Musrenbang (Musyawarah Rencana Pembangunan)—at all levels, concerning several
time frames. Musrenbang is the principal process for negotiating, reconciling and harmonizing differences
between the Government and non-government stakeholders, and reaching collective consensus on
development priorities, including regulatory reforms and budgets. While challenges still remain, the
instrument is being increasingly adopted at all government levels.

    150. Beyond the officially recognized participatory processes, various aspects of the reforms
supported by this operation have been subject to extensive specific stakeholders consultations. In the
public financial management and poverty alleviation areas a large number of seminars and workshops have
been undertaken during the past year among different government agencies, as well as between the
administration and other key relevant stakeholders, not only to discuss technical issues but also reach
agreement on policies and reform activities. During the preparation of INSTANSI DPL-2, a series of policy

                                                      47
discussions was held as part of the ongoing engagement with the core economic ministries, culminating in a
series of half-day meetings with key counterparts in each of the relevant areas or sub-areas. A roadmap of
milestones was then developed, which conforms to the Government’s own reform agenda, as laid out in the
DPL program matrix in Annex 2. This program matrix will continue to be adjusted and refined as progress
continues to be assessed and discussions mature.

     C. The Future Program

    151. The Government has recently indicated the possibility of extending the DPL series from
two to three years, thereby continuing the DPL operation in 2014. The Government is presenting its
financing needs and desired composition for 2014, consistent with its debt-management strategy that reflects
the macro volatility. The Government has indicated that it will possibly continue the INSTANSI DPL
engagement by extending the series until 2014, when the elections and change in government administration
are expected to take place. To that regard, a set of tentative policy actions for a possible subsequent
INSTANSI DPL operation have been tentatively identified and will continue to be developed in consultation
with the GoI. As demonstrated in the past, the ownership and commitment to these reforms are expected to
continue, despite the imminent change in in administration.

1.   The design and standard operating procedures are completed by the Secretariat of the National Secretariat for the
     Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) for the updating of the national registry of poor and vulnerable
     households (PPLS14).

2.   Issue a ministerial decree on implementing universal health care, including new capitation standard for primary
     care and case base group payment schedule for hospital reimbursement.

                      VI.     OPERATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

    A. Monitoring and Evaluation

    A.1. Monitoring

    152.  Monitoring the implementation and attainment of the DPL prior actions is done through
regular meetings between GoI and development partners, as well as the ongoing engagement with
agencies responsible for different prior actions. GoI has established monitoring committees and/or
technical groups that are responsible for ensuring the implementation of agreed prior actions, as
well as progress follow-up. In addition, the DPL benefits from regular joint development partner-
Government meetings to discuss interim progress in achieving agreed milestones in the reform
agenda (held in April, June and August 2013) and ongoing policy dialogue between the GoI and
World Bank teams. Table 6 below indicates the critical monitoring activities in each policy area.

Table 6 Critical monitoring activities

        Policy area                                           Monitoring activities
                                 Ongoing monitoring of the implementation of national poverty alleviation

alleviation                      Ongoing monitoring of poverty related activities in conjunction with
                            development partners as part of regular DPL program and analytic and advisory
                            activities
                                 Ongoing monitoring of progress on budget disbursements and
                            identification of key bottlenecks by Bank’s Jakarta team and GOI TEPPA
Strengthening public             Ongoing monitoring of the time profile of budget disbursement,
financial management        composition of public expenditures, and poverty and employment effects of
                            economic shocks as part of the regular DPL program and analytic and advisory
                            activities

    A.2. Evaluation

    153. A results framework has been prepared with a number of indicators to be assessed at the
end of the current DPL programmatic series. The Bank works closely with the Coordinating Ministry for
Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and other relevant agencies to monitor and assess reform
progress and impacts during the life of the program. In addition to ongoing monitoring of activities, the
Bank prepares an Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) at the end of each series. The ICR,
prepared in consultation with the Government and development partners, is a Bank self-evaluation reporting
tool that highlights the key achievements and results, as well as lessons learned.

    154. The ICR for all previous DPL series (DPLs 1-4, 5-6 and 7-8) show the significant progress
that the GoI has made in its reform efforts since 2004. They also highlight the role that the DPL has had
in supporting that progress, by ensuring the alignment of support provided by development partners with the
GoI’s own reform efforts, promoting synergies between program support and other Bank instruments,
focusing attention from both the Government and development partners on the most relevant reforms, as
well as empowering key reform oriented government officials to advance the implementation of necessary
reforms. Monitoring and evaluation will also be supported by budgetary, legislative and economic data
provided by the authorities and verified in official disclosures, directives and regulations. Baseline and


                                                     49
updated data will be provided by the respective specialized agencies and tracked according to the
Monitoring and Results Framework included in Annex 3.

    B. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects

    B.1. Poverty

    155. The INSTANSI DPL-2 policy actions have the potential to deliver positive outcomes on
poverty over the medium term. But by themselves, these actions are unlikely to have significant poverty
and social consequences or significant environmental effects. The policy actions aimed at enhancing
poverty reduction and strengthening service delivery should have positive effects over the short and medium
term. The National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) continues to address the
issues of fragmentation and lack of coordination, to improve the effectiveness of national poverty reduction
programs. Improvements in systems for better targeting of poverty alleviation programs and measurement of
poverty are also expected to support the poor by ensuring that these programs reach the appropriate
beneficiaries and by ensuring the availability of more reliable data and information—including those that are
sex-disaggregated—which are needed to make sound policy decisions. Household-based poverty reduction
programs are being strengthened, which will improve the coverage of health insurance for all families,
including the poor, and increase the number of scholarships for poor students at all education levels.
Together, these actions are expected to yield positive impacts to the poor and vulnerable social groups
throughout Indonesia.

    156. The strengthening of PFM systems more generally are expected to have significant, if
indirect, poverty and social benefits. Improvements in public financial management will improve the
capacity of the Government to provide public goods and services, which also benefit the poor. The
transparency and quality of public spending and the provision of public services will allow social programs
to have a greater impact on targeted populations. Through the subnational fiscal management and tax reform
actions, the Government plans to address the various gaps and introduce new systems and procedures that
facilitate better compliance, thereby contributing to increased revenue collections and generating additional
fiscal resources that can be used in economic development and poverty alleviation efforts. Overall public
savings through better fiscal management will allow the GoI to dedicate more resources to pro-poor
programs.

    B.2. Gender

    157. As equitable development is a major concern for the Government, the DPL also supports
institutional and policy reform aimed towards benefiting women in poor households. The medium-term
development plan (RPJMN) outlined the importance of increasing the role of women in development,
particularly women’s leadership in public sector, business community and social organizations. In
consultation with the Ministry of Women’s Empowerment, the Ministry of Finance has issued regulations
requiring that all K/L budgets are prepared using a ‘gender lens’. The regulation requires line ministries to
provide a gender budgeting statement in their proposed budget. This has been made compulsory for the line
ministries and government institutions at the same level of line ministries.

    158. Reform in the area of targeted social assistance will also benefit the poor and vulnerable
females. The National Targeting System (NTS) will be used to target poor households, especially vulnerable
households with certain practical and strategic gender needs such as households with pregnant women or
headed by women. The proposed NTS design and social service data collection survey (PPLS11) will
ensure that such programs can be properly targeted. Furthermore, the analytical research and field
experiments will consider the practical and strategic gender needs on targeting outcomes, such as the legal
status of female-headed households, and the gender impact of holding community meetings in the day or
evening. Hence, improving the effectiveness of targeting will directly benefit this constituency.

                                                     50
    B.3. Environmental

    159. The proposed operation is unlikely to have significant positive or negative effects on the
environment, forests and other natural resources. Policy area 1 actions on enhancing poverty alleviation
and shared prosperity by expanding targeted compensation measures for the poor, commencing preparations
for national social security programs and empowerment of communities through the PNPM Mandiri
program, should have no likely significant negative effects and probably only positive effects. All these
actions are designed to have positive social effects in enhancing poverty alleviation and shared prosperity.
Policy area 2 actions on strengthening public financial management for improved service delivery should
have no significant negative effects. Instead, improved budget transparency, forward planning and
monitoring and evaluation should improve effectiveness of spending on development programs to benefit
society. Improving tax administration should have no likely significant negative effects. Improving
capacity, modernizing, clarifying information and tax collection rules should increase tax compliance,
reduce leakage, and aid law enforcement efforts—all contributing to improving the rule of law and the
perception of fairness in tax payment.

    C. Fiduciary Aspects, Disbursement and Auditing

    160. Public financial management is a central policy area that is supported by the proposed
DPL operation. The Fiduciary Assessment for Indonesia has been carried out and the Fiduciary Risk is
rated as Moderate.

     161. In summary, significant strides have been made in recent years in the way Indonesia’s
public finances are managed and in increasing transparency and independent oversight. In the last
three years, progress has been made in the area of budget execution, with the development of a unified
budget and a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to strengthen the comprehensiveness and control over
spending and cash management. In addition, there have been improvements in the coverage of fiscal
accounts, accounting practices, payroll, internal controls and fiscal risk management. Notably, the 2009
audit report was the first to achieve a qualified audit opinion, as opposed to a disclaimer, with around 40
percent of ministries and agencies achieving unqualified audit opinions. Since then, the audit report has
continued to be qualified. However, the number of ministries and agencies receiving an unqualified opinion
has increased to over 70% for FY 2012. Improvements are required in several areas including refinement in
performance-based budgeting, strengthening internal and external audit, improving spending outturns.
Weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually addressed through the
Government’s PFM reform program. Also, key elements of the reforms are supported by the DPL series, as
well as the GFMRAP project and other initiatives supported by development partners. Furthermore, the
Government has also demonstrated increased focus on budget transparency by publishing the annual budget
in a timely manner, through the MoF website.

     162. The borrower is the Republic of Indonesia and this operation is a single-tranche IBRD loan
of USD 400 million. The loan will be made available upon loan effectiveness, provided that the Bank is
satisfied with the progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program and with the adequacy of
the Borrower’s macroeconomic policy framework. The Government has confirmed that Indonesia will
borrow this amount as a Variable Spread Loan (VSL) in US dollar currency with an annuity repayment
schedule linked to commitments.

    163. The loan disbursement will follow the standard Bank procedures for Development Policy
Lending. The loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account of the borrower at Bank
Indonesia that forms part of Indonesia’s official foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent rupiah amount
will immediately be transferred to the General Operational Treasury (SBUN) account of the borrower that is
used to finance budget expenditures, as the loan is intended to be used to support the general Government
budget. This arrangement has been followed for the previous DPLs. The borrower, within 30 days, will

provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer has been completed, and provide to the Bank
any other relevant information relating to these matters, including the exchange rate of the conversion from
US dollars to rupiah, that the Bank may reasonably request. Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to
any specific purchases and no procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the borrower is
required to comply with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be financed with Bank
loan proceeds, as defined in Schedule 1 to the loan agreement. If any portion of the loan is used to finance
ineligible expenditures as so defined in the loan agreement, the Bank has the right to require the
Government to promptly, upon notice from IBRD, refund the amount equal to such payment to the Bank.
Amounts refunded to the Bank will be cancelled from the loan.

     164. The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The
country is no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last
subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That
assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements
of Bank Indonesia. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment of an
independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the publication of Bank Indonesia’s audited financial
statements. Audited financial statements for Bank Indonesia for 2012 have been reviewed and the audit
report issued by the BPK contained an unqualified opinion.

    D. Risks

    165. Continued strong performance by the Government on its reform agenda and the
achievement of its medium-term objectives are subject to several risks. These can be broken down into
the following categories: macroeconomic, subsidy reform, implementation and coordination.

    166. Recently, Indonesia has seen increasing pressures on its external accounts, with the current
account deficit widening after a negative terms-of-trade shock and international financing conditions
becoming more uncertain. Recent shifts in market sentiment have resulted in sudden, large and potentially
disruptive reversals of capital inflows. The external accounts and growth outlook remain sensitive to
softening global commodity prices and demand, particularly from China. With portfolio investors focusing
on near-term policy responses, there is a risk that this diverts attention from longer-term reforms. However,
the GoI has adopted key policy measures aimed towards protecting the poor and improving quality of
expenditure, as supported by the ongoing DPL series, which are expected to help shield the risk of a crisis,
and mitigate the impact of any economic downturns on households. The Government has developed a track
record in precautionary and proactive measures to try to counter such shocks. This includes, for example,
policy measures supported under the PERISAI DPL, approved in May 2012, which, along with parallel
facilities from other development partners, also explicitly aims to mitigate GoI financing concerns in the
face of a crisis. The Government has also been quick to introduce a package aimed primarily at longer-term
structural measures to support exports and employment, moderate import growth, while limiting food price
pressures. This has been accompanied by a tightening in monetary policy. There remain questions over the
implementation of the policy package and it is likely that further policy adjustments will be required.
However, there is the potential that the current macro-economic pressures that Indonesia is facing could
allow policymakers the opportunity to make progress on medium-term structural reforms, although this must
be offset against the political pressures in the run-up to the 2014 elections.

    167. Weakening revenue growth as activity moderates, and high and volatile energy subsidy
costs, could significantly reduce fiscal space for other priority programs and undermine medium-term
plans. Fuel subsidy spending was projected to rise significantly in 2013, reflecting increased consumption,
imposing a substantial budget opportunity cost in terms of spending on key development priorities as well as
contributing to the current account deficit. Despite the political pressures from the elections in 2014, a
revised Budget incorporated a long-awaited increase in subsidized fuel prices (although the subsidy remains
significant), along with a comprehensive compensation package to reduce the impact of higher fuel prices

                                                     52
on the poor, was approved on June 17. The macroeconomic impact of the fuel subsidy reform package is
expected to be manageable and largely short term in nature, with a spike in inflation (although the recent
exchange rate depreciation may prolong the upward pressures on inflation). The proposed INSTANSI DPL-
2 will seek to build on these measures by promoting more medium-term budgeting, which should better
highlight some of the policy trade-offs of fuel subsidies, as well as strengthening the ability of compensatory
programs to protect the poor and vulnerable groups, while the broader social insurance programs start to
come into effect in 2014.

    168. PFM reforms that focus on enhancing expenditure controls and oversight will continue to
make budget spending difficult in the short term, potentially undermining support for the reforms.
Indonesia has made significant strides in PFM with increasing transparency, expenditure controls, and
independent oversight. However, this has exacerbated existing problems of budget execution, particularly
for capital spending, and increased the risk aversion of government officials, delaying much needed
spending. To mitigate this risk, the DPL seeks to balance further strengthening of expenditure controls, with
efforts to streamline procedures and improve the quality of spending as policymakers look for more rapid
results.

     169. The multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional capacities create a
challenge in coordinating and implementing reform efforts. Under the poverty pillar, the National Team
for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) has taken the lead in the overall policy planning and
coordination of social assistance programs; whereas the Ministry of Health is the main counterpart
responsible for the preparation and implementation of the new national social security system (SJSN).
Actions under the PFM pillar are undertaken by various Directorate Generals under the MoF. Nevertheless,
the reforms supported by the INSTANSI DPL are driven by priorities developed and articulated formally
through a platform of dialogue and consensus building within the Government, which the DPL helps to
provide. Hence, their implementation helps to further enhance coordination between various ministries and
agencies. The overall commitment to and ownership of reforms also remain strong, and the Coordinating
Ministry for Economic Affairs ensures consistent and effective cross-ministerial coordination. Although the
challenge will increase as the election period approaches and uncertainty over institutional roles in the next
administration increases, past experience has demonstrated continued GoI commitment to reforms,
regardless of election outcomes. The DPL program will continue to support the capacity of the various
institutions involved, for example with direct support for the development of the next administrati on’s
medium-term plan (RPJMN) and social insurance reforms (SJSN), which are complemented by other Bank
instruments, including investment projects, technical assistance and AAA.

A broader overview of Indonesia's environmental and social issues is updated annually for the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), which can be

                                                    OP 8.60 Assessment of Proposed Program Policy Matrix
             1. OP 8.60 (Development Policy Lending) mandates the Bank to determine whether policies supported by the operation are likely to have
        significant negative environmental and social effects. For policies with likely significant effects, the Bank summarizes analytic knowledge of these
        effects and of the borrower’s systems for reducing adverse effects and enhancing positive effects, also describing how any si gnificant gaps would be
        addressed before or during program implementation. In conducting this review, the team consulted Bank guidance on analysis of “likelihood of significant
        effects,” relying on the (i) Good Practice Note: Using Poverty and Social Impact Analysis to Support Development Policy Operations; (ii) Assessing the
        Environmental, Forest, and Other Natural Resource Aspects of Development Policy Lending – A World Bank Toolkit (2008), (iii) Good Practice Note on
        Environmental and Natural Resource Aspects of Development Policy Lending.

In Policy area 1: Enhancing poverty alleviation and health service delivery efforts by improving poverty measurements and targeting and improving household-
targeted poverty reduction programs should have no likely significant negative effects and probable only positive effects through improved targeting of pro poor
programs toward intended beneficiaries. The measures would improve spending and poverty alleviation and better health services. Improving monitoring and
grievance handling will improve accountability and responsiveness to intended beneficiaries of government pro poor programs.

In Policy area 2: Strengthening budget formulation and M&E systems should have no significant negative effects. Improved budget transparency, forward planning
and monitoring and evaluation should improve effectiveness of spending on development programs to benefit society. Strengthening budget execution systems
should have no likely significant negative effects. Improved budgeting systems, guidelines, auditing, software and training should improve effectiveness and
accountability of spending on development programs to benefit society and should enable better targeting of resources to the poor. Improving tax administration
should have no likely significant negative effects. Improving capacity, modernizing, clarifying information and tax collection rules should increase tax compliance,
reduce leakage, and aid law enforcement efforts – all contributing to improving the rule of law and the perception of fairness in tax payment.
