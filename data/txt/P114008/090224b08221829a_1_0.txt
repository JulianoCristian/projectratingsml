                         The World Bank LAC region in partnership with the Global Environmental Facility created the Regional Sustainable Transport and Air Quality Project (the STAQ Program), which
                         objective is to reduce the rate of growth of greenhouse emissions from this sector in the LAC region. The STAQ Program is structured into four projects: b) three Country Specific
                         Projects involving a core group of 11 cities in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and b) the Regional Project focused at Latin American level, which has been executed by the Clean Air
                         Institute, and which closed in June 2013 after a five-year implementation period. While the country project support sustainable transport interventions in eleven selected cities, the

                         regional project has been responsible for an overall integration of the STAQ program. The regional project has supported the development of methodologies to assess the
                         environmental co-benefits of transport intervention, provision of technical assistance and training, country projects monitoring and evaluation and, furthermore, policy dialogue and
                         other key activities at the Latin American and Caribbean level to mainstream climate change and air quality considerations into transport planning and implementation.

                         The STAQ Program was designed to support governments efforts to promote sustainable development; and demonstrate cost-effectiveness of different measures to reduce GHG
                         emissions associated with transport and to establish a network of local and national government stakeholders, international organizations and private sector entities to promote
                         policies and actions leading towards more energy efficient and cleaner urban transport systems in Latin American cities. Fund leverage is an integral part of the STAQ Program.

                         The Argentina Project was declared effective in August 2010, the original closing date was December 2012, a one-year extension of the Closing Date was granted to close in
                         December 2013, and a second extension was approved this year with the new closing date on the 31th October, 2014, in order to match the implementation window of partner
                         projects in Brazil and Mexico as well as to complete certain activities under the project.

                         During the last year the project has moved forward various initiatives in Tucuman, Posadas, Cordoba and Rosario; however, overall progress continues to be considered Moderately
                         Satisfactory due to delays in sub-project implementation.

                         In recent months, the Project Implementation Unit in collaboration with participating cities has advanced key project activities, including a detailed design for the Barrio 11 de Marzo
                         upgrade in Tucuman (pavement and drainage) and a final design for a BRT in the city of Posadas (Ave. Uruguay). Also, non-motorized transport activities are being developed: under
                         this component a first stage of construction of bikeways in Rosario (7.5. Km) and Cordoba (2.5 Km) has been completed, and it has recently launched a second stage for new
                         bikeways in both cities. Additionally, the project is financing campaigns for bicycle promotion in Rosario and Cordoba.

                         The regional GEF through the Clean Air Institute has designed a methodology to monitor emission reductions from non-motorized projects. It is expected that participating cities will
                         continue to track emission reductions even after grant closing date, using the methodologies agreed upon with the Clean Air Institute.
