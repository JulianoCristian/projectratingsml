The level two\n            restructuring of the Project seeks: (i) a one-year extension\n            of the closing date in order to match the implementation\n            window of partner projects - regional GEF STAQ, Brazil GEF\n            STAQ, and Mexico GEF STAQ as well as to complete certain\n            activities under the project; and (ii) an adjustment to the\n            project's results framework. Both changes will have no\n            impact in the project's development objectives,\n            activities and implementation arrangements. The Argentina\n            STAQ project (US$3.987 million) was prepared based on local\n            governments' submissions in 2005. Because of a two-year\n            effectiveness delay, the original assumptions regarding the\n            timing of GEF-financed and of co-financed activities proved\n            unrealistic. In addition, the time required for project\n            impacts to materialize is also longer than originally\n            anticipated because such impacts depend in part on\n            complementary investments that will be completed only\n            several years after the Grant is closed. Consequently,\n            planned outcomes have to be changed."}, "docdt": "2012-07-12T00:00:00Z"}
