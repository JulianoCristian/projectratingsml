                         The Argentina Project follows the higher level objectives of the Regional Program, and have a common focus in assisting participant cities in: (i) towards reducing GHG
                         emissions by increasing use of less energy intensive transport modes in cities; and (ii) inducing policy changes in favor of sustainable transport projects.

                         The World Bank LAC region in partnership with the Global Environmental Facility created the Regional Sustainable Transport and Air Quality Project (the STAQ Program), which
                         objective is to reduce the rate of growth of greenhouse emissions from this sector at a Latin American and Caribbean level. The STAQ Program is structured into four projects: b)
                         three Country Specific Projects involving a core group of 11 cities of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and b) the Regional Project focused at Latin American level, which is being
                         executed by the Clean Air Institute. While the country project support sustainable transport interventions in eleven selected cities, the regional project is responsible for an overall

                         integration of the STAQ program. The regional project supports development of methodologies to assess the environmental co-benefits of transport intervention, provision of technical
                         assistance and training, country projects monitoring and evaluation and, furthermore, policy dialogue and other key activities at the Latin American and Caribbean level to mainstream
                         climate change and air quality considerations into the transport planning and implementation.
                         The STAQ Program was designed to support governments efforts to promote sustainable development; and demonstrates cost-effectiveness of different measures to reduce GHG
                         emissions associated with transport and to establish a network of local and national government stakeholders, international organizations and private sector entities to promote
                         policies and actions leading towards more energy efficient and cleaner urban transport systems in Latin American cities. Fund leverage is an integral part of the STAQ Program.

                         The Argentina Project was declared effective in August 2010 and is expected to close in December 2013 (the original closing date was December 2012, but a one-year extension of
                         the Closing Date was granted in order to match the implementation window of partner projects as well as to complete certain activities under the project) . During 2011 and 2012 the
                         project has moved forward various initiatives in Tucuman, Posadas, Cordoba and Rosario, and progress continues to be considered Moderately Unsatisfactory due to delays in sub-
                         project implementation.
