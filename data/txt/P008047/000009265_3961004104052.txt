PRIVATIUATION ADJUT1TN T LOADN
LO0AN ANQD PROGA  YUfMR
Bonrwer:            Republic of Peru
lEeuindog Agency:   Commission for Promotion of Private Investment (COPRI)
Amount:             US$250 million equivalent
Terms:              Repayment in 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at the
Bank's standard variable rate
Loan Objectves:    The proposed loan would support the privatization program and related
sectoral policy, legal and regulatory reforms being implemented by the
Government of Peru. lhe program is designed to promote competition and
private investment and improve economic efficiency and fiscal performance.
Loan Description:   The reform program to be supported by the proposed loan would include three
components: (a) maintaining a satsfactory macroeconomic program and
financing plan; (b) implementng policy, legal and regulatory reforms in key
sectors to promote competition and private investment and to facilitate
privatization; and (c) implementing the Government's privatzation progm,
focussing on mining, hydrocarbons and telecommunications, and selected
holdings in fisheries, industry, air/urban transport and the water sector.
Benefits:           Privatization and related sectoral reforms are expected to have major benefits:
(a) improved fiscal performance through elimination of the recurring fiscal
burden of state enterprises; (b) restored prvate sector confidence in the
eonomy and in the Government's commitment and ability to reduce the
public sector and implement the refrm program; (c) increased private
investment, thereby speeding up economic recovery and alleviating Peru's
unemployment/underemployment problem; and (d) increased economic
efficiency due to the implementation of sectoral policy/regulatory reforms
together with privadzation.
Rs":                There are two main risks. One risk is that domestic pressures will result in
some backsliding or deviations in the Governes macroeconomic and
structral reform program, thereby undermining economic recovery. In this
regard, the Government has maintained sound macroeconomic policies and
performance since taking office in August 1990, and has adopted a satisfactory
macroeconomic program and externa financing plan for 1993-95, to be
supported by this operation and an IMB   Extended Fund Facility. Maintenne
of a sadsfactory macroeconomic program and external financing plan is a
condition of effectiveness, second and thid tranche release for this operation.
A second risk is that privatization will get delayed as a result of domestic
political opposition or foreign investor reluctamce to invest in Peru at this
time, given the fragility of the political and economic situation. Ihis risk has
diminished markedly over the last year with the init  success of the



i
privatizatlon program and tie opening of the eoonomy. Ihe recent
congressional and municipal elecdions are also expected to increase investor
confidence in Peru. The Govenment has also launched a public lnformation
program within Peru to stregh  public support and understanding of the
privatzaton program. It i also fincing a number of community proje
fhom the proceeds of privatiaon. MIis will help alleviate poverty, while
buflding support for privatzato  Finally, the Government is also developing
promotDonal campags for Investors abroad to explain the Govement's
program and privaiaton/investmen opporuities In Peru. The
informaional and promotional progrms are being finaced, in part, by the
Privadtzaion Technical Assistance Loan
F_mted
Disbus     t:      The loan wil be disbursed in three tranches of $75 million, $75 milion, and
$100 million, upon fulfillment of conditions of effectivens, second and third

REPORT AND RJIEATION OF T
OF TEE DMD TO THE EXCtTI lllnln
ON A PROPOSID PRIATMZATION ADUW LOAN
O TE RlUIBL!UOF PERU
1.           I submit the following report and recommendaton on a proposed loan to the Republic
of Peru for the eqvalent of US$250 million. The proposed loan would support the pri don
program ad related sectoral policy, legal and regulatory reforms being implemented by the
Government of Peru. The loan would be repayable over 20 years on a Sxed amortizaon schedule,
including five years grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rat.

2.           Peru is the world's second largest silver producer, ffth largest copper producer, and
has abundant fishing and hydrocarbon resources. Despite these considerable endowmen, Peru Is one
of Latin America's poorest countries 'with per capita income of $1020) and deeply tor by social
conflict. Income distribution traditionally has been one of the most unequal, infnt mortality among
the highest, and life expectancy among the lowest in the reion.
3.           Peru's recent history has been marked by political and economic Instability. A 12-
year period of military rule ended in 1980, when Fernando Belaunde Terry reuned to the
Presidency. His Government engaged in expansiona  fisca and monetary policies, which caused
inflation to double to over 100 percent in 1983. Duing 1984 and early 1985, efforts to stablize the
economy brought about a significant reduction in the fiscal deficit and reversed the dteroation In
Peru's competitiveness that had occurred over the preceding five years. However, economic activity
remained depressed and inflation accelerated.
4.           In 1985, Alan Garcia, of the nationalist APRA party, was elected Preident on a
populist economic platform. His Government followed expansionary fiscl policies and IsdUted
widespread foreign-exchange controls with multiple exchange rates which we subject to firequent
change. It increased minimum wages, expanded directed credit and subsidies, reduced the rate of
value-added tax, and decreased public sector prices. The program  ally appeared to work, and the
economy grew rapidly for a couple of years. But these policies increaed the fisc  defict, fueled
inflation and misatlocated resources.
S.           The consequences of eaonomic mismanement reached a climax In 1989-90. in
July 1990, inflaion reached an annualized rat close to 36,000 percent Tax revenues dropped to less
than 6 percent of GDP from 14 percent in 1985. Per capita income ha ddlined to the levels of 30
years earlier. In Lima, seventy-five percent of the labor force was either unemployed or
underemployed, and real wages declined by 60 percent between 1985 and 1990.

6.           Peru's relations with the international financial community contned to deteriorate
through the 1980s. In 1983, Peru adopted a best-effort-to-pay practice on Its foreign debt (then $12.4
billion) and its foreign arrears grew rapidly. Then, in July 1985, the Garcia Government announced
that total foreign debt paymets would be capped at 10 percent of exports. Not until 1988, however,
did actual debt service fall to the 10 percent level. Initially only payments from public creditors to
private foreign banks were suspended, but in 1987 Peru extended the moratorium to the intenational
financial institutions IFIs) and also banned external debt-service payments by private debtors. In
August 1986, Peru was declared ineligible for IMF lending and was placed on "non-accrual status by
the Bank one year later. In early 1989, the EDB also took this last step. Peru was finacialy cut off
from the rest of the world. By end-1990, Peru's external debt was almost $22 billion, with about 40
percent owed to Paris Club members, 37 percent to private creditors, 12 percent to IFk;, and 10
percent to other official bilateral creditors. Almost two-thirds of this was in arrears; arrears to the
three IFIs alone totalled $2.2 billion.
B. Recent Developments
7.           Stabilization and Structural Reform. Following presidential elections in July 1990,
the new Government inder Alberto Fujimori introduced fimdamental changes in the economy. Tbe
extent of the crisis led the Govermnent to adopt a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization and
strucural reform program. The ptincipal short-term objective of the program was to halt
hyperinflation and lower the rate of inflation to acceptable levels. she longer-tem objective was to
wansform a statist interventionist economy into a market-oriented economy. Th'. reform progm
radically departs from the ad hoc nature of past policy responses to macroeconomic imbaanc  and
stctura wealnesses of the economy.
8.           The stabilization component Iacluded not only stringent short-term fiscal and
monetary measures, but also reforms in the areas of taxation, public expenditu.es, interest rates, and
exchange rate policy. To cope with hyperinfltion and the fiscal crisis that lay at its root, the
Government adopted a tight monetary policy, full convertibility for the domestic currency, and a cash
management system for the budget. Tight controls were instituted on public sector wages, some
temporary taxes were uoduced, most tax concessions and price- and interest-rate controls were
removed, and public-utiity prices were increased substantially. Tax aminon was reorganized
and strengthened.
9.           The structual reform package included liberalization measures on boti an economy-
wide and sectoral basis. Reform has gone furthest in trade policy, and Peru's regime is now among
the freest in Latin America. Non-tariff barriers and exemptions from import tariffs were elimnted,
and Peru's complex tariff rate structure was simplified to a two-rate system of 15% and 25% of c.i.f.
prices. The Customs administration has also been reformed. Monopoly rights of public firms have
been abolished. Reforms have also been introduced to remove distortions in capital and labor
markets. Considerable flexibility has been introduced into Peru's labor laws. A new banking law has
streugthened prudential regulations, promoted universal type banking, and opened commercial
bankig to foreign investment. The four development banks are In the process of liquidation and the
Government Is withdrawing completely from commercW banlkng. Private pension funds have been
made legal. Insurace has been partily deregulad by freeing premiums and abolishing some
government monopolies. Foreign investment policies have been liberalized. And, after a slow start,
the Government is now implemendng a sweeping program of privatization.

developing a new lea and regulatory amework for the sec  to  sr wewr quty and foster
private sector participation. In ho     the Governent Is widrawing fm direc prvion of

12.         In enev and Idutry, the refoms have been aimd at liberalizing the policy and
rewaory environamet to promote com iion ad pat Iv         nt, while substantally reducing
and redefining dte role of the state. In mIin, the Govment enacted a new law faciitating priae

and removed the 10 percet expor t   In           , the Governmt deinated Petroperu!s

the dispersed demand from poor communities for improvem  in social and physical Infrastructure
and for tompt.a  employment oppornities.
14.         IntemnatIonal Support for the Program. Ihe Bank, in close collaboration with the
IMF, the IDB and bilatera donors, has supported these reforms. In May 1991, the Bank adopted a
new debt werkout approach for counries with protracted arrears; in July 1991, the Bank approved the
application of the new approach to Peru. Under this policy, the Governmenit maintained current debt
servicing to the Bank and undertook a Bank-supported macroeconomic adjustmert program for a
perfonnance period ending in December, 1992. During this period, the Bank approved three
adJustment loans: a $300 million Trade Policy Reform Loan C(PRL); a $300 million Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL); and a $400 million Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL). The IDB
supported the program with a trade policy reform loan and financial sector adjustment loan.
15.         In parallel, the IMP approved a Rights Accumulation Program (RAP) for Peru in
September 1991, under which Peru accrued rights to future disbursements of 188 percent of its quota
or SDR625 million, equivalent to its arrears to the IMF. The adoption of the RAP paved the way for
a successful Paris Club rescheduling in September 1991 (involving debt relief from October 1991
through December 1992) and enabled Peru to re-establish relations with bilateral creditors. A
Support Group of bilateral donors provided approximately $500 million in quick-disbursing balance of
payments support in 1991/92.
C. Maroeonomic Assessment
16.         Progam Implemetation and Economic Performance. The economy responded
strongly to the emergency stabilization and structual reform measures. The rate of inflation fell from
over 7,000 percent in 1990 to 139 percent in 1991 and 57 percent in 1992. After contracting for
three years, real £DP grew by 2.6 percent in 1991. For 1992 as a whole, real GDP is esdmated to
have declined by 3 percent. The sharp slowdown in economic activity occurred during the fist half
of 1992, when a severe drought and related fall in electricity generation, and an escalation in
terrorism adversely affected agricultural, fishery, and m  output. But, since August 1992
there has been a fast recovery.
17.          Recent developments in the balance-of-payments have also shown the impact of the
reform program. The liberalization of the trade regime and private capital inflows allowed increases
in Imports, thus relieving the pressure caused by the pent-up demand for imports of raw materials,
capital and consumer goods. Consequentiy, the external current account deficit to GDP ratio
increased from about 4 percent in 1990 to 5 percent in 1992. Significant private capital inflows,
induced by high real domestic interest rates, also led to an increase of more than $1 billion in gross
inteational reserves during 1990-92.
18.         Tight fiscal and monetary policies since mid-1990 have played a major role in
achieving a sharp deceleration in inflation. The consolidated public sector fiscal deficit declined from
6.5 percent of GDP in 199 to 3 percent in 1991, and futher to 2.S percent during 1992. The
nonfinancial public sector had an estimated operational surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP during 1992.
Ihe ratio of tax revenue to GDP increased by almost two percentage points since 1990, reaching 9.3
percent in 1992, despite a large decline in 1992 revenues from the excise tax on energy and oil
products (this tax represented 26 percent of total tax collections in 1991) and the fall in GDP.

19.          The operational surplus of the public sector in 1992 enabled t'ie Central Bank to
purchase foreign currency in the market without inflationary pressure. This led to an 11 percent real
depreciation of the sol, which should help Peru's export performance, which had been adversely
affected by the appreciation of the real exchange rate in 1990-91, caused by the large inflows of
private capital.
20.          The financial system entered a reriod of stepped-up adjustment in 1992, responding to
both changes brought about by the new banking law and prudential regulations as well as to
significant changes in the relative prices and profitabilities in the economy. Since March 1992,
several small financial institutions have been liquidated, and the remaining ones are undertaking
portfolio restructuring and changing their lending practices in accordance with the new economic
environment and shifts in business risks. Structural reforms since August 1990 have drastically
altered domestic relative prices, and some previously lucrative activities have become unprofitable.
And, the financial situation of some SOEs has worsened even furher. These developments have
influenced portfolios of Peru's banking sector in several ways. The percentage of non-performing
ioans in the banks' portfolios has increased, some loans have had to be written off, and others have
been rescheduled as firms have facad difficulty in repaying them on the originally agreed terms. In
summary, the reforms and associated adjustments have resulted in a reduction in the collectibiity of
banks' portfolios which, in tura, has induced banks to tighten loan terms and to attempt to recover
part of the outstanding credit.
21.          Nominal Interest rates in the banking system for deposits and loans in both soles and
dollars declined in 1992. The dispersion in interest rates between sol and dollar deposits also
declined, suggesting that the market expects a decrease in the rate of devaluation and a higher degree
of credibility in the stabilization program. Real interest rates for deposits in soles also declined but
remained positive (the real yield of time deposits in soles during 1992 was 1.7 percent). The decline
in interest rates for loans has been less than that for deposits. The high spread between loan and
deposit rates in dollars reflects adjustment costs of the banking system and higher business risks
associated with the changing economic environment. The high real cost of credit has adversely
affected the pace of economic recovery. The growing cunfidence in the Government's
macroeconomic program, as reflected in falling interest rates and inflation, and further improvements
in the banks' financial health should progressively lower the real cost of credit, thus increasing the
financial sector's involvement in meeting the ewnomy's new investment and restructring needs.
22.          In short, the process of stabilization, which started in August 1990, has been
accompanied by remarkable achievements but has yet to be consolidated. The stabilization has been
based on a reduction of the fiscal deficit and the elimination of credit from the Central Bank to the
Treasury. Monetary and exchange rate policies, while imDortant, have accompanied fiscal discipline
rather than taking a leading role in reducing inflon. Tax revenues at 9.3 percent of GDP are lov7
in comparison to that of other countries (the average for a sample of 15 countries in Latin America is
about 14.8 percent of GDP), and have fcrced the Government to maintain comparable levels of
spending.

D. Pw        lEnuIrsimRa in
23.          Improvements in Peru's external  viroment are expected to contribute to a
strengthening of its balance of payment in the 1990s. lTis section assesses export performance and
growth prospects, and the exerna debt and financing situation.
24.          Export Performance. Peru's exports of goods and non-facto. services at constant
p,ices declined at a yearly average of 1.4 percent during 1980-91. This decline reflects both domestic
economic policies pursued during the 1980s, as well as declining world prices for some of Peru's
major exports. In petroleum, Peru earned about $800 million from exports in 1980. However,
production dropped sharply during the 1980s due to the distorted policy frmework, with the result
that the country became a net importer of petroleum by the end of the decade. Severe
macroeconomic instability and appreciation of the sol in recent years also adversely affected export
performance. Externlly, declining intnational prices for some of Peru's traditional exports led to
below-potential export peromance. For example, silver prices fell from about $20/oz. troy in 1980
to almost $4/oz.troy in 1991. Similarly, world lead prices decreased by 59 percent and fishmeal by
16 percent in current dollars greater in constant dollars) over the same period.
25.          In the 1990s, significant improvements are expected in Peru's export performance,
with exports forecast to grow by 9-10 percent annually from 1994-2000. In part, this reflects
expected trends in the exenal envirorment. First, following vual stagnation in 1991-92, global
eoomic growth is projected to reach at least 3 percent in the remainder of the decade, with the
volume of world trade growing 5-6 percent. Second, Peru's terms of trade are epected to move
favorably in the second half of the 1990s, due mainly to a recovery of mineral prices. Finally, as a
rsult of Peru's small share of world trade and the product mix of its principal exports, it is unlikely
to be targeted for protectionist or retaliatory measures.
26.          While world trends are favorable (or neutra) for Peru's export growth, the forecast
expansion in exports is expected to come primarily from a 'supply.side" response, rather than
international developments. This reflects two factors: ch g rehitive prices as a result of the
radical trade liberalization and rdated strucral reforms; and major efficiency improvements in key
sectors as a result of prvaization and increased competiin  The recent depreciation of the
currency, together with maitenan  of the Governe's prudent pnetay and fiscal policies, should
also facilitate export growth. Based on Peru's past experience, the forecast level of export growth is
attanble. In the 1950s and early 1960s, whfle Peru's economy was still relatively open and healthy,
the ratio of exports to GDP was in the range of 17-21 percent. Following a prolonged period of
eoomic colLapse, this ratio had slumped to 8-11 percent by the end of the 1980s. Even with export
growth of 9-10 percent anally though the 1990s, exports will sM not have recovered to the
relative level they enjoyed in the 1950s, although the world econor, is considerably more open.
27.          Extenl Debt. The Government has made signific progress at setting arreas on
its exteral debt and secutig new financing for its progam from commercidal banks, the  Us, and
bilater donors. On November 20, 1992, the Government oncluded a tolling agrement with the
Bank Advisory Committee for commercia bank debt, which, If approved by the member banks,
would suspend potendal lawsuits over the non-payment of debt during the next six years.
Negotidons with commercial banks are expected after substaaly al lawsuits are widrawn. In
additon, the Government plans to reschedule its official bilatera debts with the Paris Club creditors



8
in May 1993. Finally, Peru cleared its arreas with the IM: with the IDB In September 1991 and
with the Bank and the IMF in March 1993.
28.          In the short and medium-term, new external financing is necessary for the success of
the program. In March 1993, the Government agreed with the IMF on a three-year stabilization
program and financing plan for 1993-95, to be supported by an Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The
EFF follows the Rights Accumulation Program which was completed in December 1992. The Bank
will also support the program through this adjustment loan and follow-up operations. The program
aims to consolidate the gains made since August 1990. The financing plan for the medium-term
program is discussed in the following section.
E. Peru's Develonment OWecves and EPlicies
29.          Although the Government has achieved remarkable economic progress over the past
two and one-half years, Peru remains in a very fragile economic, social and political situation. Its
challenges in the next few years are daunting. The economy, though beginning to recover, must
continue adjustment to a full market economy with a growing private sector. Government fiscal and
institutional capacity remain weak. Basic infrastructure is badly deteriorated from a decade of
neglect. Poverty and ethnic rifts continue to divide the country. Terrorism and drug trafficking
heavily drain Government resources, discourage foreign investment, and weaken efforts to reintegrate
the country. And political instability poses the constant risk that fundamental economic reforms could
be reversed.
30.          Against these challenges, the Government has an ambitious medium-term agenda for
development. The agenda is centered on the following objectives: sustaining the macroeconomic
stabilization program; stimulating private sector growth/invesument and reintegrating the large
informal sector into the formal economy; radically reducing the role of the state through privatization
and reshaping the public sector to carry out new responsibilities in a liberalized economy; attacking
poverty and expanding basic social services to improve the living conditions and opportunities of the
poor; rehabilitating essential infrastructure; and strengthening institutions at all levels of society. The
key policies supporting this agenda, and the major reforms to be undertaken, are described below.
31.          Macroeconondc stabiltion. The Government's macroeconomic objective is to
achieve sustained growth with price stability. Its 1993-95 economic program and financing plan, to
be supported by the Bank and the IMP, are designed to achieve this objective. In the short-term,
GDP is expected to grow at a rate of 3.5 percent in 1993. The extera current account deficit is
projected to increase from 5.1 percent of GDP in 1992 to 6.2 percent in 1993. This expansion
reflects primarily an increase in investment from 15.5 to 16.8 percent of GDP. Tax collection is
projected to increase from 9.3 to 10 percent of GDP. The consolidated public sector fiscal deficit is
forecast at 2.9 percent of GDP, slightly above that of 1992, primarily as a result of the projected
increase in interest payments and public sector investment. It will be financed with external
resources, without recourse to credit from the Central Bank to the Treasury. Inflation is forecast to
decline from 57 percent in 1992 to 27 percent in 1993.
32.          The program objectives for 1993 are achievable. There are several indications that
the credibility of the stabilization and suctural reform program has greatly increased during 1992.
The response of foreign investors to the privadzation program, the high surplus in the capital account
of the balance of payments and gain in international reserves, and the steady decline in the spread



9
between sol- and dollar-deposit interest rates are positive signs. The fiscal situation has gready
improved and a significant real exchange rate depreciation occurred between March and December
1992. There has been a strong economic recovery since August 1992, with GDP growing 10 percent
In the second half of the year. The strength of the recovery indicates that GDP is likely to increase In
1993 at a rate higher than projected in the program.
33.          The medium term projections (table 1 and Annex II) assume the following key
targets: an increase in aMmal GDP growth to at least 5% and a reduction in inflation to 10% by
1995; a gradual reduction in the external current account deficit in the second half of the decade to
below 5% of GDP; an increase in investment (both public and private) from 15.5% of GDP in 1992
to 17.6% by 1995; and an increase in gross international reserves from $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion.
34.          To achieve these objectives, the Government must continue tight fiscal and monetary
policies, while mainaning its structural reforms, particularly trade, price, exchange rate and interest
rate liberalization. T'he economic projections reflect several positive factors. The process of
deregulation and privatization is likely to result in rapid increases in efficiency in key sectors of the
economy, such as mining and agriculture which had stagnated in the previous decade. Throughout
the economy, domestic relative prices now reflect more closely the relative scarcity of resources. ITe
Government's adoption over the last two years of a more neutral and less protectionist trade policy is
expected to stimulate export growth. Productivity is also expected to increase as the restructuring of
the economy is underway. Growth in private investment is expected to contne due to increased
investor confidence, the Government's broad privatlzation program, and policy refoims and
deregulation measures to encourage business activity. The increase In public investment, particularly
the urgent rehabilitation of transport, is expected to be financed by improved tax collections,
increased multilateral and bilateral assistance, proceeds from privadzation, and the elimination of
prior subsidies to state enterprises.
35.          Flnancing Plan. The financing plan for the 1993-95 program reflects recent
developments in Peru's efforts to settle its arrears and secure new finaning. Under the plan, it is
assumed that Peru would obtain: (1) rescheduling from Paris Club creditors on all pre-cutoff
maturities failing due during the three-year period; and (Hi) full debt relief from foreign commercial
creditors on most medium-and long-term debt and the stock of short-term debt that has been in arrears
since 1984. Peru would continue servicing debts to Latin American creditors and seek debt relief
from them on terms comparable to those obtained from Paris Club creditors. Peru has resumed
payments to certain suppliers without official guaantee and is taking steps to solve specific claims
that have arisen from the nationalizations of the previous administion. It is assumed that the
Government will continue to service short-term trade credits.
36.          The financing plan for the 1993-95 program shows a gap for 1993 of $410 million,
which is expected to be secured. The Support Group of bilateral donors met in December 1992 and
early March 1993 and pledged $265 million for 1993. The remainder ($145 million) is expected to
be provided through concessional terms on Paris Club financing and/or additional commitments from
bilateral donors.
37.          Beyond 1993, the projections indicate a financing gap averaging
$205 mullion annually in 1994-95. The gap could be lower if any variables proved to be more
favorable than assumed, for example, if Peru were able to secure new flows on more concessional
terms than in the past, or other exceptional treatment (e.g. debt reduction, and rescheduling or



10
deferral of moratorium interest under future Paris Club rescheduling), or if fister GDP growth were
to lead te higher government revenues.
38.          Peru's public ecternal debt i expected to incse by 35 percent between 1994 and
2000. The Government's ability to service its debt, however, is projected to incrase subst ly as
economic reforms take hold and the economy improves, thereby loweing the projected ratio of debt
service to exports to 29 percent by 2000 from 48 percent in 1994 (see Table 1 on page 6).
Debt/GDP and other debt indicators are also projected to improve in the second half of the decade.
39.          Private sector development. Increasing the scope and size of private sector activity is
crucial for economic growth over the medium-term. The Government's agenda in this area includes
several major elements: the privadzation of all its holdings by mid-1995, when the current
Government's term expires (an enormous task given the breadth of the public sector in the economy
and its deteriorated situation); fiuther structural reforms to eliminate any remaining impediments to
private business, competition and investment; and further reform of the financl sector and
development of domestic capital markets.
40.          The privaizaton program, backed by a strong poldii  commitment and widespread
public support, is expected to have profound Implications for the consolidation of the economic
reform program. A successful program wiUl give a major signal of the Govemment's priorities and
the fiture role of the private sector in the economy. It will lead to major efficiency gains,
particularly in key sectors which have stagnated over the past decade, such as mining and
hydrocarbons. Privatization could also provide additional resources to ameliorate the tension between
the short-term inflexibility of tax revenue and the demans for increased government expndie.
41.          Pove  alleviation. Alleviating poverty i a funid ntal objective In the
Government's agenda. One fifth of Peru's households are extremely poor-their entire per capita
expenditures are inadequate to purchase a basic food bakt. Ihey are fourd disproportionately In the
rural sierra, where half of all households are aetremely poor, especially among the Quechua and
Aymara, who account for 40 percent of the extremely poor although they make up only 16 percen of
all households. Ten percent of Lima!s households and 20 pect  of those in the urban coast and
sierra are also extremely poor. Incldling households who can purchase adequate food but not other
complementary goods, over half of all Peruvians are poor.
42.          The Government's stategy recognizes that poverty alleviation calls for revitalization
of the economy through stabilization'and liberalizaon, increased and more efficient social spending,
and close coordination with community representatives. Under the strategy, targeted interventions
will concenate on the extremely poor, with the objective of reducing the incidence of extreme
poverty from 21 percent to 15 perceni of houeholds by 1995. In health, the ste  seeks to
improve the quality of primary health services in rural and margina urban as and to improve
matera and child health. In education, it seek to inrease the efficiency and quality of primary
schooling in rural and marginal urban areas through the provisinw of school feeding, textbooks and
teaching maeris, and to improve literacy and job skills among non-literate adults. In employment,
the strategy emphasizes the generation of employment and inoome in rral and margnal urban areas
through social infrstructure and production support projects. In food a nce, it aims at providing
food to vulerable rural and marginal urban groups to meet their mntritonal requirements. The
strategy incorporates geographic targetng through the use of the exWn poverty map to identify
l



11
areas with high concen ons of exureme poverty. It   Inteseor coordination and relies on
continued strong NGO pardcipation.
43.          Infrstture RabIltdon. The   abitation of Inastucture is a further item
on the Government's agenda. Infrasucue has suffered from a lack of mainten  and failures In
economic policy. In the first phase of the reform progm, the Govermnont has focwed its eforts on
liberalizing prices and entry as a sdmulus to expd and improve sevices. Competion has been
promoted wherever feasible and restrictions on private invevent h    bee diminated. 1u some
sectors, notably urban transport, there has been a rapid supply response. In other sectors, particuarly
water, electricity and telecom  unications, the Govenment has launched major eforts to privadze its
holdings as rapidly as possble to incree efficiecy and bring new management and investment into
the sectors. But, increased public invesent will also be crucial. Urgent rehabiitation of
deteiorating transport Infrastructure is essentl. And dwsoges of deecicity and water in Lima
require new invesmens   power generation and wate supply.
44.          Rehabilitation of irrigatin works I also    h r mgTed T agrculumre accounts for
over half of the value-added in agrilture, and Irgatio projec hve absorbed 90 percent of public
investments in the sector. But, public projects have suffered frm poor management, inadequate
mantenance and low cost recovery. hinit  reforms have fod on tsfering the management of
irrigation works to local water user groups and esing adeqo water tarif. The next phase will
strengtn the insitutional and legal frmework and involve beficaries in the planning and
operaton and maintenace of existing and new Irigation work.
45.          Ishtiutonal str. Pehap     most crtcal development task over the
longer term is the rebuilding of Instutions throughout sociy. I   agenda for institutional
strengthenig has many dimensions. First, the recont congressiona and municipal elections are
Importat sstep in broadening participation in the polhiW  prce  and  ngpolitical
institutions. Ite Congress will draft a new Contitton, expectd to be completed by July 1993.
Second, the Governent is strongly committd to defeatg teorism and eliminating the high socia
and economic cost that it has wrought on the country over t  last decade. Third, through
lralization of rural property right and land tidig for small fames, the Govenment is seeking to
improve the economic prowspects for the nru  population nd sregthen ther commitment to local
Instidtions. Fourth, the Government intends to strengthen h role of local governents in the
provision of services. The reform of the oducational system is part of an effort to give local
govenments the capacity to manage the povision of primary  d secondary oducato   Fifth, the
Government Intends to make the civil sarvice smaller ad more efficient.
46.          A furither objective is the ntegn of the larw inform  sector into the formal
economy. It is expected tha recent legiative chages to eance fexibRiiq in labor markets and
business entry will help the absorpdon of the informal sector. Ths is expected to have several
benefits, including improved tax collection, more effient producdon ad incteased competitiveness
of domestic firms.
47.          Possible Risks. It is expected tha the Govenmet will achieve the program targets,
given the impressive results to date and its strong commitment to susin the stabilization and
structura reform program. However, the risks ae significat and other scenarios are possible, where
the economy moves into a path of high ina  and low gw    Th  insdutional weaknesses
Increae uncertaty and could delay the proes of adjustment one the reforms are enacted.



12
48.          Social, political and institutional risks pose the greatest threat to the program. First,
long-standing social tensions could jeopardize the consensus necessary to sustain economic reform.
Second, the current reforms are being implemented by a small group of persons who occupy key
positions in the government. Political instability increases the risk that they may not remain to
complete the reforms. Third, the civil service, which had detariorated sharply in the 1980s as a result
of falling real wages and increasing budgetary constraints, may not have the capacity to carry out the
new functions of government under a privatized and liberalized economy. Weaknesses in local
government could also delay program implementation, given that the program depends in part upon
their strengthening.
49.          The Government is continuing to take steps to reduce these risks. Its poverty
alleviation strategy Is aimed at improving living conditions and opportunities for the poorest segment
of the population, thereby building social cohesion. Recent successes against terrorism, and the
Government's strong commitment to eliminate it by 1995, have buoyed public morale and confidence
in Peru's future. And the recent congressional and municipal elections, together with the expected
adoption of a new Constitution, should strengthen political stability and institutions. Over the
medium-tem, these measures will be supplemented by a broader reform of the public service and
strengthening of local government institutions.
50.          The macroeconomic program faces risks in both fiscal and monetary policy. On the
fiscal side, pressures for increased government expenditures are widespread - for improvement and
expansion of public and social services, and for fighting terrorism and drug trafficking. Pressure may
also build to bail out businesses and banks which are not successfully adjusting. At the same time,
tax revenue remains low. Despite these pressures, the Government has maintained, and is committed
to continuing a tight fiscal policy. Ihe introduction of cash-based budgeting, the elimination of
Central Bank credit to the Treasury, and improvements in the tax base and tax administration have all
contributed to an improved fiscal position.
51.          Ihe Government's flexibility is also limited in monetary policy, as a result of
dollarization. Pressures from exporters for accelerated depreciation could lead the Government to
expand the money supply beyond program targets in order to purchase foreign exchange, thereby
fueling renewed inflation. However, the Government has followed a tight monetary policy and its
purchases of foreign exchange have been within program targets. The Government is committed to
contiuing this policy.
52.          Given the importanct. of privatization in the reform program, delays in privatization
and the influx of foreign investment could also impede recovery and growth. However, this risk is
diminishing, particularly as the Government's track record on privadzation continues to strengthen.
A dozen transactions have been completed in the last eight months and the Government has made
clear its commitment to accelerate the program and privatize all its holdings. Public support for
privatization remains strong. And the Government has also launched a promotional and information
campaign both domestically and abroad. Ihe public will have to recognize, however, that even with
a successful and rapid transfer of ownership of key public service SOEs (e.g. telecommunications,
water), service improvements and expansion will require new investments and may only be felt over
the medium term.

F. Bank' Assistance Stra: Obectives and Activities
53.          Background. The Bank provided extensive assistance to Peru in the past, financing
projects in most major sectors. Outstanding Bank loans (net of cancellations) reached about $1.6
billion by the mid-1980s. Approximately 90% of Bank lending was allocated in roughly equal
proportions to three sectors: industry/energy, infrastructure, and agriculture; of the remainder, 7%
was allocated to education and health. Following the moratorium in its debt service to the Bank,
Peru's loans were placed on non-accrual status in August 1987. The number of active Bank projects
decreased from ninetean in mid-1987 to five in 1990. The difficulty in maiaining these projects
without Bank disbursements or supervision for more than four years, together with changes in
Government priorities and the deteriorating security situation, led the Bank, in consultation with the
Government, to cancel the undisbursed balances of the remaining five projects.
54.          Since August 1990, when the Fujimori Government took office, the Bank has made an
intensive effort to assist the Government in preparing and implementing its stabilization and structra
reform program. The Bank has supported the Government's reform program through economic and
sector work, technical assistance, and the three adjustment loans approved in FY92 (TPRL, SAL and
FSAL). These loans were signed in December 1992 upon fulfillment of the required conditions. The
SAL and TPRL and the first tranche of the FSAL, were disbursed in March 1993, following arrears
clearance.
55.          In all sectors, the Peruvian policy- and decision-makers have sought to benefit from
international experience and adopt best practices. To assist them, the Bank has organized several
seminars attended by international experts to share their experience. To date, conferences have been
held on privatization, dollarization of the economy, fisheries resource management, power sector
privatization and regulation, and water sector privadzation. As well, the Bank organized a seminar
for the incoming Congress, attended by experts from several countries in the region, to exchange
views and experience on macroeconomic adjustment and poverty alleviation.
56.          To strengthen Government institutional capacity, the Bank has played a major role in
mobilizing technical assistance. During FY91-93, the Bank mobilized approximately $10.5 million
equivalent through the Japanese Grant Facility and $1 million equivalent from Germany through the
Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). These grants support economic and
sector analysis, as well as preparation and implementation of reforms and projects in a number of
areas, including macroeconomic stabilization, the financial sector, privatization, the social sectors,
transport, water and sanitation, irrigation, energy, urban development, and debt statitics and
management.
57.          Key Bank Objectives. The Bank's country assistance strategy over the medium term
has been carefully tailored to support the Government's development agenda and strengthen the
reform measures initiated over the last two and one-half years. The assistance strategy for Peru has
four main objectives: (a) to sustain stabilization and consolidate structural reforms; (b) to foster
private sector development and public sector reform; (c) to alleviate poverty and promote human
resource development; and (d) to rehabilitate key infrastructure and reform related policies.
Strengthening institutional capacity is fundamental to all four strategic objectives. These objectives,
and the Bank's support through lending and economic and sector work, are discussed below.

(a) Sutaanng Stabion and Consoladang Strcual ) orms
58.          While the Govenment has made impressive progress since mid-1990 in stabilizadon
and strucwtul reform, k must sustain its macroeconomic policies and deepen the policy and regulory
reforms to achieve economic recovery and sustained growth. The Bank wil support the Govesnment
in this process through tree mecnsm. First, the Bank's new adjustmen loans will contiue to
include conditions linked to maintenance of a sadtaory macroeconomic program and financing pla.
Under these operatons, the Bank will monitor key macroeconomic indicators, consistent with the
IW program. The adjustment loans will also srpport firlher structra reforms, particulaly related
to privatzation and dereguation. Second, the Bank's investment loans will include policy
components to ensure that sectoral liberaization measures are maninWned and expanded, and that new
legal/regulatory regimes are enacted where necessary. Third, the Bans economic and sector work
(ESW) will, inter alia, support consolidation of the macroeconomic reforms and identify and analyze
priorities for fiuther structural reforms. During FY92-93, the Bank has prepared formal and informal
reports on various policy issues including economic stabliaon, labor markes, poverty, and
agriculural policies. A Country Economic M ndum is also under preparation. The major
upcoming ESW tasks include: macroeconomic policy (fcusing on inflation, exal debt, and capital
markets), public administation, mining enviromnent, oil and gas development, basic health and
nutiion, education, policy reforms in infrstrucure, and basic inhastructure services to the poor.
(1) Fotering Pdriate Sector Dewlopment and Public Sector Reform
59.          Privatizaon forms a key element of the Government's program for private sector
development and public sector refonr. The Governmenets privaizaton program is aimed at
privatzing all SOEs by mid-1995. Bank support has been provided primarily through technica
assistance (TA), finaced by a Japnese grant ($3 million equivalent, approved in August 1991). A
$30 million Privatzatlon Technical Assistance Loan was approved on December 10, 1992 to finance
contned TA for privaion and related regulatory reforms. As well, under the SAL the Bank has
agreed with the Govement on sectoral privatizaon strategies for banking, mining, hydrocarbons,
telecommunications, sheries, war, industria, transport and electricity sectors. Imlementation of
these stratei-es is being supported by several operations, including: (a) the Privatzatlon Adjustment
Loan (this operation), which will support privatization and regulatory reform in mining,
hydrocarbons, telecommunicaions, water, fisheries and industry; (b) the Financial Sector Adjutment
Loan, which is supporting the prvatzaton of state-owned banks; (c) the proposed Power Sector
Privatzation Loan, which will support prvatizaon of the electric udlities and implementation of a
new policy/regulatory framework for the sector; and (d) sector loans being prepared for
water/sewerage and tasport, which will include privatizaon cmponents. Rlated economic and
sector work will focus on regulatory policies that govern natura monopolies, financi restrucurig
rquiements and labor redundancy.
60.          At the same time, the Bank will support the Government's efforts to reform public
sector policies that have restrcted private sector participation. Despite widespread recent
deguaion, there are sdtl a few lega and regulatory restrictions which maintain barriers to entry,
undermine property rights, raise the cost of doing busins, and help account for a huge infrmal
sector. To evaluate the impact of recent reforms and assess the exten of regulatory and legal reform
stfll required, the Bank is undertaking a private sector assessment of Peru. Also, an ESW report has
just been completed which assesses the legal aspects of compettion policies and makes
recommendations on fiuter reforms. This report wfll be discussed with the Govenment shordy. A



15
proposed second Structr Adjustment Loan is expected to support additional economy-wide
measures to enhance the enabling environment for business, competition, and private investment.
61.          In parallel, the Bank will continue to support futher public sector reforms in energy
and agriculture. In the energy sector, the Bank will focus on assisting the Government in establishing
a well functoning regulatory framework and economically sound pricng policies, with maximum
reliance on markets where competition is feasible. The Bank has been providing techp;al assistance
for development of a new Hydrocarbons Law and a new Electricity Law. Lending operations and
economic and sector work will support the implementation of the new legal/reguatory regimes for
these key sectrs.
62.          In agriculture, the Bank has supported the liberalization of agricultural land, product
and rural financial markets tirough the adjustment loans approved in FY92. These reforms, which
have redefined the role of Government and changed the legal framework, are expected to improve
economic efficiency. Ihe Bank has also prepared a report on agricultural policies and discussed with
the Government an agenda for further policy reforms. Ihe Bank, through contined economic and
sector work and new lending, wiUl assist the Govermment to prepare and implemeat these reforms.
Priority areas include: (a) landlproperty reform: the elimination of remaining minimum limits on land
size and restrictions on property rights, and the creation of a rural property register; (b) rural finance:
the selling or leasing of rural branches of the Agriculture Bank to private itnsttions, the
strngthening of supervision and regulation of rural financial instutions, and the provision of
assistance to margina farmers through targeted poverty alleviation programs rather than through
credit; (c) water resource management/irrigation: strengthening the technical and financial capabilities
of the new water users associations and river basin authorities; evaluating the feasibility of
etablishing a market for water rights or of proviling concessions for water use; and transferring the
construction, management and agricultural development of the large public irrigation projects to the
prvate sector; and (d) tecbnology and extension: defining an appropriate role for the state, and
Implemening a strategy based on a mix of private and public involvement.
(c) Allevitng Povert  d Promoting Hwnan Rsource Deveopme
63.          The Bank has assisted the Government in formulating a two-part poverty alleviation
straegy. Under the first part, the Government is putting in place policies that encourage broad-based
economic growth. Ihe Bank has been supporting this part of the strategy through its adjustment
loans. The Government is also taking steps to mitigate any short-term impact that adjustment
measures might have on the poor. For example, with respect to the privatization of swie enterprises
that are the major employer and provider of social services in certain communites, measures are
being taken to secure the continued provision of essental services and to provide job remientation for
displaced workers.
64.          Under the second part, the Government wil seek to improve basic social services,
especially primary education, basic health care, family planning and nutrition. The emphasis will be
on improving living conditions and protecting the consumption and welfare levels of the poor until
growth occurs, and on ensuring that the poor are able to respond to employment oppornites arising
from economic growth. 'Te Bank has prepared a poverty assessment report which analyzes the
chaacteristics of poverty and recommends priority programs for possible Bank and donor support.
lbe report highighted three issues that must be considered in designing the programs. First, the
predominantiy rural nature of severe poverty, particularly among the Quechua and Aymara, calls for



16
appropriat strewgies to ensure basic social services in rural aes, including those related to cholera
preventio and care. Second, the lack of emphasis on programs to reach vulnerable groups least able
to captr new economic opportunities, such as lactating and pregnant women, young children, the
hronkally M and the elderly, suggests the need to develop and adequaty fince well-targeted
interventions. TMird, the high level of resources now channlled into food assistnce programs calls
for imprvement In tageiDg and cot-effectiveness.
65.          The Bank wil support the implementaion of the Government's poverty alleviation
strategy through project lending and firther ESW. Emphasis m Bank assistance will be placed on:
reforming the provision of food assistance; developing a policy for decentralizing health and
education; improving living standards information in order to improve targetag and the quality of
social spending; and invesdtg in the priority projects idendfied in health and education. The Bank's
lending program for the social sectors includes projects for basic health and nutrkion, primary health
care, basic education, and institutional development in the social sectors. As well, the Bank will
assist FONCODES (the Social Development Fund) in local initiatives to improve social and physical
infastructure and to provide direct assistance in health, food production and distibution, education
and sanitation. FONCODES fiances small projects with rapid implementation on a demand driven
basis. Bank assistance will aim to Increase the impact in terms of employment generation and poverty
allevation by improving project selection criteria and stengthening systems for management and
spvision
(d) Rehabiitating Key Ihastruture and Refrming Related Pofides
66.          The Bank's strategy for assisting the Goverment in       has tbree elements:
(a) preparing lending operations to help address immediate rehabilitaton needs in transport, water,
municipal services and irrigation; (b) introducing immediate legal, policy and regulatory reforms to
liberali prices and service and promote competition; and (c) developing longer-term strategies for
each sub-sector. I transpt, lending will intially focus on immediate measures to rehabilitate the
deteriorating transport infraucture, primarily highways, bridges, rail and airports. Particular
emphasis wil be placed on providing low-cost replacement bridges damaged by terrorist acdvities. In
water, the Bank is assisfing the Government, through technical assistance and adjustment operations,
in establishing a new legal/regulatoy framework for the sector which will ensure improved resource
use and access to safe water, while promoting private investment. In parallel, the Bank is assist
die Govement in preparing and implementhig the privataon and rehabilitation of the Lima
waterlsewerage newo   l  municipal servlce, the Bank will help the Govermment assess and solve
bodh pricing and institltional bottlenecks, and encourage sustainble municipal development projects
that are self-financing and have cost-recovery mechanisms. These projects wil use labor-intensive
constuction to support the Govment's employment generation program and allevia  poverty. In
irriton, the Bank wil assist the Government in rebabilitation, strengthening the legal and
instutional famework establishing a water market, and improving the efficiency of water resource
management through greater participation of user organzations.
67.          Areas of Spial Operational Emphasis. Two of the Bank's areas of special
operatilemphs   are explicitly highligted in the country assistance sLategy for Peru, namely
po         i alleion and private sector development. The Bank has assisted the Govemnent In the
develpnt of its poverty alleviaton strategy and is now helping to implement it through an
artiuaed program  of lending and ESW, primaily in health, nutrton, education and commmuty
projects. Povety alleviation measures are also incoporated in all operations to Improve living
condtons and help the poor respond to employment opportunities. Similarly, the Bank has placed
specl emphasis in its assistance strategy in promoting private sector development and privatization in
Pem  Given the virta collpse of the public sector in the late 1980s and the imporane of targeting
scarce budget resources to poverty alleviation and the provision of basic social services, privatizatk
and the growth of private investment are crucial to economic recovery and growth.



17
68.          In environment, lending and ESW will address two growing environmental concerns:
(a) natural resource management; and (b) mining pollution. First, the Bank wiUl undertake a series of
studies over the next three years to provide an analytical, legislative and institutional basis for
addressing the problems of water and soils management, degradation and deforestation. These studies
will help the Government create a policy framework for proper resource use and develop action plans
to address priority problems. The Bank will also continue to support the implementation of a
Nadonal Parks project, which will be financed under the Global Environmental Facility (GEF).
Second, the Bank will evaluate the magnitude of mining pollution in economic and technical terms (in
both private firms and state-owned enterprises to be privatized) and recommend ways of establishing
and enforcing appropriate technical standards. A lending operation is also being prepared to help
finance the cleanup of environmental damage from public sector mining operations.
69.          The emphasis in the country assistance strategy on human resource development and
poverty alleviation is also expected to have a major impact on women in development. Indeed, the
Initial focus of lending in the social sectors will be on the provision of basic health and nutrition
services to vulnerable mothers and children in rural or marginal urban areas. It will seek to
strengthen four services: (a) pre-natal care and delivery; (b) child nutrition promotion and
supplementation; (c) treatment of diarrhea, acute respiratory illnesses and tuberculosis; and (d) family
planning. Follow-up projects in primary health care, basic education, nutrtion, and the Social
Development Fund wiil also help improve living conditions and opportunities for women.
70.          Lending Levels and Composition. Bank lending to Peru is forecast at $400 million
in FY93 and $500 million annually for FY94-96. These levels assume maintenance of a satisfactory
macroeconomic program and financing plan. The lending program will have a major focus on
privatzation, basic infrastructure and the social sectors. This pro" Am includes three adjustment
operations (the Privatization Adjustment Loan, the Power Sector Frivatization Loan, and the SAL 11),
two technical assistance loans (the Privatization Technical Assistance Loan and the Energy and
Mining Technical Assistance Loan), and investment loans for inlfastructure rehabilitation (transport,
water, irrigation), health and nutrition, social development fund, primary education, municipal
development, and mining environment.
71.          During FY93-94, about half of the lending volume would be devoted to adjustment
lending. By FY95, lending would comprise only investment operations. About two-thirds of the
FY93-96 lending would aim to increase the access of the poor to basic social services and improve
the institutional capacity to provide social and economic infistructure (of which one-Wthird would
directly alleviate poverty), with the remainder to foster private sector development. In general, as the
focus of the lending program moves from adjustment to investment operations, continued
imnprovements in the Government's implementation capacity, as well as the security situation, will be
vital to expand lending.
72.          The lending program will be adjusted, if necessary, dependhig upon the Government'g
progress in implementing the reform program. To ensure that the lending program reflects overall
progress, we will monitor closely the implementation of the program vis-a-vis the program objectives
and targets. In assessing the success of the GovernmeWt's program, we wiUl focus on the following:
(a) achievement of the macroeconomic program targets (GDP, inflation, fiscal deficit, etc); (b)
maintenance and deepening of key structural reforms (e.g. trade, price, exchange rate and interest rate
liberalization; labor and financial market reforms; land reform); (c) progress in achieving other
program targets, particularly those related to poverty alleviation, privatization and improvement of
basic services; (d) increased political and social stability; and (e) strengthening of government
insttional capacity to carry out the reforms.

74.          Isues for Bank Asistane Strategy. Rebuilding instuona capacty wiin the
Goveranment is crucial to successful Implementaion of the proposed assistance sura. In the short-
term, the Bank is helping to strghen government capacity through technical assistance and
organizing seminars and confaences to excage best practices. At the same tme, insitional
strengthening is a key component of al Bank operadons to ensure sustainability.
75.          Given the five-year hiatus in Bank lending for Peru, there is a need to familiarize
counerpart staff with Bank operatg procedures. We are planning project launch workswps and
semmars to train project officials in Bank procurement, disburement and auditing requrements.
76.          The Bank is consdeng setting up a locally-staffed representa   office in Lima, and
eventually expanig this into a full Residen Mlission, provided there are continued impovements in
the securty suation. In view of the expanding assistance progm, a Residen Mission is important
for the Bank to support effectively Per's economic development in the medium and the long term.
77.          Bank Exposu. Under the proposed lending program, which assumes sustained
stabilizado and stuctural reform, Bank eposure is expected to increase from $1.6 billionto $2.2
bfflion between 1994 and 2000. However, aUl exposur ratios are epWeced to remin witin Bank
norms during this period (see Table l). In 1999, debt service to prerraed creditors is exected to
reach 34.7 percent of toa public debt service, after gradually rising thoghu the decade. The
increase Is due largely to the substa   disbu   from prefrred creditors expected in 1992 and
1993. The other debt indic     also remain within Bank norms trough 2000. Debt service to the
BRD, as a percentage of total public debt service, is expected to increase fiom 6.8 percent in 1994 to
9.8 percet by 2000. At the same time, debt seri  to the MRD, as a percentage of exports, is
expected to decrease from 3.0 percen in 1994 to 2.6 percent in 2000.
78.          Ihe program is highly conditioned on sustned progress by the Government in
implemeing its refom program. Iadequate macroeconomic progress or mjor policy reversals
could lead to a substan y reduced leading program, with correspondingy less exposure, but higher
risk for the Bank.
G. IFC/1GA Oasadm
79.          Since beginning operations in Peru in the 1960s, IFC has approved 24 invesmen.
Mining has been the most important sector. Although the IFC processed an aveage of two projects
annally prior oD FY86, only two new projects were processed between FY86 and FY92 due to the
poor investment cimate and macroeconomic policies, as wel as the arrears siuation wih the BaiL
In 1990, the IFC partcipated in the capital increase of Compafia de Minas Buaenura S.A. In
1992, it approved an equity inesme  and credit line for Sogewlese Leasing. At end-Febrary
1993, IFC held an aggrega of $9.36 mlioninoutstanding loans. It held an addtional S3.7 mllion
in equity invem ts in seven compaies. Total exposure (outtandig investments plus undisbrsed
CO _mmt   ) rerents about 0.2 percent of IFC  total portoli. Currently, IFC is rtiewing
prvadzaon prposas. During FY93, it expects to approve three projects in       and

minig, Increasing its exposure by toughly $40 million. Over the next few years, the IFC will
contnue Its involvement in mining in view of Peru's comparative advantage, but will also explore
possible lending and investments in infrastructur, general manufcturing, capital market, and
agribusiness.
80.          Peru completed its MIGA membership requirments on Dcmber 2, 1991. MIGA
has not yet issued any guarantees there, but has received 5 applications.
H. Relations with Qle lulta  InZi_sndillDn
81.         OMf Coordinadon. During the debt workout, the Bank and the I1  worked closely
together to assist Peru in preparing and implementing the Government's stabilization and structul
reform program. Arrears have now been cleared with both IFI, and a macroeconomic program and
financing plan for 1993-95 Is now in place, to be supported by this operation and the IM's EFF.
Ihe Bank and the JM will continue to cooperate closely in supporting Peru's reform program and
securing 0Xex al financing.
82.          1 DB Coordinaton. The Bank will continue close coordinton with the IDB on policy
reforms and project design. During PY91-93, the Bank and the IIB worked together to prepare their
respective adjustment operations for trade reform .nd financl sector reform. Ihe two insttions
have also agreed on a program of collaboration in the transportion and power sectors. Ihe Bank
will continue to stay abreast of the IDB's work program, and cafry out joint preparations as
necessary.
83.          Ihe IDB's assistance strategy in Peru focuses on supporting the consolidation of
stablization and structural reforms and promoting  edium- and long-term development. It
e sizes: (a) instutional strengthening and preinvestment support; (b) privatizaon and private
sector development; (c) poverty alleviation and social development; and (d) basic infrastructure
rehabilition. Tne IIDB plans to implement the strategy through a combination of tehnical
asistance, quick-disbursing sector loans, and invetm  loans. Given Peru's critical social sitatioDn,
high priority will be placed on projects in health and nutrition, education, water aad sanitation and
other povety-reduction efforts. The MDB is currently preparing a lending program for 1993-94
encompassing projects in health, water and sanitation, electricity, agriculture, and small-scale
entprises. The other possible projects include: education, housing and urban development, and
rigadon.
84.          Aid Coordhnton. Ihe Bank will assume a leading role in aid coordination. Given
the magnitude of Peru's resource needs, cofinancing with concesslonal loans and grants is being
sought from bilateral donors. Ihe Bank plans to organize a Consultaive Group meeting for Peru in
mid-1993. The meeting would discuss the Govemens economic program, poverty alleviation
strategy, and the profiles of priority social projects.
85.          The Bank will continue working closely with bilateral donors to ensure the successful
implementation of the Governmene's medium-term economic and structural reform program.

86.          SOEs In the Economy. Given the virtual collapse of the public sector, including
statowned enteprises, In the late 1980s, the Govrment's prvadztizon program is essental for
economic recovry and private investment. During the 1980s, SOEs accounted for roughly 15
percen of GDP, 30 prcen of merchandise exports and 7 percent of employm    In the non-
agricultural formal sector. The number of -OBs increased from 29 in 1968 to 177 by 1990, as the
result of nationalistic policies aimed at increasing the sae's operations, precluding foreip invstM
In stegic sectors, and generating suplus funds to finance developmenL Seventy-six firms were
acquired through nationalization; many operat in key sectors and were profitable before
nadonalizadon. Consequently, SOEs became dominant In many sectorS, including: oil/gas (Petoperu
and its subsidiarmi); mining (Centromin, Hierro Peru and Minero Peru); electricity (Electrolima,
Eletoperu and the regional utlities); telecimmunications (the Government holds 21 percent of Lima-
based CPT and 100 percent of Entel, whicd operates outside Lima); and water. The Governen  also
has major holdings in banking and manuactuing (steel, pulp/paper, chemicals). Aggregae SOE
assets total roughly $8.5 billion (year-end 1991 book value).
87.          SOE Performance. The fmanci peromce of the SOE sector has genrally been
poor, and worsened during the lat  haf of the 1980s due to Peru's economic turmoil and the
consequent difficulty of most SOEs in meetg their fnacing needs. Continued use of public sector
prices by the previous govermment to contain inflationary pressure led to a sharp fall in the sector's
revenues from an average of over 25 percent of GDP in 1980-85 to less than 11 percent in 1989-90.
Until 1990, the wage bill continued to increase as a proporon of expenditures due to faster wage
adjusments and increased employment; employment in the sector doubled to roughly 150,000 during
the 1980s. These developments reduced the sector's cureat account savings from 2.3 percent of
GDP in 1985 to 0.2 percent of GDP in 1990. Lack of inter  funds and ernmal financng in tumrn
caused a sharp reduction in maintenance and investment expenditures - SOE investmt as a
proportion of GDP fell from 4.3 percein L 1981-85 to 1.8 percent in 1986-89 and tO less than
1 percent in 1990. Most SOEs were operating at a loss by 1989, when aggregate net losses totalled
$531 million equivalent Net losses were $174 million in 1990, reflect  sharp price increases
Implemented by the new Govenment in August 1990 in key public services. Total SOE debt is $5.2
billion, including $3.1 billion in domestic liabilities and $2.1 billion in extral debt.
88.          Privatzaton Framework. In mid-1991, the Government expanded its structural
reform program to include privatzaion, with the objective of privadzing all SOEs by mid-1995 when
its term expires. A legislative decree (#674) was passed in Sepmber 1991, establig the broad
legal and insiuonal famework for privatiation. Ihe decree set up an inter-ministerial commson
(COPRI), under the direct supervision of the President, to oversee the pdvatzton program. The
technical preparatory work is to be canried out in a decentaized manner by special comm_ts which
are designated by COPRI for either one or a group of SOEs. Decree 674 authorizes a wide range of
prvatzation methods (e.g. sae of shares, increase in share capital, sale of assets) and also established
a revolving Privatiaton Fund (FOPRI) which would be allocated two percent of the privatizon
proceeds to finance privatization-related expenses. COPRI would determine the Fund's utlzation.
89.          Progam Status. A small technical secetriat to support COPRI was established in
February 1992. As well, more than 30 speci committees were appointed during 1992 to prepare
and implement idividual privatizations. The speci committs report reguary to COPRI.
Ptivatation plans prepared by the speial commitees have been approved by COPRI for rou.bly 20
SOEs. From May 1992 to end-February 1993, twelve pdvatizions were completed, yielding $260
million in cash proceeds, including the iron ore company (Hierro Peru) which was sold on November
8,1992 for $120 million In cash (plus $150 million in investmt commiments), and the ntonal
aidin (Aeropern), which was sold on Jamny 16, 1993 for $54 mfllionl Other privatzations have
included holdings in mining (inera Condestae, Minpoo, Quelaveco), banking (Banco de



21
Comer:io), chemicals (Quimpac, Reynasa), ship repair (Inasa), urban transport (452 buses of the
Lima bus company), and hydrocarbons (Solgas and 78 of Petroperu's 82 gas stadons).

90.          The reform program to be supported by the proposed three-tranche loan includes three
major components: (a) maitenance of a satsfactory macroeconomic program and fnancing plan; (b)
implementation of policy, legai and regulatory reforms in key sectors to promote economic efficiency,
competition and private investment and to faciitate privatization; and (c) implementation of the
Govnent's privatizaon progrm, focussing on mining, hydrocarbons, and telecommunications,
and selected holdings in fisheries, industry, air/urban transport and the water sector. Outlined below
is a description of the reforms to be supported by the Loan in these areas, as well as a description of
the fiscal impact, social impact and environment aspects of the program.
A. Maaoeeonomic Proarm and Fmnaning lPlan
91.          Economic recovery, growth in private investment, as well as the success of the
privatization program wil depend upon the Government sustaining its macroeconomic policies and
strural reform program. As noted earlier, the Government has reached agreement with the Bank
and the IMP on the macroeconomic program and extal financing plan for 1993-95, to be supported
by this operation and a three-year Fund EFF. Under this operaton, maintenance of a
mawen nomle poicy framework and a frandng pla consstent with the objecves of the
reform program is a condition of effectiveness, second and third tranche release. In aseing
macroeconomic peformance during the period of this operation, the Bank wvll monitor key indicators
consistent with the IMF program.
92.          In addition to sustaing sound macroeconomic management, the Government is
commited to maintning and deepening complemenry structral reforms implemented over the last
24 months, aimed at deagulating/lerizing the economy and promoting competition. These
measures pertain to, inter alia: price, trade and exchange rate libealization; eimination of entry/exit
restrictions and monopoly rights of state-owned companies; financial sector reform/liberalization; and
the broadening of provisions in the labor laws for layoffs. Ibe Govermen's commitment to
maiting and deepening its struct   reforms is included in the Policy Letter for this operation
(Annex I[l). Adherence to these commitments will be monitored as part of the Bank's general
review, prior to second and third tranche release, of overall progress in implementing the refotm
program set out in the Policy Letter (see para 127).
B. Seoral Pogk. Jal and RggWaIgtor!rormi
93.          In addmion to ecnomy-wide measures, the Govenmet is implementng new enabliw
legislation in virtly all sectors to foster compeion, privawe ivestme  and relianc on market
forces. Even in traditionally monopolistc sectors (e.g. electricity, telecommuicatins), the
lega/regulatory fameworks are being designed to promote competition, or at a minimum
oestability, and to put in place streamlined regulatory amangements in order to avoid regulatory
burden and to ensure greater reliance on marketbased ientives.
94.          This operation will focus on sectoral policy, legal and regulatory reforms in
hydrocabons, mining, elecommunications, fisheries and water. These sectors have been targeted for
priority aention for two reasons: 'a) regulatory reforms in these sectors are needed prior to, or in
parallel with, priafzaton, not only to filcitae prinvazion, but also to maxmize economic
efficiency; and 0) SOEs in these sectors dominae the Goverments privatization agenda and account
for rougly 60 per cent of total SOE assets (excluding electricity SOEs, which will be covered by a



22
separate Power Sector Privatization Loan). In Peru's program, all privatizations will be preceded by
a thorough analysis of the structural options (where relevant) to ensure that alternatives for Increasing
competition and contestabiity have been fully examined. Key sectoral measures taken to date, and
the additional reforms to be supported by the Loan, are summarized below (see annex IV for
additional details).
95.          Hydrocarbons. Despite its potential, Peru's hydrocarbons sector - which accounts for
about five per cent of GDP - declined sharply during the 1980s. Domestic productiop dropped from
195,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1982 to 1 10,000 bpd in 1992, and the country shifted from being a
petroleum exporter to a net importer ($186 million in 1991). Known reserves dropped by 50 per cent
from 1982 (their peak level) to 1989 (300 million barrels - enough for less than nine years of
consumption at current levels), as investments in exploration and development also declined sharply.
Many of the problems stemmed from the heavily controlled policy environment and the monopoly
position held by Petroperu on virtualy all upstream and downstream activities.
96.          The Government's objectives are to deregulate the sector, encourage competition and
private investment, and privatize Petroperu and its subsidiaries. This will require a series of legal,
policy, regulatory and tax reforms, given that the prior regime reflected Petroperu's monopoly
position in upstream/downstream markets and its role as fiscal agent for the Government in collecting
petroleum product taxes. Several transitional measures have been implemented, though fill
deregulation and competition can only be achieved through the enactment of a new hydrocarbons law
(under preparation), implementation of a new contractual framework for private firms to carry out
exploration and production, and the privatization of Petroperu.
97.          The transitional measures taken to date include: (a) issuance of a decree in 1991
eliminating Petroperu's monopoly on downstream activities (importing, refining, storage,
transportation, distribution) and modifying procedures to facilitate contracting out, to the private
sector, of upstream activities (exploration and production); (b) increase in domestic petroleum product
prices by 3000 per cent in August 1990; retail prices for 84 octane gasoline are roughly $2/gallon,
though the bulk of this reflects special taxes; ex-refinery prices net of taxes are actually slightly below
international levels (roughly 17 per cent on average at end-1992) for most products; and (c) issuance
of a decree in June 1992 formaly deregulating petroleum product prices; however, the Government
has mainained de facto control over Petroperu's prices, pending the implementation of the new legal
famework for the sector which will redefine Petroperu's relationship with the Government.
98.          While the measures taken to date are aimed at deregulation/liberalization, a new legal
framework for the sector is required to complete and implement the sectoral reforms. A draft of a
new hydrocarbons law has been prepared, which would fiully liberalize the sector, transfer the
policy/regulatory functions from Petroperu to the Government (e.g. the granting of concessions to
private companies for oil exploration and production), and establish new legal/contrctal
arangements between the Government and petroleum companies. Within the new legal framework,
Petroperu's relations with the Government would be on a filly commercial basis (identical to private
firms), while it is being privatized. Prices would be filly liberalized. Royalties and concession fees
for exploration and production would be established on an identical basis for private petroleum
companies and Petroperm. Simiarly, the existing special consumption taxes on petroleum products
(curnty collected from Petroperu) would be progressively replaced by excise taxes and a value-
added tax applied to aUl downsam    products (consistent with the economy-wide VAT). These tax
reforms are necessary in a deregulated/competitive market and would bring petroleum product
taxation in line with the overaU tax system, while maintaining fiscal revenues from petroleum
products during the maonomic adjustment period.

99.          Given the importance of this new legal framework and tax regime for deregulaon,
competition and private investment in the hydrocarbons sector, submission to Congress of a draft
law on hydrocarbons and a draft law establishing the tax regme for petroleum products, and
preparation of draft regulation for these laws 18 a condition of second tranche release.
Enactment of the hydrocarbons law and legislation establishing the tax regime for petroleum
products, and Issuance of the regulations for these laws b a condition of third tanche release.
(Note: this condition has been partially fulfilled, with the enactment in December 1992 of legislation
establishing the new tax regime for petroleum products.)
100.         The Policy Letter for this operation (Annex HI) sets out the Government's proposed
series of legal, policy, regulatory and tax reforms for the hydrocarbons sector. In addition to the
specific tranche release conditions pertaining to enactment of the laws and regulations, the Bank will
monitor the implementation of other reforms in this sector as part of its general review, prior to
second and third tranche release, of overall progress in implemening the reform program set out in
the Policy Letter.
101.         Mining. The new Government has enacted a series of measures to deregulate mining
(which accounts for 5 per cent of GDP and 45 per cent of merchandise exports) and open the sector
to private investment. These measures include: (a) issuance of a decree in July 1991 authorizing
majority private sector ownership of the major government holdings (Centromin, Hierro Peru and
Minero Peru); (b) enactment in November 1991 of a new Mining Law (Decree Law 708) which:
establishes transparent mles for granting concessions for exploration and exploitation of minerals and
metals; ensures minig companies the right to remit profits, free access to foreign exchange and the
right to freely market their production, both abroad and locally; (c) release, for private sector
exploration, of more than two million hectares of land previously reserved for the state companies;
and (d) initiation of the reorganization and streamlining of the sector agencies to facilitate granting
concessions for private exploration/development Regulations for the law have been drafted and will
be issued in 1993. Issuance of regulations for the Mining Law is a condition of second tranche
release.
102.         The private sector's response to these refms has been encuraging. Four state-
owned holdings have already been privatized, all to foreign investors. Two of these privatizaons
(Hierro Peru, the iron ore company, and Quellaveco, an undeveloped ming property) include
commitments by the new owners to invest more than $700 million for fit=re development/expansion.
The largest international mining company currently operating in Peru has also commenced a major
expansion program.
103.         Telecommunications: Telecomnmnications service in Peru is very undeveloped. Peru
has only 2.6 lines per hundred population (compared to 10.2 in Argentina and 8.2 in Venezuela).
The lack of service reflects several factors: prior legal restrictions on private and foreign investment;
erosion of real tariffs from 1980-90; and the sector organization and revenue-sharing arrangements
between Entel and CPT (the Lima-based company) which inhibited competition and efficiency. To
address these problems, the new Govenment hntroduced a number of reforms. Telephone rates were
increased by 1000 percent in August 1990 and have been periodically adjusted since then. Revenue
per subscriber line is currently estited at $600 annually, which compares favorably with other
countries in the region. In November 1991, a new Telecommunications Law was enacted which
eliminated prior restrictions on private sector participation and Entel's monopoly on long distance
service. The Law sets out a broad policy and legal framework to liberalize the sector and promote
competition and private (including foreign) investment The Law also streamlines the exising
regulatory agency, consistent with liberalization of the sector. Draft regulions are currently being
prepared for the Telecommunications Law.



24
104.         Fuher reform are necessary to Improve and implement the new regime. Revisios
to the curren service and reenue aing arragements between Ene and CPT are required to
ensure consistcy with th sector's liberalization, and to flitate privaization of the Govenmens
holdings. Rebalancing of the tariff structure is also required to reduce intaonal ras  to economic
levels, while Increasing local residential rates. The special committee for privatization of the
Govmen  tecommunicaons holdings was appoiied in mid-1992. International consulting
fims were hired in late 1992 and are cumently preparing the technical analyses and bidding
documens. MTe iial phase of the thnical work involves assessing structural options for
competition and privazaion and modifying the tariff structure. As a condition for second rande
release, the Government will prepare a new competition regime, tariff stsucture and
privatiz on Plan for th eilecommuication sector. As a condidon of third tranche release,
the Government will Implement the competition regime, tariff structre and privatization plan,
and issue regulations for the Telecommunications Law with respect to: (a) the operation of the
new regulatory agency; (b) the major classes of service; (c) the process and methodology for
settg tarffs; and (d) the process for granting of concessions.
105.         Fisheries. Fisheries is a key sector, contributing roughy $500 million aually in
export eaning (15 per cent of total Peruvin exports), virtualy all in fishmeal and fish-oil. Anchv
and sardines account for 90 per cent of fishmeal and fish-oil production. Apart from the problem of
inefficiency in Pescaperu (the state-owned fish processing company), there is also a serious over-
fishing problem in anchovy and sadines. To ensure biological sustainability as weil as to help
opmize economic benefts for the country, the Govenment is takling steps to put in place a new
fisheries resource management regime. An inational conference was held in mid-1992 to
exchange views on other countries' experience and to provide a basis for developing a new legal and
regulatoy frawork for the sector in Peru. Following this conference, a govemenl task force
prepared a new fisheries law. The operational details of a new fisheries management resoarce regime
ire also being worked out, with the advice of internatonal fisheries experts. The regime will be set
out in regulations to the new fisheries law. Submission to Congress of a draft fisheries law and
preparation of draft regulations establshing the fisheries resource management regime Is a
condition of second trnche relase. Enactment of the risheries law and issuance of the
reglatons establishing the fisheries resource management reglme Is a condition of Utird trancue
rela. (Note: this condition has been partally fulfilled with the enactment in December 1992 of the
new fisheries law).
106.         Water. The water sector, partcularly in Lima, has serious problems, including
shortages (here is currendy rationing), indequate access to clean water (over 30 per cent of Uma
residents are not connected to the disbuon system), poor water quality, with reated health
problems (e.g. cholera), and inadequate access to safe saitation (only 50 per cent of Lima residen
have access to safe saniadon). The Government Is implementing a number of reforms: (a) rates were
increased 100 per cent in August 1990 and were periodicaly adjusted until mid-l99, tough have
declined in re  tems since; (b) a special privatization committee was appointed in May 1992 for
prvatzing the Lima company (Sedapal). This committe is currently contracting international
consultants to assist with the priv on and (c) a new water sector law and water resources
management regime are being developed to ensure adeque water quality and access to service, and
to fbster private sector participation. his wil also entail the establishment of an autonomous
rgulatory agy   for te sector. Submission to Congress of a draft water sector law and
prpaton of draft reqgltons for this law is a condition of second trche reles   Enactment
of the wat  sector law, iuance of the regulations, and establishment of the reuoy geny
for the sector is a   dilion of third tranche rels
107.         The Bank has been prvidig technical assistance for water sector reform and
privatizato of Sedapal trough a Japanese grnt for the water sector ($600,000 equivalent) and is
preparg a separate Lima Watetization Project to asist with the needed inv_emes in the

108.         The Govenmen Is committed to privazing al lts holdings by mid-l995 when Its
term expires. Special commtees were appointed in 1992 to prepare and implement more than 30
priatizatlons, Inuluding all the major state entprises. Twelve privazations have been completed
since May 1992, yielding $260 million in cash proceeds, and several additional holdings are slated for
sale in the next few months, including: the petroleum shipping company (Petrolera Transoceanica),
the remaninig Petroperu gas stations, two industrial companies (Cementos iAma, Bayer IndustrW), a
rice tading company (Ecasa), and the remaining ships of the shipping company (CPV).
109.         Over the next two years, the Government expects to privatize its larger, more
complex holdings, including the remaimng mining SOEs (Centromin and Minero Peru, which wiL be
privatized in several units), the telecom holdings (Entel and CPT), the oil company (Petroperu), the
major fish processing company (Pescaperu), the major electricity SOEs (Electrolima, Electrpero), the
Lima water company (EDAPAL), the steel company (Siderperu), the pulp and paper company
(Paramonga), and the remaining state-owned banks (Continental, lnterbanc, lipotecario, Banco Sur
Medio y Callao, Banco Nor-Peru, Banco Amazonico, and Banco de los Andes). Special privatization
commie  have been appointed for all these holdings and technical preparatory work is well
underway. These privatizations ae expected to require a longer preparatory period to address policy
and regulatory issues and/or sensitive labor and political issues.
110.         This operation wEil support the implemention of prvtizaion in mining,
hydrocarbo, and telecommunications, as well as selected holdings in alr/urban transport, industry,
fisheries and water (where privatization initiatives are already undeway). Ihi agenda includes 25
SOEs with total assets of $ 4.135 billon (1991 book value). Two-thirds of this total ($2.779
billion) are in minng (28% - $1,182 million), hydrocarbons (22% - $908 milion) and
telecmmunications (17% - $689 million), and six companies in these three sectors (Cenromin,
Hierro Peru, Minero Peru, Petroperu, Entel, CPT) account for vitualy al of this amount ($2.622
billion or 63% of the total agenda under this operation). Other major companies on the agenda
include Siderper (steel), Paramonga (pulp/paper), Pescaperm (fish processing), Aeroper (national
airline), and Sedapat (Lima water). The privation agenda of SOE companies (and their 1991 asset
values) to be covered under this operation were agreed during loan negotations. Excluding the
electricity SOEs (which together account for an additional $4 billion in assets and are being covered
under a separate power sector operation), these holdings account for more than 90 per cent of all SOE
assets.
111.         In the case of hydrocarbons, the privadzation of Petopeu has commenced with
selected downstream actdvities (gas stations, liquified gas distrtion petroleum shipping). The
Govermet is committed to privazing all of Petroperu by end-1994. Given the size and complexity
of Peoper's remaning upstream and downstream operations, COPM2 has recently hired external
cOnultan to assess in greater detail the structr opdons (i.e. how to break it up) and sequencing
for the privatization of Petrperu, consistent with the overall timetable to have the company fully
privatized by end-1994. Ihis study will be finalized by mid-1993 and prvide the basis for preparing
a detaed implementaton plan for privatization of Petroperu.
112.         The proposed tranche release condtions are structured to reflect the privatizaon
agenda and expected phasing of the program, while ensuring sustined commiment and progress in
privaFzaion of companies in the economically important sectors of minig, hydrcarons, and
telecommunications. Given that the Government has started with smaller holdings and will move to



26
larger, More complex prvaizios, the tanches have progreivdy hlgher (cumulative) target.
Rather than specifying ndividual companies, the tanche condios ae based n the toal amount of
assets being offred for sale and pivaized from the agreed agenda. Ibis reflects two bct: (a) in
many cases (e.g. mining, petroleum), the companies wl be broken up into several units and sold by
unlt and (b) it is difficulit to frecast te precise tming e oprivaon of specfic
companies, as etnal ftors beyond govemens control may hamper act  sales.
113.         Based on these principles, the conditdons of send trane readse are (a) offer for
sale of at leas $450 mlon In assets from  heb prlvat on ageda, with a minimum of $275
miDlion In assets from two of the th" sectors of mni  oga byd, and
teleconmuniationsIV; and (b) preparaton of an Implemeti  plan and timetable for the
privatizton o Petroperu. On the basis of the implenton plan fo Petoperu, the Bank and the
Govenment will agree on the assets of Petpero to be offered fo sale by third tranche. Mme
condidon of third tranche relase Is: offer for sale of at least $1,2  milion (cumulative) In
assets from the privatization sgda, with: (a) a minmm of $300 mlon in assets of companies
from mgh of the minig and tlecemmuniatons sectos; and (b) assets fhrm Petroper. In
accordance with the agreed Implemenion plan and timetabli
114.         Acmievement of the tache condition (i.e. *offered for salea) will require completion
of the techical studies, Isanc of the bidding docmens, and carying out the public bWding
process for sale of the assets or shares. The third tranhe target represens rouhy 30 per cent of
total assets on the agenda. Based on inrnationa pdvatzation exeience, this is an ambitious target
115.         As the primary objective of the Loa is to complete the privaizatin of SOEs (not just
offering for sale), the Loan wil also include, as a condition of the thd  tranche release, the transfer
to the private sector of at least $600 millon in assets included In the privatzation agenda.  he
condition, as proposed, does not require the sale of any speific company, and t oe   wil not
influence the biddng process nor force the Govenment to rush or accept hipproprate trnactions.
It does recognize, however, tha unless a signficant proporton of the companies offered for sale are
subsequendy sold, the program wfll lose credibility and hence susainabity.
116.         For putposes of assessing the Government's progress vis-a-vu th tranche rlease
targets, asset value will be measured in terms of the 191 book value of total assets (on a revaued
basis) for companies on the agreed agenda that are privaized or liqiated  Where a cmpany is
privized in segments, only those segments of the compas tal assets will be counted towards the
etandie release targets. Ihese figures do not necearily reflect the maet vae, nor expected sales
price. However, as neither the valuations, nor sales (or base) prices are nown at this time, they
provide the only available benhmak for purposes of establishing tache release tagets. Moreover,
the figures reflect, to some degree, the historical impoance of the paricular SOEs. Only
prlvatzations of companies on the aged agenda will be counted towads the tranche release targets.
117.         To ensure trsparency and conistancy in the impleme    process, COPRI has
issued ope al guidles to all specia pdvazaon           s, settDg out the process to be
followed by the com_m    concernig: public anno      of compaies or assets to be
privatzed; suane of preiminary and final bidding documents; communicaton with interested
bidders; valuation and prcin,g (including the proes for setting ad announcing the base price);
public bidding; employee paricipation; and the use of consultants. In the Policy Letter for this
operation (amex  o), the Government has noted that COPRI and the spe    committee Wi llow
IV By March 1, 1993, $300 milion had been offered for sa  frm the Privatation Agenda,
including $210 fiom mini  and hydrocarbons. Of these  s, $2  nmilion in asset (ook value)
fom the Agenda had been  aserred to the private sector.

ihese guidelines, under the framework of Privatization Law 674, In implmmntg the pratzato
program  For a company to be eligible for conideraton toward the triche releas tages for
privatizadon, the Bank will review the privatization process for the company to esr that Iis In
accordance with the Privatiaon Law (DL 674) and consistent with the opeaonal guidelines issued
by COPM  to the Specal Commiees and with the principles set out in the Poc Letter.
D.        Imn
118.         The prvatizaon program is expected to have a posiive net fiscal Impact over both
the short and medium term  The positive impact wil be due to: (a) diminaton of tansfers and
govrnnme-guaranteed loans to SOBs to cover operating losses and capitalpexpel (SOB losses
peaked at $530 million in 1989); (b) higher tax revenue as a result of hnrased profits of prvaized
companies; and (c) proceeds from the sale of SOEs. At this stage, it is difficut to forecast sales
prices and the dming of the sales. Government officials are tentatvely foasig gross pdvazation
proceeds of roughly $1.2 - 1.5 bilion annually in 1993 and 1994.
119.         There will be short-term costs in the pnvatizaon progm  associated with severance
payments for SOB workforce reductions, but these costs are expected to be substantally bdow the
proceeds of privazation. There have been rougbly 10,000 SOB layoffs over the past two years as
part of a cost reducdon program. The costs of these layoffs ($66 million, or $6600/worker) have
been financed by SOE intnal funds, loans from Banco de la Nacion, and cental budget transfers. It
Is apected that frher reductions of approximately 15,000 employees wi be implmented by SOEs
prior lo their privatzaton. Payments to displaced workers will be limited primarily to cnactal
obligadons for social benefit. While the legal obligation for payment of these social benefit lies
with the SOEs (not the Govermment), the Government will monitor this process closely to ensure that
all efforts are being made to meet these obligations. Under this operation, the Bank will review the
implementation and fiancing of workforce reductions, as part of the   k's general rmiew, prior to
scond and third tranche release, of overaU progress in implementig the refiom program set out in
the Policy Letter.
120.         While some goveanment-guaranteed SOE debts may have to be assumed in the
privazation process, this is not expected to have a cashflow impact on the Government, sine the
Govemet is already responsible for servicing this debt under its sovereign debt rescheduling
agreements. In some cases, formal creditor waivers are required to enable the companies to be
privadzed. Discussions wi creditors are being handled as part of the Government's ongoing
discussions with the commercial banks on Peru's overall external debt.
121.         To date, all prvatizaions have been cash transactions.  he Governmeat is
considering the possible use of debt/equity swaps for privatization in order to attract additional
potential bidders. This would enable strong tecbhical fitms, which might lak adequat financing to
participate in the bidding, to combine with financial institutions seeking to reduce their debt exposure
in Peru. If the Goverment does decide to use some form of debt/equity swaps, they wi be: (a)
used selectively on a case-by-case basis; (b) combined with a minimum cash payment; and (c) limited
to identical debt Istumen  in order to facilitate comparison of bids.

122.         Apart from the genera SOE labor reductions, some communities, which are
dedet on one or two major SOB employers, may be particlady adversely affected by workore
reducdons. Examples include: Parmonga, Chimbote (Siderperu and Pescpeu), and the mining
communides (e.g. Marcona, La Oroya). Hierro Peru (iro ore compay) has implemented a progam
in Marcona whereby displaced employees, in addition to reein severance pay, bhav been provided
with counselling on investment and employment oppornites, n-house vocaona trning, and

advice on setting up micro-entrises. The program also included the subcontauing of some SOE
on-core acttie to dismissed workers. As well, social sevices, previously provided by Hierro
Peru, have bee transfered to other public agencies. Othe SOEs which are most likely to be
affcted aamonga, Cenrmin, and Siderperu) are in the process of developing similar programs.
The UNDP and the Bank, through the Pvaizatio Technical Assistance Loan, are providing
financia assista   in developing these programs. The Bank wil assess the Government's progress in
Implementing these measures as part of the general review by the Bank, prior to second and third
trche release, of overall progress in implementing the reform program set out in the Policy Letter.
123.         In addion to these measures, a portion of the privatzation proceeds are being
allocated to small community projects throughout Peru. COPRI recendy approved 80 community
projects, ranging from $50,000-150,000 to be finaced from privaization proceeds. Promotional
Informaton will specifically tie the fimding of each project to privaization.  his will help alleviate
poverty and build support for privatization.
F.  nrIal Aspgo
124.         Some of the enterprises being privadzed, particularly in the minigg sector, have
environmental problems. Potential Investors are seeking clarification from the Goverment
concering the scope of the problems and the environmena standards and enforcement measures to
be applied. To address these concerns, the Goverment is carying out environmental sudits, where
necessary, as part of the technical preparation for privatiztion. These audis will specidy: the extent
of environmental problems; the estmated cost of cleaning up past problems and of improving
operations to comply with environment standards. On the basis of the environmental audits, the
Governm  will clarif for potential invests their envirmenl responsibilities (if any) with
respect to cleanup of existing pollution. In all cases, privadzed firms will be subject to the same
eronmental lawS and standards as other companies. Adherence to these policies/procedures will be
monitored by the Bank, as part of its review of the privaizaton process and bidding/sales documents
for individua privatzations, prior to counting the company towards the tranche release targets for
privatzation.
125.         The environmental audts for the mining companies will be fimanced by the Baks
Prvadzaton Technical Assistance Loan, as well as a recently approved Japanese grant ($2.2. million
equivalent) for the preparation of a Mining Sector Environmental Project. The Japanese grant will
also finance technical assistance to develop guides/procedures for environmental aPessments. A
proposed mining sector environmental project is being prepared to help fince cleanup of past
environmenta damage at Centromin and  Mo   Peru. In additon to these projects, a proposed
Energy and Mining TA Loan will finance tecical assistance to strengthen the environmental policy
and reguory fmework and the Environmental Directorate wihin the Ministry of Energy and
Mines. The Energy and Mining TA project will also support, on a pilot basis, a system for
monitoring air, water and soil quality, focusing on specific problem locations such as Centromin's La
Oya refinery.

126.         Ihe $250 million loan would be diused in three tranches of $75 million, $75
million, and $100 milion. The fis tranche would be disbursed on effectiveness and the other
tranches upon fulfillment of specific conditions for tranche release. Ihe Policy Matix (annex 1)
summarzes the reform program to be supported by the Loan, including the actons taken to date, the
pecific tranche conditions (marked with an asteris), as well as other reforms which are ipoaed
In dte Policy Letter signed by the Government.



29
B.   olicy Letr
127.         The Policy Letter signed by the Government (annex El) sets out the reform program
being implemented under the proposed loan, including the program objectives and rationale, and
major actions to be carried out. Prior to second and third tranche release, the Government will
submit to the Bank a report on the overall progress in implementing the reform program set out in the
Policy Letter. The Bank will review the overall progress to ensure that it is satisfactory, prior to
second and third tranche release.
C. Loan Conditions
128.  The loan conditions are summarized below:
Condition of Effectiveness
Maintenance of a macroeconomic policy framework and a financing plan consistent with the
objectives of the reform program.
Conditions of Second Tranche
(1)    Maintenance of a macroeconomic policy framework and a financing plan consiste-$ with the
objectives of the reform program.
(2)    Submission to Congress of a draft law on hydrocarbons and a draft law establishing the tax
regime for petroleum products, and preparation of draft regulations for these laws.
(3)   Issuance of the regulations for the Mining Law.

telecommunications sector.
(5)    Submission to Congress of a draft water sector law and preparation of draft regulations for the
law.
(6)    Submission to Congress of a draft fisheries law and preparation of draft regulations
establishing the new fisheries resource management regime.
(7)    Offer for sale of at least $450 million in assets from the privatization agenda, with a minimum

30
(3)   Implementation of the competition regime, tariff structure and privatization plan for the
telecommunications sector, and issuance of regulations for the Telecommunications Law with
respect to: (a) the operation of the new regulatory agency; (b) the major classes of service; (c)
the process and methodology for setting tariffs; and (d) the process for granting of

implementation plan and timetable.
(7)    Actual sale to the private sector of at least $600 million in assets from the privatization
agenda.
D. Monitoring and Reporting
129.         As noted above, prior to second and third tranche release, the Government will submit
to the Bank a report on the overall progress in implementing the reform program set out in the Policy
Letter. In addition, the COPRI secretariat will submit to the Bank a semi-annual report on the results
of the privatization/regulatory reform program and an updated implementation timetable.
E. Technical Assistance
130.         Given the scope of the privatization program and the technical work required to
develop sectoral regulatory frameworks, substantial technical assistance is necessary to ensure
adequate preparation and implementation of the program. Considerable consulting assistance has
already been contracted and is being financed through SOEs' internal funds and bilateral/multilateral
grants. The $30 million Privatization Technical Assistance Loan, approved in December 1992, will
provide continued financing for consulting services for the preparation and implementation of the
privatization program and for the drafting of new sectoral laws and regulations.
F. Procurement, Disbursement, Audit. and Administration
131.         The proposed loan would finance 100 per cent of the c.i.f. costs of general imports
not contained in a negative list. Ineligible imports include: goods financed by other Bank loans or
loans from official multi- or bilateral sources; alcohol, tobacco, luxury and environmentally hazardous
goods; and goods intended for military use. Retroactive financing in the amount of $50 million (20
per cent of the loan amount) would be available to fimance eligible expenditures incurred after
September 30, 1992.
132.         A Country Procurement Assessment Report prepared by the Bank in September 1991
noted that the laws and decrees governing the procurement procedures followed by both public and
private sector importers were in broad conformity with the World Bank's Procurement Guidelines. In
addition, the annual budget law provides that goods and works financed by international financial
institutions will be procured in accordance with the requirements of these institutions.



31
133.         Trade policy reform since August 1990 - the wholesale reduction of tariff and non-
tariff barriers, the elimination of fiscal privileges, the removal of controls on foreign-exchange
transactions, and the beginning of customs reforms - has immeasurably strengthened the competitive
environment in which private purchasing decisions are made.
134.        In view of these reforms, the following procurement procedures would apply:
i.   Contracts for the procurement of imports made by public and private importers valued at
or exceeding $5.0 million would be procured under simplified ICB procedures in
accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines. Imports of petroleum products and
commodities such as -)ieat, corn, sugar, etc., would be purchased under competitive
procedures acceptable to the Bank. In addition, direct contracting would be acceptable if
it is in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 3.5 of the Procurement Guidelines.
Contracts below $5,000 would not be eligible for Bank financing.
Hi.  Public sector imports valued at below $5.0 million and above $5,000 would be procured
in accordance with local norms which have been assessed as acceptable to the Bank in the
Country Procurement Assessment Report of September 1991.
iii.  Import contracts by private importers below $5.0 million and above $5,000 would be
awarded in accordance with established commercial practices, which are acceptable to the
Bank. These practices generally consist of inviting more than one quotation, except for
importers of small amounts of consumer goods, who generally buy from traditional
sources using direct negotiation.
135.           Disbursements for contracts under $5.0 million would be made against Statements
of Expenditure, for which the customs certificate documentation would be kept locally for supervision
by the Bank staff in the field and for auditors whose terms of reference for auditing would be
acceptable to the Bank.
136.           The Ministry of Economy and Finance would administer the loan and be
responsible for submitting the relevant documentation for disbursement. A Coordinating Unit has
been established within the Ministry to ensure compliance with loan conditions, prepare disbursement
requests and fulfill reporting requirements to the Bank, for the three prior adjustment loans. This
Coordnating Unit will have similar responsibilities for this operation.
137.           To assist in the preparation of disbursement requests for the three prior adjustment
operations, the Ministry and the Central Bank created, in conjunction with the Customs
Administration, a Special Procurement Unit responsible for the collection of relevant procurement
documentation, ensuring that only eligible and correctly procured imports are included in withdrawal
applications. This unit will carry out the same tasks for this operation. Documentation would be
retained for review, as required, by the Bank and the project auditors.
G. Benerits and Risks
138.           The program to be supported by the Loan is expected to have major benefits: (a)
improved fiscal performance through elimination of the recurring SOE fiscal burden; (b) restored
private sector confidence in the economy and in the Government's commitment and ability to reduce
the public sector and implement the reform program; (c) increased private investment, thereby
speeding up economic recovery and alleviating Peru's unemployment/underemployment problem; and
(d) increased economic efficiency due to the implementation of sectoral policy/regulatory reforms
together with privatization.



32
139.           Ihere are two main risks. One risk is that domestic pressures will result in some
backsliding or deviations in the Government's macroeconomic and structural reform program, thereby
undermining economic recovery. In this regard, the Government has maintained sound
macroeconomic policies/performance since taking office in August 1990, and has agreed with the
Bank and the IMF on a macroeconomic program and external financing plan for 1993-95, to be
supported by, inter alia, this operation and an EFF. Maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic
program and external financing plan is a condition of effectiveness, second and third tranche release
for this operation.
140.           A second risk is that privatization will get delayed as a result of domestic political
opposition or foreign investor reluctance to invest in Peru at this time, given the fragility of the
political and economic situation. Ihis risk has diminished markedly over the last year with the initial
success of the privatization program and the opening of the economy. The Government has also
launched a public information program within Peru to strengthen public support and understanding of
the privatization program. It is also financing a number of community projects from the proceeds of
privatization. This winl help alleviate poverty, while building support for privatization. The
Government is also developing promotional campaigns for investors abroad to explain the
Government's program and privatization/investment opportunities in Peru. The informational and
promotional programs are being financed, in part, by the Privatization TA Loan. The recent
congressional and municipal elections are also expected to increase investor confidence in Peru.
V.
141.           I am satisfied that the loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement, and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

The projections illustrate a feasible path for the economy under
the stabilization and structural reforms initiated by the Fujimori Government.
The koy country assumptions behind the forecasts are as followas
1.   gross Domestic Product (CDP) declined 3.0 per cent during 1992.
However, starting in 1993 GDP should growth at a rate of about 3.5
per cent, increasing steadily to reach 6.0 per cent in 2000 (an
average of 5.4 per cent for the period).
2.   Population is assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent a year up to 1991,
declining to 2.2 per cent by 1997.
3.   Exports of goods and non-factor services are expected, because of
the trade reforms, to be a major contributor to GDP growth. After
an initial decline of 0.7 per cent in 1992, reflecting the
appreciation of the real exchange rate, export growth will recover
by about 2.0 per cent during 1993. Between 1993 and 2000 exports
are assumed to grow at an average of 8.7 per cent per year,
increasing their share in GDP from 8.5 per cent in 1992 to about
17.6 per cent in 2000.
4.   Imports of goods and non-factor services are assumed to grow at an
average of about 6.9 per cent between 1993 and 2000, to reach a
level of 19.7 per cent of GDP in 2000 (up from 11.6 per cent in
1991).
5.   The ratio of investment to GDP is expected to increase from 15.5
per cent in 1992 to about 19.4 per cent in 2000, with an average
ratio of 18.1 per cent during this period, a level comparable to
other middle-income economies. During the same period, public gross
capital formation would rise to 4.S per cent of GDP from 3.5 per
cent.
6.   Between 1993 and 2000, growth of GDP would result in a growth Gin
consumption of 3.7 per cent a year, consistent with an average
level of total consumption of 84.7 per cent of GDP. This expected
growth would be enough to allow an increase in per capita
consumption from 1994 onwards.
7.   For the period as a whole, these trends would result in an increase
in domestic savings from 13.6 per cent to 17.3 per cent of GDP.
Similarly, national savings, because of the increasing level of
investment and improvements in the current account, would increase
to 15.2 per cent from 10.6 per cent of GDP.
8.   Increases in Gross Reserves are estimated targets for increases in
Central Bank reserves.
9.  Loan Disbursements s estimated disbursoments already in the
pipeline and expected new disbursements from the IDB, bilateral
creditors, and unguaranteed private creditors.
10 Direct foreign investment assumes long time delayed investments in
gas and oil projects will take place.
11. Debt Rescheduling and Deferral: in 1991 and 1992 all official
bilateral debt is assumed to be rescheduled on the terms secured in
the September 1991 Paris Club negotiations (see below). In 1993
and beyond, pre-cutoff debt service due to the Paris Club of
creditors is assumed to be rescheduled. Other official bilateral

debt is assumed to be serviced. Private debt service is assumed to
be rescheduled every year for 1993-2000 with the exception of
symbolic interest payments. Starting in 1993, these payments will
be 5 per cent of accrued interest.
The terms of the September 1991 Paris Club agreement are as
follows.

PERU
PRIVATIZATION ADJU             LOAN
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President,
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Preston:
This Policy Letter sets out the Government's medium-term program for privaization and
related sectoral legal, policy and regulatory reforms, to be implemented under the Privatization
Adjustment Loan. This progrm is an integral part of the Government's overall development
strategy, which is aimed at liberalizing the economy and enhancing responsiveness to market forces.
A. 
Upon taking office in August 1990, the new Goverment launched a major reform
program to correct fundamental problems in Peru's economy. Key elements of this initial reform
package involved trade, price and exchange rate liberalization, together with fiscal and monetary
measures to reduce the deficit and inflation. These measures have resulted in substantia improvement
In major economic Indicators. The rate of inlation fel from 7640% in 1990 to 139% in 1991, and
fiuther declined to 56% in 1992. Fiscal performance has also Improved sharply: public sector
borrowing requement fell from 6.4% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 1991 and to 2.5% in 1992. Ihere
was no domestic financing of the Consolidated Public Sector Balance. Also, tax collections rose from
7.4% in 1990 to 8.4% of GDP in 1991 and to 9.3% in 1992.
B.   Qter Struc  Regn
A second stage of policy reform began when the Initial economic measures were
supported by a series of broad-based structura reforms, commencing in March 1991. These
measures were aimed at further strengthening fiscal adjustment, promoting domestic and exten
competitiveness, and deregulatng economic activity to promote private sector investment. Key
refrms implemented in 1991 included: (a) reorganizion of the tax adminion office,
simplification of the tax structure, and elimination of taxes on exports; (b) major adjustments in utility
prices and eldiination of wage indexion in public enterprises; (c) elkrination of remg  nongtariff
barriers and adoption of a two-tier tariff system (15% and 25%); (d) elimination of most entry/exit
restrictions and monopoly rights of state-owned companies; (e) enactment of a new banking law,
s ening of prudtial regulations, and openimg of commercial banking to foreign investment; (f)
amendment of the labor stability laws to broaden provisions for layoffs and temporary employment;
(g) liberalization of foreign investment legislation to pe foreign investors to remit abroad all net
profts and royalties and to invest under any corporate form or joint venture; and (h) expanding and
strenghening of land property rights.
Ihe Goverment is commited to maintinig and deepening, where neesary, the
reform program. Ihe Govement intends to continue the macroeconomic policies and program
launched In late 1990. We are presenly working with the mulilateal agencies and the Support
Grm  at put  in place a medium-term macroeconomic progrm and financing plan. Once agreed,
m_aoecnomic performance will be monitored in 1993-94 on the basis of the agreed program and

In addition to economy-wide reforms, the Govemment is implementing new policy, leg
and regulatry reforms in all sectors to promote competition and private Investment and to faciui
privaization. Priority has been given to those sectors with greatest economic potential (e.g.
hydrocarbons, mining, fishenes) or which provide essential public services (e.g. water,
telcommunications, electicity). Major sectoral retorms to date, and the agenda of further measures
to be implemented under the Privatization Adjustment Loan, are summaized below.
Hydrocarbons. Despite its potential, the hydrocarbons sector's perforance
deteriorated sharply through the 1980s, as Peru became a net petroleum importer. Many of the
problems stemmed from the heavily controlled policy environment and the monopoly position held by
Petroperu. iTis Governmentes objectives are to deregulate the sector, encourage private investment,
and privatize Petperu and its subsidiaies. Measures taken to date include: (a) issuane of a 1991
decree eliminating Petroperu's downstream monopoly and modifying procedures to facilitate
coning out of exploration/ development to the private sector; (b) issuance of a decree deregulating
pstroleum product prices; and (c) preparation of a draft hydrocarbons law, which would fuly
ibelze the sector and transfer the policy/regulatory functions from Petroperu to the Govenment
Mhis law is currently being finalized and we expect to enact it, and the associated regulations, during
1993. A new taxv regime for petroleum products, combiing an excise tax with a vaue-added tax
(wonsistent with the economy-wide VAT) is being developed and will be implemented during 1993. In
parlel with these reforms, we will transfer Petroperu's policy/regulatory functions to the
Government during 1993, and we intend to privatize Petroperu and its subsidiaies over the next 24
monts, in a nminer that will ensure fill and effective competiion in all petroleum actes and
prices. We will also maintain on a contimous basis price deregulaton for all products In the sector.
ing. The Goverment has enacted a series of measures to deregulate mining (which
accounts for 5% of GDP and 45% of merchadise export) and open the sector to private invesmen
These measures include: (a) issuance of a decree in July 1991 authrizing private sector ownehip of
a minimum of 51% of the major goverment holdings (Centrmn, Hierro Peru and Minero Peru); (b)
release, for private sector exploration, of more than two milion hectares of land previously reserved
for the state companies; (c) ination of the reorganization and streamliing of the sector agncies to
facilitate granting concessions for private exploration/development; and (d) enactmt in November
1991 of a new Mining Law (Decree 708) which: 'stablished transparent rules for graning concessions
for exploration and exploitation of minerals and metals; ensure miniW companies the right to remit
profits, free access to foreign exchamge and the right to feely market their production, both abroad
and localy. Regulations for the law are cumentiy being prepared and we expect these to be issued by
March 1993.
Tdeleommunlcatlons. Telecommunications service is underdeveloped in Peru. Tae
lack of svice reflects several fictors: prior k --1 restrictiDons on prie and for   investnt;
erosion of real tariffs from 1980-90; and the sector organizaon and revenue-haring arrgements
between Ent and CPT. To address these problems, the new Governmet hiroduced a mnuber of
reforms. Telephone rates were inrased by 1000% in August 1990 and have been pedodicaly
adjusted since then. In November 1991, a new Telecommunications Law was enacted, establishing a
liberalized framework to pr  compettion and private (Imcluding forgn) investmen  The Law
also steamlnes the existing reguatory agency, consistent with liblization of the sector.
Futher reforms are necessary to improve and implement the new regime. Revisions to
the cufrent service and revenue-sharing arangements between Entel and CPT a  required to ensure
concy with the sector's liberalization, and to facilitate privazation of the Govemen's
holdings. Adjusment of the tariff structure is also requred to reduce iternational rates to ecomic



SO A50N
levels. As next steps in the process, the Government will, by April 1993, prepare a new competition
regime, tariff structure and privatization plan for the telecom sector. We intend to implement these
reforms during 1993-94, as part of the process of privatizing the Government's holdings in the sector.
We will also, during 1993, issue regulations for the Telecommunicons Law, pertaining to the new
regulatory agency, the various classes of telecom service, the tariff-setting process/methodology, and
granting of concessions.
Flsheries. Fisheries is a key sector, contributing roughly $500 million annually in
export earnings (15% of total Peruvian exports). Anchovy and sardines account for 90% of fishmeal
and fish-oil production. However, there is a serious over-fishing problem in both species due to the
absence of an effective fisheries resources management regime. To ensure biological sustainability as
well as to help optimize economic benefits for the country, we will enact during 1993 a new fisheries
law and fisheries resource management regime. We will also reorganize the sector agencies during
1993, consistent with the new legal and regulatory framework.
Water. The water sector, particularly in Lima, has serious problems, including
shortages (there is currenly rationing), inadequate access to clean water (over 30% of Lima residents
are not connected to the distribution system), poor water quality, with related health problems, and
inadequate access to safe sanitation (50% of Lima residents have access to safe sanitation). The
Government is implemening a number of reforms: (a) rates were increased 100% in August 1990 and
have been periodically adjusted since; (b) a special privatization committee was appointed in May
1992 for privatizing the Lima company (Sedapal) and technical preparatory work is well underway;
and (c) a new water sector law and water resources management regime are being developed to
ensure adequate water quality and access to service, and to foster private sector participation. This
will also entail the establishment of an autonomous regulatory agency for the sector. The
Govermment expects to enact the new water sector law and reguladons, and implement a new tariff-
setting process and methodology, during 1993, in parallel with the privatization of Sedapal.
D.        tization
Background. Privatization Is a cornerstone of this Government's structral reform
program. A large-scale privatizadon program is essential to reverse two decades of statist
development policies. Under previous governments, the number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
increased from 29 in 1968 to 177 by 1990. This development strateg failed. SOE losses and debts
escalated in the second half of the 1980s, as successive governments sought to contain inflationary
pressures by controlling prices of SOE goods/services. Immediately upon taking office, the new
Government implemented significant price increases in key public services to arrest the financial
deterioration of major SOEs. In parallel, trade liberalization and competition reforms were enacted,
which exposed SOEs to market forces.
Objectlves/Framework. In mid-1991, in a second phase of strucural reforms, the
Government decided to launch a large-scale privatization program with the objective of privatizing all
holdings by mid-1995. Decree Law 674 was enacted in September 1991, setting out the legal and
institutional framework for a broad privatization program. Ihe decree set up an iter-ministerial
commission (COPRI), under the direct supervision of the President, to oversee the privatization
program. The technical preparatory work is to be carried out in a decentralized manner by special
committees which are designated by COPRI for either one or a group of SOEs.
A small technical secretariat to support COPRI was established in February 1992. As
well, more than 30 special committees have been appointed to prepare/implement individual
privatizations; these commitees are now fully operational. COPRI has established a process for



S1                                ANNEX M
special committee reporting. Under this proces, privzatlon plas prepared by the special
committ have been approved by COPRI for roughly 20 SOEs.
Agenda. Since late May, eleven privutizations have been completed (yielding US$250
million), including holdings in mining (Hierto Peru, Minera Condestable, Minpeco USA, and
Quellaveco), banking (Banco de Comercio), chemicals (Quimpac), ship repair (lasa), transport
(Aeroperu and Enatru), and hydrocarbons (Solgas and 78 of Petopeu's 82 gas stations). Over the
next four months, we expect to offer for sale several other holdings, Including: the petroleum
shipping company (Petrolera Transoceanica), the remaining Petroperu gas stai, hree indusrial
companies (Cementos Lima, Reactivos Nac6onales, Bayer Indus ), a rice trding company (Ecasa),
and the remaining ships of the shipping company (CPV).
In 1993-94, the Governm  epects to pvaze I larger, more complex holdings,
including the remaining mining SOEs (Cenuomin and Minero Peru, which wil be privaized in
severai units), the telecom holdings (Entel and CP7), the oil company (Pe,roperu) the major fish
processing company (Pescaperu), the major elecicity SOEs (Electrolima, Electroperu), the Lima
water company (SEDAPAL), the steel company (Sideperu), the pulp and paper company
(Paramonga), and the remaining stateowned banks. Special privatization committees have been
appointed for all these holdings and preliminuy technical work is well underway. These
privazations are exet  to require a longer preparatory period to address policy and regulatory
issues and/or sensitive labor and political issues.
Operational Guidelnes. To ensure coordinaton and consisency In the overall
program, COPRI has issued detailed guidelines to the special commite  setig out the process to be
followed in preparing and implementng all privons.  hese guidines set out the process for,
inter alia:
-    designation by COPRI of SOEs to be privatized;
-    establishment of special commite;
preparation of the special committee work programs and budgets;
preparation of privatization plans by the special committees;
-    technical preparatory studies to be undertaken (audit, valuadon, lega opinion) and the
procedures for hiring consultants and hvestment banks;
-    public announcemets and promotional cmpaigns;
-    process and criteria for pre-qualification of bidders (where appropriate);
-    the format and content of biig docmen;
-    determining the base price for the public bidding;
-    the sales methods and process; and
-    employee pardcipaion.



52                                 ANNEX m
Under the framework of the Privatizadon Law (DL 674), COPRI and the special
committees will follow these guidelines in implementing the privatization program. This will also
ensure that the process is fully transparent and that each company will initially be offered for sale
through a public bidding process. In addition to setting out detailed procedures to be followed by the
special committees in preparing and implementing privatizations, the guidelines specify that: (a) only
minimal essential investments should be undertaken in SOEs to be privatized; any restructuring should
be limited to workforce and cost reductions and settlement of debts with the Government or
government-owned entities; and (b) no monopoly protection or privileges should be granted to the
new owners; in cases where there are natural monopoly aspects, the concessions for the private
operators should be designed to increase competition to the extent possible.
Social Impact. As part of a cost reduction program, SOEs have reduced their
workforce by roughly 10,000 workers over the last two years. It is expected that further reductions
of approximately 15,000 employees will be implemented by SOEs prior to their privatization.
Payments to displaced workers will be limited primarily to contractual obligations for social benefits.
The legal obligation for payment of these social benefits lies with the SOEs, not the Government.
Nevertheless, we will monitor this process closely to ensure that all efforts are being made to meet
these obligations.
The impact of labor reductions may be particularly adverse in communities where SOEs
are the major employer (e.g. Hierro Peru in San Juan de Marcona, Siderperu in Chimbote, Centromin
in La Oroya). Hierro Peru has implemented a program whereby displaced employees, in addition to
receiving severance pay, have been provided with counselling on investment and employment
opportunities, in-house vocational training, and advice on setting up micro-enterprises. The program
also facilitates the subcontracting of some SOE non-core activities to dismissed workers. As well,
social services, previously provided by Hierro Peru, have been transferred to other public agencies.
Given the apparent success to date of this program, we will work with other SOEs, where SOE
workforce reductions may adversely affect the communities, to develop and implement similar
programs. We expect that UNDP and the World Bank, through the Privatization Technical
Assistance Loan, will provide financial assistance in developing these programs.
Environmental Impact. Some of the enterprises being privatized, particularly in the
mining sector, have environmental problems. Potential investors are seeking clarification from the
Goverment concerning the scope of the problems and the environmental standards and enforcement
measures to be applied. To address these concerns, the Government is carrying out environmental
audits, where necessary, as part of the technical preparation for privatization. These audits will
specify: the extent of environmental problems; the estimated cost of cleaning up past problems and of
improving operations to comply with environmental standards. On the basis of the environmental
audits, the Government will clarify for potential investors their environmental responsibilities (if any).
In all cases, privatized firms will be subject to the same environmental laws and standards as other
companies.

PRIVATIZATION ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Sectoral lRegulator Reforms and Privatization
A. Mining
Backrund
1.       The mining sector is one of the main components of the Peruvian economy, contributing
5% of GDP and 45% of total merchandise exports. The sector's poor performance in recent years
had a significant impact on the overall economy. The three major state-owned mining companies,
Centromin, Hierro Peru, Minero Peru, and their subsidiaries, produce 40% of the lead mined in
Peru, 38% of the zinc, and 100% of the iron ore. The state mining companies are responsible for
40% of total sector output. Production declined by 25% in the second half of the 1980s, during
which time the overall net investment was negative. Inadequate investment inhibited the expansion of
production and exploration as well as the ability to repair and replace equipment. By 1990, the major
state-owned mining companies were operating at an average of 75% of their installed capacity. The
deterioration of the state mining companies was due to several factors, including unfavorable
exchange rates, increasing labor costs and overstaffing, energy shortages and the unreliability of the
power supply, inadequate investment for replacement, and insufficient maintenance of machinery and
equipment.
2.        Centromin, the largest state mining company, was established in 1975 through the
nationalization of the former US-owned Cerro de Pasco Corporation. The operations of Centromin
consist of seven mines - six of which are polymetallic - and one metallurgical complex at La Oroya.
In 1991, Centromin was operating at 20-25% below production capacity and reporting losses of up to
US$ 1 - 2 million per month.
3.       Hierro Peru, an iron ore company, was obtained by the Government of Peru in 1975
through nationalization of the former US-owned Marcona Company. Although the financial
performance of Hierro Peru has been poor in recent years, the company was successful before
nationalization and continues to have profit potential.
4.        Minero Peru was established by the Government in 1970 as the vehicle for new mining
development and was granted the right to mineral deposits in the reserved areas. Its main operations
include the Cerro Verde copper mine, the copper refinery of Ilo, and the zinc refinery of
Cajamarquilla. The operating condition of Minero Peru has deteriorated over the last five years, with
only the Ilo copper refinery having maintained 1985 production capacity. The Cerro Verde mine
production decreased by 60 percent and the Cajamarquilla refinery declined by 20 percent. In
addition to its core operations, Minero Peru owned (until recendy) Minpeco, the trading company for
the state mining companies, and a smaller mining operation, Minera Condestable.
Recent Reforms and Government Strategy
5.       Privatization. Privatization has been moving rapidly in the mining sector. In July 1991,
the Government issued Decree Law 647 authorizing private sector ownership of a minimum of 51%
of the shares in Centromin, Hierro Peru, and Minero Peru. Ihis was followed by Decree 675 in
October 1991 which authorized the privatization of Minpeco. Although Decree 647 was never
ratified, the privatization program continued under Decree Law 674, which established the legal and



54                                 ANHXE
institutional framework for the Goverment's overall privatizadon program. By March 1992, special
commiuees had, been established to manage the privatization of sevea  mining companies, including
Hierro Peru, Centomin, lno Peu and Mimnra Condestable. These committees hired consulting
firms to undertake valuatons, prepare the biddig/sales docments, and assist with sales promotion.
6.        By end-1992, the Govenment had privated four holdings in the mining sector, including
Hierro Peru ($120 million in cash plus $150 million In investent commitments), Minera Condestable
($1.3 million), MinpeO ($4.1 million), and Qudlaveco (an undeveloped mining project belonging to
Minero Peru: $12 million plus $570 million in Investmen com en).
7.        The other major holdins - Centromin and Minero Peru - will be privadzed in 1993/94,
likely in several componens. Valuation are undeway for both companies and investment banks
have been hired to analyze the opto  for breaking up the companies and to assist in the preparation
and execution of the sales. A key issue for potenta Investors, particularly in Centromin, will be its
environmental problems and the respective responsibilities of the new owners and the Govermment for
cleanup of past problems and improvement of opeations to comply wih environmental standards.
Environment audis are being undetaken to asses the problems and provide cost estims for
cleanup and operational impements. Based on these audits, the Government will clarify in the
bidding/sales documents the xtent of the problems and the responsibilities of the new owners (if
any). In all cases, privatized firms will be subject to the same enviromnental laws and standards as
other companies.
8.                      Fraylw or    On November 14, 1991, the Government enacted a new
M ng Law (Decre Law 708 for the Promotion of Private Investment in the Mining Sector).  hs
new minin law guaratee mining companies tax bility and the right to operate under the same
foreign exchange law  offecti  at the time op   started. Concessions will be granted for the
exploration and exploiation of miners and metals. A draw back system will be effective as of
January 1, 1993, allowIng mWing companies to deduct local ae (cluding inect taxes) from their
income taxes. In addition, the law     miing companies the same treatment as other
compaoies rega       th dght to remit profts, fee access to fireln  exchange and free marketing of
production, boh abroad and locally.
9.        Sector hnsttutdons. The sector situtions are presenly under reorganization to reduce
personnel and reorient fucions and responsibities consistent with a lieralized, privatzed sector.
The sector institutions cude: (a) General Mining Directorate: personnel have been reduced and
operations streamlined into two units, the Promon and Devlpment Directorate and the
Fisaization D ireorate; (b)           Directorat: this is a newly creaed unit within the
Mistry, responsible for the forunlation of sectoral enironmental policy and enforcement of
regulton; (c) Public Mining Registry: this has bee stmin o  the two main functions of
hdling the legal asp   incudn registration of all mining rigb, documents, contracts, etc, and of
administtion of concessio; (d) Geological Mning _is : this agency is responsible for
geological surveys, public research,  d technology; it has siplified its structre and reduced
personnd. While  ee cges hv b    significa, fiuher Improvemets  i be required to allow

Further Reforms to be Supported by Xt Loan
10.      In order to ensure the success of the privatization and the continued development of the
sector, issuance of regulations for the Mining Law is a condition of second tranche release.
1B. Hydrocarbons
akgQUond
11.      Peru's oil and gas sector declined sharply during the 1980s. Domestic production
declined from 195,000 baTrels per day (bpd) in 1982 to 110,000 bpd in 1992, and the country shifted
from being a petroleum exporw  to a net importer ($186 million in 1991). Known reserves dropped
by 50% from their peak level in 1982 to 300 million barrels (enough for less than 9 years at current
consumption levels). Investments in exploration and development also declined sharply over the same
period.
12.      The sector has been heavily state-controlled. 'he major state-owned company, Petroperu,
is directly responsible for 36% of Peruvian oil production (40,000 bpd) and for the supervision of the
remaining 64% which is produced by foreign companies under concession agreements with Petroperu.
until 1991, Petroperu had a monopoly on all trade (export and import), transport, storage, refining
and retail distribution of all petroleum products. Many of these activities are carried out by wholly-
owned subsidiaries, including Petromar (operating the ex Belco offshore fields producing 20,000
bpd), Petrolera Transoceanica (oil shipping), Solgas (iquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution, with
40% of the market), and Serpetro (drilling service). Retail istribution is carried out primarily by
private operators under Petroperu franchise. In addition to its dominance in upstream and
downstream activities, Petroperu also carries out many policy/regulatory functions normally handled
by government ministries/agencies in other countries, including: direct negotiaing and signing of all
contracts and concessions with foreign oil companies for exploration/development; and collecing
taxes from private operators on behalf of Government
13.      The sharp decline in the sector was a direct result of an inadequate policy, legal, and
regulatory framework implemented by prior governmn, which precluded competition and private
investment, and controlled product prices below economic levels, thereby contributing to a severe
deterioration in the financial position of Petroperu. Petroperu has negative net worth and accumulated
losses of $2 billion over the three-year period 1989-91, with the result that it has been unable to
finance normal maintenance and exploration expenditures.
Recent Reforms and Government S
14.      Ihe new Government's objectives are to deregulate the sector, encourage competition and
private invesmen, and privatize Petroperu and its subsidiaries. This will require a series of legal,
policy, regulatory and tax reforms, given tha the prior regime reflected Petroperu's monopoly
position in upstream/downstream markets and its role as fiscal agent for the Government in collecting
petroleum product taxes. Several transitional measures have been implemented by the new
Goverment, though full dereguion and competition can only be adcieved through the enac   of
a new hydrocarbons law (under preparation), implementation of a new contractual framework for
exploration/production by private firms, and the privatzatlon of Petroperu.



56                                ANNX IV
15.      The transitional measures taken to date include: (a) issuance of a decree in 1991
eliminating Petroperu's monopoly on downstream activities (importing, refining, storage,
transportation, distribution) and modifying procedures to facilitate contracting out, to the private
sector, of upstream activities (exploration and production); (b) the new Government increased
domestic petroleum product prices by 3000% in August 1990. Retail prices for 84 octane gasoline
are roughly $2/gallon, though the bulk of this reflects special taxes; ex-refinery prices net of taxes are
actually below international levels (roughly 17% on average at end-1992) for most products; and (c)
issuance of a decree in June 1992 formally deregulating petroleum product prices. However, the
Govermment has maintained de facto control over Petroperu's prices, pending the implementation of
the new legal framework for the sector which will redefine Petroperu's relationship with the
Government.
16.      In parallel with the policy/regulatory reforms, the Government has been implementing the
privatzation of Petroperu's gas stations, a small refinery (Conchan), and four subsidiaries - Petrolera
Transoceanica, Solgas, Serpetro, and Petrolera Transoceanica. Implementation of these privatizations
is underway, through special privatization committees. To date, Solgas and 78 of Petroperu's 82 gas
sions have been sold. Ihe Conchan refinery, Serpetro, Petromar, and Petrolera Transoceanica are
expected to be sold by the end of the first quarter of 1993.
17.      The Government expects to privatize all of Petroperu by end-1994. Given the size and
complexity of Petroperu's remaining upstream and downstream operations, COPRI has recently hired
exal consultants to assess in greater detail the structura options (i.e. how to break it up) and
sequencing for the privaization of Petroperu, consistent with the Government's objective to privatize
aUl of Petroperu by end-1994. Ihis study will be finalized by mid-1993 and provide the basis for
preparing a detailed implentadon plan for privatization of Petroperu.
Further Rers to be Suported by the Loan
18.       iegislation. While the measures taken to date are aimed at deregulation/liberalization, a
new legal framework for the sector is required to complete and implement the sectoral reforms. A
draft of a new hydrocarbons law has been prepared, which would fully liberalize the sector, transfer
the policy/regulatory fumctions from Petroperu to the Government (e.g. the grandng of concessions to
private companies for oil exploration and production), and establish new legal/contramal
arrangements between the Government and petroleum companies. Within the new legal framework,
Petroperu's relations with the Govarnment would be on a fully commercial basis (identical to private
firms), while it is being privadzed. Prices would be fully liberalized. Royalties and concession fees
for exploration and production would be established on an identical basis for private petroleum
companies and Petroperu. Similarly, the existing special consumption taxes on petroleum products
(currently collected from Petroperu) would be progressively replaced by excise taxes and a value-
added tax applied to all downstream products (consistent with the economy-wide VAT). These tax
refomns are necessary in a deregulated/competitive market and would bring petroleum product
taxation in line with the overall tax system, while maintaining fiscal revenues from petroleum
products during the macroeconomic adjustment period.
19.      Given the importance of this new legal famework and tax regime for deregulation,
compeitdn and private investment in the hydrocarbons sector, submission to Congress of a draft law
on hydrocafons and a draft law establishing the tax regime for petroleum products, and preparation
of draft regulations for these laws is a condition of second tranche release. Enactment of the
hydrocarbons law and legislation establishing the tax regime for petroleum products, and issuance of



57                                AN
the regulations for these laws is a condition of third tranche release. (Note: this condition has been
partially fulfilled wit the enactment in December 1992 of legislation establishing the new tax regime
for petroleum products.)
20.      Privadtlon. Preparaion of an implementation plan and timetable for the privatization
of Petroperu is a condition of second tranche release. On the basis of the implementation plan for
Petroperu, the Bank and the Government will agree on the assets of Petroperu to be offered for sale
by third tranche.
C. Telecommunications
21.      Telecommunication service Is very undeveloped in Peru. The country has only 575,000
lines or 2.6 lines per 100 population, compared to 10.2 in Argentina and 9.1 in Venezuela. Demand
for new lines is estimated at 1.1 million, though real unmet demand is likely much higher given the
long waiting period (1 112 years) and high installation cost. Service is provided by two companies:
ENTEL, which is responsible for all regional phone operations (outside Lima), as well as long
distae and inernational service; and CPT, which serves the Lima metropolitan area. ENTEL is
100% stae-owned and was created in 1969 when it absorbed services previously provided by
Government commissions and foreign companies which were nationalized. CPT, which was created
in 1970 when 1T&T was Lationalized, Is mainly subscriber-owned (69%), with the Government
holding 21% of the remaining shares and private shareholders holding 10%. ENTEL and CPT have
assets totalling US$689 million (1991 book value). In addition to these basic services, a private firm
has been providing cellular service in Lima for the last two years.
22.      Several factors have contributed to the very low level of telecommunication service in
Peru: (i) prior legal restrictions on private and foreign participation in telecommunication services; (ii)
erosion of real tariffs from 1980-1990; and (iHl) the sector organization and revenue sharing
arrangements, whereby ENTEL receives the bulk of the long distance and international call revenue
(although CPT customers account for 87% of the traffic). Originally, it was intended that these funds
would be used by ENTEL for network expansion outside Lima, but in practice these funds have
subsidized major inefficiency within ENTEL.
Recen Refbn ad Gov       e
23.      The new Government has taken some important steps to reform the sector. A 1000%
tariff increase was introduced in August 1990 and rates have been periodically adjusted since.
Second, a new Telecommunication Law was enacted in November 1991 to promote competition and
private and foreign investment in all services, and to establish a new regulatory regime. Third, new
Presidents have been appointed in both CPT and Entel to manage the companies during the transition
period prior to privatization.
24.      The Government's objective for the sector, is extremely ambitious - a target of 10 linee
per 100 population by the year 2000. This would require massive investment though preliminary
figures suggest that a major portion of this could be financed from internal cashflow with modest
tariff rebalancing, assuming an efficient operator and major efficiency improvements. This can likely
only be realized through privadzation to an experienced international operator. While the Lima-based
company (CPI1) would likely be atratve to investors, ENTEL in its current form would not. Some



58
changes in the sector organization or revenue-sharing arrangements betweea CPT and Entel may be
necessary to facilitate pvaion, while ensu    network development and efficient service outside
Lima. The special committee for telecom privatizatdon was appointed in May 1992 and has recently
hired international consultants, legal advisers, and investment bankers to assist with the sector
reorganization and privatization. lhe committee, with the assistance of the consultants, will initialy
focus on reviewing structl options for sector reorganization and privatzation.
Further Reforms tQ be uprted    Xt  Lon
25.       Ihe Loan will support the preparadon and implementation of a sector reorganization and
privatization plan, as wel as Implementation of the new regulatory regime. As a condition for second
tranche release, the Government will prepare a new competition regime, tariff structure and
privatization plan for the telecommunications sector. As a condition of third tranche release, the
Government wil implement the competition regime, tariff structure and privatization plan, and issue
regulations for the Telecommunications Law with respect to: (a) the operation of the new regulatory
agency; (b) the major classes of service; (c) the process and methodology for seting tariffs; and (d)
the process for granting of concessions.
D. Pisheris
26.       The marine waters off Peru are among the richest in the world, and prior to the 1970s,
Peru was one of the world's top fishing nations. However, the sector has declined significandy over
the last twenty years as a result of increased government intervention and the losses caused by the El
Niflo warm water current of 1972-73 which dissipated the Important anchovy catch. Ihe fisheries
sector represents roughly 15% of total merchandise expots, with foreign exchange earnings of $500
million annually. In the upstream fishing activity, the main species have been anchovy and sardines,
which are used predominantly (over 90% of all catches) for fisbmeal and fish-oil. Peru currendy
produces roughly 26% of world fishmeal and fishoil; onetW  of Peru's production (8% of world
production) is handled by the state-owned fish processiog company, Pescaperu.
27.       Oveall efficiency in the sector is low, with an average fish to fish meal ratio of 5.13:1,
as compared to the worldwide average of 4.78:1. Government involvement has been one of the
major obstacles in the sector's development, particulary due to unfair competition with private
initiative and inefficiency in business management, which hurts Peruvian fisheries competitiveness in
international trade. Apart from the ineficiency of the sector, there is a serious problem of over-
fishing, due to the absence of an effective fishetk resources mana8ement regime tbat would ensure
biological sustainability as well as opdmize economic benes for the country.
28.       The Government owns six enterprises in the fishery sector. Ihe primary entprise,
Pescaperu, was created in the early 1970s and soon thereafter acquired a monopoly in the fishmeal
industry through the takeover of 99 fishmed plants. The company is presely losing US$16 for
every ton of fishmeal produced. Pecaperu produces lower qult products, from the same raw
m rials, than its international competitors (principally Chile) and therefore receives 10-20% lower
prices for its fishmeal. The company is highly inefficient, with rougly 1500 excess employees of a
total workforce of 3500. It presently owns 20 operational procesng units, 16 redndat  unitks, 
guano ferdlizer plant, and 4 oil refineries. Seven of Its plant could handle 70% of its capacity.

Another major state-owned enterprise, Epsep, was established in 1970 with the moopoly for
domestic fish distnbution, to ensure the supply of fish for human COnsUmptiOn, espely tO low
income groups. The Government maintained support of Epsep, despite Its losses, because of the
company's social role. Audits from 1980 to 1988 reveal poor fanci managemen reflected In non
profitable investments, uncontrolled expenses and poor centralized management of the operational
units. Epsep is overstaffed, with 1,100 workers, wbile its needs are estimated to be 400 workes.
In the mid 1980s, the Government created Flopesca, with a fleet of fishing boats, as a subidiary to
Epsep, with the objective of supplying the domestic market with frozen fish. This company has never
generated a profit. Copes is a mixed company created in 1974 between Epsep, in representon of
the Government, and Star Kist, a private tuna canning company. The company has been unilatrally
managed by Epsep in the last five years, during which time it has suffered major losses ($8 million In
1988). Caper, a previously privately owned firm, was expropriated in 1970 and given a monopoly
over fish product certification. Over the last few years, its managerial and financial conditon has
also deteriorated.
Reforms nd CYmCL Stey
29.       The Government has recently accelerated structural reforms in the sector. An
interational conference was held in June 1992 to review the experiences of other countries in
fisheries resource management and to provide the basis for the preparation of a new fisheries law and
regulatory regime for Peru. A Govermnent committee subsequently prepared a draft Fisheries Law
which, inter alia, establishes a modern legal framework for the fishery sector and will enable the
introduction of a workable fisheries resource management regime. It is expected that the Government
will adopt a regime which creates catching rights - expressed as shares in total allowable catch -
which constiute transferable property rights. This system, referred to as Individual Transferable
Quota system, is currently being implemented, with positive results, in several major fishing nations
including Iceland, Norway, and New Zealand.
30.       Privatization of the state fishery companies Is progressing quickly. Flopesca is currently
under liquidaton. A subsidiary of Pescaperu, Inasa, which is responsible for boat mantenance, was
sold to the private sector in July 1992. Special committees have been appointed for the privatization
of Pescaperu, Epsep and Cerper. International consultants, financed by a Canadian grant, have
commenced the valuation of Pescaperu's plants. The Government has eliminad Epsep's monopoly
of fish distribution and Cerper's monopoly on the supervision of the quality of fish products. In
addition, cargo handling has been liberalized, allowing for a decrease in the cost of port services
which had been among the most expensive in the world.
Eur  Reforis to be S9pord by the Loan:
31.       The Loan will require, as a condition for second tranche release, the submission to
Congress of a fisheries law and preparation of draft regulations establishing the fisheries resource
management regime. Enactment of the fisheries law and issuance of the regulations establishing the
fisheries resource management regime is a condition of third tranche release. (Note: this condition
has been partally fulfilled with the enactment in December 1992 of the new fisheries law.)

E. Water
32.       Through a system of 13 state-owned municipal companies, the Government controls 100%
of all water and sewage operations and distribution. At present , only 73% of the urban population has
access to water and 50% to sanitation. In the rural areas, only 22% have access to water and 6% to
sanitation. Average annual investment in this sector for the 1985-1989 period represented approximately
0.15% of GDP - one of the lowest investment levels in Latin America. The quality of service has
deteriorated steadily during the last two decades. In Lima, water pressure in 70% of the districts is below
the minimum recommended pressure. Water service is not provided on a continual basis in Lima, and
water rationing is on the rise. Although there are still about 30% of existing connections in Lima with
meters in good working condition, most of these customers are billed assuming that their monthly
consumption is 50 cubic meters. The problems are compounded by the scarcity of water resources in the
Lima area and the poor quality of the water: the raw water arriving at La Atarea - the water treatment
plant for 75% of Lima's supply - is so poor that all samples analyzed during a Bank mission in May
1991 tested positive for cholera.
Le       s Refo    and the Goverment Strategy
33.      In November 1991, the Government issued Legislative Decres No. 697, promoting private
sector investment in water and sewage activities. Also in November 1991, the Government issued
Supreme Decree No. 171, which declared Senapa, the national water and sewerage enterptise, and
Cortapa, the commission which regulates tariffs in the sector, to be in a state of emergency and
authorized their directors to conduct an economic and financial stabilization as well as an administrative
rationalization, including staff reduction with a program of incentives for voluntary retirement. In June
1992, the Special Privatization Committee for Sedapal (the Lima company) was established. The
committee, with support from a Japanese grant for the water sector, is currendy hiring consultants to
assist with the technical analyses and preparation of bidding/sales documents for the privatization of
Sedapal. It is expected that the public tender process will be held by end-1993. In parallel, the Bank
is condminug preparation of the Lima Water Privadzation and Rehabilitation Project to support needed
investments. The design of the project will depend upon the results of the privatization and the firm's
requirements following privaftzation.
uther Reforms   be uMorted by the Loan
34.       Ihe Loan will require, as a condition for second tranche release, the submission to Congress
of a water sector law and preparation of draft regulations for the law. Enactment of the water sector law,
issuance of the associated regulations, and establishment of the new regulatory agency are conditions of
third tranche release.
