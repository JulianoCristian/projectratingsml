{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Energy Efficiency\n            Project for Romania are as follows: outcomes of the project\n            were satisfactory, risk to global environment outcomes was\n            moderate, bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            based on the experience gained from this project as well as\n            from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) project, and the European Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) project, the\n            project level transaction costs are still high and clients\n            require considerable pre-investment Technical Assistance\n            (TA) support (feasibility studies, structuring finance and\n            finding attractive financing, etc.) before large scale\n            Energy Efficiency (EE) implementation is possible. Local\n            knowledge and skills contribute to success more cost\n            effectively. A strong and reliable pipeline of initial\n            projects is essential to ensure early success of this type\n            of project. The original fund manager contract structure\n            should have been weighted more towards performance instead\n            of retainer part, adding flexibility in the contract\n            structure to adjust the fixed and performance fee would be\n            desirable and avoids costly repeat procurement, knowledge of\n            local industry and market is very important to ensure\n            success. For small demonstration projects such as this one,\n            the institutional design of Romanian Energy Efficiency Fund\n            (FREE) was overly complex, but at the same time, the\n            fiduciary controls and checks and balances are attractive\n            features for scaling up with both public and private capital."}, "docdt": "2009-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
