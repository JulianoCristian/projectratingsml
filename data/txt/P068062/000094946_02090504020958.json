{"cdata!": "The Energy Efficiency Project as\n            proposed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), aims at\n            enabling companies in the industrial sector, and other\n            energy consumers, to adopt and utilize energy-efficient\n            technologies, financed under commercial criteria, by the\n            Romanian Energy Efficiency Fund (FREE) and co-financiers.\n            This would put the economy on a sustainable path of lower\n            energy intensity, and greenhouse gas emissions. The\n            investment financing component will support the\n            establishment, and operation of an Energy Efficiency\n            Development and Financing Facility, which will be operated\n            under the Free Fund, set as an independent, autonomous legal\n            entity, in a public-private partnership, with GEF funds used\n            to capitalize the Fund, and partially defray initial\n            transaction costs. The project is designed to attract\n            substantial amount of commercial co-financing, and will\n            allow for both parallel, and direct co-financing\n            arrangements. Initially, the Fund will focus primarily on\n            financing projects within restructured, and/or privatized\n            industries, based on established creditworthiness, and on\n            minimal risk, and maximum potential criteria. Other types of\n            financing will include equipment leasing, payment for\n            services, and financial products which the evolving market\n            demands. The technical assistance (TA) component will cover\n            three broad areas: 1) capacity building activities on\n            initial project development, workshops and seminars for\n            partners, and training Fund Managers in energy efficiency\n            financing; 2) Fund management activities, which includes\n            retainer fees of the Fund Manager for the first three year;\n            and, 3) FREE administration activities, to include its\n            set-up and running costs during the first four years. Donor\n            support for TA will likely come in the form of tied, or\n            in-kind contributions for capacity building activities."}, "docdt": "2002-08-27T00:00:00Z"}
