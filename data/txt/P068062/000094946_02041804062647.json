They include the following:\n            Protecting soil surfaces during construction, control and\n            daily cleaning of construction sites, and providing waste\n            disposal services will prevent contamination from waste\n            materials, particularly asbestos from old insulation.\n            Drainage, proper disposal of oil and other hazardous\n            materials, and adequate sanitation and disposal system will\n            minimize clogged drainage works, a decline in water quality,\n            and hazardous wastes. Dust control with water, filters, and\n            new insulating materials that avoid containing ozone\n            depleting substances will reduce dust during construction,\n            emissions of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate\n            matter, and other air pollutants. Construction will be\n            restricted during certain hours to avoid noise disturbance.\n            Alternative sites will be considered to avoid disturbance of\n            natural habitats. Minimizing Loss of natural vegetation will\n            be minimized and special measures taken to protect sensitive\n            wildlife species. Providing solid waste disposal systems and\n            cleaning up debris will protect the aesthetics of the\n            landscape. Legally enacted special measures will protect\n            cultural resources. Preventative measures will reduce\n            construction accidents."}, "docdt": "2002-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
