          negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: A strong analytical basis is\n            needed to design effective operations. Small steps in\n            extending the Credit's closing date can be effective in\n            helping the government achieve a difficult benchmark. Reform\n            implementation crucially depends on an effective champion. A\n            pro-active role for the government in monitoring agreed\n            outcome indicators and achieving benchmarks is crucial. This\n            should help ensure smooth implementation of the project,\n            build government capacity and strengthen cooperation with\n            the Bank."}, "docdt": "2007-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
