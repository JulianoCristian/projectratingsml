Project sustainability is uncertain. Overall\n            performances by the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            satisfactory. Key lessons for the Bank included the\n            following: school clusters have been able to provide a\n            mechanism for teachers to mutually support each other in\n            quality improvement efforts. Decentralized and participatory\n            in-service training programs are more effective and\n            efficient than centralized, traditional lecture mode.\n            Participation techniques can enhance community ownership to\n            the schools. There is a need for close cooperation between\n            the ministries of education and culture, and home affairs in\n            managing quality improvement. Training for the head teachers\n            in the use of grants will influence the success of the\n            intervention. Decentralizing authority to agencies and the\n            community at lower levels to select scholarship and grants\n            recipients can enhance ownership by both government and\n            community and help assure transparency. Lessons for the\n            government included the following: Training should be based\n            on teacher needs. Good head teachers are essential in\n            developing good schools. Parents should be involved in\n            student learning processes."}, "docdt": "2000-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
