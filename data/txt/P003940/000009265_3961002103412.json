This\n            component also provides more and better quality books and\n            materials, as well as develops policy to enhance\n            teachers' promotion opportunities. Component B\n            comprises a pilot program in East Nusa Tenggara Timur and\n            West Sumatra to upgrade the quality of the most under-served\n            schools by providing compensatory funds to schools in the\n            poorest villages.
