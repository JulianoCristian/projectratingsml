programs.\n            Component A provides support to 6 provinces (Aceh, Bali,\n            East Nusa Tenggara Timur, North Sulawesi, West Sumatra and\n            Yogjakarta) whose administrations expand an innovative\n            program of \"teacher professional support\" (SPP)\n            and \"student active learning\" (CBSA). This\n            component also provides more and better quality books and\n            materials, as well as develops policy to enhance\n            teachers' promotion opportunities. Component B\n            comprises a pilot program in East Nusa Tenggara Timur and\n            West Sumatra to upgrade the quality of the most under-served\n            schools by providing compensatory funds to schools in the\n            poorest villages.  Component C has both provincially-based\n            and national elements.  In East Nusa Tenggara Timur and West\n            Sumatra the project introduces and monitors measures to\n            rationalize the respective responsibilities of the Ministry\n            of Education and Culture and Regional Administration\n            Education Services in providing support to primary schools\n            for quality improvement.  It improves financial planning and\n            budgeting by consolidating budgetary information at the\n            school, at the provincial and at the national levels."}, "docdt": "1992-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
