The\n            project will increase the use of containers in the transport\n            of general cargo, and encourage and facilitate the use of\n            the railway for such transport wherever it is economically\n            the best option. The project will: a) improve the\n            institutional framework for efficient and competitive\n            container transport through the removal of the main customs\n            practices and procedures restricting the inland movement of\n            containers; b) strengthen the commercial approach and\n            operational efficiency of the Container Corporation of India\n            (CONCOR) by diluting at least a 5 percent share of the\n            Government's equity in CONCOR, broadening the\n            composition of the Board of Directors, reforming the claim\n            policy to customer needs, and providing technical assistance\n            and training; and c) support scheduled high-quality\n            container train services in the main corridors through the\n            acquisition of selected rolling stock, cargo handling\n            equipment, transponders and readers for electronic tracking\n            of container trains, flat car and containers, and related\n            civil works and engineering services."}, "docdt": "1994-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
