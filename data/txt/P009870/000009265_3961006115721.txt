MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENr
OF THE INTE NATIONAL BANK FOR RtECONSMRUCrION AND DEVELOPMENT
T-D THE EXECUTVE DItECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CONTAINER CORPORATION OF INDIA LTD.
FOR A CONTAIER TRANSPORT LOGISTICS PROJECT
1          I submit for yow approval the following report and reco d n     propoed loan
to the Container Corporation of lidia Ltd. (CONCOR), with the guarantee of India, for the equivalent
of US$ 94 million to help finance a Container Transport Logistics Project. The loan would be at the
Bank's stanard variable intest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.
2.         Bacdgound. Despite relatively rapid growth duing the last few years, the
containerizaon of general cargo presently accounts for only about 30 percent of the seaboard trade of
Inda, as compared with 60 perce in many other developing couris. Perhaps mo  importany*
less than 15 percent of the containers passing through Indian ports move iWland while 85 percent are
stuffed or desuffed in the ports. The fact that only 35 prcent of all cargo arriving at the leading
general cargo port of Bombay is destied for the greater Bombay area, while 65 percent is shipped on
to inland areas, clearly indicates the substantial growth potental for inland transport of overseas trade
contaiers. The amount of inland transport and of cargo suffed or destuffed at ports adds to the
already severe congestion of India's main roads. A recent study of road transport in the main
corridors noted that 46 percent of truckdng hauls on India's main highway network are in excess of
500 kn and 26 percent in excess of 1,000 kan. Given the severe capacity constrais on Tndia's main
roads and the lower through costs, much of this traffic could be moved by rail in containers if high-
quality, long-haul, multi-modal container services were made available.
3.         Because containerization sti1l accounts for only a relatively small prentage of all cargo
shipments and is largely limited to the seaborne leg of foreign trade (with most coners stffed or
destuffed at the ports), India is failing to capitalize on many of the advantages of multi-modal
ranisport and unitization. This includes lower packaging costs; less breakage; and more efficient
stuffg/destuffing of containers by lower-cost labor in inexpensive, less-congested, higher-security
facilities outside the port area. Perhaps even more important is that c ion  would facilit
trade by simplifying documetaon and making speedier payment to exporters possible (tbat is,
exporters would receive payment on the basis of though bills of lading issued at an inland container
terminal rather than at the port of shipmet).
4.         The low inland penetration of overseas coniners and limited domestic container
movements is caused by many different reasons, including (a) cumbersome customs regulations and
procedures that have especially restricted the movement by road of containers under bond; (b) the
shortage of inland container depots (ICDs) and container freight stations t%FSs); (c) the absence of an
appropriate legislative framework for multi-modal transport; (d) the shortage of railway flat cars and
multi-axle trucks suitable for the transport of containers; (e) tht generally poor condition of the road
network that restricts road movement of containers; and (f) the low priority given by Indian Railways
(IR) to such traffic.
5.         Following the establishment of the Container Corporation of India Ltd. (CONCOR),
considerable progress has been made in developing a network of ICDs and a ystem of dedicated
container trains linking Delhi with the major ports of Bombay, Jawaharlal Nehru Port at New
Bombay (JNPI), and Madras, as well as betweenBangalore, Madras and Cochin. The opening of the
Tughlakabad ICD (CM) near Delhi and new ICDs at Bangalore and Cochin in 1993 has eased the
ICD inastructur constrait to container transport and has helped CONCOR increase the number of
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) handled, from 26,5( in fiscal 1991 to over 220,000 in fiscal
1994.
6.         Recenly, there have also been several other encourgn developments to promote
muldti-modal ansport in India which address many of the above constraints. These include:



2
(a)  the GOI decision to permit private ownership and opeations of ICDs and CFSs
(originally a CONCOR monopoly) and the establishment of a streamlined process for
consideration of such requests (a significant number of private CFSs hive already been
approyed);
(b)  the adoption of the Multi-modal Transportation of Goods Act that provides for the
issuance of muiti-modal tasport documen  and clarifies the responsibilities of the
multi-modal transport operator;
(c)   CONCOR's proposal to expand its conainer haning capacty and broaden its capital
base by including an inital 5 percent private sector equity participation;
(d) several measures to simplify documentation and other procedures for customs clearance
and for the movement of conainers inland by road or rail; and
(e)  IRs agreement to enhance service levels and operate regular container trans on major
corridors with guaranteed transit times.
7.         Rationale for IBRD Involvement and Country Assiotne Strategy. The proposed
project is conssent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strateg (report # P-6141-IN) for India,
which focuses on supportng GOI's efforts to provide an enabling environment for broad-based
efficient private sector-led growth while accelerating poverty alleviation and the development of
himan resources, which was discussed on May 12, 1994. Key elements of the CAS are to assist India
in becoming a more trade-oriented economy, improving infhstructure services, increasing efficiency,
promoting instutional capacity, and fostering competition in the transport sector in India. Looking
specifically at the project, the development of international container transport is complex logistically
and requires a commercial and institutional framework that is not yet complete in India. The Bank
and the bilateral assistance from the Government of the Netherlands (GON) would assist in
transferring relevant overseas experience in the technology of container handling and transport, which
would improve the institutional capabilities of CONCOR as well as the industry. It would also enable
CONCOR to become a fully competitive and fiancia}ly sound enterprise, permitting it to finance its
futu  requirements on the domestic capital markets through either debt or eqity financing.
8.         Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project is to establish an enabling
environment for container transport and to increase the capacity and efficiency of long-hul transport
of high-value general cargo. More specifically, the proposed project would:
(a)  improve the institutional fraework for efficient and competitive coainer transport to
serve both foreign and domestic trade;
(b)  strengthen the commercial and operational performance of CONCOR in an
increasingly competitive environment; and
(c)   greatly improve the service level and capacity in the main corridors by providing
modem technology rolling stock to permit regular scheduled block train operations on
gateway port corridors.
9.         Project Description. The proposed project would help develop the necessary framework
for continer transport with particular emphasis, as a first step, on the main corridors of Delhi-
Bombay/JNPT and Delhi-Madras. The project would include three major complementary
compoents:



3
(a)  Improvement of the institutional amew,ork for efficient and conpetive container
tra   rt by removing some of the restrictive customs practices and policies on inland
movements of containers (including by road) and by expanding customs working hours
at TKD.
(b)   gtrenhenin gf the commercial approach and operati9nal cajacity of CONCOR in an
increasingly competitve environment by (i) fornalizing service relations with IR through
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) relating to service leve}s of container trains
operations; (ii) divesting at least 5 percent of the Government's equity in CONCOR; (ii)
(iii) broadening the composition of the Board of Directors of CONCOR to include non
official part time directors; (iv) refoming CONCOR's claim policy to meet customers
demand and to be competitive with road transport; and (v) providing technical assistance
and tainig to improve CONCOR's operational, commercial, financial and general
management capabilities.
(c)   &=W scheduled hi&h-Wualitv container train services in the main corrdors through (i)
purchase of 1,200 bogie container flats (BFK) flat cars from IR and retrofit with air
braking systems; (ii) purchase of 1,500 new container flat cars of new design (100 I;PH
capability); (iii) purchase of 5 prototype 60-foot long platform, lightweight flat cars
capable of carrymg three loaded 20-foot ISO containers for testing purposes; (iv) a
further purchase of approximately 750 new flat cars of the same design as under (ii) or
an equivalent capacity of the new designs under (ifl) (if the design has been approved by
the time of starting procurement); (v) procurement of complementary cargo handling
equipment for TKD ICD; and (vi) construction of civil works necessary for completing
ICD infucture.
10.        The project would be implementeJ over 5.5 years at a total cost of US$ 151 million,
with a foreign exchuge component of US$ 32 million (21 percent of tota project costs), including
US$ 19 million in price contingencies. The IBRD loan would be for US$ 94 million, or 69 percent of
total project cost, excluding dutes and taxes. The GON has agreed to provide co-financing of about
US$ 4 million equivalent for the technical assistae component of the project. The breakdown of
costs and financing is shown is Schedule A. The proposed pourement aangments and the
disbursements schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations are given in schedules C and D respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 12780-IN datd April 25, 1994, is being disb d separately.
11.        Project Implemea   CONCOR will implement the main components of the project,
partiarly  the procuement of flat cars and other equipmen and the related instittional componens
in accordance with an agreed implementtion schedule and performance targets. Close coordination
and cooperation with TR will be needed to ensure the expected performance improvements as foreseen
under the draft Memorandum of Unetnding for 1994/95. The broader instiuional component
related to customs procedures and practices will be implemented by the Ministry of Finamnc. Wile
CONCOR would be the recipient of the technical assistae for operaional support and staff training,
die GON would be responsible for contractig with the already selected consulting firm. Project
procurement has recenty started and the project should be completed by June 30, 1999. A project
mid-erm review is planned for end 1995.
12.        Frqject Susnblity. TMe sustinability of the project is dependent on (a) the ability of
CONCOR to improve its operational performance and stngthen its commercial approach to meet
market needs; (b) the cooperation of IR in providing the necessary block tain paths and tracion
power; and (c) the c       of the Government to removing some of the regulatory or procedural
constrais to increased container transport in a competitive environment. Several measr  have
already been taken by CONCOR and the Goverent (as mentioned in para 6 above). The operational



4
perfmnnance and commercial approach of CONCOR would be stengened by the technical assistance
component of the project and sever of the agreements reached during loan negotiations (pas 15
and 16 below).
13.        Lesons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvemet. It should be noted that there has been
no other project of a similar type in the transport sector in India. The overall Bank experience with
lending to the transport sector has been somewhat mixed, especially in the area of project
implementation and procurement, due to slow decision maldng and delays in counterpart funding as
well as capacity constraints and quality control by the constuction industry. The performance in the
railway sub-sector has generally been much better than in the tranwsport sector as a whole. Counterpart
funding has been available and contratal disputes have been limited. However, there have been
delays in procurement.
14.        Drawing on past experience, considerable attention has been given to several measures
to ensure efficient implemention of the proposed Containe Tranport Logistics Project. First,
agreement has been reached on the key policy issues (such as the Multi-modal Transport of Goods
Act), changes in customs procedures, and private sector participation, which will enable conainer
trawsport and CONCOR to function in a more efficient maner. Second, the prepation of the
physical components of the project is well advanced with the expected award of the first package of
contuacts occurring within the nest nine months. FirWly, in order to improve the technical,
operatonal, financial and marketing performance of CONCOR, the GON has provided a grant for a
comprehensive technical assistance program, which is part of the project. Some provision for
complementary technical assistance is also included in the proposed loan.
15.        Agreed Actions. During negotiations with the Government and CONCOR, the following
main assurances and agreements were obtained:
(a) that the Govermment will: (i) implement agreed oustoms-related measures to facilitate
inland movements of containers in accordance with an agreed timig; (ii) offer for sale
at least 5 percent of its share in CONCOR's equity; and (iii) cause 1k to maintain in
force an MOU with CONCOR; and
(b)  that CONCOR will: (i) maintain in force a satisfactory MOU with IR; (ii) enter into
agreements for expeditious loading/disarging of container flat cars with the three
gateway ports; (hii) submit to the Bank for comments the annually updated Business and
Finance Plan; and (iv) implement the project so as to achieve agreed performance and
financial targets.
16.        Coaditions of Effectveness. The following conditions are specified for effectiveness:
(a) CONCOR has implemented a new claims policy, and
(b)  CONCOR's Board of Directors shall have been broadened thru the appointment of
on-official members.
17.        Evl Aspects. The project will have a positive enironmental effect by
transferring to rail part of the break bulk freight moving on the higly congested high-density corridor
(HDC) highways. This will result in fewer accidents and rduced road congestion, noise, emissions,
and POL consumption. In addition the acquisition of new high-speed flat cas will permit a higher and
more efficient utilization of dte increasingly overloaded railway network.
18.        Project DBaits. The project has the potent  to yield substaal benefits in terms of
reduced transport pad inventory costs and to that degree shod also serve to stimulate additional



trade. Parts of the long-haul non-bulk traffic currently movig on highways would also shift to the
more economic rail transport mode, which has an estimad Economic Rate of Return of 37 percent
for this project. In addition, changes in customs regulations and private sector entry will facilitate the
handling and movement of containers, particularly for the short-haul road transportion of containers.
There is littde risk that the proposed investments will fail to generate sufficient benefits to justify the
relatively modest outlays due to the large unsatisfied demand for container transportation in hdia.
19.        Risks. The main risk related to the project is that the expected improvements in
CONCOR's performance may not be fully achieved due to insufficient support from IR in providing
needed block train paths and traction power. To reduce this risk, the MOU between CONCOR and IR
clearly determines the obligations of IR and provides performance incentives ,for both parties.
However, IR's priorities could shift in response to a shft in national priorities. Another risk is that
agencies, such as Customs, that derive little direct benefit from the project may be slow to amend
their procedures and thus prevent or delay benefits from being fully realized. In an attempt to reduce
this risk, up front and short term actions, particularly in respect to customs procedures, have been
agreed with GOI. Finally, the foreign exchange risk of the project will be borne by CONCOR even
though all of its revenues are in Rupees. The results obtained from running sensitivity analyses
indicate that CONCOR would be able to meet its debt-servicing obligations even with a depreciation
of the Rumee at a rate two times of that projected by the Bank.
20.        Recoendatmon. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
