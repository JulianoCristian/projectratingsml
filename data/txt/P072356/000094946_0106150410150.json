There\n            are three project components. The first component provides\n            grants to build the capacity of village and sub-district\n            councils and to support activities for physical\n            infrastructure, as well as income generating and social\n            welfare activities for widows and vulnerable groups. It also\n            assists sub-districts in services delivery and provides\n            grants to central networks working with highly vulnerable\n            groups; and technical assistance and monitoring. The second\n            component supports cultural heritage by financing the\n            reconstruction of the building for the National Performance\n            and Culture Center, and funding architects and consultants\n            to design and supervise. Small culture grants will support\n            artists and cultural activities at the center, and finance\n            the collection and archiving of oral history. The third\n            component develops radio and television services,\n            specifically by establishing community radio stations and a\n            support center, and funding training and equipment for\n            district reporters."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
