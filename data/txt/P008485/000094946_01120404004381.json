Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances were considered satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included the following: The Competitive\n            Process to select the institutions to participate in the\n            development of new course programs and to select those\n            teachers to be trained helped to ensure that limited\n            resources were allocated effectively. The establishment of\n            performance targets in terms of the number of individuals\n            who find jobs in the area in which they have been trained\n            and the use of follow-up surveys to determine if these\n            targets are met, is instrumental in ensuring that training\n            programs are effective. Program audits to determine the\n            overall effectiveness of government operations are useful\n            tools to assist in re-designing government programs.\n            Evaluations completed by students on their perception of the\n            quality of training can lead to improvement in course content."}, "docdt": "2001-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
