To reach this objective, the project will\n            provide equipment, software, and technical assistance and\n            training to continue development and strengthening youth\n            vocational orientation and training programs. There are two\n            components. The first component strengthens and modernizes\n            post-secondary and post-compulsory school specialized\n            training programs for young people to facilitate their entry\n            into the labor market. Its subcomponents finance technical\n            assistance: 1) for project coordination and promotion,\n            fellowship training, equipment, and software; 2) for writing\n            teams of curriculum developers in occupational specialties;\n            3) for institutional infrastructure development in\n            management, operations, and procurement; and 4) for staff\n            training. The second component expands the number of\n            secondary vocational schools applying the new core\n            curriculum and occupational orientation programs developed\n            under the Hungary Human Resource Project. Its subcomponents\n            provide hardware, software, and limited technical assistance\n            and staff training to assist secondary vocational schools to\n            implement the seven new academic core curricula for grades 9\n            through 12 and to implement vocational orientation curricula\n            in grades 11 and 12."}, "docdt": "1997-08-21T00:00:00Z"}
