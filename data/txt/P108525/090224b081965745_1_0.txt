                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in establishing and institutionalizing an efficient and effective framework for formulating and implementing
                         sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity of public institutions responsible for the development and implementation of such policies to
                         formulate and carry out the policies. [Objective as reflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not different from the PAD but wordings are different.
                         The most important project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic policy development and decision making through establishing
                         strong inter-ministerial coordination and interface; b) support process of economic policy development and implementation through enabling public institutions (and
                         particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) to formulate sound and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of
                         employment practices and wages in the civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other main objectives are from the PAD but are
                         not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although broadly in line in substance ]

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Two rounds of disruption in the government hindered project implementation. First, the government was restructured to a large extent in October 2009; among other changes, the
                         "Central Agency on Development, Investment, and Innovation" (CADII) was established and empowered with competencies over most economic policy decisions, donor coordination,
                         and all external assistance. These changes caused shifts in the role and responsibilities of the government agencies involved in the implementation of various components and sub-
                         components of the project. The majority of competencies that belonged to the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT)--originally the main implementation partner for
                         CBEM--were shifted to CADII. Consequently, CADII became the main implementing agency for CBEM.

                         The second round of disruption was caused by the April and June events of 2010. The April 2010 political uprising forced the President to resign and led to the formation of an interim
                         government headed by a coalition of opposition political and civic leaders. CADII was abolished. Then in June social tensions and inter-ethnic clashes broke out in the south of the
                         country, disrupting the government's operations and implementation of many projects, including CBEM.

                         Subsequently, with the formation of the interim government in 2010, the primary responsibility for the implementation of the project (which had earlier moved from MEDT to CADII in
                         October 2009) was shifted to the new Ministry of Economic Regulation, which has been assigned the majority of MEDT’s competencies. Again, the government restructuring that
                         took place at end-2011 resulted in renaming of the MER into the Ministry of Economy and Anti Monopoly Policy. The last round of government restructuring, however, did not hinder
                         project implementation and Ministry of Economy (MoE) remains the main agency in charge of implementation.

                         From early 2011, project implementation accelerated significantly, although, due to initial delays and some capacity constraints, the implementation is still behind the original plan.
                         Progress in the second half of 2012 includes:
                         (i) Adoption of a financial programming model under component 1, supported by an international consultant. The model has been adopted to produce economic forecasts by the
                         Ministry of Economy, Finance, and the National Bank.
                         (ii) Under component 2, a couple of training programs and study tours (to Latvia) were undertaken to advance the work on the Ministry of Economy's HR strategy which is expected to
                         result in a new structure for the ministry.
                         (iii) The Policy Development Group (PDPG) initiated the studies on shadow economy and on tourism, and presented their findings and recommendations to the government.
                         (iv) With support of an international consultant, a new set of guidelines, process, and methodology for the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) is being introduced at the MoE.
                         (v) With support of an international consultant, a diagnostic assessment of the Kyrgyz Public Investment Management (PIM) was undertaken and a report with recommendations
                         delivered tot he government.
                         (vi) New TORs have been developed to pursue technical support to the MoE on implementation of the government anti-corruption program and development of a monitoring and
                         evaluation system to assess progress.
                         (vii) Significant progress under component 3 towards developing a civil service pay and grading reform strategy which has been presented to all heads of HR departments of state
                         agencies with recommendations for reform.

                         Since the project was to close at the end of 2012, the government has requested an (i) extension of the closing date for 12 months to the end of 2013 to allow continuation and
                         completion of the existing activities and training programs, and a (ii) reallocation of project funds from the unallocated category to allow utilization of the remaining funds towards
                         strengthening the capacity of the MoE to help implementation of the government anti-corruption reform agenda. There are no changes in the project development objectives (PDO).
                         The extension has been approved and the Bank is finalizing the reallocation of funds through restructuring of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Several important decisions were made following the appointment of the interim government in April 2010 and the formation of a new government after the October 2010 elections.
                         First, the project Steering Committee (SC)--the project oversight body with representation from government agencies involved in CBEM implementation--that had previously been
                         disbanded--was reappointed and re-assigned the roles and responsibilities of leading and managing the project components. Second, more power was given to the heads of
                         individual components within the SC to independently make decisions specifically related to the implementation of their respective project components. Third, the procurement plan
                         was revised, allocating more funds to the activities where implementation progress was faster and additional funding was needed. Finally, a local Project Manager with the mandate
                         to facilitate project implementation was hired in 2011. The Project Manager resigned in May 2012, but a new one has been appointed in July. There has been significant progress
                         with implementation of the project in the second half of 2012.
