                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in establishing and institutionalizing an efficient and effective framework for formulating and implementing
                         sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity of public institutions responsible for the development and implementation of such policies to
                         formulate and carry out the policies. [Objective as reflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not different from the PAD but wordings are different.
                         The most important project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic policy development and decision making through establishing
                         strong inter-ministerial coordination and interface; b) support process of economic policy development and implementation through enabling public institutions (and
                         particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) to formulate sound and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of
                         employment practices and wages in the civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other main objectives are from the PAD but are
                         not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although broadly in line in substance ]

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Two rounds of disruption in the government hindered project implementation. First, the government was restructured to a large extent in October 2009; among other changes, the
                         "Central Agency on Development, Investment, and Innovation" (CADII) was established and empowered with competencies over most economic policy decisions, donor coordination,
                         and all external assistance. These changes caused shifts in the role and responsibilities of the government agencies involved in the implementation of various components and sub-
                         components of the project. The majority of competencies that belonged to the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT)--originally the main implementation partner for
                         CBEM--were shifted to CADII. Consequently, CADII became the main implementing agency for CBEM.

                         The second round of disruption was caused by the April and June events of 2010. The April 2010 political uprising forced the President to resign and led to the formation of an interim
                         government headed by a coalition of opposition political and civic leaders. CADII was abolished. Then in June social tensions and inter-ethnic clashes broke out in the south of the
                         country, disrupting the government’s operations and implementation of many projects, including CBEM.

                         Subsequently, with the formation of the interim government in 2010, the primary responsibility for the implementation of the project (which had earlier moved from MEDT to CADII in
                         October 2009) was shifted to the new Ministry of Economic Regulation, which has been assigned the majority of MEDT’s competencies.

                         Again, the government restructuring that took place at end-2011 resulted in renaming of the MER into the Ministry of Economy and Anti Monopoly Policy. This round of government
                         restructuring, however, is not expected to have a significant impact on CBEM implementation arrangements.

                         From early 2011, project implementation has accelerated significantly. However, due to significant initial delays and some capacity constraints, the implementation is still behind the
                         original plan.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Several important decisions were made following the appointment of the interim government in April 2010 and the entry into office of a new government after the October 2010

                         elections. First, the project Steering Committee (SC)--the project oversight body with representation from other government agencies involved in its implementation--that had
                         previously been disbanded was reappointed and re-assigned the roles and responsibilities of leading and managing the project components. Second, more power was given to the
                         heads of individual components within the SC to independently make decisions specifically related to implementation of the project component over which they preside. Third, the
                         procurement plan was revised, allocating more funds to the activities where implementation progress was faster and additional funding was needed. Finally, a local Project Manager
                         with the mandate to facilitate project implementation was hired in 2011. These decisions have had a positive effect on project implementation.
