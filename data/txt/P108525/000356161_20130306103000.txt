7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in establishing and
 institutionalizing an efficient and effective framework for formulating and implementing
 sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity of public institutions
 responsible for the development and implementation of such policies to formulate and
 carry out the policies. [Objective as reflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not
different from the PAD but wordings are different.

 The most important project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic
policy development and decision making through establishing strong inter-ministerial coordination and
interface; b) support process of economic policy development and implementation through enabling public
institutions (and particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) to formulate sound
and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of employment practices
and wages in the civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other
main objectives are from the PAD but are not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although
broadly in line in substance ]
