                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in establishing and institutionalizing an efficient and effective frameworkfor formulating and implementing
                         sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity of public institutionsresponsible for the development and implementation of such policies to
                         formulate and carry out the policies. [Objective asreflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not different from the PAD but wordings are different. The
                         mostimportant project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic policy development and decision makingthrough establishing strong
                         inter-ministerial coordination and interface; b) support process of economic policy development andimplementation through enabling public institutions (and
                         particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) toformulate sound and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of
                         employment practices and wages inthe civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other main objectives are from the PAD butare
                         not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although broadly in line in substance ]

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Two rounds of disruption in the government hindered project implementation. First, the government was restructured to a largeextent in October 2009; among other changes, the
                         "Central Agency on Development, Investment, and Innovation" (CADII) wasestablished and empowered with competencies over most economic policy decisions, donor coordination,
                         and all external assistance.These changes caused shifts in the role and responsibilities of the government agencies involved in the implementation of variouscomponents and sub-
                         components of the project. The majority of competencies that belonged to the Ministry of Economic Developmentand Trade (MEDT)--originally the main implementation partner for
                         CBEM--were shifted to CADII. Consequently, CADII became the mainimplementing agency for CBEM.

                         The second round of disruption was caused by the April and June events of 2010. The April 2010political uprising forced the President to resign and led to the formation of an interim
                         government headed by a coalition ofopposition political and civic leaders. CADII was abolished. Then in June social tensions and inter-ethnic clashes broke out inthe south of the
                         country, disrupting the government’s operations and implementation of many projects, including CBEM.

                         Subsequently, with the formation of the interim government in 2010, the primary responsibility for the implementation of theproject (which had earlier moved from MEDT to CADII in
                         October 2009) was shifted to the new Ministry of Economic Regulation, whichhas been assigned the majority of MEDT’s competencies. Again, the government restructuring that took
                         place at end-2011 resulted inrenaming of the MER into the Ministry of Economy and Anti Monopoly Policy. The last round of government restructuring, however,did not hinder project
                         implementation.

                         From early 2011, project implementation has accelerated significantly. However, due tosignificant initial delays and some capacity constraints, the implementation is still behind the
                         original plan.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Several important decisions were made following the appointment of the interim government in April 2010 and the formation of a new government after the October 2010 elections.
                         First, the project Steering Committee (SC)--the project oversight body with representation from government agencies involved in CBEM implementation--that had previously been
                         disbanded--was reappointed and re-assigned the roles and responsibilities of leading and managing the project components. Second, more power was given to the heads of
                         individual components within the SC to independently make decisions specifically related to the implementation of their respective project components. Third, the procurement plan
                         was revised, allocating more funds to the activities where implementation progress was faster and additional funding was needed. Finally, a local Project Manager with the mandate
                         to facilitate project implementation was hired in 2011. The Project Manager resigned in May 2012, but a new one has been appointed in July. These decisions have had a positive
                         effect on project implementation.
