                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

The Capacity Building for Economic Management (CBEM) was approved on July 1,
2008 in order to establish and institutionalize a sound framework and capacity for
economic policy making and implementation. The current restructuring involves
reallocation of project funds between categories and from the unallocated category for
strengthening the capacity of Ministry of Economy in its current and new policy priority
areas, including for its anti-corruption reform program. The current restructuring will
also allow the completion of ongoing activities under the project. There are no changes
to the project development objectives (PDO).

B. PROJECT STATUS

Overall implementation progress has been good despite earlier delays caused by frequent
political changes and the shift of implementation responsibility to various agencies, as
well as following the 2010 disturbances when implementation was in a standstill during
April-October of 2010.

There was good progress in implementation of all the components of the project over the
last year, particularly of components 1 and 3.1 An amount of USD 1.7 million or 60
percent of the total IDA grant funds have been disbursed so far. Progress toward meeting
the project’s development objectives (PDO) are currently satisfactory and the outcome
and results indicators are either met or would be fully met once the remaining funds are
utilized. However, a significant portion of the project funds remain undisbursed (SDR
767,814.05) and there is SDR 182,000 of unallocated funds which have been left as
reserves to be utilized as needs and priorities change.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Components: The Ministry of Economy plays a significant role in the implementation of
the priority areas of the government reform program. The CBEM project has been
providing technical assistance and capacity building support to the Ministry of Economy
to strengthen its technical and policy making expertise in the area of policy making and
economic management. The proposed restructuring aims at reallocation of project funds
between categories and from the unallocated category towards strengthening the capacity
of the Ministry of Economy in its current and new policy priority areas to support the
government reform program including in the area of anti-corruption reform. It will also
allow completion of ongoing activities under the project. There would not be any change

  The project has four components: Component 1: Institutional and technical framework for government
wide macroeconomic policy development and coordination; Component 2: Strengthening the capacity to
formulate and implement economic policy; Component 3: Develop capacity for pay and grading reform in
the civil service; and Component 4: Project management and implementation support.


                                                 4
in the PDOs which will continue to be achievable within the extended closing date of end
December 2013.

Financing: The proposed restructuring is to be financed by modifying some of the
activities under component 2 and reallocating the unutilized and unallocated funds to
finance activities that would support the implementation of the government reform
program including in the area of anti-corruption reform, as well as to continue with
completion of the ongoing activities under components 1 and 3 and to provide sufficient
financing for component 4. The amount of unutilized funds by the end of 2012 was USD
1.180 million, of which USD 436,000 are agreed to be allocated towards anti-corruption
policy and implementation related activities.

The following table specifies the categories of Eligible Expenditures that may be
financed out of the proceeds of the financing and the proposed allocations to each
category.

The proposed restructuring is expected to strengthen the bank’s existing policy dialogue
in governance and anti-corruption supported by the Development Policy Operations
(DPO) and to provide an input to the upcoming Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
