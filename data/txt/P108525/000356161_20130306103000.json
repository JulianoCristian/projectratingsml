The\n            restructuring aims at reallocation of project funds between\n            categories and from the unallocated category towards\n            strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Economy in its\n            current and new policy priority areas to support the\n            government reform program including in the area of\n            anti-corruption reform. It will also allow completion of\n            ongoing activities under the project. The restructuring is\n            to be financed by modifying some of the activities under\n            component two and reallocating the unutilized and\n            unallocated funds to finance activities that would support\n            the implementation of the government reform program\n            including in the area of anti-corruption reform, as well as\n            to continue with completion of the ongoing activities under\n            components one and three and to provide sufficient financing\n            for component four."}, "docdt": "2013-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
