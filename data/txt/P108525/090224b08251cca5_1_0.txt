                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in establishing and institutionalizing an efficient and effective framework for formulating and implementing
                         sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity of public institutions responsible for the development and implementation of such policies to
                         formulate and carry out the policies. [Objective as reflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not different from the PAD but wordings are different.
                         The most important project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic policy development and decision making through establishing
                         strong inter-ministerial coordination and interface; b) support process of economic policy development and implementation through enabling public institutions (and
                         particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) to formulate sound and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of
                         employment practices and wages in the civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other main objectives are from the PAD but are
                         not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although broadly in line in substance ]

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project implementation assessment remains moderately satisfactory. The project activities have been implemented as planned. The government bodies responsible for
                         economic policy have now established clear institutional arrangements for coordinating and developing macroeconomic projections/scenarios. The Ministry of Economy has
                         strengthened its capacity to develop and implement economic policy measures and proposals, conduct regulatory impact analysis, and monitor and evaluate implementation of the
                         anti-corruption program. The State Personnel Service has developed and started to implement a strategy on improving the civil service pay system and introduced revised skill
                         requirements to civil servants.

                         Component 1
                         The project helped the government to institutionalize a coordination mechanism for developing macroeconomic forecasts and scenarios. The key decisions on the coordination
                         framework have been approved as government resolutions:
                         -        On the establishment of the technical group on developing the financial programming model (number 94-p, dated April 4, 2011),
                         -        On the establishment of the Coordination council on macroeconomic and investment policies under the Kyrgyz Republic Government (number 215, dated May 13, 2011),
                         -        On the state forecasting system in the Kyrgyz Republic and the order of the social-economic development prognosis of the Kyrgyz Republic (number 711, dated November
                         11, 2011),
                         -        On the financial programming model and the guidance to use it (number 557, dated October 9, 2013).

                         At a technical level, the economic policy coordination has improved. Technical experts from the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance, the PM’s office, the Central Bank, the
                         Statistics Committee, and the Social Fund (the technical group) regularly exchanges economic information between each other and produce agreed macroeconomic forecasts on a
                         quarterly basis. The results of the technical group’s work are used for the preparation of the mid-term economic forecasts and the budget parameters.

                         The process of preparation of the mid-term socio-economic prognosis has been formalized. The ministries and government agencies provide all the required information to the
                         Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the approved timetable.

                         At the decision making level, the macroeconomic coordination was basically maintained using regular government meetings. The government meetings consider the joint statement
                         of the central bank and the government, the mid-term socio-economic forecasts, the annual budget and amendments to the annual budget. The role of the Coordination council on
                         macroeconomic and investment policies (CCMIP) appears to be limited although it considers the mid-term socio-economic forecasts and the mid-term budget framework.

                         In 2013, the CCMIP met three times, to consider the mid-term macroeconomic forecasts for 2014-2016, the mid-term budget framework for 2014-2016 and the partnership strategies
                         of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In 2014, the CCMIP met to consider the mid-term socio-economic forecasts for 2015-2017 and the mid-term budget framework
                         for 2015-2017 on May 22, 2014.

                         The improved macroeconomic coordination helped the government and the central bank negotiate a macroeconomic framework with the IMF under the Extended Credit Facility
                         arrangement. The IMF program has been successfully implemented during the last three years.


                         Component 2
                         The project provided support to conduct a functional analysis of the Ministry of Economy (MoE). However, changes in the whole structure of the government following the 2010
                         events led to significant functional changes in the MoE. As a result, the recommendations from the functional review were not fully implemented.

                         The current structure of the Ministry of Economy (MoE) was adopted in August 2013. It enables the MoE to adequately address the tasks assigned to the Ministry. For instance, the
                         Ministry has departments that work on policy development, macroeconomic analysis and projections, anti-corruption policy and regulatory impact analysis.



                                                                                                                                                                                                   Page 2 of 7

                         The MoE made good progress to use tools to produce macroeconomic projections and scenarios. With the support from the CBEM consultants, the MoE is now able to run and use:
                           i)       the RMSM-X model;
                          ii)       a simplified financial programing model; and
                           iii) an inflation model.

                         In addition, CBEM consultants have developed a methodology for economic forecasting at the regional level. However, there is a risk that the MoE staff might lose this potential due
                         to high turnover and overburden with daily routine.

                         The MoE also made good progress to strengthen its capacity in implementing and coordinating the government's anti-corruption action plan. The MoE has developed and approved:
                          i) a methodology on anti-corruption monitoring and evaluation system;
                          ii) a manual on monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the government's anti-corruption action plan (Order of the Minister of Economy, number 80, dated April 16,
                         2013); and
                          iii) a methodology to help individual ministries and government agencies develop and implement their own anti-corruption programs (Order of the Minister of Economy, number 89,
                         dated May 6, 2013).
                         The MoE now plays a critical role in the government in leading the anti-corruption activities.

                         The project provided support to improve the MoE’s capacity in regulatory impact analysis (RIA) but it still remains low. A CBEM consultant, in cooperation with the MoE staff,
                         prepared a new RIA methodology, which is expected to be approved by a government resolution. In addition, the CBEM consultant prepared a manual to assess the quality of RIA.

                         The MoE’s capacity for tax policy development and public investment management remains weak. CBEM consultants have developed a tax and non-tax revenues forecasting model,
                         conceptual proposals on strengthening revenue policy, and recommendations on improving public investment management. However, a little progress in these areas was due to
                         overburden of the MoE staff with daily routine and high turnover. The MoE's senior management needs to put more efforts to utilize possibilities within the project before its closure.


                         Component 3
                         Outcomes under this component have been achieved. The Wage Reform Strategy for civil and municipal servants covering 2013-2020 and an action plan for its implementation have
                         been approved by the Government (Resolution number 383, dated June 28, 2013). The Government has also adopted standards for job descriptions and qualifying requirements in
                         the civil service, and regulation for assessing performance of civil servants. In addition, the President approved a new civil and municipal services registry (Order number 145, dated
                         June 26, 2013). These documents incorporate proposals and comments from ministries and government agencies collected during presentations and round tables conducted by the
                         state personnel service in May and June 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The macroeconomic policy coordination in the government has improved at a technical level. The Government’s capacity to use technical tools to maintain a consistent
                         macroeconomic framework has increased.

                         The Ministry of Economy has enhanced its capacity to:
                         i)      develop macroeconomic projections/scenarios;
                         ii)     prepare analytical documents related to economic policy, governance, strategic planning and monitoring and evaluation system; and
                         iii)    monitor and evaluate the implementation of strategic programs and plans.

                         The State Personnel Service (SPS) has developed a program for improving the wage system for civil and municipal servants during 2013-2020, and an action plan to implement the
                         program. The action plan is being implemented.
