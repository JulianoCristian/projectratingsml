                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in establishing and institutionalizing an efficient and effective framework for formulating and implementing
                         sustainable economic policies as well as in enhancing the capacity of public institutions responsible for the development and implementation of such policies to
                         formulate and carry out the policies. [Objective as reflected in the Financing Agreement, which in substance is not different from the PAD but wordings are different.
                         The most important project objectives are: a) contribute to government-wide coherent macro-economic policy development and decision making through establishing
                         strong inter-ministerial coordination and interface; b) support process of economic policy development and implementation through enabling public institutions (and
                         particularly the MEDT, through capacity building and restructuring) to formulate sound and analytically informed policy measure and proposals; and c) support reform of
                         employment practices and wages in the civil service by building the capacity in a special task force in this area. [ These other main objectives are from the PAD but are
                         not reflected in the legal agreement except item b. although broadly in line in substance ]

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In September 2012, the government requested (i) an extension of the closing date of this project by 12 months to the end of 2013 to allow continuation and completion of the existing
                         activities and training programs, and (ii) a reallocation of project funds from the unallocated category to allow utilization of the remaining funds towards strengthening the capacity of
                         the Ministry of Economy (MoE) to help implementation of the government anti-corruption reform agenda. The authorities prioritized the anti-corruption activities by allocating more
                         than 40 percent of the remaining project budget to anti-corruption activities (component 2). The Bank approved the extension in December 2012, and reallocation of funds through
                         restructuring of the project was done in March 2013. There were no changes in the project development objectives (PDO).

                         There was a good progress in the implementation of the project although uneven within and across the components of the project during the first half of 2013. The authorities
                         strengthened the macroeconomic policy forecasting and coordination at the technical level, introduced a methodology for monitoring the implementation of the anti-corruption
                         program, set up a platform for a dialogue between the government and the civil society on anti-corruption issues, and adopted the wage reform strategy for the civil service. However,
                         they still need to make strong efforts at the political level to institutionalize mechanisms for economic decision making in many areas supported by the project.

                         Component 1
                         The coordination council on macroeconomic and investment policies under the government (CCMIP) held three meetings during the first half of 2013. At these meetings, the CCMIP
                         considered and approved the government medium-term social-economic forecasts for 2012-2014 and the medium-term budget forecasts for 2012-2014. It also considered the
                         country partnership strategies of the ADB for 2013-2017 and of the World Bank for 2014-2017.

                         While the CCMIP meets regularly, it does not meet every month as was proposed by the previous Prime Minister in May 2012. This is partially due to the government being
                         overburdened with other priorities, and the meetings of the CCMIP are rather considered as a formality. To strengthen the role of the CCMIP, the government would need to grant
                         more authority to it. The WB team keeps indicating to the head of Component 1 the importance of the regular meetings of the CCMIP to insure collective consideration of economic
                         policy issues.

                         Coordination at the technical working group under the CCMIP has been satisfactory. The technical group comprising of representatives from the ministry of economy, the ministry of
                         finance, the central bank, the statistics committee and the social fund meet regularly to update the data base for the financial programming model and agree on the assumptions for
                         and outcomes of macroeconomic forecasts.

                         To ensure better economic policy coordination between the ministries and government agencies, the PM’s office put forward a proposal of setting up an interministerial working group
                         at the level of deputy ministers and deputy heads of government agencies. This proposal has not been agreed yet.

                         The PM’s office now has the financial programming model with relevant data base as well as a manual on using this model. To institutionalize the process of the preparation of
                         macroeconomic forecasts and coordination between key economic agencies within the government, the financial programming model and its operational manual are expected to be

                         approved by a PM’s resolution soon. In addition, the PM’s office is in the process of hiring a long term consultant on econometric modeling. Econometric sub-models will be used to
                         estimate input variables to the financial programming model.

                         The technical working group together with the CBEM consultant contributed to the preparation of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development for 2013-2017, the Government
                         Action Plan for 2013, the Joint Government and NBKR Economic Policy Statement for 2013, and the Government’s Performance Report for 2012.

                         Component 2
                         The ministry of economy continues to strengthen its role in implementing and coordinating the government anti-corruption action plan. As a result, the monitoring and evaluation of
                         the implementation of anti-corruption activities have been institutionalized. The ministry of economy developed and approved a methodology on anti-corruption monitoring and
                         evaluation system, and a manual on monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the government anti-corruption action plan (Order of the minister of economy number 80
                         dated April 16, 2013). It also developed and approved a methodology to help individual ministries and government agencies develop and implement their own anti-corruption

                         programs (Order of the minister of economy number 89 dated May 6, 2013). The Ministry of Economy set up a new unit of five experts whose primary responsibilities are the
                         development and implementation of anti-corruption policy measures, and monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the anti-corruption action plan.

                         A reporting mechanism on the implementation of the anti-corruption action plan has been established. Pursuant to the government resolution number 596 dated August 30, 2012, the

                         government is to receive and consider a report on the implementation of the anti-corruption action plan every six month. The first report covering September-December 2012 was
                         prepared on January 25, 2013, and subsequently approved by the government on March 28, 2013. The second report covering the first half of 2013 was prepared and submitted to
                         the Government in July 2013.

                         A regular and formalized interaction with the civil society on anti-corruption activities has been practiced with the establishment of an anti-corruption forum to facilitate dialogue
                         between the government and the civil society (Order of the minister of economy number 3 dated January 12, 2013). The ministry of economy has hosted three meetings to discuss
                         corruption issues and incidences in the energy sector, public procurement and land registration. These meetings aimed to involve the civil society in developing and implementing
                         anti-corruption programs.

                         To enhance the capacity of government officials, the ministry of economy organized training on monitoring and evaluation methodology of the anti-corruption program in May 2013
                         and on anti-corruption policy (the anti-corruption summer school) in June 2013, which was widely attended.

                         The ministry of economy has also been working on developing anti-corruption measures in education, health care, and the social protection sector, on developing and implementing a
                         methodology for examining the legislation against corruption possibilities, and on introducing the international anti-corruption legal tools into the domestic legislation.

                         The ministry of economy continues to strengthen its capacity in regulatory impact analysis (RIA). It is now working on adapting the draft RIA manual prepared by the international
                         consultant to the Kyrgyz procedures, and planning to organize training for the technical staff in other ministries involved in RIA related activities in their respective ministries. The
                         adapted RIA manual is expected to be approved by a government resolution.

                         Progress on the fiscal modeling and forecasting sub-component and on the assessment of investment projects has been relatively slow. The lack of progress seems to have resulted
                         from meager attention on these areas from the senior management as well as the low capacity of the technical staff of the Ministry of Economy. For instance, the Ministry has made
                         very little progress on following up on the recommendations on the public investment management prepared by the international consultant. The WB team indicated the lack of
                         progress in these areas to the senior management of the Ministry, the project manager and the PIU, and strongly recommended to monitor the work of the local consultants.

                         Component 3
                         The Wage Reform Strategy for civil and municipal servants covering 2013-2020 and an action plan for its implementation have been approved by the Government (Resolution
                         number 383 dated June 28, 2013). The Government has also adopted standards for job description and qualifying requirements in the civil service, and regulation for assessing
                         performance of civil servants. In addition, the President approved a new civil and municipal services registry (Order number 145 dated June 26, 2013). These documents incorporate
                         proposals and comments from ministries and government agencies collected during presentations and round tables conducted by the state personnel service in May and June 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured to (i) extend the closing date by one year until the end of 2013, and (ii) reallocate the project funds from the unallocated category to consultancy. The
                         restructuring was aimed to complete the existing project activities and strengthen the capacity of the MoE to implement the government anti-corruption reform agenda. The
                         restructuring did not result in any changes in the project development objectives (PDO).

                         The macroeconomic policy coordination in the government has been in place. However, it needs to be further strengthened by holding regular monthly meetings of the Coordination
                         Council for Macroeconomic and Investment Policies under the Government to consider key economic issues.

                         The monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of anti-corruption activities have been institutionalized. The minister of economy Order number 3 dated January 12, 2013
                         facilitates a dialogue between the government and the civil society to involve the civil society in developing and implementing anti-corruption programs. The minister of economy
                         Order number 80 dated April 16, 2013 defines a methodology for anti-corruption monitoring and evaluation, and approves a manual for monitoring and evaluation of the
                         implementation of the anti-corruption action plan. The minister of economy Order number 89 dated May 6, 2013 approves a methodology for individual ministries and government
                         agencies for developing and implementing their own anti-corruption programs.

                         The Government adopted the measures for improving wage system for civil and municipal servants covering 2013-2020 and an action plan to implement these measures (Resolution
                         number 383 dated June 28, 2013). Furthermore, the same Government Resolution adopted standards for job description and qualifying requirements in the civil service.
