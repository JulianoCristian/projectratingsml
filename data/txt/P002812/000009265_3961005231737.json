to\n            support Tanzania's private sector-oriented mining\n            development policy and to expand private investment in\n            mining. The secondary objective is to strengthen the\n            capacity of mining institutions to efficiently administer\n            and regulate the sector. The project also aims at improving\n            productivity and environmental and social viability of\n            artisanal and small-scale miners. The project has three main\n            components: The legal, regulatory, fiscal and environmental\n            component will help introduce appropriate mining laws and\n            regulations and fiscal and environmental framework to\n            promote and guide private investment in mining. The\n            institutional strengthening component will improve\n            organizational, manpower, and logistical capacity of the\n            Mineral Resource Department (MRD), help reactivate\n            MRD's environmental and mine safety inspection, and\n            strengthen MRD's geological services including\n            publication of geological map sheets and the improvements of\n            its mineral laboratory. The small-scale mining component\n            includes a baseline data survey, the dissemination of\n            information and demonstration of simple and\n            environmentally-sensitive technologies, and training and\n            capacity building support to small-scale miners through the\n            Regional Miners Associations."}, "docdt": "1994-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
