On balance, the sustainability of various\n            components of the project is likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory. There\n            were several lessons learned. Among them: The vital\n            precondition for successful mineral sector reform is a\n            comprehensive and sustained commitment from government\n            authorities. This should be imparted to the staff of\n            sectoral institutions, in order to implant in them a strong\n            commitment to the reform and a sense of ownership and\n            repsonsibility for the reform process. Their participation\n            in seminars, workshops, training programs, and exposure to\n            best practice and experience from mining countries with\n            successful reforms would be useful for this purpose. The\n            mineral sector reform should be approached in an integrated\n            manner, especially on the main components of initiatives for\n            the reform, such as cadastral systems, extension services\n            for small-scale miners, investment promotion activties, and\n            development of basic information for promotional purposes.\n            Formulation and implementation of mineral sector technical\n            assistance programs need to address associated social\n            dimensions, incorporating consistent social strategies and\n            elements. This should be initiated during project\n            preparation, built-in throughout project implementation, and\n            subsequently continued by sectoral and related government\n            institutions over the long term."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
