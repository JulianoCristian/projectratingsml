Sixth Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Excellency: 
 
Please refer to the Loan Agreement (the Loan Agreement) between the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela (the Borrower) and International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank), dated October 12, 1995. 
 
Pursuant to your letter of request dated January 28, 2003, the Bank hereby agrees 
to amend the Loan Agreement so as to increase the Bank’s financing percentage for 
Consultants. Therefore, Category 4 (Consultant’s services including the services of the 
Extension Agents) in the table under paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement is 
modified to read “88%” instead of “60%” as reflected in Schedule 1 and set forth in the 
Annex to this Amendment Letter.   
If you agree with the foregoing amendments, please sign and date the two copies 
of this letter in the space provided below, and return to us one copy of the letter 
countersigned by you.  This amendment letter will become effective as of the date of your 
countersignature, upon receipt of a signed copy of this letter by us. 
 
Sincerely yours,
