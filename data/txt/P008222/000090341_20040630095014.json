The\n            lessons learned indicate that proposal of a co-financing\n            matrix and specification of the flow of funds is not\n            sufficient to guarantee co-financing from local governments,\n            instead specific provisions need to be made. The issue of\n            beneficiary contributions for agricultural services is more\n            difficult. In the Venezuela case, there was an attitude on\n            the part of project management that beneficiaries (poor\n            farmers) should not pay. The type of extension services most\n            requested by beneficiaries might not be what project\n            designers envisaged. Specific provision was made in the\n            Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) for Subject Matter Specialists\n            (SMS) from research institutes to respond to requests from\n            extensionists in the field. Initially this project\n            didn't focus on Gender issues. However, once the\n            extensionists started working in the communities it was\n            obvious that women could play an important part in the\n            project. The project specifically stated that the\n            municipalities and the Producer Associations (ACEs) would\n            supervise all extension contracts. Project preparation\n            overestimated the local capacity to contract, supervise and\n            evaluate the extension program. The establishment of a\n            decentralized extension program needs to be accompanied by a\n            strong training program of local organizations such as the\n            municipalities and ACEs and should be planned accordingly\n            with adequate resources."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
