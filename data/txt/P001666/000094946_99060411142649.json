The project consists of four components. 1)\n            Strengthening the road sector institutional framework will\n            support institutional development and changes in various\n            road sector agencies to accommodate the new sector policy\n            framework. It will also support capacity building and skills\n            development of road sector personnel for sustainable road\n            sector management. 2) Development of the construction and\n            consulting industries will support the establishment of the\n            National Construction Industry Council as the principal\n            stakeholder representative body for the development of the\n            local industry and will support the development and\n            implementation of action plans to address industry\n            constraints. 3) Support to sustainable periodic maintenance\n            will cover priority periodic maintenance requirements of the\n            core network to assure road infrastructure quality. 4)\n            Support to selective rehabilitation and upgrading will cover\n            a limited amount of rehabilitation of the paved road network\n            and a limited amount of earth to gravel or gravel to paved upgrading."}, "docdt": "1999-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
