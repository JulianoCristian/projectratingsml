This\n            preliminary study provides advice and guidance on the\n            requirements for environmental impact assessment and\n            mitigation in the road sector in Malawi. The report\n            discusses the context in which the road sector now operates\n            including the current legislative and administrative\n            framework. It also discusses how the road sector can address\n            the requirements and minimize the potential environment\n            impact. The report also emphasizes the importance of\n            community participation at all stages.
