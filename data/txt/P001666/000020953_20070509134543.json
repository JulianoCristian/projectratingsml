Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) With upfront agreement of core policy\n            and regulatory reforms, sector institutional development can\n            be successfully carried out, even in a weak country\n            environment provided there is a long term support to\n            implementation of second order reforms generated through\n            project activities; 2) With newly established institutions,\n            caution needs to be exercised in estimation of\n            implementation capacity and there needs to be greater\n            pro-activity on part of the Bank and the Borrower to adjust\n            to the realities on the ground; 3) Effective government\n            ownership and support from the development partners, can\n            lead to initially weak institutions being challenged to\n            deliver more than average results even under adverse\n            macroeconomic environment; 4) Continuity of task team\n            leadership and ensuring an adequate skill mix, contributes\n            positively to the outcomes of a project; and 5) For\n            successful monitoring and use of indicators, there needs to\n            be a periodic review of indicators to reflect current\n            country and Bank objectives. This is critical for projects\n            such as this where there is a long period (10 years) between\n            appraisal and project closing."}, "docdt": "2007-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
