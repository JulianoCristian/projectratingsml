3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
(i)      To assist in reducing the vulnerability of poorer rural communities through fostering opportunities
for such communities to strengthen their capacity to mobilize, implement self-help projects, collaborate
with relevant local institutions and to benefit from the returns of the communal assets they create and
maintain.

(ii)     To assist in improving the design of poverty reduction policies and programs through promoting
improvements in the system to monitor the impact of these policies on the poor.

Zimbabwe is an agricultural based economy, with about 70% of its population in rural areas, living largely
from subsistence agriculture. The project objectives were relevant to Zimbabwe, where extreme poverty
increased during the 1990s, with an estimated 35% of households living below the poverty line in 1995
compared to about 26% in 1990. Based on the total consumption poverty line, households in poverty
increased from around 40% in the late 1980s to 62% by 1995/96.

Of the many programs improving the conditions of local communities through the provision of
infrastructure or basic social services in Zimbabwe Community Action Project (CAP) was the only project
to single out the strengthening of community capacity to identify and prioritize needs; plan and implement
solutions; and manage and maintain investments as the strategy to improve the standards of living of
participating communities. A fundamental feature of CAP was the channeling of financial resources
directly to the beneficiary communities. CAP was a targeted poverty reduction project implemented in 26
of the poorest districts of Zimbabwe and was designed to support two key components of the Government
of Zimbabwe's (GOZ's) Poverty Alleviation Action Plan (PAAP): empowerment of poor communities and
poverty monitoring.

The project objective and design were consistent with the development objective of Zimbabwe's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS 1997) on poverty reduction through: (a) completing the macroeconomic agenda
of reform and private sector development for economic growth; (b) strengthening rural development and
natural resources management including the empowerment of local communities to manage economic and
social development; and (c) promoting poverty reduction through human resources investments, effective
safety nets, improved targeting and regular monitoring of welfare indicators.

CAP became effective on October 23, 1998 but 18 months later, in May 2000, disbursements to the project
were suspended because the Government of Zimbabwe defaulted on its loans to the Bank and other
international financial institutions. For these reasons, the ICR assessments are given, where applicable, and
for the 18 months the project was under implementation with IDA support.

In 2000, anticipating the arrears would be cleared by the government, the Ministry of Public Service,
Labour and Social Welfare (MPSLSW) prepared two contingency plans and loaned money to CAP to keep
it going. MPSLSW took over the project and scaled down the activities and disbanded the PIU. The Rural
District Councils (RDCs) who were implementing CAP at the local level also released the officers
responsible for CAP.

In October 2000, Zimbabwe was placed on non-accrual status by the World Bank and has remained in this
status to date.

A year and a half after disbursement were stopped, the government in the 2002 national budget allocated



                                                      - 2 -

ZWD 90 million for CAP.

The Bank closed the project and the undisbursed balances for the Credit amounting to SDR 42,299,875.49
was cancelled on December 31, 2003.

The economic crisis has worsened during the past three years and the country's arrears continue to rise.
Zimbabwe has not made any repayments and has not made any other efforts to clear its arrears to the Bank
since December 2000. These have risen to US$ 263 million as at end of February 2004. Zimbabwe's total
external arrears continue to mount reaching approximately US$ 1.5 billion as of end 2002. In 2003 the
World Bank placed Zimbabwe in a Low Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) status.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
The three components are:

I.      Community sub-projects: The component provided grants to rural communities for investment in
social and economic infrastructure (e.g. schools, clinics, boreholes etc), improved natural resources
management, and training communities and capacity building and social mobilization. CAP was a targeted
poverty reduction project using inter-district and intra-district poverty criteria for resource allocations. The
component drew on lessons from traditional approaches for organizing community efforts and elicited
communities perceptions of the poor.

The component related to the project objective for providing opportunities for poor communities to
mobilize themselves, implement self-help projects, collaborate with relevant local institutions and benefit
from the returns of the communal assets they create and maintain.

This component was established as part of the Social Development Fund (SDF). A strong coordination
with other government agencies, civil society and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) was ensured
through the SDF Advisory Board and District Review Committees. This component was implemented
through the Rural District Councils (RDCs).

II.     Poverty Monitoring: Integrated Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System (IPMAS) focus was on
commissioning studies, policy advice, dissemination and qualitative data. This component was congruent
with the objective of improving poverty analysis, poverty data and policy formulation. The project would
finance consultant services, training, a poverty study fund, equipment and operating costs. Expected
outputs were regular participatory poverty assessments, other priority studies commissioned from the study
fund, supplementary financing to upgrade ongoing data collection efforts, policy briefs to appropriate
central and local planners and dissemination of information on welfare dimensions to the public, NGOs,
academic institutions, sector associations, through newsletters, workshops, media.

The component related to the project objective of improving the design of poverty reduction policies and
programs.

The Department of Labour Research and Statistics of the MPSLSW was initially identified as the
responsible agency but subsequently, the SDF became the agency responsible for the poverty monitoring
component.




                                                     - 3 -

III.    CAP Institutional Support: Providing administrative support to the CAP Community
sub-projects component. This component financed the administrative staff, including a central CAP
Management Unit staffed by a small core of professional and highly motivated personnel, and field officers
in each participating RDC. The calibre of the technical and administrative staff included a Project
Manager who was appointed from within the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare
(MPSLSW); qualified finance and administrative staff with experience in the private sector and in NGOs;
project specialists in natural resource management, infrastructure, development and training and in
monitoring. At the field level, the PAAP officers and PAAP assistants in the RDCs, had work experience
in NGOs and local authorities.

The component related to the first project objective of reducing the vulnerability of the poor by creating self
help projects and collaborating with local institutions.

3.4 Revised Components:
Not applicable.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project quality at entry is satisfactory.

The Government appointed a Project Preparation Team (PPT) to prepare the project and a Project
Preparation Manager was hired. The Director of SDF supervised project preparation. A Steering
Committee who included representatives of groups with community-based experience, advised the Director
SDF.

The preparation work drew on lessons learnt from desk studies of existing community programs in
Zimbabwe; on a systematic client consultation of communities that focused on their perceptions of poverty
and preferred interventions; and from study tours to the Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF). The
respective Task Managers brought international experiences from Brazil and Argentina to the project
design. The project used a district ranking exercise to identify the most disadvantaged rural districts from
which the poorest 26 were targeted for project implementation.

A specialized consultant was hired to design an integrated Management Information System (MIS) and
accounting system for CAP.

Technical Handbooks on Social Infrastructure, Access Roads, Water and Sanitation and Natural Resources
Management; and the Information, Education and Communications (IEC) strategy and the methodology for
the intra-district Poverty Maps were prepared.

Given the demand-driven nature of the CAP, it was not possible to predict the specific environmental issues
that would arise as a result of the final composition of sub-projects demanded and financed under the CAP.
To minimize possible negative impacts, CAP PIU sought the assistance of the Ministry of Mines,
Environment and Tourism (MMET) in the design, execution and review of an environmental impact
assessment (EIA) of anticipated CAP investments.

The critical assumptions for risks for the development objective are that the Government remained
committed to fighting poverty as the main priority; that other projects with similar goals were successfully
implemented, and that political and economic stability was maintained.

The technical appraisal of the project was completed at pre-appraisal and subsequently the proposal to



                                                      - 4 -

upgrade the pre-appraisal mission was accepted and the project was declared appraised in January 1998.

The project was negotiated and the DCA signed on June 25, 1998. CAP was launched on August 31, 1998
through an official ceremony inaugurated by the Minister, MPSLSW.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Assessments for the outcome and achievement of the development objective is unsatisfactory and is based
on 18 months of the project.

The design of the project is appropriate for achieving the objective and outputs. Some of the expected
outcomes were a strengthening of community capacity of poor communities to organise themselves, and to
plan and implement activities responsive to their needs. The other expectation was improvements in data, in
data collection and in poverty analysis and use of such data for poverty reduction strategies.

4.2 Outputs by components:

SUPPORT



I.       Community sub-projects. The community sub-projects component is rated unsatisfactory for the
first 18 months of the project. Projected targets in terms of the numbers of community projects that should
have been approved, been under implementation and completed were high and needed revising. Project
delays occurred as a result of bottlenecks throughout the workflow from project identification by
communities, through review and approval by RDCs and the PIU, delayed feedback on project
submissions, and slow disbursements for community training and implementation of project activities. The
PIU tended to micro manage the project during the first 12 months. This, however changed and the PIU
became proactive in facilitating support to the PAAP Officers and district technical services and modified
procedures and practices. Disbursements picked up and the number of projects completed in 2000 was 91
sub-projects. Number of applications received in 1999 was 1010, 203 were received in 2000 and in 2001
the figure was 1066. The number of projects approved were 346 in 1999, 214 in 2000 and 464 in 2001.
Total cost of component US$ 60.5 million (IDA US$ 50 million; Beneficiary Communities US$ 10.5
million). Of this figure, 1,957422.11 was disbursed as grants to rural communities for investment in
social and economic infrastructure (e.g. schools, clinics, boreholes etc), improved natural resources
management, and training communities and capacity building and social mobilization.

II.      Poverty Monitoring. The Poverty Monitoring Component is rated unsatisfactory because a
condition of effectiveness - hiring a project manager for the IPMAS - was not met. In May 1999 the
MPSLSW informed the Bank that the candidate who was appointed in May 1999 failed to take up his
position. The post was re-advertised but when a suitable manager was found Zimbabwe was in arrears to
the World Bank.

Total cost of the component US$ 3.0 million (IDA US$ 3 million). IPMAS focus was on commissioning



                                                      - 5 -

studies, policy advice, dissemination and qualitative data. The project would finance consultant services,
training, a poverty study fund, equipment and operating costs. Expected outputs were regular participatory
poverty assessments, other priority studies commissioned from the study fund, supplementary financing to
upgrade ongoing data collection efforts, policy briefs to appropriate central and local planners and
dissemination of information on welfare dimensions to the public, NGOs, academic institutions, sector
associations, through newsletters, workshops, media. No policy briefs, studies or surveys were undertaken
under IPMAS.

III.     CAP Institutional Support. This component is rated satisfactory for the first 18 months because
the project assisted the RDC capacity by making administrative grants available for Poverty Alleviation
Action Programme (PAAP) field staff based in the RDCs to work on CAP. Financing was for the
administrative staff, including a central CAP Management Unit staffed by a small core of professional
personnel, and field officers in each of the 26 participating RDC. This component also financed the
capacity-building activities for CAP staff. Two courses and 9 training workshops were provided by CAP
PMU and field staff. Total cost of the component US$ 9.5 million (IDA US$ 7 million, GOZ US$ 2.5
million). The amount disbursed for operational costs was 910,768.77.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Communities contributed 20% of individual sub-project costs.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Rating negligible. The project's institutional development impact is difficult to assess because the period
was so short and when the Government took over the project in 2000 it scaled it down.

Ironically, the project was thoroughly prepared and the capacity to implement the project was available.
The Government was committed to the project and which it saw as the major component of its poverty
alleviation programme. The rating is simply a reflection of the fact that the project did not have time to
complete the work started and the structures created were disbanded. The project did not have the
opportunity to build the impact and establish practices the project had in mind. If the country had not gone
into an economic crisis, the national budget could have continued to fund the project.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
HIV prevalence in 2003 was 24.6%. The overall rate shows that Zimbabwe is undergoing one of the worst
HIV/AIDS epidemics in the entire world. It means that among those Zimbabweans aged 15-49; about one
of four is already HIV infected. Without proper treatment, those infected may progress to AIDS and may
even die eventually.

Floods in early 2000 affected many parts of the country, destroying infrastructure such as roads and
bridges in the rural areas. Several districts where CAP was being implemented were affected.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
In 1999, Zimbabwe went into a situation of negative foreign exchange inflows and in October 2000,
non-accrual status.

The fiscal deficits created an unsustainable domestic debt situation. The government domestic debt



                                                      - 6 -

required more resources for debt service reducing resources, affecting the delivery of social services.
Hyperinflation eroded budgetary allocations to social sectors.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
(i)      Procuring computers and the server for the Management Information System (MIS) was delayed
and the time it took to clear the goods with customs and excise and install the system added to the delay.
(ii)     Staff retrenchment in 2000 when the country went into arrears and the Bank suspended
disbursements to Zimbabwe. The Government retained 3 staff out of 7 specialists from CAP PIU and the
field staff resigned.
(iii)    The Information Education and Communications campaign started in 1999, several months after
the project started. The PIU could have hired NGOs and CBOs to undertake the IEC instead of relying
upon government structures.

5.4 Costs and financing:
PHRD funding for technical assistance was utilized in the design of CAP to do poverty mapping, a
systematic client consultation to identify community needs, priorities, capacity, and relationships with
existing organisations. The grant also funded visits by CAP preparation teams to other countries to learn
from social funds and draw lessons; an institutional assessment of existing institutions of government and
NGOs at central and local levels; and an IEC strategy.

Implementation was affected by the non-payment of arrears.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability rating is highly unlikely. The economic decline and political context, HIV/AIDS pandemic,
the brain drain whereby 4.5 million Zimbabweans left since 1997, a deterioration in the civil service
capacity and service delivery and a humanitarian crisis in 2002/03 affected sustainability. The project
operated with IDA funding for 18 months.

In 1996/1997 when CAP was being designed, Zimbabwe was a blend IBRD/IDA country with a good
fiscal deficit and a sound budget. In 2003 Zimbabwe became a Low Income Country Under Stress
(LICUS) according to World Bank classification.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The PIU became proactive in mobilizing resources from GOZ and donors to continue delivery of services
to communities. A Contingency Plan was prepared by the GOZ in consultation with the Bank. Twice the
GOZ made contingency funding available to CAP and the contingency funds were used to fund
sub-projects that were already under implementation and restricted to ensure that low-level activities
continued in each of the 26 districts of the project. The second contingency measure was for down-sizing
the CAP PIU and mainstreaming the PIU functions in the SDF of the MPSLSW and terminating the
services of the PAAP Assistants at district level. The GOZ contingency strategy was in the hope that when
the government cleared the arrears with the World Bank , IDA funding would be resumed.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in project identification, preparation and appraisal was satisfactory. The Bank
provided technical advice on the studies that were commissioned as part of project preparation. During
preparation and implementation, the Bank team brought its experience of social funds in more than 30


                                                      - 7 -

countries - in targeting, in community driven development, and in strengthening poverty monitoring systems
and community based natural resources management to assist in the design and implementation of CAP.

Three Task Managers at different phases, managed the project during identification to appraisal. The team
composition at appraisal included a senior social scientist who was the team leader with experience in
social funds elsewhere in Africa, senior economists, operational analysts, natural resource management
specialists, an institutional development advisor, road engineer, architect, and rural water specialist.

Studies commissioned for project preparation were inter district geographical targeting, a notional intra
district poverty targeting, an assessment of community development experiences, a participatory study on
community perceptions of poverty and likely interventions for poverty alleviation. The Bank team held
stakeholder consultations, visited NGOs and NGO funded projects, undertook field trips and held
discussions with local authorities. Bank team members on simultaneous field visits on two Bank projects,
viz CAP and the Rural District Council Capacity Building Projects (RDCCBP), exchanged staff on the
field visits as part of learning and consultation.

Community participation in project identification, selection, implementation and community contributions
was a key CAP design features. CAPs decision making processes were designed to strengthen the capacity
of existing structures within local government and the traditional village system to serve as effective
mechanisms for active participation by marginalized groups (women, landless, youth) in determining
options and priorities for alleviating poverty and the sustainable management of their natural resource base.


7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision is rated satisfactory for the year and a half the project was under implementation with
IDA funding. The Bank had at least two supervision missions a year with a mix of economists, natural
resource management specialists, poverty economists, social scientists, operational analysts, procurement
and disbursement specialists, infrastructure specialists and consultants in monitoring, institutional
development and infrastructure. There was a continuity of staff on supervision missions.

During supervision, the Bank team reported proactively on implementation problems, assessed the
development impact and the enforcement of the covenants. Intensive sessions where the Bank mission with
the PIU and the government extracted and analyzed lessons from the processing of the first group of project
proposals helped the PIU become more proactive in facilitating logistical support, technical backstopping
to the Poverty Alleviation Action Program (PAAP) Officers and district technical services, and it modified
procedures and practices, with the objective of promoting a higher volume of good quality project
proposals that can be processed at the RDC level with a minimum of delay. The Bank team undertook field
visits and commented on the contingency plan the Government prepared as a response to the arrears.

The Bank team reviewed the technical handbooks, the natural resource management handbook, notional
poverty maps, IEC strategy, Monitoring Information System (MIS) and Accounting System, gave feedback
to the government and the implementing agency on procurement plans and approved the initial three
sub-projects from each district. Missions undertook field visits to RDCs and to sub-projects and
participated in subproject launches.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory for the 18 months and supervision missions were welcomed by
government and by the implementing agency.




                                                     - 8 -

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrowers performance during preparation was satisfactory and this is reflected in the Pre-Appraisal
Mission changing its status to an Appraisal Mission and the project being effective four months after
approval.

The PAAP, presented to the donor Consultative Group in 1996 identifies the SDF as the coordinating body
for the technical implementation of Government's poverty reduction programs.

The Government constituted and appointed a Project Preparation Team (PPT) to prepare the project and a
Project Preparation Manager who was directly supervised by the Director of the SDF, and advised by
members of a core Management Committee drawn from the broader Steering Committee made up of broad
representation from groups with community-based experience.

Project Preparation Team comprised the manager, finance and accounting officer, project officer and a
secretary became the PPT at the outset who were assisted by an international institutional development
advisor.

An Operational Manual for the Community Action Project was developed during project preparation.

The CAP was implemented through the Rural District Councils who reviewed and approved sub projects
up to $50,000 and were one of three signatories to the CMC sub project account.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
GOZ performance is rated unsatisfactory. Zimbabwe going into arrears adversely affected community
development in the poorest rural districts of the country. Notwithstanding this, had the economy not gone
into a crisis, the national budget could have continued to fund CAP.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agency, the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare,
was satisfactory for the 18 months of the project.

CAP hired well qualified and experienced technical and financial staff in the PIU and at the districts.
Annual work programs and budgets were submitted on time, Special Bank accounts were established and
appropriate records, statements and auditing done. Three quarterly and one annual report, were produced.
Generally and given the short period of operations, the PIU performed well and specifically in the areas of
community mobilization, training, project awareness and community participation. It is difficult to assess
the impact on the ground given the few projects that were implemented and the communities reached.

When Zimbabwe fell into arrears, the implementing agency (Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social
Welfare and the PIU) became proactive by devising a strategy to continue implementing CAP, assuming
arrears would soon be cleared. When it became apparent that the GOZ were not going to clear arrears in
the foreseeable future, the MPSLSW in 2002 received public funds from the national budget to implement
CAP sub-projects but on a vastly reduced scale.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower's performance is rated unsatisfactory. The overall assessment is on government as the
borrower who having requested for a project to promote community development as part of its poverty
alleviation programme, created circumstances that made it difficult to implement the project.

8. Lessons Learned

l Empowering communities was very successful and critical for the success of this project. The
    channeling of funds from the PIU through the Rural District Councils (RDCs) to the community
    project account was unique in Zimbabwe and became popular in promoting a bottom up approach to
    development. The synergy between the communities and the local authorities raised the communities
    enthusiasm and brought about better results in community mobilization, as well as motivated CPCs.
    The capacity of the RDCs enhanced as they responded to community demands. RDCs started doing
    intra district notional poverty maps.

l Champions in government were critical for manifesting government ownership and the country still has
    good technical people who are committed to improving the quality of peoples lives. The Government
    for example, continued to fund CAP from the national budget disbursing funds to communities directly,
    following the CAP Operational Manual, although the funds were a one time payment and not given in
    tranches.

l Clear guidance on how to deal with ICR processing in a situation where the project was cancelled.
    Guidance would assist in preparing an ICR before the institutional memory is lost.
