modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that empowering\n            communities was very successful and critical for the success\n            of this project. The channeling of funds from the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) through the Rural District\n            Councils (RDCs) to the community project account was unique\n            in Zimbabwe and became popular in promoting a bottom up\n            approach to development. Champions in government were\n            critical for manifesting government ownership and the\n            country still has good technical people who are committed to\n            improving the quality of peoples lives. The Government for\n            example, continued to fund Community Action Project (CAP)\n            from the national budget disbursing funds to communities\n            directly, following the CAP Operational Manual, although the\n            funds were a one time payment and not given in tranches.\n            Clear guidance on how to deal with ICR processing in a\n            situation where the project was cancelled. Guidance would\n            assist in preparing an ICR before the institutional memory\n            is lost."}, "docdt": "2004-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
