Commitment of\n            the Borrower and other beneficiaries are essential in any\n            project. Staffing continuity facilitates project\n            implementation and the achievement of its objectives.\n            Coordination with other international financial institutions\n            and donors should be maintained to ensure consistency of\n            approach and to avoid duplication of efforts. Technical\n            assistance projects should be targeted and linked to\n            specific assistance needed to advance a reform agenda but\n            some flexibility in design should be maintained to respond\n            to evolving needs. The careful selection of indicators and\n            their relation to the desired outcome facilitates monitoring\n            of progress, allows timely actions to be taken to make corrections."}, "docdt": "2005-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
