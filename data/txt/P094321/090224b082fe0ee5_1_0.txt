F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives
The Project Development Objectives (PDO), as stated in the Loan Agreement, are: to assist the
borrower in (i) improving the competitiveness of rural productive supply chains with strong
indigenous participation and (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the public entities
participating in the Program for the adoption of a territorial management model with indigenous
participation.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
N/A.
    (i) PDO Indicators:
The Level One Restructuring approved by the Board on June 30, 2011, revised the Results
Framework, dropped one PDO indicator, and added a new one. It added eight Intermediate
Outcome Indicators (IOI), revisited three, dropped five, and retained eight original indicators. The
closing date however remained unchanged at February 1, 2013. The fourth project restructuring,
approved on March 29, 2013, revisited the target values for the two PDO indicators, revisited six
IOI (rewording them or changing the target value), and split one IOI into two. The closing date
was extended by six months to July 31, 2014.

1 The project documentation refers to an “increase in total sales “with” instead of “of” US$50m. In the 2011
restructuring, an attempt was made to reword the indicator as follows: “Increase in annual sales of producer
organizations of US$50m.” However, the indicator was recorded as originally stated in all ISRs; in the project
restructuring that took place in March 2013, it was recorded as originally set using the word “with.”
                      Partially achieved (47%). The revised target value (US$35m) was not
                      fully achieved during the life of the project. However, in percentage terms,
                      the aggregate incremental increase represents 64 % of the initial sales value
                      of the partnerships at the approval stage of the Business Plans (BPs).
                      Aggregate increase in sales for horticulture and coffee BPs (subsectors
                      sharing 72% of PDER investments in BPs) were estimated at 76% and 56%,
                      respectively. Several considerations are relevant here. First, considering the
                      initial sales of the beneficiary rural producer organizations (RPOs), the
                      target value for the indicator was ambitious (an increment of approximately
                      106% in relation to the base value). Second, the total target value of
Comments (incl. %     increased sales at project end was generated by a lower number of
achievement)          partnerships (164) than originally anticipated (minimum 200). The number
                      was lower because 27 partnerships focused only on training and not on
                      productive investments, 15 were cancelled, and 10 did not generate
                      increased sales (half of these involved coffee and cardamom, which
                      experienced declining international prices and yields; coffee yields were
                      reduced by disease (rust—roya) and cardamom by pests (thrips)). Third,
                      because the investments were demand-driven, some (9%) involved low-
                      value commodities (13 BPs on basic grains), generating lower sales values.
                      Finally, considering that 61% of the investments in partnerships were made
                      in 2013–14, the likelihood that the value of sales increased after the project
                      closed is high, as suggested by the economic and financial evaluation.

I. Disbursement Profile
1.       Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal
1.      Country and Sector Background. At project appraisal in 2006, Guatemala was the Latin
American country with the highest level of inequality, particularly in rural areas, where 61% of
the population lived. At the time, about 74% of the rural population faced poverty (24% faced
extreme poverty), and high rates of illiteracy prevailed (43%). Poverty was (and still is)
particularly high among indigenous populations, 80% of whom lived in rural areas. Poor
development and social indicators were the legacy of the country’s difficult colonial past and the
debilitating civil war, which ended in 1996. Progress was slow yet steady as the country
continued to overcome profound challenges to consolidate democracy and address issues related
to equity, inclusion, growth, and the establishment of credible public institutions.

2.      The development of a consensus on a national rural development strategy, as well as on
the implementation of rural programs, was high on the political agenda from the time that the
1996 Peace Accords were signed. The government was focused on developing a coherent,
overarching strategy, supported by well-resourced and well-managed programs, to have the
highest impact on poverty reduction in rural areas. To that end, a number of studies and reports
provided guidance to the government on its Strategic Agenda for Integrated Rural Development
(Agenda Estratégica para el Desarrollo Rural Integral), approved in March 2005. A key element
of the strategy was a vision for rural development that extended beyond agriculture to adopt a
more comprehensive approach based on the development of institutions and infrastructure and the
promotion of opportunities for broad-based growth in rural areas. One of the programs supporting
this strategy was the Rural Economic Development Program, known as Desarrollo Económico
desde lo Rural (PDER).2

3.     Rationale for Bank Involvement. In March 2005, the Government of Guatemala
requested the World Bank (IBRD) and Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) loans to
finance the PDER program, to be implemented between 2006 and 2011. Both development banks
had extensive experience in rural development and were expected to play an important role in
helping the government to apply a more coordinated, effective development approach at the local
level. Investments by IBRD and IADB were complemented by a US$6.0m grant to the
Presidential Secretariat for Planning and Programming (SEGEPLAN) by the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (ASDI/SIDA). The World Bank also provided a
PHRD3 project preparation grant to SEGEPLAN.

4.      Prior to 2005, and upon request from the Government of Guatemala, the World Bank had
prepared a number of studies and sector strategy notes to guide policy formulation. They included
a study on the drivers of sustainable rural growth and poverty reduction, which highlighted that
despite the agricultural sector’s erratic performance in the past, considerable potential for
agricultural growth existed (for example, in the non-traditional export sector). The study
concluded that if agricultural growth was broad-based, forward and backward linkages to

2 The four underlying principles of the program were: (i) adoption of a demand-driven approach emphasizing the

fundamental role of local actors in promoting economic development; (ii) encouragement of public-private-civil society
partnerships for local development planning and implementation; (iii) promotion of intercultural relationships and the
effective integration of the indigenous population; and (iv) strengthening of modern, democratic, and pluralistic public
multi-sector institutions.
3 Japan Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD), US$1.47m.

agriculture could be strong catalysts of growth. Another relevant document—the “Rural
Infrastructure for Rural Development Policy Note”—emphasized the importance of integrating
infrastructure programs with the provision of financing (micro-credit) and technical assistance to
develop local industries and micro-enterprises at the territorial level. The note also identified
potential policy reforms, including passage of a water law and a rural transport strategy as well as
second-generation electricity and information and communication technology (ICT) reforms.
Bank-managed studies funded by grants helped to identify the extent to which ICT services were
under-provided in rural areas (the “digital divide”). At the time, Guatemala had one of the lowest
Internet penetration rates in the region.

5.      The FY2005–08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was developed to support the
economic policy program known as Vamos Guatemala, which rested on three strategic pillars:
Guate Solidaria, Guate Verde, and Guate Crece/Compite. The project was expected to have a
positive impact on increasing the competitiveness of rural-based productive activities, which in
turn would foster enterprise expansion and export growth, in alignment with the Guate
Crece/Compite (Growth/Compete) pillar.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
6.       The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were as follows: (i) to improve the
competitiveness of rural productive supply chains with strong indigenous participation and (ii) to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the public agencies participating in the program for the
adoption of a participatory territorial management model (TMM) with indigenous involvement.
The two PDO indicators were:
(i) Increase in total sales of the rural productive supply chain partnerships with [of] US$50m
     during the project period.
(ii) 30% of the municipal planning offices participating in the program have a territorial
     management plan.

1.3      Revised PDO, Revised Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justifications4
7.      The PDOs remained unchanged throughout the life of the project. The Level One
Restructuring approved by the Board on June 2011, dropped one PDO outcome indicator (30% of
the municipal planning offices have a territorial management plan), and added a new one (At
least 5% of municipal projects in the 2012 budget stem from the participatory planning process).
The change was justified by the need to reflect the outcome, not the output that the project sought
to achieve, as well as to better capture the expected results of people’s participation. The project
continued monitoring the number of municipalities with territorial/municipal management plans,
however, as an intermediary outcome indicator (IOI).

8.       The fourth project restructuring (March 2013) revised the target values of both PDO
outcome indicators. It reduced the target value of the sales indicator from US$50m to US$35m to
reflect the project’s new budgetary realities, resulting from the cancellation of nearly half of
IADB’s loan.5 The second PDO indicator was slightly reworded (having previously been changed

4 Details on the changes in the project’s Results Framework is presented in Annex 10.
5 The initial project allocation to Component 1 was US$53m, of which US$27.3m were from IBRD and US$26.3m
from IADB. According to the project documentation, MINECO’s new leadership decided to cancel Subcomponent 1.2
(US$8m provided by IADB) in November 2012, because the activities to be supported extended the established closing
date of the loan and IADB had decided not to extend the closing date. Another reason provided in the project
documentation was that MINECO already had programs on financing SMEs. With the delays to the project’s start and




                                                        2
in the June 2011 restructuring, as indicated) to reflect the correct project closing date, and the
target value was increased from 5% to 25%, as the initial figure had already been surpassed. The
new indicator reads: “At least 25% of municipal projects stem from the participatory planning
process.” (It was previously recorded as: “At least 5% of municipal projects in the 2012 budget
stem from the participatory planning process”).

9.      The list of IOIs was also modified at both restructurings to make them clearer (because
they had become obsolete or because of the cancellation of subcomponents), to reflect delays in
project effectiveness, or to account for the reallocation and/or partial cancellation of funds within
subcomponents.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries
10.      It was expected that 80% of 45,000 beneficiaries of supply-chain partnerships would be
indigenous people. The target value of partnership beneficiaries was reduced to 30,000 in the
fourth project restructuring, in accordance with the reduction in the project’s budget. The
telecommunications component was expected to have more than 3.5 million direct beneficiaries
living in un-served or underserved rural communities within the project area. The initial project
area covered eight departments/provinces with high population densities and poverty rates.6

1.5      Original Components (as approved)
11.      Component 1: Investments in Productive Supply Chains (US$53.6m; IBRD US$27.3
m; IADB US$26.3m). This component aimed to increase the incomes of a mostly indigenous
rural population through investments coordinated over time and across geographical areas to
benefit rural producer organizations (RPOs). The component was to be implemented through four
subcomponents:
a. Subcomponent 1.1: Entrepreneur Development Services (US$13.5m; US$5.4m financed by
    IBRD). This subcomponent, to be implemented by the Ministry of the Economy,7 aimed to
    facilitate greater access by RPOs to markets and develop their links to productive chains
    through market intelligence, technical assistance (TA) and operational (seed) capital.
b. Subcomponent 1.2: Access to Financial Services (US$8m, to be financed entirely by IADB).
    This subcomponent aimed at: (i) strengthening the capacity of MINECO to help micro-
    enterprises access financial services; (ii) providing technical assistance (TA) and incentives
    for intermediary financial institutions to adjust their services to better meet the needs of
    RPOs; (iii) providing TA to RPOs to comply with the requirements of financial
    intermediaries; and (iv) establishing a line of credit for eligible financial intermediaries at
    market interest rates.
c. Subcomponent 1.3: Access to Productive Rural Infrastructure (public and collective)
    (US$16.4m; US$6.2m financed by IBRD). The role of this subcomponent, which was to be
    implemented by the Social Investment Fund (FIS), was to finance small and collective public
    rural infrastructure8 to improve the competitiveness of participating RPOs.

IADB’s initial decision not to extend the loan beyond January 2013, IADB pulled back a total of US$13.4m (around
49% of IADB’s planned contribution to Component 1 and 25% of the total amount for that component). This reduction
in resources was reflected in a proportional reduction of the PDO1 outcome indicator target value.
6 San Marcos; Huehuetenango; Solalá; Quetzaltenango; Totonicapán; Chimaltenango; Sacatepequez; and Alta Verapaz.

These primarily rural departments accounted at the time for 30% of the national population, 45% of the poor, and 50%
of the extreme poor.
7 Specifically through the Vice Ministry for Development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.
8 Examples of small infrastructure include small-scale irrigation systems, rehabilitation of feeder roads, and improved

electricity connections. Examples of collective infrastructure include storage facilities and distribution centers.




                                                          3
d. Subcomponent 1.4: Information and communications technology investments (ICT)
   (US$15.7m, financed entirely by IBRD). This subcomponent, to be implemented through the
   FONDETEL, 9 would extend basic infrastructure for telephony and broadband Internet
   connectivity to small municipalities in rural areas.

12.      Component 2: Strengthening of the Territorial Public Management Capacities for
Competitiveness (US$3.5m; IBRD US$1.4m; IADB US$2.1m). This component aimed at
developing the TMM to influence national and sectorial policies as well as public investment
priorities. Implementation of the model was to be based on participatory principles and was
expected build on and better coordinate processes10 within SEGEPLAN, but under a territorial
approach.

13.      Component 3: Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$2.8m; IBRD
US$1.22m; IADB US$1.6m). The role of this component was to ensure that project management
capacity was in place and that an effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was
established and maintained.
1.6      Revised Components
14.      Component 1 experienced significant changes during implementation, as it was
ultimately reduced to two subcomponents rather than the four originally planned. Subcomponent
1.2, which never started,11 was cancelled at the government’s request in 2012 (fully funded by
IADB). Subcomponent 1.4 (fully funded by IBRD) was suspended and later cancelled (June
2011) at the government’s request, as landlines were continuously replaced by privately operated
and more widespread cellular network infrastructure. 12 With the pressing need to finance
infrastructure following the devastating impacts of Tropical Storm Agatha, funds from
Subcomponent 1.4 (about US$15.4m) were reallocated, mainly to Subcomponent 1.3 (91%), with
the remainder applied to Component 2 (second restructuring, June 2011). The financial execution
of the project is presented in Annex 1 (including original allocations by
component/subcomponent).
1.7      Other Significant Changes
15.     Executing agency for Subcomponent 1.3. At project approval, FIS13 was responsible
for Subcomponent 1.3. FIS had proven implementation capacity, demonstrated earlier during the
emergency response to Hurricane Mitch (1999). Both the World Bank and IADB had previously
supported the institution, but during preparation it was uncertain if FIS would continue to exist
(previously, Congress had extended its lifespan). The National Peace Fund (Fondo Nacional de la
Paz—FONAPAZ) was an alternative, but it was regarded as a weak institution. During the period
between Board approval of the project (March 2006) and its ratification by the Congress of
Guatemala (November 2007), the government abolished FIS and requested a change in the loan
agreement to transfer responsibility for implementing Subcomponent 1.3 from FIS to FONAPAZ.

9  The Telecommunications Development Fund (FONDATEL), Ministry of Communications, Infrastructure and
Housing (CIV).
10 The National System of Strategic Territorial Planning (SINPET); the National System of Pre-investment Support

(SINAPRE); and the National System of Public Investment (SNIP).
11 As mentioned, MINECO’s new directors decided to cancel Subcomponent 1.2, in Nov 2012, because the activities to

be supported extended the established closing date of the loan and IADB had decided not to extend the closing date.
Another reason provided in the project documentation is that MINECO already had programs on financing SMEs.
12 Under Subcomponent 1.4, only US$82,500 was used to undertake studies to determine if the subcomponent

indicators had already been achieved through private sector investments and to generate lessons learned.
13 FIS’s core mission was to finance basic social and economic infrastructure for the poorest communities.




                                                        4
The government dissolved FONAPAZ in early 2013, and its remaining resources and project
implementation responsibilities, with regard to productive (collective) infrastructure, were
transferred to MINECO from April 2013 until the project closed in December 2014.

16.      Reallocation of funds from Subcomponent 1.4 to Subcomponent 1.3. With the
reallocation of funds from the telecommunications subcomponent (Subcomponent 1.4) to help
respond to the impacts of Tropical Storm Agatha, FONAPAZ’s activities focused on rebuilding
and rehabilitating public infrastructure (mainly bridges) not specifically related to BPs, but
aligned with the objective of the project of strengthening supply chain competitiveness, as the
investments would allow communities all over the country, including initial project targeted
areas, to maintain connectivity to markets and other services.

17.      Creation of Project Management Units (PMUs) in the co-executing agencies. The
original project design strengthened capacity at the project coordinating level within
SEGEPLAN. Soon it became evident, however, that PMUs, including financial and procurement
units, were needed at the co-executing agencies, and they were created through the first project
restructuring in April 2009.

18.      Partial cancellation and subsequent reallocation of IADB’s loan. Delays in
implementing the project and MINECO’s decision not to go ahead with Subcomponent 1.2
(Finance) led IADB to partially cancel US$13.3m. In October 2014, the government requested
the reactivation of these funds to support activities under PDER subcomponent 1.3 and
component 2, as well as activities and investments in the Chixoy watershed. IADB approved the
request. At project closing, IADB and the Government of Guatemala were discussing further
details of the scope of the activities to be supported.

19.      Extension of the project’s closing date and expansion of the project area. The initial
closing date of IBRD’s loan was January 2013; and October 2011 for IADB’s loan. IBRD
extended the closing date to January 2014 to allow ongoing and planned BPs to be implemented
(November 2012—third project restructuring). A second extension of the closing date to July
2014 was requested and granted (fourth project restructuring). A third extension to December
2014 was granted (sixth project restructuring). The accumulated extension period did not exceed
two years. IADB, on the other hand, extended the closing date of its loan from October 2011 to
January 2013 to allow for reconstruction efforts; a second extension was granted until August
2013, and a third one until October 2014. With approval of the re-allocation of the funds that
were partially cancelled in 2012, the closing date of IADB’s loan has now been extended to
October 23, 2016. IADB expanded the project area in 2010 to include nationwide coverage in
response to Tropical Storm Agatha, with IBRD following suit in 2011 (second project
restructuring).
2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

20.     Background analysis. IBRD and IADB responded to the government’s request for
support to operationalize a vision for rural development that was emerging throughout the region,
anchored in the integrated development of the territories as a means to reduce inequality and
achieve poverty reduction goals. In Guatemala, key pieces of analytical work, some of which
were funded by the World Bank as described in the PAD, supported the need to build synergies
around targeted multi-sectoral investments that would translate into important development
outcomes at the territorial level. The project was proposed with an initial focus on selected



                                               5
territories in Guatemala with the potential to generate short-term economic growth linked to
poverty reduction.14 Sectoral and cross-sectoral analytical work and lessons from implementing
earlier projects helped shape the rural development strategy and the award-winning project
design, which, as described later, was a pioneering effort in Guatemala to promote a holistic
approach to improving competitiveness.15

21.      The multi-sectoral team prepared the project in 10 months (June 2005 to March 2006).
The project’s preparation and subsequent implementation were affected by turnover in the
political sphere and complex decision-making processes. Preparation was hampered by
SEGEPLAN’s refusal to allow preparation teams to carry out field visits. 16 Although project
approval was delayed for more than a year in the Guatemalan Congress, such a delay was not
unusual. The project started implementation right after effectiveness (in November 2007) under a
grant provided by SIDA.

22.      Institutional arrangements (Annex 2). Reflecting agency mandates and responsibilities,
the project’s institutional arrangements were divided among several agencies. SEGEPLAN was
designated as the overall coordinating agency for the project, and specific components were to be
undertaken by the co-executing agencies (SEGEPLAN, FIS, MINECO, and CIV/FONDETEL).
Despite Component 1’s strong focus on investments in agricultural supply chains, SEGEPLAN
was reluctant to involve the Ministry of Agriculture (MAGA) and suggested the Vice-Ministry of
MiPyMES17 at MINECO as the implementing agency for Subcomponents 1.1 and 1.2., because of
its role in the country’s economic development and competitiveness agenda and the Agency’s
leadership in the implementation of the National Competitiveness Program (PRONACOM).18

23.     The project team included a provision in the legal agreement to review the effectiveness
of the implementation arrangements after two years. With the closing of FIS, the need to revise
those arrangements materialized just a few months after Board approval, and responsibility for
implementing Subcomponent 1.3 passed to FONAPAZ. Although the preparation of a
contingency plan for transferring responsibilities from FIS to FONAPAZ would have been useful
during preparation, it would not necessarily have led to a better outcome, as FONAPAZ was
known to have poor capacity. In general, FONAPAZ was very slow in implementing
Subcomponent 1.3 and was eventually closed in early 2013.

24.     Plans for strengthening the capacity of the implementing agencies included only
SEGEPLAN.19 On the other hand, MINECO, CIV/FONDETEL, and FIS (later FONAPAZ) were
to execute many of their activities through external contracts and using their current capacity. For
example, for the activities under Subcomponent 1.1., MINECO was expected to rely on
AGEXPORT (Asociación Guatemala de Exportadores), which had wide experience in

14 Including territories combining high densities of poor people and high numbers of indigenous people, with relatively

well-distributed land and basic infrastructure, and with the presence of relatively higher-than-average economic
dynamism.

16 Prior to launching the project, only two short field trips and one unofficial meeting with indigenous groups were

carried out.
17 Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises.
18 MAGA’s lack of involvement had no major repercussions on the project’s implementation but the lack of

coordination between MINECO and MAGA provides no opportunity for addressing key competitiveness constraints of
agri-supply chains (phytosanitary issues, for example). Links between the two ministries were promoted in the later
years of implementation.

specialists at the respective units within SEGEPLAN.

implementing market-linkages projects. A revision of institutional arrangements for
implementation eventually resulted in the establishment of PMUs at each of the co-executing
agencies, which required an amendment to the original loan agreement (first restructuring, April
2009).

25.     Project Design. The project sought to improve rural competitiveness and enhance
capacity for territorial planning/management through activities under two components. Under
Component 1, the project attempted to scale up (with public funds) an approach known as
“productive linkages” (encadenamientos productivos). The approach had been promoted for
several years by private entities (especially AGEXPORT), and focused on enhancing supply-
chain competitiveness by strengthening the internal capacity of RPOs to improve market access
(and/or access new markets). The project design brought additional innovations by linking
localized partnerships investments with broad productive and public infrastructure investments,
therefore, promoting a holistic approach to competitiveness through multisectoral investments.
MINECO was to recruit Business Services Partners (SDEs—Socios de Desarrollo Empresarial)
through a competitive process; the RPOs and their commercial partners, with the support of the
SDEs, were to draw up BPs detailing their needs for entrepreneurial and financial services as well
as business and public-related infrastructure and, where applicable, telecommunications-related
services. Examples of supply-chains or sectors expected to be targeted by the project included:
handicrafts, coffee, lettuce, snow peas, tomatoes, lemons, and honey (all high-value commodities
or sectors). The BPs were expected to play a central role in operationalizing the project design by
aligning the investments made at a broad level with more localized investments specific to the
BPs. This expectation added unnecessary complexity to the project design. The decision to divide
BP-specific investments between two agencies (MINECO and FONAPAZ) also added
complexity during implementation.

26.      Component 2 was conceived as a means of piloting a new model of public management
focused on territorial competitiveness and development (TMM) and on establishing the
institutional and operational basis to implement the model. Over the long term, territorial
planning was expected to help prioritize investments and improve competitiveness. Although the
need for territorial planning to prioritize investments under Component 1 was discussed early in
the preparation phase, the project preparation team rightly decided to run the two components in
parallel and not to link them. The design and operationalization of Component 2 was simple and
appropriate to its pilot nature. However, the expansion of project’s area nationwide in June 2011,
gave a higher dimension to this component, beyond its pilot nature, as it ended-up supporting the
creation and operationalization of the National Planning System (SNP).

27.      Project Objectives and Indicators. The PDOs were appropriate, relevant, and important
to the country, aligned with the government’s rural territorial development agenda as well as its
goals related to poverty reduction and inclusiveness. Yet the PDO outcome indicators had some
shortcomings, especially in relation to the outcome indicators for PDO1. The gains to be made as
a result of Component 1 investments—comprising 89% of the project budget, as stated in the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD)20—were to be measured only as a function of the incremental
sales of the RPOs supported through BPs (300 BPs- reduced later to 200), which were anticipated
to generate an increase in sales value of US$50m (a net increase of US$166,700 per BP). The
contributions to PDO objectives resulting from improved infrastructure, especially from the broad
investments in telecommunications (which represented one-quarter of project investments and
one-half of the IBRD loan), were not captured by the PDO level indicators set at appraisal. The

20   Final investments under Component 1 represented 75.4% of project investments.




                                                           7
2011 Level One restructuring, mainly for the reconstruction/rehabilitation of bridges affected by
Tropical Storm Agatha, did not add indicators at the PDO level to reflect the outcomes of this
substantial reallocation of investments from Subcomponent 1.4. The gains to be made from
investments in public infrastructure were to be captured by the IOI set at appraisal and reworded
to capture a broad range of beneficiaries beyond those linked to BPs—“100% of the beneficiaries
of the improvements in rural roads have access during the whole year to critical markets.”21

28.     Government Commitment. The project was approved by Congress in November 2007,
before the new government took office in January 2008. However, the new administration did not
agree with the project’s design and implementation arrangements (particularly in relation to
Subcomponent 1.1)22 and did not provide the project with the fiscal space to operate.23 Once these
discrepancies were resolved and PMUs were established in each of the executing agencies, the
loan was reinstated in April 2009; almost twenty months after Board approval.

29.      Risk Assessment. The project’s risk level at the Board presentation was deemed
“substantial” for several reasons: (i) the innovative nature of the approach to Component 1,
specifically the concept of linking RPOs to markets through the alignment of localized as well as
broad investments in productive and public infrastructure; (ii) conditions within the country
resulting from the upcoming elections; and (iii) insufficient institutional capacity in some
participating agencies to implement a complex project adequately, including a lack of experience
in fiduciary matters. The preparation team introduced measures to mitigate some of the potential
risks to project implementation and outcomes, such as the provisions discussed earlier to review
the effectiveness of the implementation arrangements after two years. The Bank also managed to
modify the government’s expectations regarding the size of the investments to be made,
substantially reducing the loan amount from US$300m (the original request) to US$60m
(US$30m from each development bank).
2.2.      Implementation Factors Influencing Project Implementation
30. External Factors
a.       Political instability. The project implementation period covered three national
administrations; it was prepared during the government of Oscar Berger (2004–07) and
implemented during the administrations of Álvaro Colom (2008–11) and Otto Pérez Molina
(2012–15). The period of greatest instability for the project occurred between 2008 and 2012,
owing to each successive administration’s mistrust of processes carried out by its predecessor,
which led to requests for external audits and changes in project staff and delayed progress.24
During those years, responsibilities for implementing the subcomponents were reassigned both
within and between agencies, and in certain periods the fiscal space for operationalizing the
project was limited.
b.       Tropical Storm Agatha (2010) 25 had important implications for the project, as its
infrastructure investments were redirected toward the rehabilitation of bridges damaged by the
storm. Strictly speaking, the transfer of funds to rehabilitate public infrastructure did not imply a

21 The original IOI read: “100% of the participating partners whose improvements in roads have been approved have
access during the whole year to critical markets.”
22 The incoming administration at MINECO was interested in agro-industrial complexes and undertaking a number of

studies. Also, it did not agree with hiring private operators to implement activities under the component.
23 The implication being that limited budget allocations for implementing the project were included in the national

annual budget approved by Congress.
24 Between 2008 and 2012, MINECO's minister changed five times.
25 The storm generated considerable losses to the country and, according to recent studies, contributed significantly to

the increase in poverty that Guatemala experienced during the 2006-2011 period.




                                                            8
major change in the project’s design, because the construction of infrastructure such as feeder
roads was already anticipated under Subcomponent 1.3. The major challenge was rather to align
BPs with infrastructure investments, as reconstruction needs (among other factors) guided the
prioritization of investments.26 The project’s expansion to nationwide coverage, also a result of
Agatha, placed additional pressure on the PMUs as co-executing agencies and required greater
capacity for implementation and monitoring. At FONAPAZ, these pressures delayed
implementation.
c.       Price movements and disease outbreaks. Twenty-nine percent of the investments
through BPs involved the coffee supply chain. Gains from those investments have been reduced
by significant declines in coffee prices since 2011; additionally, coffee yields (and therefore
sales) suffered from an unexpected outbreak of rust (roya) in 2012/13. Plantations at lower
elevations (and planted with susceptible varieties) were affected more severely, although they are
recovering as a result of improved management and pest control. The project supported fewer
partnerships for cardamom production, but again low international prices and an outbreak of pests
(thrips) affected the crop nationwide, with implications for the performance of BPs.

31. Internal Factors
a.       Weak institutional capacity and changes of personnel in the implementing agencies
affected the project’s progress between 2008 and 2012. The project’s performance was hindered
by changes in responsibilities within the implementing agencies, changes in project staff, and the
lack of clear implementation procedures. These factors especially affected activities under
Component 1.
b.       The slow speed of implementation of subcomponent 1.3 by FONAPAZ, affected the
project ratings assigned by the Banks during year 2012 (MU/U). The project’s mid-term review
in June 2012, provided key recommendations to accelerate progress, including the transfer of
funds by FONAPAZ to the RPOs for the building of productive infrastructure aligned to BPs;
MINECO would assume responsibility in the implementation of Subcomponent 1.3, after
FONAPAZ closing, early in 2013. The approach initiated by FONAPAZ and implemented by
MINECO fostered greater responsibility and ownership in RPOs for building infrastructure and
proved very successful. Furthermore, MINECO was better able to coordinate integrated support
to RPOs as indicated within the BPs (TA, grants, infrastructure needs).27
c.      Stability of project staff and critical procedural improvements contributed to strong
performance during the last two-and-a-half years of project execution. The stability in project
staffing at MINECO from late 2012 to the end of the project contributed to the strong
performance and important outcomes of Component 1 during that period. Critical procedural
improvements also contributed to the positive performance during that period, including: i)
procedures put in place in 2011 and validated in subsequent years provided clarity and
contributed to smooth implementation of BPs; 28 ii) changes in the Operational Manual provided
flexibility for MINECO to engage with a wider number of service providers. The project initially
worked with a small number of SDEs, but eventually engaged with 25 SDEs; this significantly
helped to accelerate implementation; and iii) during the last years of project implementation,
MINECO worked with only one source of funding (IBRD), which simplified procedures and
made it easier to implement BPs.

26A detailed methodology was designed by the Project for the prioritization of the rehabilitation efforts.
27The MTR also recommended to extend project duration to allow for the implementation of approved BPs and
requested MINECO to prepare a proposal for the modification of the target values for the indicators related to
Subcomponent 1.1.
28Examples include the clear composition of beneficiary contributions and delivery mechanisms for the
seed/operational capital.

d.       Highly successful implementation of Component 2 throughout the project’s life. The
successful implementation of this component reflected the simplicity of its implementation
arrangements and the alignment of its activities with long-term national objectives to build
institutional capacity for territorial planning/management. The external independent project mid-
term review carried out between August-October 2012, highlighted the relevance of the
achievements of Component 2, in terms of establishing the first phase of the SNP, through a
participatory exercise in almost all municipalities of the country. To contribute to the next steps
of the development/consolidation of the SNP, it was critical to extend the duration of the project,
the evaluation concluded.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
1.       Design. The monitoring arrangements described in the PAD were in accordance with
generally accepted practices. The arrangements were expected to facilitate the monitoring of
outcomes and allow for continuous assessment of progress to learn and make adjustments as
needed. The arrangements included the establishment of a decentralized and centralized M&E
information system to generate information on implementation in real time. The M&E system
was to be centralized at SEGEPLAN, but fed by the individual co-implementing agencies. The
SDEs were responsible of reporting progress to MINECO on BP’s implementation and related
indicators. This information was verified through regular field visits by project’s supervisory staff
(twice a month to each BP); the information gathered through field visits was sent to SEGEPLAN
to be input in the project monitoring system. For the construction of public infrastructure,
personnel from FONAPAZ was responsible of technical supervision; environmental performance
of public infrastructure subprojects was responsibility of FONAPAZ, but was also supported by
staff from SEGEPLAN.

2.      Implementation and utilization. The M&E system was implemented through a SAP
Business Object Platform, which became a very useful source of relevant information for the
preparation of project progress reports and was accessible 24 hours a day. The platform was
extremely helpful for overall project monitoring and made it possible to follow up on the IOIs,
including the geo-referencing of BPs. The system had limitations, however, including limitations
on the generation of real-time information on project outcomes (outcome indicators), particularly
for Component 1. During the last two-and-a-half years of implementation (2013–14), the
information flows between MINECO and SEGEPLAN improved significantly, allowing key
information on BPs to be updated in the Business Object Platform. Progress reports were
consolidated by SEGEPLAN on time and made publicly available through the project website.

3.       Project mid-term review (MTR) and evaluations. The MTR was conducted in July
2012. 29 Results of the external evaluation were available a few months later (October 2012)
owing to delays in contracting procedures. The evaluation highlighted progress in implementing
the components and the improved capacity developed by the implementing agencies. It also
emphasized the need to establish better mechanisms for detailed follow-up of investments in the
BPs, as well as the need to institute measures for achieving compliance with environmental
requirements (see Section 2.4). The external evaluation also highlighted that on the basis of the
BPs analyzed, there was a high probability of partnership success, and the emergent evidence
suggested that the instrument could generate important results; therefore the approach
“encadenamientos” as an instrument of public policy should be considered as pilot or

29Because of delays in implementation and the restructuring that took place in 2011, the team postponed the MTR to
be able to account for and evaluate some concrete results on the ground.

experimental, and consequently be properly monitored. This led to the improvement of the
project monitoring systems for BPs. A final external performance evaluation of the project,
contracted by the borrower, was undertaken in December 2014; the methodology and results are
presented in Annex 9. The evaluation concluded that the project achieved its expected results
under very difficult political and institutional circumstances. The evaluation rightly divided the
performance for Component 1 into two stages; the first (from 2009 to 2012) was characterized by
low performance, and the second (from 2012 onward) was characterized by strong performance.

2.4         Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
4.       Safeguards. Having an environmental category B classification, the project involved an
environmental assessment and preparation of an Environmental Management Framework (EMF)
in accordance with the requirements of OP 4.01, the only environmental safeguard triggered by
the project. Social safeguards included Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20, being revised as OP 4.10);
when the substantial reconstruction of bridges was added, Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
was activated during the 2011 project restructuring. The triggering of this safeguard was
cautionary, considering that only rehabilitation (and not new construction) was expected. It is
important to note that although an Involuntary Resettlement Plan was prepared, there was no
resettlement under the Project. The EMF and the Indigenous Peoples Framework were reviewed
in light of the 2011 restructuring, and an Involuntary Resettlement Plan was prepared. The Bank
found all of these safeguards to be satisfactory. OP 4.09 on pest management was not triggered,
as the project did not finance pesticides or insecticides. In every instance, the EMF and its
implementation emphasized integrated pest management.

5.       The supervision missions rated Safeguards as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory in
all ISRs. Specific indicators to measure environmental compliance of investments in BPs were
added to the Results Framework in the 2011 restructuring, to ensure safeguards compliance and
monitoring, which was slow at the beginning. Delays by MARN 30 in issuing environmental
licenses to BPs led the IOI indicator to be revised to unlink the project’s environmental
performance from MARN’s internal procedures. The hiring of qualified environmental staff at
MINECO and of an external service provider contributed significantly to improve environmental
monitoring. Overall, the project’s environmental management improved remarkably over the
years. MINECO integrated environmental management across the subproject cycle from initial
stakeholder communication to related training, made payments/disbursements conditional on
environmental compliance, and focused environmental monitoring on BPs with the highest risk
sensitivity on the ground. The project generated important lessons (Section 7) that have been
incorporated in the implementation of the partial follow-up project, GT Enhancing MSME
Productivity Project (P112011).

6.       Financial Management (FM) and Audit. FM was rated Moderately Satisfactory during
supervision and audits were unqualified. From the project’s approval until 2009, FM was rated
Satisfactory. The rating fell to Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) during part of 2009 and all of
2010 but regained its Moderately Satisfactory (MS) rating for the remainder of implementation
(2011–14). The MU rating reflected the project’s difficulties in providing timely, accurate
financial information conforming to Bank standards. Those difficulties were resolved after the
client implemented key elements of the FM Plan agreed upon with the Bank.

7.       Procurement. Procurement was rated MU during the early years of implementation
owing to considerable weaknesses in managing procurement (especially in contracting
consultants) and preparing procurement plans. Following the first restructuring of the loan in
2009 and until the end of the project, procurement earned Satisfactory (S) or MS ratings.
Procurement planning improved continuously as good overall capacity developed over the course
of the project. Procurement planning was challenged by a new national contracts law approved in
2014. Under the new law, every consultant working for the project had to be rehired under new
terms of reference and payment structures, a process that took two to three months to resolve and
negatively affected the hiring and payment of project teams. The law continues to make project
implementation (especially contracting) a very laborious administrative burden.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
8.       The ongoing GT Enhancing SME Productivity Project, funded by the World Bank and
implemented by MINECO, supports improvements in competitiveness in agro-supply chains. The
successor project prioritizes the horticulture, potato, and cardamom supply chains, among others
supported through PDER; it also offers an opportunity to monitor and consolidate specific PDER
investments. It continues PDER investments in support of RPOs. The team that implemented
PDER at MINECO has transitioned to leading the implementation of the SME productivity
project, helping to ensure that lessons from PDER are reflected in implementing the new project
and that its activities sustain and consolidate PDER’s achievements.

9.      IADB’s reinstitution of PDER loan allocations to subcomponent 1.3, for public and
productive infrastructure needs in the Chixoy watershed but also to continue supporting
component 2 activities is expected to contribute to the consolidation of the national planning
system, under SEGEPLAN’s leadership.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance. Substantial
10.      Relevance of PDO. High. At project closing, the PDOs remained highly relevant. To
ensure income-generating opportunities for rural indigenous populations by improving the
competitiveness of the goods they produce and supply to domestic and international markets was
and remains a critical development objective in Guatemala. The National Agenda for
Competiveness 2012–2021 highlights the improvement of productive and market linkages
(encadenamientos productivos) and strengthening of RPOs’ capacity as key priorities to improve
the competitiveness of rural enterprises. Within the context of the long-term national
development Plan (K’atun 2032), MINECO and MAGA have been given responsibility for
promoting productive linkages under the encadenamientos productivos approach. This approach
is also very relevant within the context of the WBG Country Partnership Strategy (2013-2016),
specifically the rural development and SMEs pillar, which supports the growth of rural small
businesses through direct investments, capacity building, and the creation of a more supportive
business environment. Strengthening capacity for territorial management/planning also continues
to be an important priority for Guatemala. The country has made the strategic planning and
management of its territories the foundation for prioritizing investments and building consensus
around near-, mid-, and long-term development goals. In fact, the long-term development plan,
K’atun: nuestra Guatemala 2032, is the result of a highly participatory process for long-term
planning supported by PDER. The government’s commitment since 2013 to strengthen the
efficiency of public sector investments through results-based strategic planning and monitoring is
a definitive indication of the relevance of sound planning processes in which local, regional, and
national priorities converge.


                                               12
11.     Relevance of design and implementation. Substantial. Coordinated multi-sectoral
investments to remove constraints on competitiveness at the farm and territorial levels continue to
be a valid, highly relevant approach for creating opportunities for the rural poor, and this
approach is at the center of current development efforts. Another feature of the project’s design
that remains highly relevant for poverty reduction objectives in Guatemala is its emphasis on
directing productive investments to and within priority regions where poverty rates and
population densities are particularly high.31

12.      Improving competitiveness by building RPOs’ capacity to strengthen market linkages
also proved to be a relevant approach, although time was needed to streamline procedures for
public entities to implement it. The encadenamientos productivos approach is the key instrument
for strengthening producer capacity highlighted by policy documents (Plan Nacional de
Desarrollo K’atun) and institutional programs at MINECO and MAGA (for example, MAGA’s
Family Farming Program). The activities implemented under Component 1 were highly
innovative. They continue to be relevant and to yield valuable lessons, including lessons for
improving the Results Frameworks of similar projects and for consolidating project investments
directly linked to BPs under a single agency (Section 7). The Bank-funded GT Enhancing MSME
Productivity Project (P112011), implemented by MINECO, reflects elements of PDER’s design.

13.      In relation to Component 2, the need to anchor public and private investments to
productive potential and concerted local priorities and planning remains critical. SEGEPLAN has
led these efforts; it will continue to do so by reallocating some of the IADB funds that were
cancelled in 2012 (partial PDER loan cancellation) to continue efforts to enhance capacity for
territorial management/planning.

14.      In PDER’s design, Components 1 and 2 were intendedly disjointed in their
implementation, specifically due to the need to first build capacities for territorial
planning/management. To operationalize activities of component 1, BPs were seen as the
instrument for aligning specific and broad investments to improve enterprise competitiveness in
key territories; but using the BPs as an instrument to coordinate both types of investments, added
complexity to implementation. Now that capacity for territorial planning has been strengthened,
through component 1 activities, important opportunities exist to improve the effectiveness of the
local/territorial planning process for economic development by prioritizing and coordinating
specific and broad productive investments through municipal and regional development plans.
SEGEPLAN’s currents efforts are directed at supporting this goal.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives
15.     The project had two development objectives: (i) to improve the competitiveness of rural
productive supply chains with strong participation by indigenous peoples and (ii) to strengthen
the institutional capacity of public entities through the adoption of a TMM with indigenous
participation.

PDO 1: to improve the competitiveness of rural productive supply chains with strong
indigenous participation.


31Although the area covered by the project was eventually expanded to include the entire country, investments in BPs
remained highly concentrated in the departments/provinces initially targeted.




                                                         13
16.     The project attempted to enhance access to markets and finance multi-sectoral
investments that were aligned over time and across geographical areas. The investments would be
linked directly to the demands of the participating RPOs. This support on the supply side,
complemented by improved access to finance and improved public infrastructure (feeder roads,
telecommunications), would form the basis for improved competitiveness, which would be
measured in terms of:
 a. The increase in total sales of the rural productive supply-chain partnerships.
 b. The percentage of supply-chain enterprises accessing new sources of finance for capital and
      operating expenses.
 c. The percentage of participating partners who have received approval for improvement in
      rural roads and have access during the whole year to critical markets.
 d. The percentage of municipalities in the program departments that have broadband Internet
      access.

17.     The design of the project’s Results Framework took into consideration the dual objectives
proposed for the project. For PDO1, only the increase in total sales value was elevated to a PDO
outcome indicator resulting from Component 1 activities. The indicators related to
telecommunications and finance investments were cancelled. The outcome indicator associated
with improvements in competitiveness resulting from investments in public infrastructure (roads)
remained at an intermediate level (IOI).32 The assessment of project outcomes for PDO1 is based
on the investments made through BPs; the relevance of the outcomes from investments in
public infrastructure (specifically bridges), would be highlighted, but a rating for the respective
IOI indicator will not be assigned

PDO Outcome 1—Increase in total sales of the rural productive supply chain partnerships with
US$35m during the project period

18.      The project successfully strengthened productive supply-chain partnerships. The
project established a total of 216 partnerships between RPOs, commercial buyers, and service
providers (SDEs). Of those partnerships, 15 were cancelled for various reasons.33 The project
achieved its target of a minimum of 200 partnerships. Although 13 supply chains were supported
through BPs, 85% of the project’s investments in BPs went to support 5 supply chains—
horticulture (fruits and vegetables, F&V), coffee, basic grains, forestry-related products, and
honey. Export-oriented sectors such as horticulture and coffee together represented 72% of BP’s
investments (65% of all BPs). The average number of RPO members supported by each
partnership was 96; the minimum was 20.34

19.     Increasing access to productive assets, technologies, and strengthening entrepreneurial
capacity. Of the 216 partnerships, 27 were supported only through training (Business
Strengthening Plans—BSPs). The remaining benefited through a combination of:
i) Entrepreneurial business support services (certifications, TA, training, studies, legal and
marketing services).
ii) Investment funds, which were used to support:
a. Technological upgrading and/or compliance with standards (for example, refrigeration
    equipment, industrial processing equipment packing machines), and/or

32 With the emphasis on rehabilitation of infrastructure as a result of Agatha storm; the IOI was reworded to expand the
targeted beneficiaries of improved productive infrastructure, beyond those benefiting from BPs.
33 For example: failure to fulfill the cash contribution by the RPOs.
34 Average duration of the BPs was 12-18 months.




                                                          14
b. Small infrastructure, including the farm module of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), small
     building improvements aligned to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), farm irrigation
     (drip and sprinkler), and triple rinse modules; and
c. Capitalized expenses, specifically to procure items such as inputs, packing materials, and
     other goods or services.
iii) Collective productive infrastructure for the RPOs (storage facilities, coffee mills,
warehouses, cold rooms, drying yards, wastewater treatment, and the like).35 Twenty-two BPs
benefited from investments in collective infrastructure.

20.      Horticulture BPs focused mainly on closing gaps related to quality/safety by
implementing GAP and GMP programs. Improvements in safety (particularly compliance with
the stricter food safety requirements pertaining to export markets) were necessary for producers
to gain, sustain, and expand access to markets. Among the horticulture subprojects, 24 RPOs
completed food safety certifications. The project also assisted RPOs to strength their managerial
capacity. Investments in infrastructure, primarily in storage and irrigation facilities,
complemented the other investments in horticulture BPs. Support to subprojects in the coffee
supply chain consisted mainly of seed capital for production improvements, support for
certification or re-certification (e.g. organic standards), and support to improve milling and
processing capacity.

21.      Total increases in sales value (PDO outcome indicator). The reported increase in total
sales of 189 partnerships supported by the project through BP investments (BPs supported only
with training are not considered here) reached US$16.3m by December 2014, representing a 47%
achievement of the target value of the outcome indicator (US$35m). In percentage terms, this
value represents a 64% increase in the value of sales from the initial baseline reported by the BPs
at the time of their approval. The aggregate net increase in the value of sales of horticulture BPs
reached 76 %; coffee BPs attained a 56% increase (see Annex 5 for details on other products). Of
39 partnerships examined in detail for the economic and financial analysis of the project,36 the
increased net income of RPOs resulting from the project investments was attributed mainly to
increases in productivity (yields), expansion of cultivated area, improvements in product quality
(price), and additional crop/processed product capacity (Annex 3).37

22.      Implementation delays are partly responsible for the slow achievement of the target value
for the sales indicator over the life of the project, as 61% of the disbursements to support BPs
were made in 2013 and 2014 (77% during 2012–14). The increased sales were achieved with 164
partnerships and not the entire set of 216 partnerships supported by the project—27 were
supported only through TA, with a focus on institutional strengthening (not on increasing sales);
15 were cancelled; and 10 did not report an increase in sales value. Of the latter, 5 partnerships
related to cardamom and coffee were affected by unanticipated disease outbreaks; those losses
were compounded by the unexpected drop in prices, which reduced their end-of-project sales
value.

35 Three collective infrastructure subprojects contracted by FONAPAZ were unfinished. The government is pursuing

legal action against the contracted firms.
36Assessing the “with” and “without” project situation.
37 A detailed analysis of 16 partnerships during the final external evaluation of the project contracted by the borrower,

found that partnerships that included collective productive investments (storage rooms, processing facilities, and so
forth) reported increases in sales that were 20% higher than sales of partnerships supported only with investments in
TA and other investments. The economic and financial analysis, on the other hand, did not find higher returns to
infrastructure investments; higher returns were associated with the type of business. For example, projects working
with wood production and commercialization has the highest returns, followed by horticulture-related investments.




                                                          15
23.     An additional factor influencing achievement of target for sales at the end of the project
was the overly ambitious nature of the initial target, which in relation to the baseline represented
an average net increase in sales of 106% per BP. 38 The unanticipated problems facing the coffee
sector and the elimination Subcomponent 1.2, which was expected to help finance 10% of the
BPs supported by the project, also contributed to making the original sales target unrealistic.39
Even so, the financial and economic analysis suggests that the investments supported through the
project make it highly likely that sales will continue to increase in the years to come.40

24.      Beneficiaries and indigenous participation. The supply-chain partnerships were
expected to reach 30,000 beneficiaries, of whom 80% were expected to be indigenous people. At
project closing, the number of direct beneficiaries was 20,001, falling short of the target. Yet 90%
of partnership beneficiaries were indigenous people, and 34% were women, surpassing the
targets. The number of indirect beneficiaries of the partnerships is estimated to be 108,690.

25.     Other benefits from investments in partnership. From the RPOs’ perspective, as
confirmed in the beneficiary survey undertaken for this ICR, the major benefits of project
support, in terms of business performance, were improvements in product quality, followed by
major improvements in efficiency, and thirdly by increased sales (see Annex 7). To strengthen
RPOs and their managerial capacity, the project provided training and TA within BPs and
addressed specific needs through Business Strengthening Plans (BSPs). Overall, beneficiary
producers had a positive perception of the project’s contributions to improving membership
participation and strengthening the structure of their organizations (see Annex 7).

26.      Strengthening service provision to bridge gaps in RPOs’ capacity. The project engaged
25 business services partners (SDEs) as service providers. These providers—coming from
international and local NGOs and secondary RPOs—played a critical role in translating producer-
buyer demands into project proposals and supporting implementation of the resulting subprojects.
The external final evaluation of the project found that beneficiaries expressed virtually unanimous
(98%) satisfaction with the efficiency of the services provided by SDEs. Sixty-two percent
reported they would be willing to hire their services with their own financial resources, although
the remaining thirty-eight percent said that financial constraints would prevent them from doing
so.

Relevant IOIs directly aligned with improved supply-chain competitiveness

27.     Ensuring supply-chain connectivity to markets, year round, by rehabilitating and
improving damaged infrastructure. Demand for building public infrastructure (feeder roads,
bridges) was expected to come from rural communities with proven links to BPs
(encadenamientos productivos supported by the project). As a result of Tropical Storm Agatha,
however, demand for infrastructure came from rural communities severely affected by the storm.

38 The indicator at the initial target value represented a net increase per BP of US$166,700; with the reduced target of

US$35m, the average minimum net increase per BP was even more ambitious (US$175,000).
39 The indicator on increased sales by BPs was conceived from the start as a narrow indicator meant to capture the

competitiveness gains from broader investments in public infrastructure. For that reason, the lack of alignment between
public infrastructure investments and BP investments that arose in the wake of Tropical Storm Agatha may not actually
have influenced achievement of the sales indicator.
40 In coffee, for example, new plantings and the gradual recovery of production after the rust outbreak are likely to

translate into production increases; this together with prospectus of better coffee prices, particularly in the specialty
market, will translate into higher sales.




                                                           16
Criteria for prioritizing infrastructure investments included whether they would significantly
improve connectivity to critical markets for communities where infrastructure was affected by the
storm. Fifty storm-damaged bridges were rehabilitated during approximately two-and-a-half years
(2010–12) at an estimated cost of US$15.7m (34.5% of project investments, including pre-
investment costs) (19 bridges were financed by IBRD and 31 by IADB).41 This infrastructure has
enabled an estimated 160,367 people to reach critical markets throughout the year. An idea of the
impact of these investments can be gained from a detailed feasibility study42 undertaken by the
project in 2011 for a sample of 47 bridges that were to be rebuilt.43 The value of the incremental
annual time and travel savings attributed to restoring this infrastructure was estimated at
approximately US$15.6m (at the exchange rates prevailing in 2011), and the value of the
increased net annual flow of agricultural and livestock products from the producing regions was
estimated at US$1.5m. The ex-post economic analysis confirms the high returns from the
investments made by the project in rehabilitating bridges. Therefore, the project achieved the IOI
indicator “100% of the beneficiaries of improvements in rural roads have access during the whole
year to critical markets.”

28.     Conclusion. The PDO objective of improving the competitiveness of rural supply chains
with strong indigenous participation was achieved by increasing the total value of sales,
increasing the time savings, and maintaining market connectivity. These benefits will extend well
beyond the life of the project. Ninety percent of BPs were made of indigenous people. The
revised total sales indicator was not achieved during the life of the project owing to
implementation delays, an overly ambitious initial target, and exogenous factors (especially
affecting the coffee sector). The total increased sales at project end were also generated by a
lower number of partnerships (164) than originally estimated (200). Another mitigating factor is
that some investments involved low-value commodities (13 partnerships on basic grains), for
which sale values were inescapably low. That said, the results of the economic analysis of 87
subprojects were very positive (with strongly positive economic rates of return that were robust
based on the sensitivity analysis). The same analysis concluded that the overall sales indictor was
highly likely to increase in the years ahead (additional close monitoring will be required,
however). The investments in 50 bridges maintained market access and generated time savings
that will also continue to translate into supply-chain competitiveness and broader gains to rural
communities.

29.      A number of benefits were not estimated by the project but are nevertheless significant.
They include the benefits arising as RPOs achieved or maintained access to important markets by
obtaining essential food safety certifications such as GlobalGAP. The benefits accruing to the
BPs that were supported only through BSPs (training) were not estimated, but the beneficiary
survey found positive impacts in terms of strengthening RPOs’ capacity. Overall, the geographic
distribution and social benefits (women and indigenous peoples) were as expected. The BPs
ultimately covered 20 of the 22 departments of the country. The rehabilitation of bridges was
concentrated in six departments with high levels of poverty.

PDO 2 – To strengthen the institutional capacity of the public entities through the adoption
of a territorial management model (TMM) with indigenous participation.


41 Of the 50 bridges funded by IADB, two present a structural risk, requiring close follow-up.
42 The study used the RED model for economic analysis of rural roads with low traffic densities (a methodology
developed by the World Bank), which included 11 of the 19 bridges out of this sample that were financed by the IBRD
loan.
43 Feasibility studies were carried out for 88 bridges.




                                                        17
30.     This objective was to be achieved through the introduction of TMM via a pilot program.
The specific activities, as reported in the loan agreement, contributing to this PDO were: (i)
development of the new TMM for rural development based on participatory principles and its
implementation in selected departments; (ii) access to territorial strategic information through an
integrated and decentralized territorial strategic information system; and iii) disclosure, awareness
and training.

31.     The development of the new TMM for rural development, based on participatory
principles, and the implementation of the model in selected departments. The PDO-associated
indicator was originally defined as: “30% of the municipal planning offices participating in the
program have a territorial management plan.” By December 2010, 81% of the
Territorial/Municipal Development Plans (MDPs) had been completed and, before the second
restructuring took place to adjust project outcomes, MDPs had been finalized in 91% of the 161
municipalities in the original project area (that is, in the eight departments initially covered by the
project). In fact, the participatory planning process led by SEGEPLAN was close to completion
in seven of the eight departments in the project area. As part of the second project restructuring,
the PDO indicator was dropped (but continued to be monitored). A new PDO indicator was added
to reflect the outcomes of the component and not its inputs: “At least 5% of municipal projects
stem from the participatory planning process.” By the time of the MTR in 2012, the PDO
indicator had already surpassed its target (reaching 10%), so the target was increased to 25%
during the fourth restructuring in May 2013. At project closing, according to the M&E system of
SEGEPLAN’s Territorial Planning Directorate (DPT), 65% of the projects included in Local
Management Plans (LMPs) and OANs (Operative Annual Plans) were part of local government
agenda, while 35% were the result of participatory planning processes. The PDO outcome
indicator was exceeded. All IOIs for the component were also exceeded.

32.     With the expansion of the project’s area nationwide (in 2010 by IADB and 2011 by
IBRD), Component 2 activities moved away from a pilot nature towards supporting the first steps
in the establishment of the National Planning System. By the end of 2012, the project achieved
the IOIs associated with the development of the TMM. With the subsequent extensions of the
project’s closing date and the transfer of funds from Component 1, SEGEPLAN was able to
concentrate on consolidating SNP and the TMM. To do so, SEGEPLAN focused on: (i) putting
together a national vision for the country’s long-term development; the National Development
Plan (K’atun, Nuestra Guatemala 2032) was the result of a highly participatory process involving
the public and private sector; (ii) deepening the analysis of productive economic diagnostics; (iii)
incorporating land use into the planning process; (iv) generating key information to support
decision making and planning processes; 44 (v) operationalizing MDPs through multi-annual
planning and the establishment of LMPs and OANs; and (vi) establishing the policy for
strengthening municipalities and the Plan for Municipal Strengthening (PLANAFOM). Annex 3
presents the extensive outputs of these processes.

33.     The introduction and development of a TMM based on participatory principles was
highly successful, as per the outcomes defined by the project’s Results Framework. In terms of
impacts, the external evaluation of the project identified the following:




44   Such as development of the national atlas of risk perception at the local level (centros poblados).




                                                              18
a. Institutional capacity for TMM planning was strengthened and methodologies and planning
   processes were consolidated, creating new departments/divisions within SEGEPLAN and
   improving internal and interagency coordination.45
b. The implementation of the SNP influenced the long-term planning culture in the country in a
   positive manner.
c. The preparation of LMPs and the training provided to municipalities on results-based
   planning/management, together with the guidelines for the preparation of AOPs, are a first but
   significant step toward aligning planning processes with the application of the national organic
   budget law and impelling the implementation of results-based planning.
d. The LMPs strengthened the alignment between planning processes and budget allocations at
   the local level. According to data reported by DPT, 35% of project ideas included in the DPM
   were incorporated into the AOPs.
e. For the monitoring of LGPs, SEGEPLAN pilots the SIGEMUNI,46 which contains a module
   on its SIPLAN-GL (System for Local Government Plans), which is the tool for municipal
   planning and budgeting.47

34.      The access to territorial strategic information through an integrated and decentralized
territorial strategic information system. PDER has resulted in a major advance in the
development of geo-statistical information and spatial data in Guatemala. In 2008, SEGEPLAN
had a GIS unit at its headquarters. The unit provided inputs for the planning process and
databases (accessible only to members of the GIS geographical data unit) and a geoportal
(ArcIMS). Inter-agency sharing of geographic information was poor. Currently, SINIT48 provides
extensive statistical information and spatial data on a public platform generated by SEGEPLAN.
SINIT has been institutionalized at the headquarters and at departmental levels. SEGEPLAN has
become a benchmark throughout Guatemala for geographic information, making an impressive
array of geographic information publicly available through the IDE geoportal.49

35.      Disclosure, awareness, and training. As mentioned, SEGEPLAN’s information system
is available to the public. Capacity building focused largely on developing tools and instruments
and on training. Examples include the development and implementation of a “diplomado”
(specialization) in results-based          management, aimed at improving municipal
planning/management and the transparency of local governments and development councils.

36.     Conclusion. PDO 2 surpassed the target value for the outcome indicator and for all
associated IOIs.

37.     Overall ratings for PDO indicators. Ratings are assigned for three implementation
periods (see Table below):



45 Interagency coordination has also been strengthened, not only between SEGEPLAN and the Ministry of Finance—

which has contributed to linking budgeting and planning processes within the National Public Investment System
(SNIP)—but also the coordination between SEGEPLAN and other ministries and institutions related to the municipal
sector and development councils.
46 Integrated Municipal Management System.
47 SIGEMUNI is being tested in 10 pilot municipalities, which will serve as a reference for broad national

implementation, allowing SEGEPLAN, the Finance Ministry, and National Treasury to take an integrated approach to
strengthening LMP monitoring at the local level.

      2011 (the second restructuring modified the PDO2 indicator).
(ii) From June 2011 to the fourth restructuring in March 2013 (this restructuring modified target
      values for both PDO indicators).
(iii) From the fourth restructuring to project closing.

38.      The weights are calculated based on disbursement percentages (in relation to total
disbursement of the IBRD loan amount) at the time of restructuring.50 The relative weights are
8.6%, 40.9%, and 50.4%. Although the PDO indicator on increased value of sales was not
achieved during the life of the project, 61% of the budget execution for BPs occurred in the last
two years, with a high likelihood that overall sales will significantly increase in the years ahead. It
is also relevant to highlight that in percentage terms, the reported aggregate increase in sales
value is significant (64% of the baselines at the time BPs were approved). The overall assessment
of this indicator is partial achievement. The rehabilitation of roads is considered
completed/achieved, and the indicator for PDO 2 is exceeded. The overall PDO achievement is
rated as Substantial.

3.3          Efficiency
39.      The project’s financial and economic efficiency is rated Modest. The ex-post economic
and financial evaluation measures the economic efficiency of the project based on the
investments in (i) productive subprojects (Subcomponents 1.1 and 1.3) and (ii) rehabilitation of
rural bridges (revised Subcomponent 1.3), which together represent 76% of project financing
from IBRD (US$30m). The analysis is based on a universe of 87 subprojects, from which a
random sample of 39 productive subprojects was selected through a two-stage process stratified
by geographical region and subsector with respect to the investment. The final selection of
subprojects was done on a random basis. The difference between total approved BPs and the
universe reflects the fact that a significant portion of the investments was approved only during
the last two years of project implementation and therefore could not be assessed on the basis of at
least one full cycle of production and sales.51 For the evaluation of the rehabilitated bridges, a
sample of 11 bridges was analyzed out of the 19 rehabilitated with IBRD funds. The sampling
and evaluation methodology is further described in Annex 5.



50 Restructuring implying modification of PDO outcome indicators and/or target values.
51 The sample was defined in August 2014. Economic and financial results of the sample (39 subprojects) were inferred
to the whole universe of 87 subprojects, which represented US$6.3m of project investment regardless of the source of
finance. Economic and financial indicators were also calculated considering the indirect costs of administrating those
87 subprojects from the IBRD allocation.




                                                                    20
40.      At appraisal, the aggregate Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) was estimated at 9%
for infrastructure subprojects and 13% for productive subprojects, while the aggregate Financial
Net Present Value (FNPV) was calculated at US$6.7m. 52 The aggregate Economic Internal Rate
of Return (EIRR) of productive subprojects and public infrastructure was estimated at 13% and
the Economic Net Present Value (ENPV) at US$4.4m.

41.     At completion, the analysis of productive subprojects was based on actual performance
and 10-year cash flow projections. The aggregate FIRR is 20% and the aggregate FNPV,
applying a discount rate of 12%, is US$2.45m. Considering project management and monitoring
costs proportional to the investment analyzed, the FIRR and FNPV are 17% and US$1.87m,
respectively. A 20% reduction of net incremental income was calculated to test the robustness of
the results against adverse technical, climate, or market-related events. As a result, the FIRR
decreases to 12% and the FNPV is reduced to US$0.15m. The aggregate EIRR and ENPV of the
analyzed subprojects are 28% and US$4.98m, respectively, and other project costs (project
management and monitoring proportional to the investment analyzed) are 25% and US$4.43m. A
20% reduction in income level to account for risk factors (technical or social/organizational) and
climate or market-related variability results in an EIRR of 19% and ENPV of US$2.24m.

42.     For bridge subprojects, a total of US$5.81m was invested in the rehabilitation of 19
subprojects. The aggregated EIRR and ENPV for the 19 bridges rehabilitated are 118% and
US$40.61m, respectively. Results of the economic analysis of IBRD-funded bridges can be
extended to IADB bridges. There is no reason to think that IADB-funded bridges will present
different IRRs than that calculated for IBRD-funded subprojects.

43.     Economic Analysis. In summary, over the projected 10-year analysis, the aggregate
EIRR of productive subprojects amounts to 28%; the aggregate ENPV is US$ 4.98 m, and the
average ENPV per beneficiary is US$738. Considering other project costs, such as project
management and monitoring proportional to the investment analyzed, the EIRRs and ENPVs are
25% and US$ 4.43 m, respectively (US$656 on average, per beneficiary). Applying the 20%
reduction of net incremental incomes to test the robustness of the efficiency indicators reduces the
EIRR to 19%, the ENPV to US$2.24m, and the average ENPV per beneficiary to US$332.

44.     Institutional and Administrative efficiency. The slow project start, which translated
into a twenty-month delay, as well as subsequent implementation delays resulting from changes
in responsibilities between and within agencies, budgetary constraints, instability of project staff,
among other factors, etc., had significant implications on project implementation and outcome
achievement. In spite of the government instability and administrative difficulties, the
government’s ability to accelerate project implementation and overcome constraints during the
last two and a half years of implementation was remarkable, and contributed significantly to
improving administrative efficiency and the achievement of outcomes. Significant capacities for
the implementation of productive projects were built at MINECO. Furthermore, overall weak
implementation capacities of FONAPAZ (beyond the scope of PDER project) leading to the
closing of the institution, highlighted the need for a strategy to build institutional capacity for
public infrastructure-related investments in Guatemala.

52While the ex-post analysis of productive subprojects largely follows the approach used at appraisal, two important
differences apply. First, at appraisal it was assumed that investments would be financed through long-term credit,
whereas in reality subprojects were financed through matching grants. Second, the ex-ante analysis did not consider the
without-project situation and calculated absolute rather than incremental net benefits. Therefore, a direct comparison of
ex-ante and ex-post indicators is not possible.

3.4.    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
45.      Rated: Moderately Satisfactory. The overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory is
justified based on the considerations in the following three paragraphs.

46.      Relevance: Substantial. The project’s stated development objectives reflected proper
diagnosis of two development priorities that remain relevant: improving supply-chain
competitiveness and capacity for territorial planning/management. These development priorities
continued to be relevant to the country, as evidenced by the inclusion of objectives concerning
strengthening market linkages and competiveness of rural enterprises and rural producer
organizations in key policy documents and programs. At the territorial level, efforts are
underway, led by SEGEPLAN, to deepen analysis of economic opportunities and investment
priorities at the local level, to provide links to local planning processes, and to continue overall
strengthening and consolidation of the National Planning System.

47.     PDO achievement: Substantial. This rating is based on the partial achievement of the
indicator related to the increase in sales, complete achievement of the indicator related to road
access, and the over-achievement of the PDO 2 indicator. The efficacy of the project was affected
by the partial achievement of the increase in sales indicator during the life of the project due to
the combination of implementation delays, ambitious targets, and exogenous factors. That said,
there is a high likelihood that overall sales would increase significantly in the years ahead.
Through infrastructure rehabilitation, the project helped to maintain market access and
connectivity. The target for the PDO 2 indicator was exceeded, as well as all its associated IOIs.

48.      Efficiency: Modest. Although the project resulted in strong positive indicators of
economic and financial efficiency, there were issues relating to administrative and institutional
inefficiencies.
3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
49.      The project greatly benefited indigenous populations and municipalities with high
poverty levels. Of the partnership beneficiaries, 90% were indigenous people. Beneficiary
perceptions support these findings: 84% of the respondents to the beneficiary survey believed that
the project facilitated higher participation of indigenous people in the RPOs. Seventy-nine
percent of the partnerships’ direct beneficiaries were located in seven departments
(Huehuetenango, San Marcos, Sololá, Chimaltenango, Alta Verápaz, Quetzaltenango, and
Quiché). Extreme poverty in Quiché and Alta Verápaz was estimated at 20.1% and 46.7%,
respectively, in 2011. Bridge reconstruction covered six departments and 23 municipalities with
high levels of extreme poverty (94% of reconstruction efforts were concentrated in Totonicapán,
Chimaltenango, and Baja Verápaz, where extreme poverty rates of 24.5%, 15.4%, and 27.3%,
prevailed, respectively, in 2011). Furthermore, 160,367 people benefited from the infrastructure
rehabilitation.

50.      Gender Aspects: Of the total beneficiaries of BPs, 34% were women, surpassing the
target. The project benefited 40 RPOs in which more than half of the members were women (see
Annex 3); 16 of these RPOs had only female membership. According to the results of the
beneficiary survey, 68% of the RPO beneficiaries believed that the project strengthened women’s
participation in RPOs (for example, by including women in leadership roles in RPOs or by
ensuring that RPOs had a high membership of indigenous people). Several beneficiaries and
SDEs reported, however, that women needed to be more consistently reached by these types of
projects.


                                                22
51.     Institutional Strengthening. MINECO gained considerable capacity for the
implementation of productive projects. The experience with implementing the project was a very
valuable learning process for the agency; which has translated into higher credibility and trust in
the government from the perspective of beneficiaries. This finding is supported by beneficiaries’
comments in the survey (see Annex 7). The survey of SDEs that collaborated with MINECO in
implementing the project highlighted the fact that MINECO gradually corrected bureaucratic
delays. Clearly, the project advanced both a useful mechanism for decentralized investment and a
productive collaboration between the public and private sectors. At SEGEPLAN, the project
contributed to the development and introduction of a TMM and supported critical steps in the
consolidation of the SNP.

52.     Social Development: PDER successfully implemented a model of socio-economic and
ethnic inclusion and for strengthening the capacity of producer-based organizations to improve
production and commercial performance. The project predominantly benefited indigenous
populations and, through investments in public infrastructure, maintained socio-economic
opportunities for thousands of producers and rural people more broadly in municipalities with
high levels of poverty. The process of participatory planning at the local and regional levels is an
important step in the construction of a more equal society in rural Guatemala.

3.6.    Beneficiary Survey: Summary
53.     The ICR team created and distributed two surveys of qualitative perception-based
questions to RPOs and SDEs. The surveys were distributed between January and February 2015
by MINECO via email and in hard copy. The responses were sent by the beneficiaries to
MINECO or directly to the World Bank for consolidation and analysis. Overall, 66 surveys were
received, 16 from SDEs and 50 from RPOs.

54.     The results of the surveys suggest that a high proportion of RPOs perceived benefits from
participating in PDER and working with MINECO. Both RPOs and SDEs strongly agreed that
they benefitted from the project and would like to see similar projects continued. A brief
summary of the responses is presented below (details can be found in Annex 7).
- RPOs and SDEs agreed that the benefits of the project are perceived primarily in terms of
   product quality, followed by production efficiencies and increased sales.
- Respondents perceived that RPO structures had become stronger and that the participation of
   members had improved.
- A focus of PDER was to increase support for the representation and participation of women
   and indigenous populations. Respondents indicated that support and participation had
   increased thanks to PDER, but they only moderately agreed (58% for RPOs and 56% for
   SDEs) that the opinions of women, were formally taken into account by RPO leadership.
- Both SDE and RPO respondents indicated that measures to mitigate environmental risk had
   been incorporated.
- Respondents commonly noted that the project gave too much emphasis to reporting
   requirements, citing the high number of progress reports required. Despite this, many
   beneficiaries mentioned that although the process was bureaucratic and delayed), they hoped
   to continue participation.
- There was widespread agreement that RPOs needed more access to commercialization and
   national and international markets. Several noted the benefits of business experience s and
   knowledge sharing.




                                                23
- General feedback included the need for subproject to have longer execution periods, not only
  to coincide with production cycles but to link with government initiatives to encourage
  sustainability and improved livelihoods after project completion.
- 98% of the respondents indicated that SDE support was efficiently executed. The majority
  enjoyed working with MINECO and would like to see this type of project continued.
- In conclusion, respondents were hopeful that programs similar to PDER would continue.
4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome. Rating: Moderate.
55.      SEGEPLAN’s capacity to continue strengthening the SNP, particularly at the regional
level. SEGEPLAN’s achievements are largely linked to its capacity to hire consultants with
project funds. Of the nearly 100 consultants hired by PDER for Component 2 activities, 35 were
absorbed by the institution, which allows SEGEPLAN to continue strengthening the SNP,
including deepening results-based budgeting/planning. Reallocation of IADB funds will make it
possible to meet the needs that have already been identified for sustaining capacity; in the
medium and long term, however, sustaining the gains achieved to date and supporting
consolidation of the SNP will rely heavily on the government’s continued commitment. The new
responsibilities assigned by law to SEGEPLAN for monitoring sectorial and territorial planning,
especially at the local level, signals that commitment, which needs to be supported by budgetary
allocations.

56.      Maintenance of public infrastructure. Maintenance plans were signed by 100% of the
municipalities that were beneficiaries of the investments for the reconstruction of bridges.
However, the sustainability of these investments also depends on whether the municipalities have
not just the will but the capacity to maintain these structures. Many regions may require TA from
the national level.

57.      Sustainability of partnerships and investments through BPs. As mentioned, activities
under the GT Enhancing SME Productivity Project being implemented by MINECO support
improvements in competitiveness in agro-supply chains, and the SME project is expected to help
sustain the gains achieved through PDER.

5.      Assessment of Bank Performance
5.1     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
58.     A multi-sectoral team (including specialists in transport, telecommunications, municipal
development, rural development, finance, and other domains) prepared the project in close
collaboration with IADB. Within IBRD, project preparation and implementation were led by two
task team leaders (from the agriculture and transport units). The team designed the project in
alignment with the government’s rural development strategy. The design was also based on
analytical studies and prior success in Guatemala with implementing projects funded by the Bank
or other donors through arrangements with the private sector or non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), such as the encadenamientos productivos (productive linkages). Several of the activities
were of a pilot nature, such as, the attempt to scale-up “encadenamientos productivos” through
public funds and through linking them to broad infrastructure improvements and the piloting of
the TMM model under component 2. The project’s design was innovative and the institutional
arrangements aligned with institutional roles and mandates. For Component 2, the project’s team
chose an effective and simple approach to pilot the model for TMM under SEGEPLAN’s
leadership; which later become a major success and the foundation for the establishment and
consolidation of the SNP. The team exercised due diligence and managed to reduce government
expectations in relation to the size of the loan. It also kept component 1 and 2 activities running in



                                                 24
parallel, but not jointly, which otherwise would have added unnecessary complexity during
implementation. Despite careful arrangements, several issues beyond the control of the team
affected preparation, such as the limits on field visits. Furthermore, one of the studies that
contributed to the design of Subcomponent 1.4, incorrectly concluded that public investments
were needed in telecommunications owing to market failures, but the preparation team could not
have foreseen this reality.53 Other shortcomings in preparation included the need for stronger
plans to build capacity in implementing agencies and more detailed mechanisms for inter-agency
coordination of activities and investments.

5.2      Quality of Supervision. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

59.     Throughout project implementation, there were two supervision missions per year with
participation by technical, fiduciary, and safeguards staff and consultants, as needed. IADB and
IBRD organized joint missions and there was close coordination among both supervision teams.
Implementation difficulties were gradually overcome as operational procedures were streamlined
and capacity in implementing agencies grew stronger. The agriculture unit at the World Bank led
project supervision/implementation support, once the reconstruction of bridges ended in early
2013. With the completion of those rehabilitation activities, joint missions with IADB also
ceased. Supervision missions identified several issues and helped overcome operational
challenges in a timely way (such as the need to strengthen capacity at the PMU to speed
compliance with national environmental requirements, or the importance of hiring a technical
expert at SEGEPLAN to supervise FONAPAZ in implementing the bridge construction). The
supervision team missed opportunities to improve the Results Framework to better capture the
outcomes of Component 1 activities, particularly in relation to rebuilding efforts. The team was
instrumental in instituting a permanent process of improvement and self-learning, covering the
administrative, financial, procurement, business, environmental, social, planning, and monitoring
aspects of the project.

60.      Overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The project team
exercised due diligence during project preparation and designed a project in alignment with
government strategies and available sounded studies and past experiences. Furthermore, several
of the project activities were of a pilot nature. During implementation, the project team carried
out an “adaptive supervision,” in response to continuously changing circumstances.

6.        Borrower Performance
6.1 Government Performance. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
61.     Preparation was supported by the formulation of a rural development strategy, studies,
and the pillars defined by the government for PDER, but it was limited by the inability to conduct
a wide consultation of prospective beneficiaries. Project implementation covered three
administrations. Significant delays in implementation occurred initially after a new administration
took office and raised issues related to key elements of the project, which took time to resolve.
The period of greatest instability for the project occurred between 2008 and 2012 and was
characterized by mistrust in the processes led and implemented by the exiting administration,
changes in project staff, changes in responsibilities within and between agencies for

53 The studies were supported by grants from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and Global

Program on Output Based Aid (GPOBA) programs, and received significant dissemination and were well profiled.
They identified the extent of the under-provision of ICT services in rural areas (the “digital divide”); one of the outputs
included the report on “Digital Divide in Guatemala: Challenges and Strategies for the Future.”




                                                            25
implementing subcomponents, and limited fiscal space to operationalize the project. In spite of
the government instability and administrative difficulties, the government’s ability to accelerate
project implementation and overcome constraints during the last two and a half years of
implementation was remarkable.

6.2 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
62.      The performance of the implementing agencies can be characterized as follows.
(i)      SEGEPLAN— SEGEPLAN’s performance improved significantly over time, and it
came to play an outstanding role in implementing Component 2. The early years of project
implementation were affected by poor coordination and frequent changes in personnel. After a
leadership change at SEGEPLAN and a six-month period of stagnation while an external
financial audit was completed, the project resumed activities in early 2009 with SEGEPLAN
clearly defined as the facilitating agency.
(ii)     MINECO—Changes in implementation responsibilities and leadership,54 staff changes,
and divergent views about the design and operationalization of Component 1, together with a lack
of clear procedures, affected implementation from effectiveness until 2012. Greater stability in
project staffing at MINECO, as well as critical procedural improvements, reversed these
problems and contributed to strong performance of Component 1 during 2013–14.
(iii)    FONAPAZ—FONAPAZ was initially plagued by administrative bottlenecks and
frequently disagreed with MINECO regarding the implementation of infrastructure investments
linked to BPs. FONAPAZ’s performance in the reconstruction of bridges improved over time,
however. A total of 88 feasibility studies for reconstruction of bridges were carried out but only
50 bridges were built; the rest were not approved by the Investment Coordination Committee
(ICC) because of missing documentation, among other factors. The decision to hire experts at
SEGEPLAN to support supervision activities for public infrastructure significantly favored the
successful finalization of the infrastructure projects.

63.       Overall Borrower Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
difficulties that characterized the Borrower’s performance during 2009–12 were largely overcome
in the project’s later years. During the last years of implementation, the project units at
SEGEPLAN and MINECO were efficient, stimulated innovation, and incorporated lessons
learned during implementation.
7.          Lessons Learned
64.      Reducing political interference through transparent and competitive staff selection
procedures and performance evaluations. Political instability and interference, with the
resulting staff changes, affected project implementation. In anticipation of such challenges, it is
critical to include mitigation measures, to the extent possible, during project preparation. In
similar projects supported by the World Bank in Latin America, transparent and competitive staff
selection procedures and performance evaluations are included in the agreements for project
implementation. Measures that have proven highly successful in ensuring staff continuity include
the use of two different external firms to take responsibility for (i) staff recruitment, which
encourages unaffiliated professionals to apply for project positions and widen the candidate pool
and (ii) yearly performance evaluations based on individual work plans and interviews with
beneficiaries.




54   Responsibility alternated several times between the Vice-ministry for the development of MiPymes to PRONACOM.




                                                        26
65.     Opportunities for building capacity in RPOs. The implementation model of PDER
allowed SDEs to play a strong role in consolidating demands by RPOs and in formulating and
implementing BPs. The SDEs bridged the gaps in RPOs’ capacity and ensured transparency in
the management of public funds. Given the innovative application of the productive linkages
approach (using public funds), the role of SDEs in bridging capacity gaps was very important.
Future interventions, however, must consider a stronger focus on strengthening RPOs’ capacity to
manage and implement subprojects (including accountability of their members) and strengthening
their role in ensuring accountability for the services provided by SDEs. Experiences in
implementing similar projects in Latin America highlight the benefits of linking social
accountability and formal controls.

66.      Setting realistic indicator outcomes aligned with “upgrades/improvements”
supported through the project is critical for success. PDER supported specific investments
that were to yield significant short-term gains and increased the value of sales for producer
organizations. Some of the upgrades supported by the project, however, such as investments in
packing houses or efforts to renew or replant coffee area, would increase sales only in the
medium term. Such possibilities have to be considered when formulating the outcomes expected
from project investments. Overambitious targets and imperfect indicators can pose significant
challenges to a project’s success. The increase in sales indicator (expressed in value terms) is a
challenging indicator of competitiveness in demand-driven projects such as PDER, as the exact
size of the gains to be made by the project investments (in value terms) are difficult to know a
priori. Also, the “sales value” (particularly in global commodity sectors) is linked to exogenous
factors outside the project’s control (such as changes in commodity prices for long periods).
Expressing the increase in sales as a percentage of initial sales or in volume terms (in percentage)
would be more appropriate. Overall, PDO outcome indicators aligned to sustainable gains at the
level of increased productivity, increased efficiencies, quality improvements, and reduction of
postharvest loses are very appropriate for projects that support improvements in enterprises.

67.     Improving women’s participation requires specific strategies, including
differentiated support. Although the project achieved its objective in terms of reaching women,
their active role in the RPOs remains low. Specific strategies should be considered to foster
women’s participation, such as establishing a specific business line to support the types of
businesses opportunities that traditionally attract a high level of interest among women. On the
other hand, implementing dissemination events specifically directed at women is a good practice
in demand-driven interventions such as PDER, as well as making targeted/customized gender-
sensitive training available for RPOs.

68.      Moving from a focus on “non-harm approaches” toward generating positive
environmental outcomes of project implementation. Under PDER, Environmental Plans (EPs)
were prepared alongside the BPs. The EPs were perceived by project staff and beneficiaries as a
separate list of mitigation measures to be implemented to comply with project or national
requirements. In practice, however, a large proportion of the BPs already provided support for the
implementation of GAPs and GMPs, mainly to achieve compliance with market requirements, but
such compliance also entailed improved environmental practice in productive and processing
activities. Therefore, moving away from a single focus on safeguard compliance and toward
internalizing positive environmental outcomes of project activities is critical. This requires
awareness-raising and well-defined strategies within projects.

ANNEX 5. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. INTRODUCTION

1.       Background: With financing from the World Bank of a credit of US$ 30 m to the
Republic of Guatemala, the Ministry of Economy (MINECO),55 the Secretariat of Planning and
Programming of the Presidency (SEGEPLAN) and the National Fund for Peace (FONAPAZ)
implemented the Rural Economic Development Program (PDER). The project focused on
improving the competitiveness of productive subsectors while promoting indigenous
participation; and on strengthening the capacity of the public institutions that participated in the
project to adopt a participatory TMM.

2.       Overall project outcome and impact: The main economic benefits have been increased
net incomes for subprojects of producers groups, primarily due to increases in production and/or
productivity (yield), cultivated area, volume of marketed product, and/or improved product
quality (unit price); and, in the case of bridge rehabilitation, reduced post-harvest losses, vehicle
operating costs, and opportunity costs of time of transport operators. Social impacts included
increased seasonal and permanent employment within the partner enterprises. Producer
organizations have also been empowered through capacity building and technical and marketing
assistance; specific training on GAPs and GMPs has contributed to positive environmental
externalities.

3.       Project outputs: The project has strengthened the organization of 189 producer groups
within 12 subsectors and cofinanced 189 productive subprojects on a matching grant basis
designed to help producer associations to increase production/productivity and work more
effectively and efficiently with their market partners in long-term market relations. The project
has reached 18,115 direct beneficiaries through productive subprojects, 90 percent of the target.
For the public infrastructure subprojects, well over 50,000 rural dwellers benefitted from the
rehabilitation of 19 bridges (the 11 bridges analyzed in detail are used by 35,000 persons alone).

4.       Project costs: The actual project cost funded by IBRD amounted to US$ 30 m, of which
the bulk of resources were devoted to Component 1, Investments in Productive Supply Chains
(76%), followed by Component 2, Strengthening Territorial Public Management Capacities for
Competitiveness (20%), and Component 3, Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (5%). By
project subcomponent, Subcomponent 1.1, Access to business development services (for income
generating sub-projects), represented 46% (US$ 16.6 m) of actual total costs. The costs of
Subcomponent 1.3, Access to rural productive infrastructure resources (US$ 9 m), were split
between rehabilitation of bridges (US$ 5.81 m) and income generation subprojects (US$ 3.19 m).
Subcomponent 1.2 (Financial services) and Subcomponent 1.4 (Investment in ICT) were not
finally executed and therefore not evaluated.

5.      Subproject cycle: The project supported groups of entrepreneurs through investment
subprojects contained in Business Plans (BPs). The subproject cycle involved four stages: (1) pre-
investment stage: (2) execution stage (including procurement of equipment and of technical
assistance); (3) operation stage; and (4) monitoring stage.

                                                          42
6.       Eligible investments: Investments were mainly for technical/legal/marketing assistance
and key goods and services to rural producer organizations (RPOs); they were classified by the
project as follow: (i) Business Development Service (SDE), which included the pre-investment
costs of business plan preparation as well as management, negotiation, and quality assurance
costs; (ii) Seed Capital (CS) and (iii) Productive Infrastructure (IP). The SDE maximum ceiling
eligible for funding was US$ 40,000, of which 90% was funded by the project and 10% was
producers’ in-kind contribution. CS was co-funded by the project (80%) and by the RPO
counterpart (20% in cash); while 100% of the IP was funded by the project. The maximum non-
reimbursable investment by beneficiary was US$ 2,000 (including SDE, CS and IP).

7.       Target regions: he project supported productive subprojects in 19 of the 22 departments
of Guatemala. For the public infrastructure subprojects, IBRD concentrated its funding on the
rehabilitation of 19 bridges in Chimaltenango and Totonicapán Departments.

8.      Efficiency: The ex-post financial and economic evaluation of the project estimates
returns derived from the investments in income-generating subprojects and rehabilitations of
bridges damaged during Tropical Storm Agatha in 2010. As noted, Subcomponents 1.2 (Access
to Financial Services) and 1.4 (Investment in ICT) are not evaluated because they were not
implemented.

2. EX-ANTE VS EX-POST ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

9.      Investment in Productive Subprojects: The cost-benefit analysis conducted during
project preparation, as presented in the PAD, was based on indicative community/group
entrepreneurial subprojects likely to be demanded by beneficiaries. Subproject models were
prepared for the following subsectors: (i) coffee (production and marketing; post-harvest
processing and marketing); (ii) lettuce (production and marketing; packing and marketing); (iii)
snow peas (packing and marketing; production and marketing); (iv) tomatoes (greenhouse
production and marketing); (v) creole lemon (drying and marketing; production and marketing);
(vi) Honey (production and marketing); and (vii) handicrafts (production and marketing).
Projected economic benefit streams for those models were estimated based on loans with an
average 10-year repayment period (depending on the economic life of the investment) at an
average interest rate of 8% per year. Projected financial benefit streams were calculated by
deducting the financial cost of credit from the economic benefit stream.

10.      At project completion, the ex-post analysis used the same methodology to estimate costs
and benefits for the productive subprojects, taking into account the needs for reinvestment in
major capital goods and their residual values. A direct comparison of ex-ante and ex-post
indicators is not possible, however, for the following main reasons: (i) ex-post analysis is based
on actual performance of the matching grants provided to business subprojects, and not on a
credit scheme that was not actually implemented; (ii) ex-post analysis and economic indicators
are based on incremental net benefit streams (a “with project” and “without project” situation),
which differs from the “with project” benefit streams estimated in the ex-ante analysis.

11.      Access to Rural Productive Infrastructure: At appraisal, two indicative public
infrastructure subproject models were analyzed in for horticultural production: (i) the
rehabilitation of 10 km of a rural road in bad condition and (ii) bridge construction. The aim of
these investments was to help improve the competitiveness of the supply chains supported by
business subprojects under PDER. After May 2010, however, project funds were reallocated to
rebuild bridges demolished by Tropical Storm Agatha. Consequently the evaluation of

                                               43
investments in infrastructure cannot does not reflect the ex-ante analysis. Details of the
methodology proposed for the ex-post cost-benefit analysis are presented later.

3. EX-POST ECONOMIC                            AND        FINANCIAL            ANALYSIS             OF    PRODUCTIVE
   SUBPROJECTS

12.     As shown in Table 1, the project approved a total of 189 business plans in 12 subsectors
worth US$ 15.22 m (including counterpart funds). The sectoral distribution is as follows: (i) fruits
and vegetables (44.3% of total investment); (ii) coffee (28.5%); (iii) basic grains (6.5%); (iv)
forestry (3.9%); (v) beekeeping (3.8%); (vi) cocoa (2.7%); (vii) livestock (2.2%); and (viii)
others.

     A) Sample selection for Ex-Post Analysis

13.      From the 189 business plans, at the time of sample selection for the ICR (July 2014), 15
subprojects had been cancelled after the investment, and 52 had not yet completed their first cycle
of production and sales and so were not considered. In addition, the following types of
subprojects were discarded: (i) subprojects that had only received TA (not seed capital or
financing for productive infrastructure) and (ii) subprojects belonging to subsectors that
contribute to less than 2% of the aggregate investments of all productive subprojects financed. Of
the remaining 87 subprojects, a random sample of 39 was chosen through a stratified selection
process based on subsectoral and geographical distribution. The final selection of subprojects
(after stratification) was done on a random basis. The difference between total approved business
plans and the universe results from the fact that a significant proportion of the investment was
approved only during the last two years of project implementation, and therefore could not be
assessed based on at least one full cycle of production and sales.

14.      Tables 2 and 3 summarize key parameters of the universe and sample investigated among
the different chains.

     B) Methodology for Ex-Post Analysis of the sample

15.     A detailed ex-post cost-benefit analysis was conducted for the 39 subprojects based on
primary and secondary information, performance of the investments, and profitability of the
producer association. For the “with and without project” situations, costs and benefits were
estimated based on sales and cost figures over one year, and field visits were conducted to the
subprojects to validate the secondary data of the analysis conducted in the Business Plans of each
subprojects and	 reconstruct the “without project situation.” Results of the “with and without
project” and incremental situation are presented in detailed tables of Annex 5.1 (Tables 5.1, 5.2
and 5.3).

16.     The ex-post cost-benefit analysis is based on projections of a 10-year incremental net
benefit flow projections. The analysis assumes that the increased net income obtained by
producer groups as a result of the investments financed by the project—primarily arising from
increases in productivity (yield), cultivated area, volume of marketed product, and/or
improvement in product quality (unit price)—will be maintained during the 10-year period.

17.     The projected incremental net benefit flow projections are analyzed from a financial,
economic, and fiscal perspective. The financial analysis uses market (private) prices and includes
the cost of non-paid family labor valued at market prices, which represents the bulk of the
production cost, and taxes. To estimate the benefits from the point of view of the national
economy, conversion factors (CF) are used to transform the market prices into economic values.
Table 4 show the CF used in this analysis based on a study on National Economic Parameters and

analysis considers a 30% income tax on incremental revenues. In addition, a sensitivity analysis
was conducted to show the impact of a 20% reduction in income level to take risk factors and
climate or market variability into account. The parameters estimated were annual net income /
profit; labor generated; Net Present Value (NPV) of benefits at a discount rate of 12%; and
Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The tables in Annex 5.1 summarizes the financial and economic
indicators for each subproject of the sample.

     C) Aggregate and average ex-post economic indicators for producer groups’
        entrepreneurial subprojects

18.     Economic and financial results of the sample are inferred to the whole universe of 87
subprojects by productive subsector level and considering the different type of project
interventions (i.e. SDE+CS; SDE+IP; SDE+CS+IP).

19.     Aggregate financial and economic indicators and averages per beneficiary have been
calculated for the universe of subprojects, which represented a total investment of US$ 7.13 m
and benefited around 6,800 producers. See Annex 5.1 for summaries of the aggregate financial
and economic indicators of the analysis.

20.     Financial Analysis. Over the 10-year period of the analysis, the FIRR for productive
subprojects is 20% and the aggregate FNPV is US$ 2.45 m, for an average FNPV of US$ 363 per
beneficiary. In a second scenario, in which costs of family labor valued at market wage rates and

the 10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to technical assistance are eliminated, the FIRR
increases to 36%, the aggregate FNPV is US$ 8 m, and the average FNPV is US$ 1,186 per
beneficiary.

21.     Considering project management and monitoring costs proportionate to the investment
analyzed, the FIRR and FNPV are 17% and US$ 1.87 m, respectively. For this last situation
(including proportionate indirect project costs), a 20% reduction of net incremental income
is calculated to test the robustness of the results to adverse technical, climatic, or market-
related events. The FIRR falls to 12% and the FNPV is reduced to US$ 0.15 m. In the second
scenario (without family labor costs and with the in-kind contribution valued at market prices),
the FIRR decreases to 25%, the FNPV is reduced to US$ 4.65 m, and the average FNPV per
beneficiary falls to US$ 688.

22.     Economic Analysis. In summary, over the 10-year period, the EIRR of productive
subprojects amounts to 28%, the aggregate ENPV is US$ 4.98 m, and the average ENPV per
beneficiary is US$ 738. Considering other project costs (project management and monitoring
proportionate to the investment analyzed) the EIRR and ENPV are 25% and US$ 4.43 m,
respectively (US$ 656 per average beneficiary) . In this last scenario, applying the 20%
reduction of net incremental incomes to test the robustness of the efficiency indicators
reduces the EIRR to 19%, the ENPV to US$ 2.24 m, and the average ENPV per beneficiary
to US$ 332.

4. EX-POST ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF REHABILITATION OF
   BRIDGES

23.     Background: Project Subcomponent 1.3 (Access to rural productive infrastructure) was
intended to finance various types of community rural infrastructure. At appraisal, two indicative
types of subprojects were assessed for a horticultural production area: (i) feeder road
improvement and (ii) bridge construction. For both subprojects, conservative assumptions were
made to estimate the product losses avoided through the improved public infrastructure. For the
bridge construction, it was estimated that once every 10 years the entire snow pea harvest of one
season would be saved57 for 2,600 families within a production area of 84 hectares. The EIRR
and FIRR were estimated at 13% and 9%, respectively.

24.      Ex-ante evaluation: Bridges: Due to the damages caused by Tropical Storm Agatha in
2010, the funds for public infrastructure investments under Subcomponent 1.3 were used only to
rehabilitate bridges (and not to rehabilitate feeder roads or build other public infrastructure as
envisaged in the PAD). At that time (2011), a detailed feasibility study was undertaken by the
project covering 46 bridges to be rebuilt, including 11 of the 19 bridges eventually financed by
the IBRD loan (17 vehicular bridges and 2 overpasses). This study quantified the benefits of
reconstruction/rehabilitation using the RED model developed by the World Bank for the
economic analysis of rural roads with low traffic densities.58 Results are expressed in economic
values; as in the RED model, a CF of 0.85 was used. Based on the RED model, three main types
of benefits were quantified:

average once in 10 years.

    A) Estimation of the travel time saved by users of the bridges (farmers and traders
       transporting agricultural produce from the production areas to the nearest markets)
       valued at the opportunity cost of time as reflected in the current rural wage rate.
    B) Valuation of the reduction in time needed to transport agricultural produce,
       estimated by applying a discount rate of 12% per annum (0.04% per hour) to the
       value of the transported goods multiplied by the reduction in transport time.
    C) Decrease in the Cost of Operating a Vehicle (COV) based on the Average Annual
       Daily Traffic (AADT) on rural roads where these bridges are located. Alternate
       routes were identified to represent the "without project" situation.

25.    Ex-post Evaluation: The analysis for this ICR used the methodology of the feasibility
study, updating the cost-benefit models for 11 bridges located in the departments of
Chimaltenango and Totonicapán, based on actual investment costs (US$ 3.49) and estimated
maintenance costs for a period of 15 years.

26.      Thus, at an investment costs of US$ 3.49 m, 11 IBRD-funded bridges, representing total
length of 216 m and width of 57 m, will generate a global ENPV of US$ 24.40 m and an EIRR of
118%, compared to the “without project” situation, which implies a substantial positive impact on
the national economy.

28.     As shown in Table 5, 4 bridges have a particularly high EIRR for the following reasons.
The high return to the Panibaj community bridge (Patzun Municipality) is due to the time savings
for passengers and agricultural produce, multiplied by very high traffic of 1,075 vehicles per day.
For the Xeatzan Bajo community bridge (Patzun Municipality), the large time saving for
passengers and cargo do not result primarily from high traffic flows (equal to only 179 vehicles)
but rather from the significant time savings for each individual trip. Reaching three communities
would take 4 or 5 hours on foot instead of a few minutes with the bridge. The same is true for the
Panatzan community bridge in Santa Apolonia, Chimaltenango, and the Cambalcol Alto bridge in
San Martin Jilotepeque, Chimaltenango.

29.      The economic results for the 11 bridges were extrapolated to the 19 bridges
rebuilt/rehabilitated with IBRD funding (see Table 6), resulting in an aggregate ENPV of US$
40.61 m.

5. EX-POST ANALYSIS OF PRODUCTIVE SUBPROJECTS

30.      Fruit and vegetable production and marketing subprojects. Overall the project has
supported 77 productive subprojects with an aggregate investment of US$ 6.74 m (representing
44.3% of the investments in productive subprojects), benefitting 5,918 producers (32.7% of
project beneficiaries). Investments essentially fell into three categories: (i) pre-investment,
capacity building, and technical/marketing assistance to support the businesses growth plan (35%
of the investment); (ii) seed capital, mostly used for agriculture inputs (26%); and (iii) productive
infrastructure such as storage and packing facilities, cooling and packing machinery, and
equipment to increase production efficiency, processing, and storage (39%).

As shown in Annex 5.1, 19 subprojects (including 11 in production, 4 in marketing, and 4 in both
production and marketing of fruits or vegetables) were analyzed in depth. These subprojects
represent an aggregate investment volume of US$ 2.1 m, benefiting 1,329 producers. Of the 19
subprojects, 5 were dedicated to sweet pea production (ADIAP, ADIFERT, ASOMAM, Buen
Sembrador and Rabinal Vargas), 3 to potato production (ADINUT, CONUVI and QCHMON), 1
to macadamia production (ADISC), 2 to green bean production (APROCHIYO and ASODIAZ),
5 to tomato production (ADISUC, ASIPA, CONUVI, Flor Chimalteca and GGESTOR), 2 to
berry production (Flor de Mora and Flor del Campo), and 1 to peach production (FRUTASA).

31.      The aggregate EIRR for the 19 subprojects is 24%, resulting in an aggregated ENPV of
US$ 1.2 m (or US$ 2,147 per beneficiary), when a 12% discount rate is used. Aggregate FIRR
and FNPV are 17% and US$ 0.57 m (or US$ 401 per beneficiary), respectively. Eliminating the
costs of family labor valued at market wage rates, and the 10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to
technical assistance, the aggregate FIRR increases to 24% and the resulting aggregate FNPV to
US$ 1.20 m (US$ 910 per beneficiary). On average, the increased net income per year is US$
33,932 per subproject and US$ 515 per family before fiscal tax, and US$ 23,752 (or US$ 360 per
family) after fiscal tax. Fruit and vegetable production and marketing subprojects also show an
important average increase of annual seasonal labor (paid worker) of 1,909 person-days
(equivalent to 6 person-years) and an average increase of family labor of 370 person-days
(equivalent to 1 person-year). Little permanent employment is created at the level of the
associations: an average of 1 person/year, depending on the alliance and mostly in the accounting
sector.

32.      Based on the results of the specific analysis, the average incremental net income has been
calculated by type of intervention, i.e., SDE+CS; SDE+IP; SDE+CS+IP. This provides the basis
for extrapolating the results to the 42 fruit and vegetable subprojects in the universe (of which 22
subprojects are involved in production, 11 in marketing, and 9 in production and marketing),
which received a total investment of US$ 3.9 m. The aggregate EIRR and ENPV for the 42
subprojects are 24% and US$ 2 m, respectively, whereas the FIRR and FNPV amount to 17% and
US$ 0.88 m, respectively. Eliminating the costs of family labor valued at market wage rates and
the 10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to technical assistance, the FIRR increases to 22% and
the resulting FNPV to 1.70 m.

                                                               49
33.     Coffee production and marketing subprojects. Overall the project has supported 45
subprojects with an aggregate investment volume of US$ 4.3 m (29% of the total investments),
benefiting 7,400 producers (41% of project beneficiaries). Investments essentially fell into three
categories: (i) IP, mainly equipment and buildings to increase production efficiency, processing,
and storage (25% of total investment amount); (b) CS, mostly used for agriculture inputs (41%);
(c) SDE, technical assistance essential to start the process and support the alliances in the path for
growth (34%).

34.     As shown in Annex 1, 7 coffee subprojects were analyzed in depth, including 4 in coffee
production and 3 in coffee production and marketing. The aggregate EIRR and ENPV for the 7
subprojects are 35% and US$ 0.74 m, respectively. From the financial perspective, the aggregate
FIRR and FNPV are 20% and US$ 0.26 m, respectively. Removing the costs of family labor
valued at market wage rates and the 10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to technical assistance,
the FIRR increases to 51% and the resulting FNPV to US$ 1.32 m (US$ 1,653 per beneficiary).
On average, the increased net income per year per alliance is US $ 61,220 (or US$ 534 per
beneficiary) before fiscal tax and US$ 42,853 (or US$ 374 per family) after fiscal tax. The
coffee subprojects analyzed here generate an important increase in employment of 3,527 person-
days (equivalent to 12 person-years).

35.     Based on the results of the specific analysis, average incremental net income has been
calculated by subproject type (i.e. SDE+CS and SDE+CS+IP). This provides the basis for
extrapolating results to the 16 coffee subprojects (receiving total investment funds of US$ 1.3 m
and benefiting 2,407 producers) of the universe. The aggregate EIRR and ENPV for the 16
subprojects are 34% and US$ 1.8 m, respectively. The aggregate FIRR and FNPV are 20% and
US$ 0.64 m, respectively; and when the costs of family labor valued at market wage rates and the
10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to technical assistance are excluded, the FIRR increases to
58% and the resulting FNPV to US$ 4.19 m.

36.     Basic grains production and marketing subprojects. Overall, the project has supported
13 subprojects with an aggregate investment volume of US$ 988,230, of which 88% was funded
by the project and 12% by the producers, benefiting 1,563 producers (8.6% of all beneficiaries).
Investments fell into the following categories: (a) SDE (33.3%), (b) CS (43.5%), and (c) IP
(23.2%).

37.      As shown in Annex 5.1, 3 subprojects were selected to evaluate their performance and
economic indicators: (1) bean production and marketing (ADEGO); (2) maize production and
marketing (Boxomá Associaction), and (3) maize production and marketing (Cooperative Union
Campesina). The total investment was US$ 179,474 and benefited 139 producers. Investment
essentially involved 35% of SDE and 55% of CS. The aggregate EIRR and ENPV for the 3
subprojects are 17% and US$ 36,602 (US$ 263/beneficiary), respectively, and the aggregate
FIRR and ENPV are 16% and US$ 30,269 (US$ 218/beneficiary). When “unpaid” family labor
valued at market wage rates and the “in kind contribution” to the investment provided by the
associations are excluded, the aggregate FIRR increases to 33% and the resulting FNPV to US$
182,467 (US$ 1313 per beneficiary). In this situation, the incremental annual revenues
attributable to project investments before and after taxes are US$ 12,428 and US$ 8,700,
respectively (equivalent to US$ 268–188/beneficiary).

38.     The impact in term of employment generation has been mixed across the subprojects.
ADEGO created 3,000 seasonal jobs (equivalent to 10 person-years), but in the other two
subprojects, seasonally hired labor seems to have been substituted by family labor. Boxoma

                                                 50
added 970 family jobs (equivalent to 3 person-years) and Union Campesina added 2,223
(equivalent to 7 person-years).

39.     Based on the results of the above specific analysis, aggregate financial and economic
indicators and averages per beneficiary have been calculated for 8 basic grains subprojects of the
universe, which represented a total investment of US$ 524,886 and benefited around 424
producers. The aggregate ENPV and FNPV are US$ 106,359 and US$ $85,391, respectively.
Excluding the costs of family labor valued at market wage rates and the 10% beneficiary in-kind
contribution to technical assistance, the FNPV increases to US$ 486,578 (US$ 1,148/beneficiary).

40.     Wood production and marketing subprojects. Overall, the project has supported 11
subprojects in the forestry sector for a total investment of US$ 597,316, of which 83.7% was
funded by the project and 16.3% through producers’ contributions, benefiting 661 producers.

41.      Three subprojects for producing and marketing wood were analyzed in depth: (i)
FORESCOM, which invested in improved industrial wood drying and molding and to strengthen
administrative and financial management and marketing; (ii) CUSTOSEL, which improved
production processes and strengthened its administrative, financial, and commercial management
through the project investment, and (iii) AFISAP, which invested to improve the productivity and
efficiency of its sawmill and to strengthen its administrative and commercial capabilities. The
aggregate EIRR and ENPV are 58% and US$ 385,890, and the aggregate FIRR and FNPV are
45% and US$ 291,776. Excluding the costs of family labor valued at market wage rates and the
10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to technical assistance, the FIRR increases to 51% and the
resulting FNPV to US$ 343,439. In this situation, the incremental annual revenues attributable to
project investment before and after taxes are US $ 31,547 (or US$ 430 per beneficiary) and US$
22,083 (or US$ 301 per beneficiary), respectively.

42.     Aggregated financial and economic indicators and averages per beneficiary have been
calculated for 6 subprojects of the universe producing and marketing wood, which received an
investment of US$ 368,795 and benefited 417 producers. The aggregate ENPV and FNPV are
US$ 806,594 and US$ 562,889, respectively. Excluding costs of family labor valued at market
wage rates and the 10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to technical assistance, the aggregate
FNPV increases to US$ 662,769 (US$ 1,589 per beneficiary).

43.     Honey production and marketing subprojects: Overall, the project has supported 8
subprojects for an investment of US$ 0.58 m, benefiting a total of 492 producers. Investments
were subdivided as follow: (i) SDE (44%), CS (31%), and IP (26%).

44.      The subproject APROCHILCO (105 families) sought to increase revenues by expanding
production and marketing of honey and bee pollen through a comprehensive business
management program. The investment of US$ 63,259 essentially involved the establishment of
300 beehives, equipment and technical/marketing assistance. The EIRR and ENPV are 24% and
US$ 40,726, respectively, and the FIRR and FNPV are 25% and 42,909. Excluding the costs of
family labor valued at market wage rates and the 10% beneficiary in-kind contribution to
technical assistance, the FIRR increases to 50% and the net present value to US$ 117,100. In this
case, incremental annual revenues attributable to project activities against investments before and
after taxes would be US$ 32,336 and US$ 22,635, respectively (equivalent to US$ 308–
216/beneficiary).

45.     Based on the results of this model, aggregate economic and financial rates of return were
calculated for 4 alliances of the universe, i.e., an investment of US$ 288,425 that benefited 297

                                                51
producers. The aggregate ENPV and FNPV are US$ 184,494 and 195,642, respectively. If
producers’ in kind contributions are excluded from the aggregate financial streams, the aggregate
FIRR is US$ 468,400.

46.     Livestock production and marketing subprojects: Overall, the project has supported 5
subprojects for an aggregated investment volume of US$ 337,372 (89% funded by the project and
11% by the beneficiaries), benefiting 301 producers.

47.      As shown in Annex 1, 2 subprojects were analyzed in depth. Based on the results of the
specific analysis, average incremental net income has been calculated by type of intervention, i.e.
SDE+IP (ACORDI) and SDE+CS (APRODERCH). This provides the basis for extrapolating the
results to the 4 subprojects of the universe, which received a total investment of US$ 331,372 and
benefited 199 producers. The aggregate EIRR and ENPV are 13% and US$ 10,149, respectively.
The aggregate FIRR and FNPV are 15% and US$ 41,342 (US$ 208 per beneficiary), respectively.
Excluding the costs of family labor valued at market wage rates and the 10% beneficiary in-kind
contribution to technical assistance, the IRR increase to 33%, resulting in a FNPV of US$
362,258 (US$ 1,820). In this situation, the incremental annual revenues attributable to project
investment before and after taxes per average association are US $ 22,115 (or US$ 404 per
beneficiary) and US$ 15,480 (or US$ 301 per beneficiary), respectively.

Others:

48.      Cocoa production and marketing: Overall the project has supported 7 cocoa
subprojects (5 subprojects in Alta Verapaz Department, 1 in Suchitepéquez, and 1 in San Marcos)
for a total investment of US$ 0.4 m, benefiting 506 producers. The investment was divided as
follow: a) SDE (43%), b) CS (37%), and c) IP (20%, mainly used for the Civil Fundalachuá
Association). The objective of the subproject analyzed in depth for this ICR (implemented by
Producers Association for Rural Development K'ajb'om, APRODERK) was to strengthen cocoa
production and marketing. The beneficiaries were 39 cocoa producers of Alta Verapaz
Department. The investment of US$ 60,377 was used as follow: (a) technical/administrative
assistance and capacity building (34%), including (i) GAP to improve productivity and product
safety and (ii) GMP to improve the quality of processed cocoa, and (b) 66% in seed capital for
cocoa processing equipment, as well as the packing process. The EIRR and FIRR are 20% and
17%, and the ENPV and FNPV are US$ 18,698 and US$ 12,556, respectively. Excluding family
labor and producers’ in-kind contribution, the IRR is 20% and the NPV is US$ 17,765. In this
case, incremental annual revenues attributable to project investment before and after taxes would
be US$ 13,779 and US$ 9,645, respectively (equivalent to US$ 353–247/family). Annual
employment generated for the production activity was 133 workers/year (28 paid labor and 105
unpaid family labor), or 3.4 person/year/family.

49.      Processed food and marketing subprojects: Overall, the project has supported 6
subprojects for a total investment of US$ 0.3 m (2% of the total investments in productive
subprojects), benefiting 289 producers. A jam processing and marketing subproject, implemented
by the Food Processing Center Nueva Esperanza, was analyzed. The subproject aimed at
improving the net income of the association members by increasing the efficiency of jam
production, packaging, and marketing. The investment of US$ 33,224, mainly in equipment to
optimize processing, helped to increase jam and sauce production volume from 1,835 to 12,000
bottles. The EIRR and FIRR are 19% and 18%, respectively, and the ENPV and FNPV are US$
8,467 and US$ 7,227, respectively. The FIRR and FNPV increase to 23% and US$ 13,283 when
the costs of family labor valued at market wage rates and the 10% beneficiary in-kind
contribution to technical assistance are excluded. In this case, the incremental annual revenues

                                                52
attributable to the investment before and after tax are US$ 9,066 and US$ 6,347, respectively
(equivalent to US$ 302–212/family). A permanent job was created by the association (the
accountant).

50.      Handcraft production and marketing: The financial and production data provided on
the selected subproject (Tikonel), which supported the production and marketing of wood items,
were not sufficient to carry out a financial and economic analysis. After the assessment of the
data, it was decided to drop this example in agreement with PDER team.

ANNEX 7. Beneficiary Survey Results

To gauge beneficiaries’ satisfaction and collect qualitative feedback on PDER’s benefits and
perceived impacts, the ICR team distributed and received customized surveys between February 2
and March 13, 2015 for RPOs and SDEs. Key results follow.
                                            Total Responses (#)
                                 SDE                 16
                                 RPOs                50


I. Rural Producer Organizations (RPOs)
    - The vast majority of indicators received “in agreement” responses (17 out of 18, or 94%).
        Questions were divided into four themes:
            o    Business
            o    Organizational
            o    Social/Environmental
            o    MINECO/SDE support


 1| Business. The most conclusive response received was a clear increase in production quality,
 which in turn led to higher sales and improved efficiency in the case of many OPs.
 Beneficiaries also felt more empowered thanks to higher success levels.
                                                                      “Technical assistance and

“Strengthened the participation of associates in decision-making, including women.”
“PDER allowed us to train artisans in the handling of leather; now we have the opportunity to
compete against quality brands in Europe, Asia and the United States.
“PDER helped increase incomes of producer families.”

“The project established parameters for starting the process of converting coffee production from
conventional to organic using culturally appropriate practices, pest and disease control and
nutrition.


 2| Organization. By encouraging participation of members in productive activities, PDER
 project helped strengthen organizational structure and cohesion—a common challenge faced
 by RPOs. Few responses indicated increased membership as an effect of the project, implying
 that perhaps more focus was placed on strengthening existing structure as opposed to
 increasing quantity of members.


 “The project made it possible to

“Members now have a stronger understanding of their organization because the mission and
vision is so clear.”
“The organization was strengthened by trainings and exchange trips, which were fundamental
for the management of other projects.”



 3| Social/Environmental. A key focus and impact of PDER was its inclusion of women and
 increased support for indigenous populations. Many RPOs saw a shift in the participation of
 women, yet few responses indicated that women’s contributions were taken into account by
 the directive body. Increased capacity for environmental mitigation practices was another
 pertinent result.
“Improved consciousness in terms of protecting the environment, particularly water sources, as
well as the collection of contaminants within farming areas, housing and surroundings.”
“We principally worked with K'iche and Ch'orti communities.”
“Interventions promoting increased participation of women should be more consistent.”
“Every project had an Environmental Management Plan that incorporated mitigation initiatives
as part of good agricultural practices.”
“Women were among the most interested in the project”

                  measures


  4| State Support. BDS/SDE responses indicated low agreement that bureaucratic processes
  were efficient and minimally bureaucratic. However, the role of the SDE was largely agreed to
  be clear and facilitated by project mechanisms. The vast majority (94%) agreed that these
  types of projects should be continued and that overall, the BDS benefited.

“The accompaniment of SDE support staff
was excellent; they were always present along with PDER personnel, monitoring project
execution. We enjoyed being included in this initiative, as there are many others who need it as
well. It was a pleasure working with MINECO for the first time in history.”


 5| Self-evaluation. 85% of responses indicated that the association was highly willing to
 compromise to achieve project results. The remainder indicated medium levels of
 compromise, or did not respond to the question.

     How would you qualify your association’s self-management (in terms of willingness
      to compromise) in subproject implementation?

“We're committed to continue supporting artisans thanks to tools derived from the seed capital in
order to reach more women in need of job opportunities.”


                                                64
“The commitment of our partners was instrumental in providing 20% in seed capital as well as
the use of inputs, tools and agricultural equipment purchased with PDER/MINECO funds,
allowing a productivity increase of 40%.”
“One commitment required by the organization is working hard to achieve the results of each
project and ensuring that donors feel satisfied with their achievements toward improving the
living conditions of its beneficiaries.”
“The project could have more thoroughly monitored and supervised implementation activities; at
times it was quite weak especially in regards to documentation management.”


 6| Future projects. A common response was a request for further training in how to achieve
 greater national and international market access. Respondents requested longer project
 duration periods as well as increased follow-up to ensure accessibility and sustainability of
 project development.

     What would you suggest to improve future projects?

The majority of indicators received “in agreement responses” (16 out of 19, or 84%).
Categories were the same as OP questions, but with different indicators.

 1| Business. The most important contribution based on beneficiary feedback was increased
 production quality and improved sales. However, beneficiaries only moderately agreed that
 new products and access to new markets/improved position in current markets were important
 contributions. In the case of new products, some beneficiaries (12.5%) disagreed that this was
 a contribution.


“Behavioral changes amongst beneficiaries allowed them to be more competitive and
improve the quality of their products.”
“The provision of seed capital by SDEs thanks to PDER allowed RPOs to increase
competitiveness and productivity, as well as their capacity to hire employees, access training
and new technologies, and increase productive infrastructure - all of which is reflected in
higher production and earnings.”
“One of the coffee groups was able to add toasting, grinding and packaging processes with
commercial equipment, and a blackberry organization was able to begin exporting
“Increased participation of women in processes needed to add value to products.”

 2| Organization. By encouraging participation of members in productive activities, the
 PDER project helped strengthen organizational structure and cohesion—a common
 challenge faced by RPOs. Few responses indicated increased membership as an effect of the
 project, implying that perhaps more focus was placed on strengthening existing structure as
 opposed to increasing quantity of members.

“Women were among the most interested in the project”


4| State Support. SDE responses indicated low agreement that bureaucratic processes
were efficient and minimally bureaucratic. The vast majority (94%) agreed that these
types of projects should be continued.


“PDER, SEGEPLAN and MINECO personnel in general conducted themselves with honesty
and responsibility, seen in few governmental projects.”
“Overall, processes involving the Ministry of Economy were efficient and not too
bureaucratic, besides delays in receiving seed capital.”
“The role of the SDE was clear, and the technical team truly facilitated precise execution of

 5| SDE Management. Many SDEs indicated high levels of participation and capability
 amongst RPOs, which allowed for a clear path toward achieving common goals and
 administrative clarity. However, bureaucratic delays were not entirely avoided, as
 several SDEs lost personnel or expressed other negative results due to slow receipt of
 payment (via seed capital) from PDER/MINECO.

6| Project Design & Sustainability. There was a widespread agreement that producer
organizations needed more access to commercialization and national and international
markets. Several noted the benefit of business interchanges and knowledge sharing.

    Which project activities would you have emphasized or added?
       o Technical assistance and follow-up
       o Certification payment training
       o Accompaniment in more than one production cycle
       o Commercialization, such as to external markets
       o Client relations
       o Higher amount of seed capital per beneficiary so as to make it more
           comprehensive
       o Participation of women
       o Higher presence of PDER personnel in the field
       o Increased business interchange with experienced organizations
       o Higher focus on programs that improve specific areas in a way that the RPO
           is able to continue improving them as they learn more and grow.

    Which project activities would you have emphasize less or not included?
       o Commonly mentioned over-emphasized aspects of the project were the high
           amount of required progress reports, which some SDEs mentioned hampered
           their development of actual project objectives.

7| Future Initiatives. General feedback requested longer execution periods of projects, so as
to coincide with production cycles and link with existing government initiatives, so as to
encourage sustainability and improved livelihoods after project completion.



                                                   69
 What suggestions do you have to improve future projects?
    o Projects should have an execution period of at least two years so that the
        project coincides with production cycles.
    o Increased emphasis on business strengthening so as to develop RPOs’
        capacity to grow their business through increased production and quality,
        increased access to international and national markets, and increase the
        livelihoods of its associates (examples include international market fairs and
        commercialization, such as packaging).
    o Develop evaluation mechanisms
    o Facilitate general project organization and administration to eliminate
        bureaucratic barriers, including the alignment of projects with institutional
        dynamics.
    o Be clear about payment procedures, especially seed capital distribution.
    o Include in the programs emerging RPOs that lack administrative organization
        but have high potential to develop.
    o Classify MiPyMES by levels and design projects for each level.

Externalities.

    1. Tropical Storm Agatha (2010): In 2010 the project dynamic was drastically
       interrupted by Tropical Storm Agatha. Funds and program indicators were re-
       oriented to address a need for rebuilding and rehabilitation of public infrastructure,
       with a particular emphasis placed on bridges. These new projects took advantage of
       newly gained skills in environmental risk management. Agatha reinforced the need

       for more in-depth territorial analysis and diagnostics regarding social, economic,
       environmental, and political realities.

   2. Change in national and municipal government (2012): As typically occurs with
      each governmental change, political orientations altered drastically. However, the
      National Planning System was not discarded, it was instead re-directed toward the
      construction of the National Development Plan (K’atun).

iii) Challenges for the Future in relation to Component 2 activities:

1. The IADB has mentioned its willingness to reallocate unused funds; this opens a
   window of opportunity to give continuity to the activities leading to the consolidation of
   the national planning system.
2. There are a set of identified needs, in order to ensure the sustainability of the gains made
   by PDER, which include:
           a. Revisit the structure of the two large regional delegations of SEGEPLAN in
               the southwest and northeast.
           b. Update PDM (Planes Desarrollo Municipal) – it is vital that a
               methodological guide for its update is constructed.
           c. Retain at least one expert consultant on territorial planning/management in
               departments with at least 20 municipalities; and at least two consultants in
               departments with 20 or more municipalities, so as to maintain territorial
               plans and operations.
3. Develop political advocacy toward approval of the National Planning Law.

ANNEX 9. Summary of External Final Project Evaluations

A. Methodology

EPYPSA (Estudios, Proyectos y Planificación S.A), a company selected by SEGEPLAN through
a competitive process, carried out the final evaluation of PDER project. The objectives of the
evaluation were threefold:

    -   Evaluate the management of PDER and its components in terms of relevance, efficacy,
        efficiency, and impact/sustainability;
    -   Identify key factors affecting PDER management; and
    -   Extract lessons learned for public policy and for the design and implementation of
        future related projects.

The evaluation did not have the character of an impact evaluation, as a major obstacle was the
lack of baseline and control group, without which it is difficult to adequately analyze a treated
and untreated group. Overall, 16 business plans (which underwent a two-stage selection process)
were analyzed in eight different departments. Additionally, six completed bridges were visited
and reviewed in the department of Chimaltenango. Main results follow.

Component 1
   Political and institutional instability had a deleterious effect on the performance of
     Component 1 activities.
   Endogenous and exogenous factors negatively affected annual progression of the
     project. Considering project progress, it is possible to divide the project performance
     into two stages: (1) low achievement from 2009 to 2012 and (2) high achievement from
     2013 until project closing.
          o From inception, neither the assignment of Business Plans (BPs) nor their function
               was very clear. Changes made after 2010/2011 to assignment criteria greatly
               improved the programs, as well as the management and execution of the BPs.
          o The project’s achievement improved significantly when a number of important
               BPs were approved in 2013, highlighting the importance of changes made in
               2012 and 2013 allocation adjustments.
          o Increased sales value was not as high as anticipated, with the reason attributed to
               overly ambitious goals for the types of RPOs receiving support.
          o Investments in productive infrastructure (on-farm/processing) combined with
               technical assistance in the BPs had the highest positive effect on sales.
    A possible explanation for the good performance of the project (Component 1) in later
     years is associated with the change in the execution of the productive infrastructure.
          o RPOs had a passive role when this subcomponent was executed by FONAPAZ.
               A transfer of funds in 2012 and change in management to MINECO after 2013
               allowed the RPOs more autonomy and sped up project execution.
          o General execution and supervision of the physical works were technically
               acceptable, however some cases saw scarce community participation in the needs
               assessment and design of the works.
    It is partially possible to see the results and impacts of the BPs from the beneficiary
     responses:
          o Perceived increases in productivity and production oscillated between 25% and
               50%, with sales increase data showing improvements between 25% and 75%.


                                               73
            o   Perceived improvements in income were 25%, although in reality most
                beneficiaries perceived increases up to 75%.
            o   Additionally, about 40% of beneficiaries considered their lives better than before
                the project.
            o   Variability in responses can be attributed to a range of factors, including RPOs’
                level of organization, the quality of the support received from the SDEs; the fact
                that the business plans had only two business cycles, and, as a consequence, an
                inability to properly evaluate improvement in business.
            o   Positive perception on the improvement of RPO’s internal management.

Subcomponent 1.3: Bridge Reconstruction
    Implementation was characterized by an excessively long pre-investment period and
      delays in project execution.
    There were 92 bridges for which pre-investment studies were conducted; 50 were
      completed. This is attributed to a lack of comprehensive research conducted before pre-
      investment studies were commissioned.
    The quality of the work completed is acceptable. In particular, the Technical Audit
      conducted was indispensable for correcting defects and providing supervision for
      contractors with respect to the technical specifications and depth of work, as well as to
      guarantee structural protection.
    The bridges had a substantial contribution to local development as far as communication
      improvements between communities is concerned. Beneficiary responses were
      overwhelmingly positive.

Component 2
   Overall, this component succeeded in developing an improved National Planning System
     and the generation of a culture of planning at the local level. The success of this indicator
     can be seen in the massive amount of planning instruments facilitated by the project at
     the municipal, departmental, regional, and national levels. Products are uniform in their
     quality.
   It is still too early to measure the impact of the plans, but elements to measure success
     and failure have been established and in some cases, institutionalized.

Component 3
   Established indicators were achieved. SEGEPLAN’s reports were conducted each
     semester and other project documents are available in the project’s online portal. These
     documents share important information on project achievements, with information on
     finances as well.
   The system used to conduct monitoring (SAP Business Objects) was extremely useful for
     reports thanks to its 24/7 availability. SAP helped monitor PDER, but it wasn’t as useful
     for administration and management during project execution.
   With respect to results indicators, there were no tools or bases for opportune follow-up.
     This is most critical in regard to Component 1, with additional difficulties in updating
     Subcomponent 1.3. This is attributed to issues with communication between FONAPAZ
     and SEGEPLAN/MINECO, which did improve after 2013.
   Follow-up and monitoring of Component 2 was excellent thanks to efforts of
     SEGEPLAN.

B. Recommendations/Takeaway lessons
Component 1

                                               74
    1. Institutional program structure must be much more independent of political change.
    2. Before starting, the project must have all its resources prepared and adjusted (this
       includes levels of competency of personnel working on the project).
    3. Take careful consideration of what indicators and goals are established, maintaining
       realistic expectations while considering project objectives and the possibility of
       adjustments over time.
    4. Strengthen the role and participation of beneficiaries in regard to decision-making
       processes.
    5. Improve monitoring of execution, particularly in regard to the payments for services
       provided by the SDEs.
    6. Strengthen internal structures of RPOs to promote higher levels of transparency and
       distribution of possible benefits.
    7. Moving forward, it is important that RPOs receive business and financial support to
       ensure sustainable results.
    8. Ensure that the physical work being executed is in all cases very clear and directly linked
       to the goal of productive linkages. This includes a need for SDEs and RPOs to be
       involved at every step so as to ensure relevancy and meet specific needs.

Subcomponent 1.3
   1. To improve the speed of implementation for similar projects in the future, it is necessary
      to invest in a team of qualified designers and specialists (environmental, structural, and
      civil). This will lead to improvements in bridge quality and sustainability.
   2. Work closely with relevant municipal authorities and community organizations to ensure
      long-term maintenance of built infrastructures.

Component 2
  1. This component was conducted parallel in time with Component 1, although the ideal
     situation would have been to conduct Component 2 ahead of Component 1 so as to gain
     valuable insight when designing productive linkages from the effects of the territorial
     planning systems.
  2. Results show that effective citizen participation is a fundamental aspect for the
     sustainability of these types of interventions. Additional active participation of
     development councils, local governments, sectorial representatives, and the private sector
     would contribute to a more efficient use of public resources and an overall sense of
     camaraderie among stakeholders.

Component 3
  1. A system such as SAP Business Objects is vital in these types of projects. It is important
     to use the system, however, in a way that integrates the different actors and roles: RPOs,
     BDPS, and program staff during project implementation.
