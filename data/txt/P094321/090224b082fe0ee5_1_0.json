Some lessons\n            learned included: reducing political interference through\n            transparent and competitive staff selection procedures and\n            performance evaluations. Political instability and\n            interference, with the resulting staff changes, affected\n            project implementation. In anticipation of such challenges,\n            it is critical to include mitigation measures, to the extent\n            possible, during project preparation. In similar projects\n            supported by the World Bank in Latin America, transparent\n            and competitive staff selection procedures and performance\n            evaluations are included in the agreements for project\n            implementation. Measures that have proven highly successful\n            in ensuring staff continuity include the use of two\n            different external firms to take responsibility for: (i)\n            staff recruitment, which encourages unaffiliated\n            professionals to apply for project positions and widen the\n            candidate pool, and (ii) yearly performance evaluations\n            based on individual work plans and interviews with\n            beneficiaries. Although the project achieved its objective\n            in terms of reaching women, their active role in the Rural\n            Producer Organization (RPOs) remains low. Specific\n            strategies should be considered to foster women\u2019s\n            participation, such as establishing a specific business line\n            to support the types of businesses opportunities that\n            traditionally attract a high level of interest among women.\n            On the other hand, implementing dissemination events\n            specifically directed at women is a good practice in\n            demand-driven interventions such as Rural Economic\n            Development Program (PDER), as well as making targeted and\n            customized gender sensitive training available for RPOs."}, "docdt": "2015-06-01T00:01:03Z"}
