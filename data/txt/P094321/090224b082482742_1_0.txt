                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are (i) to improve the competitiveness of rural productive supply chains with strong indigenous participation; and (ii) to
                         strengthen the institutional capacity of the public entities participating in the program through the adoption of a territorial management model with indigenous
                         participation.

                         The project is scheduled to close on July 31, 2014 and project activities are advancing towards reaching the completion point, while ensuring achievement of results. This is despite
                         changes in the contract norms of the country, affecting the project management unit and requiring reconfiguration of all Terms of Reference and remuneration of consultants working
                         with project resources. Of the 176 sub-projects led by MINECO, 84 have already closed their activities with the remaining 92 scheduled to close by project closing, reaching around
                         107,000 indirect beneficiaries in rural areas (90% of whom are indigenous people). SEGEPLAN continues to perform well in delivering results under Component 2, related to
