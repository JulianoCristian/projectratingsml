The purpose\n            of this restructuring is to extend the closing date for the\n            project, by 12 months - from February 1, 2013 until January\n            31, 2014. The extension of closing date will be the third\n            second level project restructuring and the first extension\n            of closing date for this loan. Previous project\n            restructurings were approved on April 7, 2009 and June 30,\n            2011. Present disbursements amount to US$10,203,618.03 or\n            34.01 percent of the total loan amount of US$30 million. The\n            project's most recent progress towards achievement of\n            PDO is rated unsatisfactory and implementation progress is\n            moderately unsatisfactory. However, the project objectives\n            continue to be achievable. Of the two PDO indicators, the\n            one related to municipal projects stemming from the\n            participatory process planning has already surpassed and\n            doubled the target. The extension is necessary to allow the\n            project to implement 27 already approved business plans, and\n            seek the approval of more as feasible, enabling the project\n            to reach the other PDO indicator (increase of total sales of\n            the rural productive supply chain partnerships with US$50\n            million during the project period). The project had a\n            satisfactory audit report in 2011; the 2012 audit report\n            will be financed by the Inter-American Development Bank\n            (IADB) (a co-financier of the project). Financial\n            management, procurement performance, and the overall\n            safeguard compliance, continue to be moderately\n            satisfactory. An action plan has been agreed with the client\n            and officially sent to the World Bank on August 20, 2012.\n            The action plan is formulated in 5 steps, the first being an\n            extension of the closing date of the loan for 12 months. The\n            remaining 4 steps of the action plan will be discussed in\n            detail with the client during a mission in November 2012 and\n            specific actions will be improving performance. This will\n            involve a project restructuring related to improving\n            implementing agency performance, reallocation of proceeds\n            and adjustments of intermediate indicator targets."}, "docdt": "2012-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
