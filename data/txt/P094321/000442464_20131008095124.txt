                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.       This Restructuring Paper proposes a restructuring of the Guatemala Rural
Economic Development Project, Loan 7374-GU, P094321 to: 1) modify the Project’s
implementing arrangements; 2) extend the Project closing date; 3) reallocate loan
proceeds; 4) modify the Project’s disbursement arrangements; and 5) revise indicator
targets.

2.      This will be the fourth Project restructuring. The first restructuring (approved in
April 2009) expanded disbursement categories to allow the financing from loan proceeds
of consultants, operational costs, management costs and training for the co-executing
agencies of the Project and corrected two minor errors in the Loan Agreement. The
second restructuring (approved in June 2011) resulted in: i) reallocation of funds to
finance rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by Tropical Storm Agatha on May 9,
2010; ii) triggering of the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12); iii) expansion of
the Project nation-wide; and iv) revision of Project result indicators and targets. The third
restructuring (approved on November 1, 2012) extended the Project’s closing date by one
year to January 31, 2014.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.     Project Background. The Guatemala Rural Economic Development Project (in the
amount of US$30 million) was approved on March 29, 2006 and made effective on
November 26, 2007. Its original closing date was January 31, 2013. The Project
Development Objective (PDO) is (i) to improve the competitiveness of rural productive
supply chains with strong indigenous participation; and (ii) to strengthen the institutional
capacity of the public entities participating in the program for the adoption of a territorial
management model with indigenous involvement. The Project finances three
components, namely (i) investments in productive supply chains ($53.6 million; IBRD
$27.3 million); (ii) strengthening of territorial public management capacities for
competitiveness ($3.5 million; IBRD: $1.4 million); and (iii) management, monitoring
and evaluation ($2.8 million; IBRD $1.2 million). As of March 25, 2013, the Project has
disbursed US$14.8 million representing 49 percent of the total loan.

4.      Project Performance. Despite past difficulties, the Project is making progress
towards achieving its objectives. This has been recognized in the Project’s most recent
ISR with an upgrade to moderately satisfactory for both progress towards achievement of
PDO and implementation. The upgrade was based on the careful assessment of Project
results to date and agreed work program until Project closing. An important factor in the
assessment are recent developments in Project implementation, including the
implementation of 27 new business plans and the launch in November 2012 of a call for
proposals which is expected to add close to 70 more business plans to the Project by May

                                                                                            4
2013. This is expected to bring the Project towards reaching its first PDO indicator
(regarding the increase of total sales of the rural supply chain partnerships). The target for
the second PDO indicator (regarding territorial development) has already been surpassed.
Financial management and procurement performance, as well as overall safeguard
compliance, continue to be moderately satisfactory. There are no outstanding audits. A
first partial draft of the report (covering the period until August 2012) was presented to
the Bank in February 2013, with the complete report due in June 2013.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

5.      Change in Implementing Arrangements. The Project has three implementing
agencies, MINECO (sub-component 1.1), SEGEPLAN (Components 2 and 3) and
FONAPAZ (sub-component 1.3). While Project implementation by MINECO and
SEGEPLAN has been satisfactory, the performance of FONAPAZ has been
unsatisfactory. On January 17, 2013, FONAPAZ was officially dissolved. The
Liquidation Commission of FONAPAZ has informed the World Bank officially that the
Project team in FONAPAZ will be maintained to complete its pending commitments,
which include the completion of infrastructure works (bridges). An Action Plan has been
developed to ensure that FONAPAZ completes all bridges by the due date. A formal
letter has also been sent to the Government of Guatemala informing them of the agreed
deadlines for physical closure of the work on the bridges (March 30, 2013) and the date
for financial closure (May 30, 2013). Those have been reflected in the revised
Disbursement Letter and Loan Agreement. All other activities for which FONAPAZ was
the implementing agency will now be transferred to MINECO. Thus, the Loan
Agreement is being revised to reflect this change and relevant changes have also been
made to the Disbursement Letter.

6.      Extension of Closing Date. The Government had originally requested an 18
months extension of closing date. However, given the Project progress when this request
was received, the Bank decided to grant only a one year extension – with a revised
closing date of January 31, 2014 - to enable pending activities to take place and give time
to the Project to justify the need for further extension. Given the progress made to date
and the new business plans for producer organizations being considered (close to 70
business plans have been presented with 52 already approved), it is important to extend
the closing date by another 6 months – to July 31, 2014 – to allow for the new business
plans to be implemented. Signature of one-year contracts with the relevant producer
organizations will only be possible if the remaining Project period is extended.

7.      Reallocation of Loan Proceeds. The request for reallocation of loan proceeds is
directly related to the change in implementing arrangements, reflecting the shift of
responsibilities and related resources to the remaining two implementing agencies
(MINECO and SEGEPLAN). Project funds from Category (2) (corresponding to
FONAPAZ’s activities under sub-component 1.3), the remaining funds under Category
(3) and Category (6b) and funds in the Unallocated Category will be distributed across
the other expenditure categories. Reflecting the new institutional arrangements and the
greater role of MINECO in the oversight of Project activities, most of the reallocated
funds will be shifted to Category 1 to cover investment subprojects under sub-component
                                                                                            5
1.1., implemented by MINECO. The operating costs have been adjusted proportionately,
also including the adjustment of the percentage of expenditures to be financed under
Category (6b) by eliminating the previously established cap. There is no change in
overall Project costs. The reallocation does not result in a change to the Project activities
but requires a modification to the Project description related to implementation
arrangements in the Loan Agreement (all investment subproject-related responsibilities
are transferred from FONAPAZ to MINECO). Annex 2 provides a summary of the
allocations of funds across categories, components and sub-components.

8.      Disbursement arrangements. The Disbursement Letter is also being modified with
the ceiling for Category 1 being increased from US$500,000 to US$1,000,000 given the
change in implementation arrangements, namely the shift of activities and resources from
sub-component 1.3. (implemented by FONAPAZ) towards sub-component 1.1.
(implemented by MINECO). This change was requested by the client in the context of
the reallocation of loan proceeds and MINECO’s oversight of productive infrastructure
investments. In addition, the Disbursement Letter is amended by adding a Section IV on
Additional Disbursement Instructions that references communications between the
Ministry of Finance, FONAPAZ and the Bank clarifying that FONAPAZ may pay and
incur expenditures related to infrastructure works (Categories 2) until March 30, 2013,
and will have an additional two-month period until May 30, 2013 to document
expenditures incurred under Category 2 and may also incur and document Operating
Costs incurred under Category 6. b. FONAPAZ will be responsible for refunding any
funds received in their designated account that were not spent and documented by the
dates indicated.

9.       Changes in indicators and targets. The wording of certain Project indicators has
been revised and some targets modified to reflect Project changes. Annex 1 presents the
revised results framework. The language of the first indicator was modified and the target
was revised. The adjustment in the first PDO target was done using an incremental sales
analysis based on Project data (presented in the last Aide Memoire), to ensure that the
target is internally consistent with the current Project structure. It refers to the increase in
total sales of the rural productive supply chain partnerships with US$ 35 million during
the Project period (instead of the US$50 million originally planned). The other PDO
indicator (related to municipal projects stemming from the participatory process
planning) has already surpassed its target, which was originally set too low. Therefore the
target is being increased.

     The project initial allocation to Component 1 (for productive partnerships) was for US$53.6 million, of which US$27.3 were from the World Bank and US$26.3 from IADB). Sub-
   component 1.2 was not implemented by the IADB (US$8 million) and with the delays in the start of project activities and the decision of the IADB not to extend the project duration, a
   total of US$13.4 million dollars were pulled back by the IADB (around 49% of IADB’s planned contribution to the component and 25% of the total component amount). This reduction
   of invested resources is reflected in a proportional reduction of project outcome target.
