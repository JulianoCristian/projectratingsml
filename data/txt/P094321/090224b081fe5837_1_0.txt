                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are (i) to improve the competitiveness of rural productive supply chains with strong indigenous participation; and (ii) to
                         strengthen the institutional capacity of the public entities participating in the program through the adoption of a territorial management model with indigenous
                         participation.

                         Despite the past challenges, the project is making progress and effectively pursuing mitigation measures to ensure achievement of objectives. The project has been extended by six
                         additional months (new closing date of July 31, 2014) to compensate for delays in effectiveness and allow the project to carry out all planned activities. A total of 81 new for sub-
                         projects have started implementation since the call for proposals announced to the public in mid-November 2012 by MINECO. SEGEPLAN continues to perform well in delivering
                         results under Component 2. The project's monitoring and evaluation framework is very good and can be of great use not only for project evaluation, but more importantly, for

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         - Carry on with the 81 sub-projects approved by the Project Technical committee under Component 1.
                         - Carry on with sub-projects with productive infrastructure transferred to MINECO from FONAPAZ (under Component 1).
                         - Restructure the project to reflect the change of status of FONAPAZ, reassign resources across loan categories and revise indicators.
                         - Deliver all public infrastructure (bridges) overseen by FONAPAZ.
                         - Reassign resources (from MINECO to SEGEPLAN) to allow SEGEPLAN to provide support with the design of the National Development Plan of Guatemala.
