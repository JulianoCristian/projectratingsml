                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are (i) to improve the competitiveness of rural productive supply chains with strong indigenous participation; and (ii) to
                         strengthen the institutional capacity of the public entities participating in the program through the adoption of a territorial management model with indigenous
                         participation.

                         Despite the past challenges, the project is making progress and effectively pursuing mitigation measures to ensure achievement of objectives. The project has been extended by one
                         year (new closing date of January 31, 2014) to compensate for delays in effectiveness and allow the project to carry out all planned activities. A new call for proposals has been
                         announced to the public (in mid-November 2012) by MINECO, with an estimated 60 new sub-projects to result from it. Significant progress in completing the work on bridges has
                         been made by FONAPAZ. SEGEPLAN continues to perform well in delivering results under Component 2. The project's monitoring and evaluation framework is very good and can be

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following agreements were reconfirmed:
                         - No additional contracts (other than the ones already approved) for the construction of bridges will be approved. Current activities have to close by January 31, 2013, which also
                         implies a closure of project activities with FONAPAZ.
                         - With regard to the transfer of funds to producer organizations for the construction of physical infrastructure, theresponsibility for transfer of funds and supervision of the works will be
                         assigned to MINECO for all physical infrastructure for which FONAPAZ would not have initiated the first transfer by September 18 2012. By early November, 2012 close to 80% of

                         transfers were made.
                         - In a formal communication, the GOG has requested modifications to project implementation arrangements to reflect the agreements; among them is an extension of closing date
                         (granted for 1 year), reallocation of funds to reflect changes in responsibilities and revision of indicators to better reflect project reality.
