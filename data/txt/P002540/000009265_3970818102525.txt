IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Multisector I Project in Sao
Tome and Principe (STP) for whicih Credit 2038-STP in the amount of SDR3.9 million (US$5.0
million equivalent) was approved on Junie 14, 1989 and made effective on February 23, 1990.
The Credit was closed on December 3 1, 1996, the original closing date. It was fully
disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on June I 1, 1996. Cofinanicilig for the Pro'ject was
provided by the Government of Portugal, the United Nations ('hidr-enl's Fund (UNICEF), and the
European Unioll.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Leslie Pean, Task Manager, and Mr. George Faillace,
Consultant. It was reviewed by Mr. Hasan Tuluy, Country Director, AFC 15 and edited by Mrs.
Pushpa N. Schwartz. The Borrower provided comments that are included as appendixes to the
ICR.
Preparation of the ICR was begun during the Bank's supervisioni/completioni missions in
January and October 1996. It is based on materials in the project file, including the Staff Appraisal
Report, and interviews with IDA staff involved in Project implementation and with Borrower's
staff.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Government of Sao Tome and Principe (GOSTP) adopted, in 1987, a comprehensive
Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) supported by two Structural Adjustment Credits from the
International Development Association (IDA). The first was approved in 1987 (US$4.0 million equivalent
from IDA, and US$3.0 million equivalent from the Special Facility for Africa), and the second was
approved in 1990 (US$9.75 million equivalent). The first phase of the SAP made short-term progress to
move Sao Tome and Priicipe (STP) from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. The second
phase (]991-95), which was supported by various donors, emphasized reduction of the public sector and a
growing role for the private sector. Aside from stabilization measures, it also addressed structural reforms,
mainly land distribution, privatization of public enterprises, and a profound financial sector reform.
Unfortunately, the fundamental changes sought in the economy were not achieved.
2.    In addition, the implementation of the adjustment program was negatively affected by political
instability and excessively expansive fiscal and monetary policies. As a result, economic and financial
performance deteriorated particularly in respect to inflation which almost doubled in 1994 compared to
previous years. The GOSTP took measures for economic revival and the protection of vulnerable groups,
which was supported by an IDA-financed Economic Rehabilitation and Modernization Project in mid-
1985. The project was designed to help remove critical physical constraints to production and covered
small investments in agriculture, fisheries, transport, and energy as well as studies, technical assistance
(TA), and training. In mid-1989, in response to the need for furthier assistance, IDA approved the first
Multisector Project (MSP).
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    The MSP sought to mitigate the social and economic impact of economic decline and structural
adjustment by generating income and employment opportunities for low-income, urban and rural
households through subprojects in the social as well as the infrastructure sectors. The project was also to
support the development of the emerging private sector with the help of a lie of credit.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
4.    The Credit was approved in June 1989, became effective in February 1990 and last disbursement
was made on June I1, 1996. The project was to be implemented by the Social and Infrastructure Fund
(SIF), a new autonomous institution created under the project. SIF with the assistance of IDA identified
and appraised a start-up phase consisting of six priority. Total estimated cost of these subprojects was
US$3.8 million, these were successfully implemented.
5.    Employment and income were generated for low-income groups in construction and rehabilitation
and textbooks were provided to primary school children. In addition, essential drugs were provided to the
poor, the on-going malaria eradication program was continued, and the Endemic Disease Center was



- iii -
constructed. Water supply was successfully rehabilitated and improved. The Project thus helped provide
basic services to the neediest and paved the way for more comprehensive social sector interventions by
IDA.
6.    In terms of institutional development, the capacity of the Ministries of Education and Health to
plan and set policies were impaired specifically to deal with poverty alleviation. The objective of providing
capital for emerging small-scale enterprises, however, was not achieved because of serious delays by the
GOSTP in creating the enabling environment for the private sector to develop. Because of this and the
lack of Government support, no further subprojects were prepared and the line of credit for private sector
development was canceled.
7.    In summary, project objectives were only marginally met and the overall outcome is judged less
than satisfactory. All in all, the project outcome is judged as less than satisfactory. In spite of difficulties
with counterpart funds payment, SIF was created and it executed the Project during a transitional period.
SIF/INDES served as a mechanism to assist in the transition towards liberalization. Basic infrastructure
improved as planned. Efforts to assist private sector growth were not successful. The experience gained
from the MSP was invaluable for designing the IDA-assisted Social Sector Project. The skills of a number
of local professionals were improved and capacity created for future project design and implementation.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS, AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
8.    A key lesson learned from the MSP implementation experience is that project design should
conform to the realities of the adjustment process. This lesson is best illustrated by the experience with the
private sector component. It was assumed that as privatization progressed there would be great demand for
credit in the private sector, particularly if the economy was growing. It was also assumed that financial
sector reform, a key element for private sector development, would take place rapidly. This did not take
place because GOSTP did not decide to divest and privatize public enterprises, and no privatization took
place until the MSP was virtually completed. Thus, the line of credit for the private sector was largely
unused.
9.     Other important lessons are: (a) to the extent possible, counterpart contributions should be secured
as part of the conditions for Credit effectiveness; (b) TA should only be carried out within a clear
framework and an appropriate action plan; (c) social funds, such as SIF, should be set up with as much
autonomy as possible, because Government intervention can cause implementation delays; (d)
coordination with other donors is important for policy change.
10.   The follow-up operation -- Multisector II Project, approved in June 1992, drew substantially on the
MSP experience. The objectives of this Project are similar to the MSP, although its focus was on
infrastructure rehabilitation. However, as for the MSP, the second project was unable to deal with the
issues of counterpart funds, technical assistance and autonomy of social funds.

II.  BACKGROUND
1.    Sao Tome and Principe (STP) is a small, two-island country in the Gulf of Guinea, with a
population of 133,225 (July 1993 est.), a third of wlhom live in the capital city of Sao Tome and other
urban areas. Its economy has remained dependent on cocoa since independence 20 years ago; however,
cocoa production has gradually declined because of drought and m ismanagement, so that by 1994 annual
output had fallen from 10,000 tons to 3,200 tons. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has created a
serious balance-of-payments problem. Agriculture production was further discouraged by inappropriate
price and trade policies including an overvalued exchange rate and low international cocoa prices in the
second half of the 1980s.
2.    In 1987, the Government of Sao Tome and Principe (GOSTP) adopted a comprehensive Structural
Adjustment Program (SAP), supported by two Structural Adjustment Credits (SACs) from IDA: the first
in 1987 (US$4.0 million and US$3.0 million equivalent from the Special Facility for Africa) and the
second in 1990 (US$9.75 million equivalent). The first phase of the SAP made some short-term progress
to move the country from a centrally planned to a market-based econiomy. The second phase (199 1-1995)
emphasized reduction in the size of the public sector and growth of the private sector. Besides a number of
stabilization measures, this phase addressed structural reforms, mainly land distribution, privatization of
public enterprises, and a profound financial sector reform. However, the fundamental changes sought in
the economy were not achieved.
3.     The adverse social consequences of adjustment were expected to be outweighed by economic
growth and efficiency gains. However, implementation of the SAP was hindered by political instability
resulting from a succession of three different governments, and by an attempted military coup in 1995. In
addition, because of excessive expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, the country's economic and
financial performance deteriorated and the rate of inflation almost doubled in 1994 compared with earlier
years. IDA supported the GOSTP's measures to protect the disadvantaged groups through the Economic
Rehabilitation and Modernization Project (Cr. 1590-STP), in the amount of ';DR 5.3 million (US$5.0
million equivalent) approved in May 1985. This credit, the first IDA operation in the country, financed a
line of credit that aimed at removing critical physical constraints that had developed as a result of the
economic crisis through small investments in agriculture, fisheries, transport, and energy as well as studies,

technical assistance (TA) and training. IDA's support for these types of investments continued through Cr.
2038-STP approved in June 1989 for the First Multisector Project (MSP), to be implemented by a new
autonomous institution created under the project, the Social Infrastructure Fund (SIF).
HI.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The MSP was aimed at mitigating the social and economic impact of economic decline and
structural adjustment by generating income and employment opportunities for low-income, under-
employed and unemployed urban and rural households through components for: (a) education: including
the supply, storage, and distribution of text books; (b) health: including provision of a facility to help
support the immediate phase of an Integrated Malaria Control Program; (c) physical infrastructure:
including rehabilitation of water supply and construction of a municipal market in the capital city of Sao
Tome; and (d) private sector development by means of a line of credit (LOC). The SIF, a flexible and
simple organization, was to be established for rapid and effective implementation of subprojects in these
four areas.
5.    Project objectives were clear, realistic, and consistent with IDA's strategy to assist STP's short-
term recovery from an economic crisis and prepare for long-term development. A major risks to the
Borrower was the capacity of SIF to maintain an adequate standard of subproject appraisal and
management of the implementation process in as many as four sectors. An important action taken was
SIF's proposal for modification of its structure which was endorsed by the Bank. A consultant was
appointed by SIF to draft the necessary changes to SIF's Decree Law of 1989 and in August 1994, Decree
Law No. 22/94 was approved creating Instituto para o Desenvolvivmiento Economico e Social (INDES)
as the successor of SIF.
IV. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.     SIF and IDA identified and appraised a start-up phase consisting of six priority subprojects, one in
each category; this process provided an opportunity to test the appraisal methodology and initiate on-the-
job training of local staff. Each subproject was supported by an economic and financial analysis. The
start-up phase encompassed the following subprojects: (a) Textbook Printing and Distribution; (b)
Education Planning and Administration; (c) Malaria and Endemic Disease Control; (d) Health Planning
and Management; (e) Water Supply Rehabilitation; (f) Public Market Development. The total estimated
cost of these start-up subprojects was US$3.8 million, of which SIF's share was US$2.3 million or almost
half of the IDA Credit Because of SIF's weaknesses and lack of Government commitment, no further
subprojects were prepared and the line of credit for private sector development was canceled. These
subprojects were successfully implemented.
7.    Employment and income were generated for low-income groups in civil works construction.
Textbooks were provided to primary school children, who for many years before the SAP was initiated,
had none available to them. Altogether, some 22,000 students in 71 primary schools and 9,000 students
in 10 secondary schools obtained textbooks. Essential drugs were provided to the poor who had hardly
any access to such drugs before; the on-going malaria eradication program was continued, and the
Endemic Disease Center was constructed. A modicum of cost recovery was established in the essential
drugs and textbook subprojects. Water supply, which had been a problem ever since independence
because the civil works had deteriorated badly, was successfully rehabilitated and improved. The Project
thus helped provide basic services to the population, especially the neediest families. Achievement of
MSP objectives in mitigating the social and economic impact of economic decline and structural
adjustment was, in the limited scope of this project, satisfactory.



8.    In terms of institutional development, the Ministry of Health was assisted with TA and training in
setting up a statistical and planning unit that has been operational since mid-1991. A statistical analysis
and information system was established in the Ministry of Education and it developed capacity to supervise
projects; but the planning capacity was not put into place. Both ministries developed capability to
formulate policies and implement projects in their respective sectors, largely with the TA and training
provided under the Project. Achievements of MSP in terms of institutional development were satisfactory.
9.     The objectives of the project with regard to private sector development, were not met.
Privatization of public enterprises was delayed, largely because SIF's Board met infrequently. Three
enterprises were identified and appraised by SIF for divestiture, but no financing was provided to private
entrepreneurs for their purchase because SIF's Board did not consider the timing of privatization to be
appropriate. Much more progress will be needed in liberalization of the economy, restructuring of the
financial system, and provision of investment incentives before privatization can succeed.
V.  IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
10.    Factors Subject to Government Control. The first factor that substantially affected implementation
of the MSP was that the Borrower did not have clear development plan for the sectors supported by the
Project, even though as part of the SAC II, it reached agreement with IDA on a Public Investment Program
(PIP). The Subprojects supported under MSP were clearly priority areas under the PIP. With the
exception of one, all other sub-projects were successfully completed by INDES.
11.   The second factor that substantially affected Project implementation was the lack of GOSTP
support for the SIF. While SIF's organizational structure and responsibilities were well-defined and
appropriate regulations, guidelines, and procedures had been put in place, the GOSTP did not clearly
understand the role that this new institution would play. SIF was viewed with suspicion and criticized by
Government officials for operating outside the bureaucracy and for its high staff salaries. Little effort was
made to have the GOSTP participate in setting up SIF and understand the purposes of the institution which
led to delays in subproject preparation and approvals. A workshop to introduce the new institution to
officials in the GOSTP and donor agencies was planned but not held. Efforts to carry out a publicity
campaign were also curtailed. The lack of GOSTP interest in SIF is a reflection of both the lack of
administrative capacity within the GOSTP and institutional conflicts. SIF managed, nevertheless, to
complete the initial batch of subprojects in a timely manner because preparation (which represented the
bulk of the financing) had been thorough and because no Board approval was required.
12.   The third factor that affected implementation substantially was the persistent delays in the
provision of GOSTP counterpart funds due to shortfalls in public revenues and weak budgetary
management and administration. This, in turn, led to delays in project execution. It also affected SIF staff
morale adversely as payment of salaries and bills was often delayed. In early 1993, at the request of the
GOSTP, IDA agreed to increase its share of financing of operational costs. The Development Credit
Agreement was amended accordingly in late 1993.
13.    Factor Subject to Implementing Agency Control. Another decision that was taken after
considerable delay was to de-emphasize financing by SIF of private-sector subprojects and concentrate
instead on public-sector subprojects. Once it became clear that SIF Board would not meet to review
private-sector subprojects (only one small subproject had been approved before 1992), the Bank asked
SIF's management to curtail all work on preparation of private sector subprojects and redeploy staff to
prepare public-sector subprojects. This change in emphasis took effect in May 1993.



-4-
VI. PROJECT RESULTS
14.    The overall project outcome is judged as less than satisfactory. In spite of difficulties with
counterpart funds payment, SIF was created and it executed the Project during a transitional period in the
country's evolution as it shifted from a command to a market economy. SIF/INDES served as a
mechanism to assist in the transition towards liberalization, not only in the infrastructure and other public
sectors, but also in removing some inherited skill constraints. Basic infrastructure, such as roads, clinics,
and drainage channels was built or rehabilitated and health and education services were improved as
planned. Efforts to assist private sector growth were not successful, as three out of the four private sector
projects financed were not implemented. The experience gained from the MSP was invaluable for
designing the IDA-assisted Social Sector Project. The skills of a number of local professionals were
improved and capacity created for future project design and implementation.
VII. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
15.   MSP's achievements are uncertain. SIF was conceived as a dynamic, evolving implementation
(executing) institution. It was anticipated that SIF's raison d'etre would change in the future with
significant improvements in the country's economy. These improvements were expected to affect, in
particular, the private sector's access to capital. SIF's role in direct lending to the private sector was
expected to have a finite life. Moreover, experience world-wide with direct lending by public development
agencies has not been positive. Under the amended Decree Law, SIF (known now as INDES) was no
longer permitted to engage in lending to the private sector. Further evolution in the way INDES operates is
expected with further economic improvement in the country; over the longer term, INDES' role is likely to
shift to providing access to donor funding for communities, local governments, and NGOs and to assisting
the emerging private sector by channeling resources from external donors through the new financial system
for term financing needed for fixed assets.
16.    Sustainability of the institution depends on the willingness of the Government to accept the
remodeling of INDES to make it more autonomous and on the finding of a solution to the salary issue.
Unless INDES role is redefined and its reorientation accepted by the Government, the institution will not
be sustainable. In its present form, INDES can only continue to exist if it receives external funding or if
Government accepts to carry out reforms to make it an Executing Agency for the implementation of most
donor-funded projects in STP, thereby contributing to reducing its overhead cost.
17.   As for the sustainability of its output, this will depend on the acceptance by the beneficiaries of the
new framework for assistance. Through the subprojects it financed, INDES introduced the concept of cost
recovery and paved the way for its efficacy in a country where there is virtually little or no tradition of
paying for public services. Suggestions of charging user fees for public services have often met with
resistance even among Government officials. However, such attitudes are changing as the reality of
meager budgetary resources sets in, and the change will help ensure the future sustainability of MSP
subprojects.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
18.   IDA's role throughout project preparation and appraisal was satisfactory. Project supervision was
satisfactory through at least two annual supervision missions and almost continuous long-distance advice
and support. On the other hand, more efforts should have been made to explain the role of the institution to
GOSTP officials and to secure their support. Frequent changes in Task Managers after April 1992 and the
Bank reorganizations contributed to lack of continuity in project support. These elements affected
negatively IDA's performance to government expectations.

IX. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
19.    The Borrower's performance during project preparation and the start-up phase of implementation
was satisfactory. There was considerable support for SIF and its functions. Regular SIF Board of
Administration meetings were held and decisions were taken, all of which were crucial for the sound
establishment of the institution. However, when the new Government took over in January 1991, SIF's
first Executive Director was removed and over eight months elapsed before a new Executive Director was
appointed. It became clear that interest in the institution had waned. Furthermore, the Borrower delayed
by almost one year its counterpart contribution, which resulted in freezing of the Special Account that
delayed implementation and affected SIF staff morale adversely. The Borrower's performance during
project implementation is considered unsatisfactory.
X.    FUTURE OPERATIONS
20.    Because of the relative success of MSP and in spite of implementation obstacles encountered along
the way, a second Multisector Project was approved by the Board in June 1992 (US$ 540,000 was used
from the budget of the first MSP to prepare the second MSP). This second Project, focused on financing
infrastructure rehabilitation, is also being implemented by SIF. The same problems encountered in MSP
have arisen during implementation of the Second Multisector Project. A third Project focusing on
employment generation and on grass-roots development is being prepared with a different institutional
arrangement, modeled on the AGETIP Executing Agency in Senegal. However, GOSTP reluctance to let
an independent agency carry out public works implementation led to the cancellation of this operation.
XI.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED
21.    The principal lessons learned during project preparation and implementation are:
(a) project design should conform to the realities of the adjustment process in a country. This lesson is
best illustrated by the experience with the private sector component. It was assumed erroneously
that as privatization progressed there would be great demand for credit in the private sector,
particularly if the economy was growing. It was also assumed erroneously that financial sector
reform would take place rapidly. Most of the subprojects appraised by SIF required GOSTP
decision to divest and privatize public enterprises, and no privatization took place until the MSP
was virtually completed. Thus, the line of credit for the private sector was largely unused and the
resources originally allocated to it were substantially reduced;
(b) to the extent possible, counterpart contributions should be secured as part of the conditions for
Credit effectiveness;
(c) TA should only be carried out within a clear framework and an action plan that is appropriate and
realistic in the context of the country's development;
(d) social funds, such as SIF/INDES, should be set up with as much autonomy as possible, because
likely Government intervention can cause implementation delays;
(e) coordination with other donors is important for policy change.
(f) Multisector 1I Project, the follow-up operation approved in June 1992, drew substantially on the
MSP experience. The objectives of this Project, are similar to the MSP, although its focus is on
infrastructure rehabilitation. However, as for the MSP, the second project was also unable to deal
with the issues of counterpart funds, technical assistance and autonomy of social funds.

ANNEX A
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
Ministry of Finance and Planning
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MULTISECTOR I PROJECT
(Credit 2038-STP)
REVIEW OF PROJECTS/PROGRAMS
FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW
COMMENTS
In light of all the considerations set forth in the document presented by the World Bank
on implementation of the projects/programs included in the Multisector I Project, it can be
concluded that:
(a)   The Multisector I Project was executed in a fully satisfactory manner.
(b)   The SIF. a pioneer organization of its type in Sao Tome and Principe,
designed specifically for the execution of a multisectoral project, operating
without a developed system and lacking in relevant acquired experience up to that
time (1989), proved to be a suitably qualified, dependable, competent and
dynamic agency worthy of the confidence of the Government, the World Bank
and other development partners of Sao Tome and Principe.
It must nevertheless be stressed that:
1.    SIF's performance could have been even better if its Board of Administration had not
found itself so politicized; however, the fact that the meetings of the Board did not take place
with the appropriate diligence was, in our opinion, due to agend(a problems of its members,
especially the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, at grips with the implementation of a
Structural Adjustment Program against the background of the expectations generated by the
democratic system instituted in the country and not to lack of interest on the part of the
Government. The government of any country cannot fail to interest itself in a multisector
project, which is of course a development-oriented policy instrument. Improving the living
conditions of the people is a natural feature of any government. Sao Tome and Principe is no
exception.



ANNEX A
2.    Termination of SIF's first Executive Director took place at his own request, for the
reasons stated by him at the time and set forth in his notice of resignation. It is therefore not true
that he was removed from office, as the World Bank states.
3.   It has to be borne in mind that the delays in furnislhing the Government's counterpart
contribution toward the costs of financing the institution caused some bottlenecks in its
operations. That goes without saying. It should however be noted that it is not easy for the
Government to comply with these commitments promptly at a time when it is implementing a
strict budgetary restriction and containment policy, with severe cuts in public expenditures. On
the receipts side, public receipts have not been rising as is to be expected, owing to the weak
position with respect to collection. In these circumstances, and with the Government having to
deal with budgetary expenditures that have first claim because they involve the very collective
survival of the population, it is clearly impossible, practically speaking, applying the necessary
priority ranking, with resources scarce and needs all too great, to comply with all the
commitments precisely on schedule.
Note must nevertheless be taken of the great effort accomplished by the Government, in
the situation described above, in having delivered Db 127,949,970 (US$227,252.77) to SIF, as
shown in the following table:
GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO 1995
Year        Db             US$ equivalent
1989              0.00             0.00
1990       2,949,970.00       20,509.12
1991              0.00             0.00
1992      35,000,000.00       99,188.00
1993      30,000.000.00       65,926.55
1994      30,000,000.00       24,779.06
1995      30,000,000.00        16,850.04
TOTAL    127,949,970.00        227,252.77
4.    Many of the delays that occurred during Project implementation were due to slowness in
replying to requests sent to the World Bank.
In a wide variety of situations, files pile up in the "corridors" of the World Bank, awaiting
an answer and/or a statement of "no objection" for far in excess of wl a, is a reasonable and
acceptable time in an organization with the World Bank's structure. More serious than this, from



ANNEX A
time to time, especially in cases of task manager replacement, some files and important loose
documentation "are no longer recorded in the archives", with the result that the World Bank turns
and asks for documents that are already in its possession.
It was also noted that task managers tended to delegate powers to consultants excessively.
Such incidents do not enhance the prestige ol' a huge organization like the World Bank.
5.    From the start, the inclusion of economic projects in Multi I was the subject of
reservations on the part either of the Sao Tome Government or. let us be fair. of certain sectors of
the World Bank.
Since SIF is not a commercial bank, it was difficult to see how it could proceed to grant
direct loans, a task normally assigned to commercial institutions.
The underlying reasons for such inclusion stemmed from the fact that at that time the Sao
Tome banking system did not offer the minimum guarantees ol viability (the BNSTP and the
Caixa Popular were showing clear symptoms of impending collapse).
As is known, such projects were not executed in an optimum manner.
The budget allocation was hence fully utilized, because applicants were either ineligible
or, where they were selected, proved to be incapable of complving with the commitments they
had entered into; the result is that today we have some "bad bets." a situation that falls short of
dramatic only because SIF was able already at that time, on a case by case basis, to mobilize
guarantees, some additional and others atypical, without whichi we would today be in a "panic"
situation.
In that connection, on a number of occasions the World Bank urged SIF to review the
projects with a view to granting the entire budget allocation (forgetting that there was little to
review since the basic issue had to do with the loan applicants' lack of capacity and soundness).
If SIF had followed that World Bank recommiiendation to the leter, the situation could
today could actually be dramatic, especially in an institution that does not have the functions of a
commercial bank and hence lacks prefinancing and other resources inherent in enforcement of
collections, and this in a country where such proceedings call take years.
6.    The channel for poverty alleviation is the SDA, not SIF.
Strategy was poorly defined, SIF being assigned a program of activities that did not mesh
with the objectives that had been set. In our view, infrastructure construction, provision of
technical assistance, training, procuring and printing textbooks and procuring medications, etc.
do not properly speaking constitute a poverty alleviation program, above all in the absence of
measures to strengthen institutional capacity and rehabilitatc infrastructures that were in bad
condition and consequently impeding the economic recoverv process. 'l'lhe amount allocated to



ANNEX-A
economic projects, and the number of these actually financed, fell far short of what was needed
to accomplish this objective.
The World Bank's policy of dispersing its activities (SIF/DSA), in a situation in which
the latter has not so far attained the hoped-for objectives, has led many people to blame SIF for
failure to achieve what were not SIF objectives.
Conclusions to be drawn
- Clear definition of objectives
- Reduction of costs
- Evaluation of the SDA program and its relationship with the INDES program
In conclusion:
Multisector I and all subsequent and future multisector projects are shared-responsibility
projects.
For good or ill, for better or worse, the projects are the responsibility of STP and the
World Bank. STP, through SIF/INDES, administers them under World Bank supervision
and control; this produces a clear distribution of responsibilities and hence a single
purpose: to provide the people of Sao Tome and Principe with increasingly more
dignified living conditions

AIDE MEMOtRE
SAO TOME AND PRINCEPE
MULTISECTOR I AND II PROJECTS AND
PROPOSED PROJECT
Introduction
1.    A World Bank mission composed of Messrs. Leslie Pean and George Faillace
visited Sao Tome e Principe from January 23 to 29 (Mr. Faillace until February 7th)
for the purposes of supervising the two Multisector Projects, reviewing with the
relevant Government and the Institute for Economic and Social Development (INDES)
officials the draft Implementation Completion Report (ICR) document (for the
Multisector I Project and discussing with the Goverrnent and ENDES certain key
issues pertaining to a proposed new project.
2.    The mission met with the Minister of Finance and Planning (Dr. Joaquin Rafael
Branco)' his advisor (Dr. Agapito Mendes), the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
and Co-operation (Dr. Guillerrne Posser da Costa), Minister of Social Equipment and
Environment (Sr. Alcino Martinho de Barros Pinto). At his request, the mission met
with the President (Dr. Miguel Anjos Trovoada) Other persons met by the mission are
listed in Annex 1.
Multisector I Project
3.    The mission reviewed with INDES and a representative of the Ministry of
Finance and Planning the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The document
had been previously translated into Portuguese. The mission also discussed with the
Governments its contribution to the ICR (The Implementation of Project from the
Government's Point of View). A draft of this section has now been prepared and will
be sent to the Bank following its review by members of the Cabinct.
4. ' The mission reviewed the status of the credit account for the Multisector I
Project. AS of January 18, 1996, a total of only SDR3,787.72 remained undisbursed.
5.    Water Supply Qta. Sto. Antonio- This sub-project, which was originally io
be financed under Multisector I, is being financed by the EEC, as part of its city-wide
water supply project. The engineers (SAFEGE) have completed the final design and..
bid documents and implementation is expected to start during the second half of 1996.
'A daft copy of this Aide Memoir was given to the Minister on Februazy 2 for his rview and
discussed with him, Mr. Agapito and INDES on February .



Annex B

6.    Private Sector Sub-projects- Of the four private sub-projects financed, two
are operating successfully (although loan repayments have been in arrears) and two
(the smaller ones) have defaulted on the loans (see Annex 2) and legal action has been
taken; of the latter sub-projects RNDES has taken possession of the premises and/or of
the equipment. It is important that INDES proceed as soon as possible with the sale of
these repossessed assets to recuperate the loans.
Multisector II Project
7.    Since the dismissal of Mr. Helder Barros from the position of Executive
President of INDES in November, 1996, Mr Homero Salvaterra has been acting as
Executive President. The mnission reviewed the current management capacity of
INDES and approved the continuation of the appointment of Mr. Homero Salvaterra
as acting director of INDES until the future of TDES is clear. At that time, a mission
from the Bank will evaluate the situation and make reconmmendations on the next steps
to be taken for the nomination of a permanent director.
S.    Cash Flow and Reallocation of Funds- The mission gave its no-objection for
the preparation of a budget reallocation to cover administrative expenses for MDES
and to pay for consulting services for technical studies and for the completion of pilot
community development sub-projects. INDES prepared a cash flow projections
showing its budget needs for this calendar year (see Annex 3). It is expected that
*DES will need some capital inhfiLsion (and/or significant cost-cutting measures
taken) in order to bridge the time gap between the execution of Caisse Francaise de
Development (CFD) funded Principe sub-projects (expected to start by June) and the
new operation financed by IDA By best expectations, such operations will start
disbursing in early 1997.
9.    Operating cost of INDES are too high. The institution will bave to take
drastic measures to adjust its staff commensurate with its portfolio of works
executed. The Bank expects to receive proposl from the Govemment for cost-
reduction mesures to be taken by INDES no later than by April 15, 1996.
Among the possible cost-reduction measures that can be taken are: (a) extending the
acting director's term, thus reducing the salary cost of a new director; (b) eliminating
all statraining programs; (c) reducing non essential staff, commensurate with
INDES very much reduced work load for 1996, (d) further reductions' in the recently
approved new salary scale (Annex 4); (e) moving to less expensive office premises:
Some income will also be generated through faster recupemtion of private sector loans
and sale of assets (para. 18). Based on the cash-flow projections discussed in detail
with the mission (and shown is Annex 3), there is a financing gap of about S54,000 in
ENDES' operating costs which will need to be covered, through cost cutting and own
sources.
2 This can be done on the Wusis of specific staffing needs and not on the bads of indivi
concened
Only as a temporay cost-cutng measure.

10.   The rmission reviewed disbursement issues regarding Multisector II. The
mission informed INDES and the Government that the original letter with the signature
of the Acting President of INDES had not been received in Washington. However,
arrangements had been made with the disbursement and legal departments of the Bank
to accept the faxed copy of the signature, pending receipt of the original which has
been mailed again. At the same time a disbursement application for the replenishment
of the Special Account has been sent to the Bank, to permit the payment of long
overdue bills to contractors and consultants.
11.   INDES provided the mission with a request for a reallocation of the credit
categories. Given the time needed for such a reallocation to be processed in
Washington, the mission faxed the disbursement department to permit overdrawing on
category 4, Operating Costs, pending the time when reallocation of proceeds becomes
effective. INDES is forwarding to the Bank the request for reallocation which takes
into account the cash flow projections for 1996, as agreed with the mission.
12    Site Visits- The mission visited Riboque Lucumi, Boa Entrada, Guegue Power
Station, inauguration of the San Marcal pilot water supply sub-project, the secondary
roads sub-project, the sites for the proposed new market, endemic decease center and
all completed and pending sub-projects in Principe. Details of he mission's fnding are
described in Annex 5.
13.   Riboque/Lucumi. Details of the next steps to be carried out for the
implementation of the Riboque/Lucumi Urban Rehabiiitation Project are given in
Annex 6.
14. Road Maintenance Program. SENAE (Servicio Nacional de Estradas) in
MESA was created in 1994, for the purposes of setting up a road maintenance
mechanism, utilizing local labor force in the municipalities. SENAE is to be funded
through a 10 dobras per Liter tax on all fuel sold by ENCO. The mission leaned
that while the mechanism has now been set up (with "brigadas" covering 4 km in
the area where they Live, under contract with the municipality) the 10 dobra tax has
not generated the 120 milion dobras per year expected, because ENCO has
excluded framthis tax the fuel sold to EMAE, the power uflity, its largest
consume. Therefore, until this issue is resolved SENAE will only have limited
fiJnds-fuits- maintenance program.
15.   Guegue Minihydroelectric Power Plant. INDES has faxed the Bank
(16J01/96) a request for no objections for the supply of spare parts for the turbine.-The
mission informed INDES that it could not approve such a requesS since the sib-project
was completed over one year ago and the responsibility for its maintenance rest with
EMAE not INDES.                          -
16.   Community Development Departmnent (CDD)* The community development
department was set up to begin the implementation of three pilot sub-projects in
anticipation of the new project which would have an extensive communty



Annex B
development component4. As a result of the delay in the decision on the scope and size
of the new project (Annex 7), the planned activities of CDD were left without funding;
some are being completed with financing under the on-going Multisector II Project.
Unfortunately, this means that critical sub-projects such as the RiboqueJLucumi sub-
project which is ready for tendering will need to be trimmed back, because of the
limited funds under Multisector [1. In this connection the mission recommends that the
integrty of the CDD be maintained and that the three professional staff of the CDD be
redeployed to the RiboquelLucumi sub-project to work on the community awareness
and participation aspects of this sub-project throughout its implementation (Annex 6).
17.   Salary of INDES' staff. This very controversial issue (given the large
discrepancy between INDES salaries and those of Govemrnent employees), has been
apparently defused by the Ministry of Finance and Planning with the scaling down of
the approved salary increase which took place in 1995 (Annex 4).
18.   Administrative Issues. A number of administrative actions had been identified
by the external auditors and previous Bank supervision mission. Their status is as
follows:
(a) Al retained moneys for executed projects under Multi I and El have been
paid;
(b) INDES is proceeding with the auction of the obsolete computer
equipment, vehicles and furniture. A comnittee will be formed with
Mfinistry of Finance to value the assets and to set the base price for the
public auction;
(c) Accounting: (i) a new chart of accounts has been set up in agreement with
Central Bank, (ii) INDES will purchase a new accounting program, but
will continue with the existing semi-manual accounting system in paralle;
(d) Audit: 1NDES will close the 1995 accounts during February and will
proceed with the exteinal audit of its accounts, as required under the
Credit Agreements; it was agreed with the mission that IDES would send
the Bank TOR and a short list of international auditors for the Bank's no
objections. The external audit is expected to begin in March;
(e) INDES' annual report for 1995 is expected to be completed and sent to
the Bank in February; and,
. (_) The planned MIS has been suspended pending a resoludon of the
institutional issue connected with the new project; the selected supplier (a
Brazilian firm) has notified of this;
(g) The mission. informed INDES (again) of the requirement need to have
insurance cover for all of its assets. INDES informed the mission of the
difficuldes in obtaining such cover given that the only national insurace
company was in liquidation, and foreign ones charge very high premiums
for such coverage.
4 The dirability of including this component in the MulSeC=r m Pjet dWUcusued at ken
during proect preprAt  with the Prime Minister of that time (Dr. Carloo Gina), the Dqulty Pime
Ministr (Dr. Armindo d'Almeida& now Prime Minis), the Ministe of Finane (Dr. Carls
Quare) and MESA AU enthiasdcally supported hu itmve.

19.   Co-financing needs. In the light of the expected delays in the implementation
of the nect project, INDES would be well advised to seek financing sources from other
donors for some of the priority sub-project which are ready for tendering, including
the RiboqueJLucumi sub-project, emergency street repairs and drain rehabilitation in
Sao Tome and the remaining community development pilot sub-project in Principe..
20.   Donor's opinion of INDES and Mr. Barros' performance. The rnission held
individual meetings with the various donors who without exception expressed a
positive opinion of INDES ability to implement projects, and of Mr. Barros in
particular. They felt that his dismissal, which they felt was too abrupt, was based on
various factors (personal, political) and also through his excessive confidence on the
autonomy of the institution and lack of consultation with the Govenmment..
Proposed New Project
21.   Discussions with the Minister of Finance.The mission explored the
opportunity of continuing the preparation of Multisector m and in that respect
engaged discussions with Minister Branco. An agenda was prepared covering
institutional aspects, salary issues, board composition for the new institution, and the
hiring process of the Executing Director. After lengthy discussions on the first theme
(institutional issues), Minister Branco proposed that a draft of the main pointS
discussed be prepared for his review. A copy of that drift is attached as Amnex 7, wa&.
given to the Minister the next day. The Mnister gave its comments that were included
in the final draft. However, discussions on the preparation of the new project bad to be
interrupted as the mission was informed from Washington not to do so, pending the
completion of a development strategy for the country.
22.   PPF Request- The Government/INDES had requested a second PPF to cover
the completion of the on-going pilot projects and the completion of studies, capacity
building courses for small local contractors and engineering design and bid
documentation for various sub-projects to be implemented under the proposed new
project. Such request was cleared by the disbursement officer and the legal department
in the Bankl The mission will enquire on the status of this reqwest in Washington and
inform INDES-iz the light of the need to postpone further works on the project until
the,developmnt strategy is approved. However, the mission believes that the request
was oa agpived by the Department Director, mainly in view of the questions raised
about tbkproject by the Sao Tomean Delegation during the Annual Meeting in
Wasington. .
23.   Pibt Community Development Sub-projects and Other flitiatve. During
the preparation of the proposed new project, three pilot community development sub-
projects were identified in order to determine and test the best approach to this new
initiative by INDES. The three sub-projects covered water supplY in two communitis
in Sao Tome island and three communities in Principe. Unfotunateiy, as indicatod
above, the planned PPF which was intended to help finance the completion of the pilot
projects, completion of the traiing of commuity agents, and of local smaU
contractors and consultants were left high and dry without fiuding; some activities
such as two of the three pilot sub-projects (Annex 5) are being completed with

financing under the on-going Multisector II Project, which will affect the
implementation of the remaining activities planned under Multisector II.
