    mitigate the social and economic goals of structural\n            adjustment and economic decline. It hopes to generate income\n            and employment opportunities for low income, underemployed\n            and unemployed urban and rural households through education.\n            In order to carry out these objectives, a Social and\n            Infrastructure Fund (SIF) will be established. The project\n            will help provide the necessary financing for the SIF,\n            support subprojects in the startup phase and assure funding\n            of subsequent phases. Typical subprojects will be health,\n            education, water supply and markets. SIF will vigorously\n            encourage private initiative by providing investment capital\n            and facilitating entry conditions into profitable private\n            operations. All sponsoring agencies, including individual\n            borrowers in the private sector will receive technical\n            assistance from the SIF. Operations will be monitored\n            through action plans, periodic reports & qualitative\n            surveys in order to ensure that resources are reaching\n            target beneficiaries and achieving desired socio economic goals."}, "docdt": "1989-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
