development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the Bank should not expect too\n            much from consultations with stakeholders in a country\n            tightly controlled by the security apparatus. In the\n            interviews carried out for the preparation of the completion\n            report, most interlocutors complained that there had been\n            too little consultation in the development of the reform\n            program. In a society undermined by deep corruption and\n            cronyism, statements from the ruling elite should not be\n            taken at face value. In his electoral program for 2009-2014,\n            President Ben Ali made employment a national priority. He\n            promised reforms to address the unemployment and social\n            protection challenges. While he made his speeches, he was\n            strengthening the rent seeking system which was stifling\n            entrepreneurship and job creation. The previous regime,\n            which seemed to be well entrenched, was swept away in a\n            short period of time. Solid political economy analyses are\n            essential to better understand the constraints and\n            frustrations in a country where opportunities are scant\n            because of deeply embedded corruption."}, "docdt": "2012-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
