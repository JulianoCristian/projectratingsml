in\n            Tunisia, this first Development Policy Loan (DPL) will\n            improve active labor market programs, labor intermediation\n            and the information base for guiding employment policies.\n            The Government of Tunisia declared employment the number one\n            priority in its Eleventh National Development Plan (NDP-XI)\n            2007-2011. Achieving a lower unemployment rate will require\n            demand side interventions, including private sector\n            development, increased competitiveness, and innovation;\n            supply side interventions, including education and\n            vocational training systems; and effective labor market\n            intermediation to match demand and supply. This program\n            document (PD) summarizes the program agreed during the last\n            12 months during various missions, by the Bank, the European\n            Commission (EC), and representatives of the Government. The\n            identified policy matrix covers: (i) short-term measures\n            supported by this first DPL (DPL I), to be realized by May\n            2010, (ii) potential medium-term measures, to be realized in\n            a second DPL (DPL II) by mid 2011, and (iii) a shared vision\n            of achievements, to be realized by the end of this 5-year\n            program. It also contains performance indicators to be\n            achieved by May 2012 (one year after the end of DPL II)."}, "docdt": "2010-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
