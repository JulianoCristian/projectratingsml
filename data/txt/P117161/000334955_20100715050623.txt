                               More and better matching of migrants to jobs abroad
                               Regular transmission of data from public institutions to the
                                 National Statistical Office from public institutions
                               Increased international comparability of national statistical data.
                              
Program Development         Within the overall program objective of improving the effectiveness
Objective(s) and            and efficiency of job entry in Tunisia, this first Development Policy
Contribution to CPS         Loan (DPL) will improve active labor market programs, labor
                            intermediation and the information base for guiding employment
                            policies.

                            The DPL series mainly supports pillar I of the Country Partnership
                            Program (CPS) ­"Growth, Competitiveness and Employment" and,
                            to a lesser extent, pillar III "Quality of service delivery".
Risks and Risk Mitigation   There are four moderate to high risks covering the political, macro,
                            institutional and technical spheres and mitigation measures have


                                                i
               been set up to address each of these:

               1. On the political side, the Government of Tunisia may be
                  unwilling to undertake reforms that may be perceived as
                  challenging social cohesion. To limit this risk, while promoting
                  greater efficiency and equity, the consensus building process
                  should include wide participation from key stakeholders. The
                  actions supported by this DPL will serve as first steps in
                  building momentum for reform.
               2. In terms of macroeconomic risks, Tunisia is still experiencing
                  the aftermath of the crisis and changes in employment
                  opportunities will depend on the business cycle. The program
                  includes measures to mitigate the crisis' impact on employment
                  in the short and long term.
               3. Ensuring adequate institutional and technical capacity to support
                  the implementation of reforms and ensuring cooperation
                  between different ministries is a key challenge. Additionally,
                  ministerial personnel changes at high technical and political
                  levels can happen without prior notice and affect the ownership
                  of the DPL series. The Government of Tunisia is aware of this
                  and has augmented the teams for international cooperation and
                  statistics in the Ministry of Vocational Training and
                  Employment (MVTE), and has formed inter-ministerial
                  commissions with representatives from ministries as well as
                  other concerned parties.

                                     PROGRAM DOCUMENT
         FOR A PROPOSED EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                                TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA

I.   INTRODUCTION
1.      The Government of Tunisia declared employment the number one priority in its XIth National
Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2011. Achieving a lower unemployment rate will require demand
side interventions, including private sector development, increased competitiveness, and innovation;
supply side interventions, including education and vocational training systems; and effective labor
market intermediation to match demand and supply.
2.      The Government has requested World Bank support for this integrated approach to address
employment issues through the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (2010-2013) comprising a number
of operations. These include, on the labor demand side: (1) the Integration and Competitiveness
Development Policy Loan (DPL), Third Export Development Project, and Energy Efficiency Project;
on the labor supply side: the (2) Higher Education Quality and Skills Development Projects; and in
terms of matching demand and supply (3) this proposed Employment Development Policy Loan (DPL)
series (DPL I and DPL II).
3.      In particular, this proposed Employment DPL supports the efforts of the Government in
generating quality jobs by advancing the structural transformation of the economy and ensuring an
adequate institutional setting for efficient matching of labor demand and supply.
4.       The Government has invited the Bank and the European Commission (EC) to join forces to
support the above objectives on the basis of a shared vision over a five-year perspective. Financial
support would be granted first from the World Bank followed by the EC, including the following
coordinated instruments over the next five years: (a) reform financing through two-single tranche
DPLs in 2010 and 2011 (World Bank) and budget support from 2012 to 2014 (EC), which will support
a common set of reforms to improve the functioning of the labor market, especially young graduates'
school-to-work transition; (b) technical assistance from both the Bank and the EC, which will build the
capacity for employment intermediation and labor market analysis; and (c) Bank-facilitated trust funds
to pilot innovative forms of employment in social entrepreneurship. In addition, the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) supports the Government's preparation of several targeted studies
that inform actions in DPL II.
5.       This is the first time that the Government has requested external support in this area which is
largely a result of the trust that has been built gradually between the Government and the World Bank
with regards to employment issues since 2000. The proposed DPL follows the pattern of collaboration
between the Government and the Bank which has characterized joint work in other sectors: initially
cautious and specific steps that were critical in laying the foundation for reliable and sustained reforms
in priority policy areas such as competitiveness, infrastructure, and macroeconomic policy. The
national political economy in Tunisia requires a gradual, consensus-based approach involving all
stakeholders as an effective way to achieve sustainable and far-reaching reform.
6.      This Program Document (PD) summarizes the program agreed during the last 12 months
during various missions, by the Bank, the EC, and representatives of the Government. The identified
                                                    1
policy matrix covers: (i) short-term measures supported by this first proposed DPL (DPL I), to be
realized by May 2010, (ii) potential medium-term measures, to be realized in a second DPL (DPL II)
by mid 2011, and (iii) a shared vision of achievements, to be realized by the end of this 5-year program.
It also contains performance indicators to be achieved by May 2012 (one year after the end of DPL II).

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

7.      Tunisia's main challenges for the future are to ensure the generation of quality jobs, the supply
of an adequately skilled workforce, and a dynamic and efficient matching between jobs and workers.
Despite an excellent macroeconomic track record, the pace of job creation has not kept up with the
growth of the labor force and has been aggravated by the recent economic crisis. Furthermore, the gap
between the rising share of new labor market entrants holding university degrees and the number and
type of available jobs needs efficient labor market mediation.

A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN TUNISIA

Growth and Employment

8.      In the past decade Tunisia has shown consistent economic growth as a result of sound
economic policies and steady structural reforms. Tunisia experienced an average annual growth of 4.8
percent in GDP over the last eight years, placing the country among the leading performers in the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and in emerging economies, more generally, where
average growth rates in GDP were around 4.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Tunisia's growth
performance reflects the positive effects of macroeconomic stability coupled with a gradual but steady
opening to trade and foreign investment. This dynamic growth has been driven by increased exports
and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, and by large public investments and vigorous private
consumption (the largest component of real GDP). Overall, Tunisia's macro-economy is consistently
sound. The fiscal deficit is modest (-1.2 percent in 2008), public debt decreased from 59.7 percent
of GDP in 2004 to 47.1 percent in 2009, inflation is low (3.5 percent in June 2009), external debt has
dropped significantly in recent years (below 52 percent of GDP in 2008 from 71.4 percent in 2004) and
reserves are currently at healthy levels (approximately 5.5 months of imports in 2009).
9.      The economy grew by 3.1 percent in the third quarter of 2009 compared with the same period
in 2008, as a result of strong growth in agriculture and steady expansion in public and commercial
services which more than offset a contraction in the manufacturing industry induced by the crisis-
driven slump in exports (down by 22 percent in 2009) .

10.      The financial crisis has had a moderate effect on the financial sector, but a deeper and more
profound effect on the real economy. Macroeconomic stability was relatively unaffected in the initial
stages of the global financial crisis. This was due to a number of factors including: (i) the absence of a
"sub-prime" problem: real estate loans represent only 10 percent of GDP (compared with close to 90
percent in the US); (ii) little foreign exposure of local banks; (iii) relatively low (28 percent) foreign
participation in the stock market; (iv) limited public debt (48.2 percent in 2008) and prudent
macroeconomic management; and (v) non-convertibility of the dinar for most capital-account
transactions. The main channel of transmission of the crisis has been trade. Depressed external
demand (particularly from the EU, which is the destination of 76 percent of Tunisian exports) resulted
in a drop of over 25 percent in export value in the first seven months of 2009, showing a slight recovery
only towards the end of the year (total drop in export values was 18 percent). This eventually
translated into a reduction in manufacturing output. Overall the Index of Industrial Production dropped
almost 6 percent in 2009 alone and over 15 percent from 2007.

11.     The sharp decline in industrial production resulted in the loss of 38,000 manufacturing jobs
between 2008 and 2009 (second quarter). In addition, officials believe that a similar number of jobs
(30,000) were not created during the year as a result of the global crisis. The annual unemployment
rate, however, seems to have only slightly increased by a one-half of a percentage point to reach 14.7
percent of the active population in 2009, according to the latest official data. A more severe impact on
unemployment was not experienced largely as a result of labor market regulations which have made
firing difficult; and as a result of payroll tax relief provided to companies most likely to be facing
market pressures. It should be noted, however, that the official employment data do not take into
account employment and earnings adjustments in the informal sector or employment of individuals
with term-contracts that were not renewed. The latter is likely to affect mostly young workers not
completely established in the labor market, who in large part, hold term-contracts.
12.     The Government has taken several short term stimulus measures to support the real economy
in response to the slowdown. These have included steps to: (1) increase public investment by 20
percent with the 2009 Budget Law; (2) assist exporting firms through measures such as providing: (i)
subsidies towards the employer's cost of social security (50 percent for firms witnessing a dramatic fall
in exports to Europe; 100 percent for firms that have had to cease production and run down stocks); (ii)
a subsidy of 50 percent of the cost of export insurance; and by modifying existing and adopting new
                                                        4
procedures, including: (iii) an acceleration of procurement procedures for public contracts granted to
the local private sector; and (iv) selected reforms to enhance integration as well as improve the business
climate and strengthen the financial sector.
13.     After inflationary pressures in mid-2008, which ended with the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) reaching 5 percent, inflation eased to 3.7 percent in 2009 as a result of a decrease in the
price of basic products (food and oil) and an appropriate monetary policy. The CPI is expected
to increase in 2010 to 4.5 percent, due to external factors (larger imported inflation from higher
commodities prices but also inflationary pressures coming from a depreciation of the exchange
rate to raise competitiveness) and internal pressures (as the planned annual rises in public-sector
pay and the minimum wage--which will also drive up non-agricultural private-sector wages by
almost 4 percent a year). It will, however, remain contained as a result of appropriate monetary
policy. The Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) reduced the key inter-bank rate from 5.25 percent to
4.5 percent in February 2009 for the first time in 30 months to control excess liquidity and
introduced "new instruments" to ease credit flow and liquidity in the banking system1. The
authorities reaffirmed the objective of a freely floating exchange rate, which have since been
delayed by the global financial crisis. During 2009, the dinar (which is pegged to a basket of
currencies, of which the euro accounts for around two-thirds) depreciated by 1.9 percent against
the euro and remained almost stagnant against the US dollar.

14.      The pace of the transformation of Tunisia's production structure has been slow and not
adequate to move the economy up towards high value-added sectors. Domestic commercial services
(except for tourism) dominate the economy, representing almost 48 percent of GDP (and 38.8 percent
of total employment) in 2008. The manufacturing sector (19.7 percent), the largest exporting sector, is
quite diversified with textiles and clothing (4.7 percent of GDP), agro-industry (4.7 percent) and
mechanical and electrical engineering (4 percent of GDP) sectors being the most prominent.
Agriculture also remains important in size, accounting for a little less than one-tenth of GDP and 18.3
percent of total employment. The evolution of the domestic private investment rate, in contrast to
that of FDI, followed a declining trend in the most recent years from over 11 percent of GDP in
1
  These instruments include: i) an increase of the capital base of the bank for small and medium-sized enterprises (Banque de
financement des petites et moyennes enterprises) by TDN 30 million (US$24 million); and (ii) a reduction in the reserve
requirements for all banks from January 2009.

2003 to 8.9 percent in 2008. Further, employment-output elasticities have gone up since 1995
(excluding the agricultural sector), reflecting lower labor productivity and a growth in lower value-
added jobs.2 A longer term challenge will be to change the structure of the economy and this is
currently being addressed by the Integration and Competitiveness DPL that was approved by the
Bank in FY09 in support of Tunisia's trade, business climate and financial sector reforms
program
15.     In spite of solid growth, unemployment remains a persistent problem. Tunisia has a
relatively high unemployment rate at 14.7 percent (compared to 6.4 percent for all middle
income countries, 2008). The overall rate masks a striking divergence by age, with younger
groups of the labor force being more affected (see Figure 3). Unemployment increasingly affects
the better educated, although low- and medium-skilled workers still make up the bulk of the
unemployed. As Figure 3 shows, the unemployment rate of higher education graduates, which
was below 5 percent in 1994, has increased significantly to 23 percent in 2009. However, among
the stock of the unemployed, 40 percent have completed secondary education, 35 percent have
completed primary while only 20 percent have a university degree.

16.     In the near future, unemployment numbers will likely worsen, especially for university
graduates, because of still growing labor supply, insufficient demand, and a poorly functioning
labor market leading to long unemployment spells, on average. With the labor force projected to
grow at an annual rate of above 2 percent until 2012, between 70,000 and 80,000 new jobs
would be needed each year only to absorb the new entrants (i.e., without taking into account the
current stock of the unemployed).4 Furthermore, a large and growing share of new labor market
entrants will hold university degrees (from 60,900 in school year 2006-2007 to 79,900 in school

17.     In addition, the education system does not respond to the needs of the labor market,
leading to simultaneous over-supply of graduates and shortages of vocational technicians.
University graduates who do work often find themselves over-qualified or in jobs that do not
match their acquired skills. Approximately 28 percent of graduates are not working in jobs using
their levels of education three and a half years after graduation, while 15 percent are matched to
a job outside their area of training.5 Reform of the education system is being supported by the
World Bank through the Education, Higher Education and Skills Development projects.
18.     Movement in- and out of jobs is low and unemployment spells are long. Between 2002
and 2008, the number of layoffs reached only 0.3 percent of total employment, while the
comparable figure for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries is 10 percent (OECD 1996). The average duration of search for the first job or
between two jobs is long. One-half of the workforce report having searched between 10 and 24
months (Labor Force Survey, 2007).6 It is not surprising that in this context, newcomers, such as
the young and women (women's unemployment rate is close to 18 percent vs. 13 percent for men),
face a more difficult labor market situation. In addition to higher unemployment rates, women are
considerably less active in the labor market than men. In 2008, the labor force participation rate
among women aged 15 to 64 was 28 percent, compared to 74 percent among men (ILO, 2009).
19.    Informal employment and fixed term contracts are increasingly more widespread than
open-ended contracts (see Figure 4). Fifty-four percent of those in the workforce do not have a
contract, and over 40 percent of graduates in their first job have a fixed term contract only.

20.     These labor market dynamics are most likely attributable to rigidities and transaction
costs of formal employment required by the Labor Code. Flexibility in formal employment is
very limited. Tunisia scores the highest in the region on the difficulty of firing index, which
relates to the notification and approval requirements for termination of a redundant worker and
existing obligations to reassign or retrain redundant employees. For instance, an employer
typically needs to request authorization from and notify the regional board or central commission
for dismissal control prior to laying off any open-ended worker for economic reasons. Further,
temporary assignments, labor leasing and the use of temping agencies are forbidden. The Labor
Code also requires sector-wide collective agreements between employers and employees to
determine further details of contractual (hiring and layoff) procedures, as well as salary scales
according to professional category.

21.     In addition, the Labor Code stipulates that centralized wage-setting determines the
default private sector wage scales. Currently, in each sector, centralized employer and employee
representatives agree to a pay-scale with wage ranges for different professional levels.
Countrywide, the overarching collective agreement `Convention Collective Cadre' between the
UTICA7 (employer representation) and the UGTT8 (general trade union) determines the default
framework. Individual companies can deviate from the Convention if needed, within a regulated
negotiations protocol9, but only in agreement with their worker representatives. According to the
Labor Inspection, the application of the Convention is enforced.

22.     Centralized wage setting can lock in an exogenous rise in unemployment. This might
occur, for example, as a result of an oil-price or demographic shock. More specifically, this will
occur when on the employee side, wages are monopolistically negotiated by unions whose
members are all employed. The unemployed, who would profit from a wage reduction against
an increase in jobs, do not typically have a voice in this process. As a consequence, the
negotiations rarely result in stagnating or lower wages, even if this would reduce the

unemployment rate.10 This situation is not unique to Tunisia. However, the results of this
process can be particularly severe if the unemployed are largely first time job-market entrants as
is the case in Tunisia.
23.     At the same time, only permanent workers laid off for economic reasons are entitled to
unemployment assistance. This leaves many unprotected and reinforces the dual nature of the
labor market. The unemployment assistance program in Tunisia is currently financed by the
Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS) and administered by the CNSS, the Ministry of
Social Affairs, Solidarity and Tunisians Abroad (MSASTA) and the Ministry of Vocational
Training and Employment (MVTE). The potential benefit duration is 12 months, and the level of
the benefit is equal to the minimum wage (salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti, SMIG).
The benefit is only available to workers who have been laid off for economic or technological
reasons and who have three or more years' tenure with the former employer.11 Other laid-off
workers, regardless of whether they have open-ended or fixed-term contracts or are in the
informal sector, are not eligible for unemployment assistance12 (but they may be covered through
Active Labor Market Policies, ALMPs). As a result, the program currently provides benefits to
only a small number of eligible participants. In 2008, 1,441 individuals received benefits,
equivalent to only 28 percent of those who had lost an open-ended contract job during that year.
And according to the latest figures (2007), only 5.4 percent of all dismissed workers had been
laid off for economic or technological reasons, i.e., were eligible at all.13
24.     In sum, the Tunisian labor market displays high and persistent unemployment, limited
mobility and income protection for vulnerable workers, and a dual structure. In this context,
informal and term employment (i.e. jobs not covered by open-ended contracts and/or social
security and often without long term career prospects) has increasingly provided a needed
flexibility valve for the private sector, affecting disproportionately women and youth.14
25.    Finally, there remains ample room to capitalize on the positive externalities of
international migration. According to government sources, approximately 9 percent of
Tunisia's population lives abroad. Of those, 85 percent live in European countries,
predominantly in France.15 Emigration rates are particularly high among Tunisians who are
young and male. Approximately 23 percent of new entrants to the labor force emigrate.16
Migration can ease pressure on the labor market in the short term and provide benefits to Tunisia

   Dismissed workers and their family members are guaranteed the continuation of the right of health care and family allowances
for one year from the date of termination. If the dismissed worker has not resumed gainful employment after the expiration of
these benefits, needy families can receive free medical assistance and low income families have access to medical assistance at a
reduced rate.

workers do not meet the conditions required.

   International research suggests that the case of Tunisia is not unique, as countries with less developed social systems to protect
individuals against unemployment risks are more likely to also have protective employment regulations, See Heckman, J., Pages,

international employment intermediation, resulting in potentially fraudulent practices, the non-
equivalency of diplomas leading to migrants struggling to signal their skills abroad, and the lack
of data hamper the optimization of migration benefits.

Fiscal and Current Accounts

26.     After a marked improvement in the country's fiscal position in 2008 (with a deficit of 1.2
percent of GDP), fiscal deficit rose to 3.3 percent in 2009. This level of deficit can be considered
contained, considering the boost in expenditures the Government authorized an increase in
investment and stimulation of consumption in the supplementary Finance Law approved in July
2009. Public investment increased by 20.5 percent during the year and the measures introduced
in January 2009 to support exporting firms hurt by declining exports were maintained for the
entire year. The public debt ratio declined from 50 percent in 2007 to 47.5 percent in 2008. It
continued to decrease despite the stimulus measures17 amounting to 47.1 percent of GDP in
2009, well below the 49.4 percent level budgeted in the complementary Budget of July 2009, as
a result of increased fiscal revenues and decreased cost of subsidies.

27.    The current account deficit widened considerably to -4.2 percent in 2008, due to a sharp
decline in the volume of exports (1.1 percent against 14.1 percent in 2007). The slowdown in
export growth was generalized, with textiles, mechanical and electrical goods, agricultural
products, and energy and phosphates, all either declining in value or showing significantly
slower export growth. Imports also slowed slightly from 12.1 percent in 2007 to 6 percent in
2008 primarily as a result of much cheaper oil, but slowing domestic demand meant that key

   The Government has taken several short term stimulus measures to support the real economy in response to the slowdown. These have
included steps to: (1) increase public investment by 20 percent with the 2009 Budget Law; (2) assist exporting firms through measures such
as providing: (i) subsidies towards the employer's cost of social security (50 percent for firms witnessing a dramatic fall in exports to
Europe; 100 percent for firms that have had to cease production and run down stocks); (ii) a subsidy of 50 percent of the cost of export
insurance; and by modifying existing and adopting new procedures, including: (iii) an acceleration of procurement procedures for public
contracts granted to the local private sector; and (iv) selected reforms to enhance integration as well as improve the business climate and
strengthen the financial sector.

imported consumption items also decreased. In 2009, the deficit was reduced to -2.9 percent, as a
result of a decreased trade deficit, increased tourism receipts (+2.1 percent) and workers'
remittances (8 percent) which balanced the trade deficit on the services side. The improved trade
balance was due to a fall in the import bill of US$3.3 billion (15 percent) that more than offset
the fall of US$3.1 billion (17.6 percent) in export earnings. The capital account registered a
surplus of US$2.7 billion surplus, which was primarily the result of a 43 percent increase to
US$2.6 billion in public and private overseas borrowing that outweighed a 32 percent fall to
US$1.7 billion in foreign direct and portfolio investment. Overall, the external account
registered a surplus of US$1.6 billion in 2009, slightly higher than the surplus for 2008. Tunisia
remains in a solid external position, with comfortable reserves level of US$ 9.8 billion
(approximately 5.5 months of imports, 2009).

Financing of the Economy

28.     The Tunisian financial sector has only been moderately affected by the international
crisis. The Government has continued their long-term strategy of reinforcing the banking sector,
which has led to a decline in the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans from 17.6 percent in
2007 to 15.5 percent in 2008 and an increase in the provisioning ratio from 53.2 percent in 2007
to 56.8 percent in 2008. The authorities intend to continue this effort even after they reach their
targets of 15 percent and 70 percent, respectively, in 2009. Tunisia's sovereign spreads
(Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) Global spreads) have increased to more than 600 basis
points as of December 1, 2008, (with a 12-month high of 656 which is also an all-time high for
Tunisia), reflecting a higher country risk resulting from the volatile global financial environment.
Still, Tunisia's sovereign spreads remain below the MENA regional average (close to 900 basis
points). The main international rating agencies (S&P, Fitch, R&I) reaffirmed the rating for
Tunisia in 2009 and 2010, keeping it stable with respect to the past year, reflecting confidence in
the ability of the country to maintain steady economic and fiscal management which will contain
the worst effects of the financial crisis.


                                                              12
29.      To address financing needs without crowding out the private sector in the domestic
market and without having to issue new bonds in the international market, the Government
decided to reduce domestic financing and increase external borrowing from official sources. In
the first half of 2009, Tunisia raised US$600 million from official sources for an Integration and
Competitiveness DPL (including US$250 million from the World Bank). The proposed
Employment DPL series, with a first loan of US$50 million, also contributes to this objective.

B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

30.     Real GDP growth is expected to rise to 4 percent in 2010 and increase to 5 percent from
2011. With the economy of the EU, Tunisia's main trading partner, expected to start its recovery
(+1 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent in 2011, source World Economic Outlook 2010), Tunisia's
growth will also pick up in 2010. Agriculture and energy are expected to contribute positively to
growth, as are most services sectors (notably trade and telecommunications). Manufacturing
industries (which account for 19 percent of GDP) should start their, albeit slow, recovery in
2010. Accelerated and expanded public investment will also contribute to an increase in the
pace of growth in 2010. Internal demand, especially private consumption and public investment,
will act as the main driver of growth, supported by the Government's stimulus plan. However,
the effect of the Government stimulus plan on the economy will be constrained by the erosion of
fiscal space.
31.     Inflation (CPI) will most likely rise to 4.5 percent in 2010 due to both external factors
(larger imported inflation from higher commodities prices but also inflationary pressures coming
from a depreciation of the exchange rate to raise competitiveness) and internal pressures (as the
planned annual rises in public-sector pay and the minimum wage - which will also drive up non-
agricultural private-sector wages by almost 4 percent a year). Inflation, however, will remain at
reasonable levels, thanks to efficient monetary policy and targeted interventions to reduce excess
liquidity and keep inflation under control. Further, the inflation rate will begin to recede in 2011
as external conditions start to stabilize.
32.     Tunisia's external position will remain positive and stable in 2010. The current account
will remain around -2.9 percent of GDP. The trade balance will not change considerably, as
export earnings will increase more than the import bills, which will be affected by the increase in
commodities prices. The service surplus will widen modestly thanks to tourism receipts and
remittances from abroad as the world economy recovers. FDI will most likely recover with a
return to the availability of funds. Overall, Tunisia will remain in a solid external position, with
a comfortable level of reserves (around 5 months of imports).
33.     The Government intends to continue pro-active public debt management through: (i)
early repayment of high-interest debts; (ii) active management of the risk related to the interest
rate (in 2008, only 8 percent of external debt had a variable rate); and (iii) active management of
exchange and refinancing risks (in part through issuance of long maturity bonds in local
currency). Keeping debt increases below the rate of growth of the economy will help reduce
debt-to-GDP ratios, freeing foreign exchange reserves and allowing the maintenance of reserves
at a comfortable level through 2011.
34.   In summary, Tunisia's macro policy framework can be considered adequate for the
purposes of this Development Policy Loan (DPL I).

35.     In the medium-term, Tunisia will remain vulnerable to shocks in growth and employment
partly as a result of the country's strong trade ties with the EU. Its growth cycle is strongly
correlated with that of the EU18, even if not one-to-one. For example, a 1 percent reduction in
the EU growth leads on average to a 0.66 percentage point reduction in Tunisia's growth, all else
being equal.19 As Europe approaches a period of fiscal austerity, following the critical debt
position of some of its members, and the fading of the fiscal stimulus, the growth prospects for
2010 could change and deteriorate during the year. Some analysts believe that there is a risk of a
W shape of recovery for both the US and Europe which would mean a delayed recovery also in
developing countries with close trade relations.
36.     Fiscal consolidation must therefore continue to secure the fiscal space to respond to
shocks on the economy and the budget. The fiscal deficit will remain around 3.5 percent in 2010
as increased expenditures will be attenuated by a planned and announced phase out of the
subsidies (particularly on energy) and balanced by increased revenues in particular from
taxation. Public debt will continue therefore to decline, with a target of 40 percent by 2012.
37.      Policies supported by the DPL series would contribute to preserving macroeconomic and
fiscal stability and help mitigate current shocks.
       In the short term, some of the policies supported by this DPL series focus on facilitating
       job creation in areas of market failure, improving the portfolio of Active Labor Market
       Policies (ALMP), and tapping managed migration as a safety valve for skilled
       unemployment. The proposed short term policies would also help to create fiscal space
       through more efficient ALMP management. At the same time, better data production,
       management and accessibility would help sharpen accountability tools for employment
       policy.
       These short-term policies lay the groundwork for longer term reform on strategic issues
       with far-reaching impact, some of which will require extensive public consultation.
       Gradually increasing labor market flexibility and enhancing income security will
       contribute to a more dynamic labor market and to employment growth in the longer term.
       Specific measures include changes to the Labor Code and the design of a comprehensive
       unemployment safety net with the objective of enhancing and accelerating labor mobility.
       Improved labor mobility would be productivity enhancing by allowing an easier
       reallocation of the workforce to areas of higher productivity.
       Introducing these far-reaching policies in the short term, in a crisis context, would not be
       productive. Therefore, the proposed policy matrix takes into account the adequate
       phasing of such policies, and includes their strategic preparation and the needed inter-
       ministerial consensus-building and social partners' consultations as actions in their own
       right.

     The measures supported by the proposed DPL I are highly complementary to the
     Government's short-term crisis response. The Government's actions aim mainly at
     stabilizing employment through subsidies, especially in the crisis-affected export sector.
     This DPL prepares the groundwork for phasing out the Government's temporary actions,
     by: (i) modernizing the portfolio and the administration of ALMP: the people eventually
     laid off during the crisis would find better employment services, at the central and at the
     local level; (ii) mobilizing new job creation: expanding self-employment and innovative
     public-private partnerships to provide under-supplied services nationally, and managed
     migration internationally; and by (iii) preparing the first steps to modernize and expand
     Tunisia's safety net for the unemployed, so that a basic revenue can be protected during
     unemployment spells. In addition, the proposed DPL (iv) paves the way for a review of
     the Labor Code towards an easier adjustment of firms' workforce. This may rekindle
     some dynamism lost during short term crisis-response measures which aimed at
     stabilizing employment.

III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

38.     The Government recognizes that addressing the employment challenge is critical and
agrees that the way forward is to accelerate the structural transformation of the economy in
order to increase productivity and generate a sufficient number of skilled jobs. The Government
will therefore seek to: (i) stimulate labor demand through private sector led investment in high-
value added and innovative enterprises; (ii) increase the availability of skills through a lifelong
education and training system; and (iii) improve matching between demand and supply in the
labor market. The Government's key strategic documents (summarized in Box 1) show that the
Government and its social partners have chosen an integrated perspective of employment,
recognizing interdependencies and complementarities of three main pillars of policies reflecting
the issues above: (i) labor demand, (ii) labor supply, and (iii) a well-functioning labor market
both nationally and internationally (migration), notably through a modern legal framework
encouraging hiring, active labor market policies, and a social safety net that protects workers'
income between jobs. Across the three themes, the Government's strategy also calls for better
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of policies and key labor market trends, as well as better
dissemination of this information to concerned actors.
39.     The Government explicitly chose separate though conceptually integrated Bank
instruments for the different sectors featuring in its pro-employment policy. The initiatives that
will be supported by this DPL as well as those that will be supported by other Bank instruments,
include on the demand for labor: The Second Integration and Competitiveness DPL, and on the
supply of skills: a proposed DPL (FY2010) for vocational education, an investment loan for
basic education (Project for Quality Improvement of the Education System (PAQSET II))
(FY2011), and an investment loan for higher education (Higher Education Support Project
(PARES)) (FY2012). Each of these is described in Section C below.




                                                16
                                   Box 1: Recent Strategic and Planning Documents
1.      The XIth National Development Plan (2007-2011) (NDP) is the major strategic document of the
        Government of Tunisia. The key priority of the XIth NDP is employment, in the form of an increased
        number and better quality of jobs. The NDP assembles all macroeconomic and sectoral policy
        strategies for the period 2007-2011, and is articulated around five axes: (i) international integration
        and acceleration of growth and employment; (ii) sustainable development including social,
        generational and regional equilibrium; (iii) structural transformation towards a knowledge economy;
        (iv) investment in human resources; and (v) implementation of sectoral policies that support the
        modernization of the economy towards a higher share of value-added activities.
2.      The report of the National Consultation on Employment (2008) (NCE) summarizes the results of
        the consultation conducted by an integrated central committee with the key stakeholders, including
        universities, experts, employers of diverse sectors, representatives of the social partners (employers
        and trade unions), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), political parties and the civil service. The
        recommendations of the report focus on the three key themes listed above.
3.      Presidential Program (2009-2014). The electoral program of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,
        which covers: (i) enhancing social protection, especially assistance for vulnerable groups at risk of
        poverty, and a pension reform; (ii) making employment a national priority, and exploring the
        expansion of under-provided public services as a means of job creation; (iii) fostering innovation,
        competitiveness and structural adjustment for higher productivity; and (iv) enhancing quality in higher
        education, also through greater autonomy for universities.


A. DEMAND FOR LABOR FROM ENTERPRISES AND INNOVATION

40.    Previous and on-going analyses (see Table 5 on page 30) have highlighted the need for
the Tunisian economy to identify new sources of growth, create more and higher value-added
employment and to absorb the higher number of university graduates in the context of sharper
national and international competition.20 Accelerating the transformation of the Tunisian
economy towards higher productivity and creation of qualified jobs encompasses: (i) policies
for innovation, science and technology, and (ii) incentives for entrepreneurs and investors to
innovate, invest and create higher value added.

Policies for Innovation, Science and Technology

41.     For more than two decades, the Government has actively supported the development of
key elements of the national innovation system (NIS), including scientific research, technology
diffusion, education and industrial upgrading ("mise-à-niveau"). Notable progress towards key
input indicators, such as the share of public investment in research and development (R&D), the
share of researchers per capita, and qualifications of the workforce, demonstrate Tunisia's
commitment to technological progress. In addition, a coordinated infrastructure of agencies and
programs has been established to support innovation and research.




20
     See objectives of the XIth plan and links to the knowledge economy, and high value-added sectors, notably in services.

                                                                 17
42.     Despite these achievements, the research sector contributes little to the creation of a
strong technology basis and has limited partnership with the industry.21 The Government has
embarked on an evaluation of the Tunisian innovation system, to understand reasons for the
negligible amount of private sector R&D activities and for low take-up of public resources
allocated to research and innovation.22

Incentives for Entrepreneurs and Investors to Innovate, Invest and Create Higher Value
Added

43.     The Government acknowledges the need to improve the business climate for onshore
enterprises and to augment the rate of private investment to reach the average of emerging
markets similar to Tunisia23 and has thus embarked on undertaking a series of relevant reforms,
including: (i) a prudent macro policy, resulting in macro-economic stability; (ii) continuous
reduction in tariffs to increase trade openness; (iii) gradual liberalization of utility and service
sectors; (iv) easing of some business procedures, including for start-ups, tax payments, land
acquisition; and a (v) gradual alignment of the legal frameworks for the onshore and offshore
sectors
44.     The Government recognizes that investments in physical capital and innovation need
additional reforms and a report of the National Consultation on Employment (NCE) (see Box 1)
has emphasized deregulating certain professional services, integrating the onshore and offshore
sectors, and accelerating the opening up of key infrastructure sectors as important means to
foster the creation of higher value-added jobs.

B. SUPPLY OF LABOR AND SKILLS THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM

45.     A well-functioning labor market hinges on an adequate supply of skills. To improve
responsiveness of the education system to the demands of the labor market, the Ministry of
Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Technology (Ministère
de l'Enseignement Supérieur, et de la Recherche, MHESR) are taking important steps to develop
an integrated strategy around basic and higher education, as well as vocational training.
46.     A key pillar of this integrated strategy is the orientation of education contents around
competencies. In basic education, following a pilot phase from 1995-2001, a competency-based
curriculum was introduced in all primary schools in 2005-2006. (`Ecole de Demain'). In higher
education, the new Higher Education law includes basic principles24 that reflect the current
strategy of the Government and that the Bank supports through PARES II. In vocational
education, a reform project to strengthen lifelong learning and employment (Mise à niveau de la
formation et de l'emploi, MANFORME), was financed by the Bank and the EC (among others)
21
    Project ESTIME of the European Union, 2007. The project aims at the description of the scientific and technological
capabilities in 8 research partners countries of the Mediterranean by providing precise indications on research, technological
development, and innovation.
22
   Ibid.
23
   Phases of strong growth and productive transformation of emerging economies show usually a private investment share of 25
percent of GDP, compared to about 15 percent in Tunisia.
24
    Those principles include: (i) increase universities' managerial autonomy; (ii) improve the quality and relevance of study
programs for the labor market, fostered by a competitive allocation of funds; (iii) introduce a quality assurance system; and (iv)
develop a durable financial strategy, which would introduce cost-sharing mechanisms and ensure grants and credits for poorer
students.

                                                               18
and implemented in 1997 in order to satisfy the demand of enterprises for more and higher order
competencies.25      The Government is currently developing the second generation of
MANFORME, which will require: (i) generalizing a quality assurance system for training
centers; (ii) strengthening training in firms; (iii) encouraging an entrepreneurial culture in the
training centers; and (iv) implementing new financing instruments.

C. POLICIES TO FACILITATE THE MATCHING OF LABOR DEMAND AND
SUPPLY IN THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LABOR MARKETS

47.     The proposed Employment DPL series (DPL I and DPL II) will support the development
and adoption of policies to facilitate the matching of labor demand and supply in national and
international labor markets. Policies which will be the focus of this DPL (DPL I) articulate
around three main axes:
     (i) Labor market policies, which include ALMPs, as well as public employment services;
     (ii) Policies that facilitate labor force mobility, domestically and internationally, which
          includes labor legislation that will allow employers to adjust to the economic
          environment, a social safety net that ensures consumption smoothing during periods of
          unemployment, and facilitation of domestic and international labor mobility through legal
          and institutional interventions; and
     (iii) Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of employment policies' for evidence-based policy
           making, which includes the coordination and harmonization of employment data
           production in Tunisia according to international best practice, as well as increased data
           sharing among public bodies.

Labor Market Policies

48.     The Government's objective in reforming the ALMPs is to facilitate successful labor
market insertion, in a cost-efficient manner. The Government is monitoring the labor market
situation (described in Section II) and addressing these challenges at the forefront of policy
making efforts. During 2008, the NCE was held with key stakeholders (government,
universities, private sector, trade unions and some NGOs) which resulted in a series of
recommendations going forward, which are summarized in the NCE's final report (see Box 1)
which forms part of the Government's employment strategy.
49.    ALMPs have always been a priority within Tunisian labor market policy. Tunisia spends
approximately 0.7 percent of its GDP on ALMPs, close to the OECD average of 0.9 percent, and
well above comparable Eastern European countries.26 Until 2009, the National Agency for
Employment and Independent Work, ANETI (Agence Nationale de l'Emploi et du Travail
Indépendant) managed over 20 programs, to which access was virtually unconditional for all
categories of unemployed and employers, with little to no targeting of beneficiaries or


25
   The program identifies three pillars, (i) development of dual programs, actively involving the enterprises, (ii) implementation
of a decentralized management model, and (iii) the adoption of a competency-based curriculum.

market policies", Swedish Economic Policy Review 8

employers. From the Bank's analytical MILES27 work28 (see Section V) it emerged that the lack
of targeting and conditions was likely to entail substitution effects and deadweight losses29, and,
as a result, inefficient spending.30 This view was shared during the NCE.
50.      In response to the public debate, and informed by the World Bank's analytical work, the
Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment (MVTE) undertook a reform of the portfolio of
ALMPs beginning of 2009. The reform bundled the then 20+ ALMPs into six generic programs,
facilitating their management and financial control. All ALMPs contain a small monthly
income-assistance, and have stricter eligibility rules for both job-seekers and employers. This
action is supported by the proposed DPL (DPL I). (For details see the description of Prior
Action 2 in Section V.)
51.     ANETI manages the ALMPs. ANETI provides traditional public employment
intermediation without case management. The agency focuses on two goals: (i) bridging the
information asymmetry between employers and hard-to-employ job-seekers, and trying to match
them: and (ii) supporting new business start-ups, as self-employment, which has become a
priority for the Government.
52.     ANETI's present internal capacity is not prepared to face the growing employment
challenge. According to a process evaluation31 commissioned by the World Bank, each one of
ANETI's 91 employment offices faces an overwhelming workload, which has led them to use
their entire counselor staff on a polyvalent basis, to use all resources to the maximum. The
evaluation estimates that, on average, each counselor deals with 700 active job-seekers per year.
(Compared to, for example, an average of 75 job-seekers per counselor in Germany and 150 in
the UK, respectively).
53.    These circumstances do not facilitate personalized case management on a large scale.
Instead, the process job-seekers go through is very standardized and follows average criteria and
quantitative rather than qualitative objectives. `Qualitative management' as it applies to
employment services, i.e. individual evaluation of competences, profiling of job-seekers, and
counseling by specialists is virtually absent in ANETI. 32
54.     ANETI is well known among unemployed higher graduates, but not among other jobless
groups. According to the graduate tracer survey 2007 (of class 2004), 92 percent of graduates are
registered at ANETI. But according to the LFS (Labor Force Survey, 2007), only 21 percent of
the total unemployed are registered. This may be, in part, attributable to the fact that ANETI
enjoys visibility as a result of its presence in bigger towns (where its offices are located) and not
in the countryside, particularly in the Southern and Western areas of the country.

55.     Higher graduates, however, are more difficult to place than those individuals with less
than a university education. The university graduate tracer surveys (2005 and 2007) and a
Vocational and Educational Training (VET) graduate tracer survey (2005) suggest that
vocational graduates find work more easily and more quickly than university graduates.33
Similarly, ANETI's management reports that those job-seekers for which the agency has records,
and who have less than a university education are easily placed once they acquire a vocational
degree.
56.     In January 2009, the Government in cooperation with the World Bank held a
consultation workshop on potential Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs) reform measures and
other labor market policies. The MVTE led the workshop with participation of the Ministries of
Development and International Cooperation, Social Affairs, Solidarity and Tunisians Abroad
(MSASTA), Finance (MOF), Higher Education, Science, and Research (MHESR), Education
(MOE), representatives of the universities, employers (UTICA) and the national trade union
(UGTT). The workshop discussed international experience to date with regards to various policy
measures, including the introduction of new ALMPs to create jobs in under-supplied public
services (e.g. childcare); reforming the working processes of employment services;
intermediation in private employment; and other related labor market policies.
57.     In the context of the challenges described above, and the consensus achieved among
various stakeholders, the Government has identified three avenues of reform to address the
situation:
         Launch of ALMPs that allow for the creation of new jobs. For example, the XIth Plan
         calls for an improvement and expansion of the ALMP for self-employment.
         A reorganization of the ALMP management, both centrally and regionally. This would
         include a re-structuring of the ALMP portfolio and a reorganization of ANETI's work
         processes, with a greater emphasis on the personalized management of priority customers
         (both beneficiaries and firms) and outsourcing of non-core services, as well as increased
         regional implementation.
58.    The detailed actions which will be taken to achieve each of these in the context of the
proposed DPL I, are described in Section V.

Policies that Facilitate the Mobility of the Labor Force, Domestically and Internationally

59.     The Government's objectives in this domain are to develop policies that facilitate labor
force mobility, which will entail the development of legislation that allows firms to adjust their
factor inputs in times of shock, establishes a social safety net that will ensure consumption
smoothing for workers during spells of unemployment, and legislation that facilitates legal
migration to benefit the country's economy.
60.     The Labor Code was instituted in 1966 and last revised in 1995. While a cornerstone of
the employment pact, some of its provisions may yield adverse effects on overall productivity as
protecting jobs instead of incomes can reduce labor mobility and affect productivity and
employment. Empirical studies show that: (i) excessive job protection reduces entry to and exit

     MILES II: Labor Demand, Skills Supply and Employment (Policy Note, FY2009/10)

                                                           21
from employment and leads to longer unemployment spells; and that (ii) greater labor mobility is
associated with a structural transition of the economy towards more productive activities. A
more mobile labor force allows for reallocation of economic resources from less productive
sectors to more productive ones and, thus, increases total factor productivity. Several countries
in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regions have
revised their social policies in this respect, moving from protecting jobs to protecting workers'
income. The Government and its partners acknowledge the constraints related to the Tunisian
labor code. The NCE noted the bias of the Labor Code towards protecting existing jobs rather
than promoting new employment; and the rigidities it generates for a small open economy, which
needs to adapt flexibly to the demand of the global markets. Given the sensitivity of these issues,
dialogue between the stakeholders will need to be gradual to ensure successful reforms.
61.       The lack of flexibility and security in the labor market is impeding Tunisia's
competitiveness and, therefore, hampering growth. In addition, existing safety nets are not
explicitly geared to provide effective mechanisms for protecting workers against employment
shocks. While a number of social programs exist,34 evidence on their effectiveness and coverage
is still scant. Ongoing analytical work on Social Safety Net Assessment will contribute to fill this
gap.
62.    The relatively limited international mobility of the country's labor force represents a loss
in terms of employment opportunities and income for the country. At present, international
migration is an under-tapped source of jobs for the country's labor force, especially for those
with qualifications. For example, Tunisia only managed to send 1,546 national workers to
France in 2009, despite a bilateral agreement allowing for 9,000 work visas. Over the next 20
years, demographic changes will lead to a decline in the labor force in Europe and the Gulf
countries and to an increase in job mobility and international migration.
63.     The Government has recognized this potential and its objectives are: (i) in the short term,
to assess employment opportunities abroad; and (b) in the medium term, to establish a dynamic
intermediation system between Tunisian workers and world labor demand, with in-sourcing of
international service jobs and work emigration to Europe and other regions. This will require a
new regulatory framework to liberalize and set quality standards for private international labor
intermediation.
64.    A competency-based National Qualification Framework (NQF) that allows for a
transparent recognition of qualifications and skills may improve the employability of individuals
and enhance the potential to place Tunisians in appropriate jobs abroad. To allow for better
recognition of competencies and a better match between the competencies required by foreign
employers and those supplied by Tunisian qualified applicants, it would be necessary to
implement an updated and competency-based NQF among all public providers of education and
to promote it among national and international employers.
65.     In the context of the challenges described above, and the consensus achieved by the
various stakeholders, the Government has identified three avenues of reform to address the
current situation:


34
  These include the National Program of Assistance to Needy Families, Programs geared to the creation of employment
opportunities, micro-credit interventions, food subsidies, and other housing, health, education and infrastructure programs.

                                                            22
     Increase labor market dynamism to allow for restructuring of the private sector towards
     higher value-added sectors. This will likely entail a review of the existing hiring and
     firing dispositions in the Labor Code, using a gradual process in order to develop
     consensus and to bring on-board all concerned stakeholders.
     Strengthen the social safety net for redundant workers. Any changes to the social safety
     net will be based on an assessment of the existing schemes' efficiency which will make
     suggestions for their overhaul.
     Improve international mobility of the active workforce. Facilitation of international
     migration is high on the agenda of the MVTE given the proximity of the EU and the Gulf
     countries and the existence of bilateral conventions with countries such as France.
66.     The detailed measures that will be taken with regard to each of these objectives and that
will be supported by the DPL are described in Section V.

Monitoring and Evaluation of Employment Policies

67.     The Government's objective in this area is to ensure that employment-related data are
collected, harmonized, monitored and disseminated in the most efficient and transparent
manner, according to international best practice. Currently, the extent to which statistics,
including micro-survey data, are shared is insufficient. As a consequence, systematic evidence-
based policy making is limited due to a lack of information flow among agencies and from the
National Statistical Institute (INS) to researchers, as well as a lack of regular monitoring of
employment-related data. With regard to data collection and dissemination, there is no official
procedure for sharing data among public agencies in place, although such a procedure is foreseen
by the Statistical Law of 1999 regarding the provision of data from the national agencies to the
INS. Currently, there are legal constraints as well as legal sanctions for the unauthorized sharing
of micro survey data, as cited in the Statistical Law of 1999, Articles 5 and 28 (Law N° 99-32,
April 13, 1999). To achieve consistency and comparability of Tunisian employment data, such
as the Labor Force Survey, with international statistics, there is a need to harmonize national
methodologies and nomenclature with international standards (such as the EU's statistical
classification of economic activities, NACE, revised in 2006 and the United Nation's statistical
classifications of activities, ISIC, revised in 2006). National adoption of a common classification
would also allow for inter-agency comparability of data, such as from the INS and ONEQ, for
example.
68.   In this context, the Government has identified three avenues of reform to address the
above-mentioned challenges:
     Coordinate data production. To allow for efficient and transparent production of
     employment data, this would require establishing the official procedures for data
     exchange from public agencies to the INS as well as the institutionalization of a technical
     committee that is responsible for coordinating the production of all employment data.
     Harmonize data nomenclature. To advance the process of harmonization in accordance
     with international standards, the MDIC produced two reports in 2009 with the objective
     of officially standardizing the nomenclature of Tunisian economic activities, products,
     and professions (Project for Nomenclature of Tunisian Activities and Project for
     Classification of Tunisian Products). The nomenclature of activities and products have
                                                23
     been reviewed accordingly and officially published by the National Institute for
     Standardization and National Property (INNORPI). So far, the nomenclature of products
     has been registered, while the registration of the nomenclature of activities is subject to
     modification or revocation of the decree of 1996. However as the nomenclatures for
     products and activities go hand in hand, the adoption of the former implies the adoption
     of the latter.
     Mainstream evidence-based policy making. As a starting point, the two on-going pilot
     experiences of new ALMPs include an integrated rigorous impact evaluation. In order to
     mainstream a rigorous M&E process, the regular monitoring and impact evaluation of
     social and labor force policies will be anchored in the relevant legislation.
69.     Detailed descriptions of actions which will be taken in accordance with each of the above
areas, to be supported by the proposed DPL, are included in Section V.

D. PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

70.    The Bank has advised the Government on the importance of consulting the proposed
reforms, as per OP.8.60 in a letter sent to the Government on May 24th, 2010.
71.     As employment is at the core of the social contract between the Government and the
country's population, a gradual, consensus-based approach involving all stakeholders will be
necessary and is essential in ensuring sustainability and in enhancing the development outcomes
of the policy loan. In addition, strong inter-institutional coordination among agencies involved
in employment issues will be critical in their ability to implement any reforms.
72.    The Government has conducted broad strategy consultations within the context of the
National Consultation on Employment (2008) (NCE) with key stakeholders including
universities, experts, employers of diverse sectors, representatives of social partners (employers
and trade unions), NGOs, political parties and civil service workers.
73.    In preparing the latest CPS, the Bank team undertook a broad series of consultations in
June 2009 with a set of development partners and stakeholders. These meetings, with NGOs,
private sector representatives, other civil society organizations (CSO), professional
organizations, unions and academics, were organized both at a local and national level.
74.     In January 2009 the Government, in cooperation with the Bank held a Technical
Consultation Workshop in Sousse on potential ALMP reform measures and other labor market
policies with broad participation from relevant Ministries, representatives of the Universities,
employers (UTICA) and the national trade union (UGTT). The workshop discussed
international experience to date with regards to undertaking a series of policy measures,
including, for example, ALMPs to create jobs in under-supplied public services (i.e. childcare),
and those which focused on organizational reform of employment services, private employment
intermediation and other related labor market policies. The results and recommendations
adopted by the workshop are supported by this DPL (DPL I).
75.     A one-day technical seminar on managed migration held in Tunis in January 2010 in
cooperation with the Government and the Bank, and which was attended by government
officials, research institutions, and the press, discussed the findings from two major World Bank
migration reports: Shaping the Future: A Long Term Perspective of People and Job Mobility for

                                               24
the Middle East and North Africa (March 2009) as well as the findings from the EC-funded
World Bank program: Labor Migration from North Africa: Supporting Policies to Maximize
Benefits for Exporting and Importing Countries. In line with the major themes of these reports,
the introductory speech of the Minister of Employment highlighted the need for more active
migration management and for efforts to upgrade skills to better meet the demand of both the
domestic and global labor markets. The discussion during the workshop centered on issues
pertaining to: sending countries' capacity to absorb their labor force; compensation for the
sending countries' investment in education of their emigrants; and the mismatch between the
demand and supply of skills in the domestic and international markets.
Partnerships between the Government and the private sector in Tunisia are as yet limited and
official representatives of private employers are often understood as having a quasi-public role
as well. Therefore, a Brainstorming Event with selected vocal representatives of the private
sector, on Supply and Demand for Skills (education and training, in-sourcing and private
intermediation of employment, at the domestic and international levels) took place in Tunis in
January 2010. Opinions voiced during this event pointed to the fact that the Government's
employment and learning plans had been developed without sufficient knowledge of the needs of
the enterprise sector and that there was a lack of public-private partnerships.
76.     ANETI hosted a Round Table Workshop in Tunis in March 2010 with participation from
relevant Ministries, universities, UGTT and UTICA about labor market reforms, with particular
emphasis on `flexicurity'- type reforms which soften barriers against layoffs in labor legislation
while simultaneously expanding performance and coverage of the social safety net for laid-off
workers. The Bank team presented experience with such reforms in comparable settings
(Poland, Turkey and Colombia) and, in particular, highlighted the importance of tri-partite
cooperation of the government, employers and trade unions to bring about effective and
sustainable reforms. Participants expressed interest in thoroughly understanding these
experiences and their impact for the respective countries, as well as the related lessons learned,
and engaged in a constructive debate on this. Representatives from the UGTT, who had already
started studying the topic of flexicurity, signaled their readiness to accompany the change. At
the same time, they criticized the lack of a shared diagnostic of the situation between the
government and the social partners. They also lamented that a commission, established for the
multi-partite discussion of these matters, had never yet met. Employer representatives further
underlined that Tunisia's current legislation on these issues was not suitable for "the realities of
the labor market".
77.   The DPL series addresses each of these concerns, with the objective of axis 2 being to
"enhance internal and external mobility of the workforce" in both DPL I and DPL II.

IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A. LINK TO CPS

78.    Generating employment and establishing a knowledge-based economy with emphasis on
human development are the centerpieces of the XIth National Development Plan and thus
supported by the CPS through three strategic pillars (i) employment growth and
competitiveness; (ii) sustainable development and climate change; and (iii) improving the

                                                25
quality of service delivery. To address the country's employment challenge and assist its
transition into a knowledge-based economy, pillar I focuses on (i) strengthening the demand for
labor and (ii) fostering the employability of labor. The CPS engages (1) on the labor demand side,
the Integration and Competitiveness DPL, the Third Export Development Project, and the Energy
Efficiency Project, (2) on the labor supply side, the Higher Education Quality and Skills Development
Projects, and (3) on the matching of labor demand and supply, this proposed Employment DPL series
(DPL I and DPL II).
79.     The Employment DPL will support three objectives that fall under the first pillar of the
CPS: (1) facilitating employment through active labor market policies; (2) enhancing domestic
and international mobility of the labor force; and (3) strengthening the monitoring, evaluation
and dissemination of employment data and mainstreaming evidence-based policy-making. The
proposed DPL will also contribute to the third pillar of the CPS (improving the quality of service
delivery) by modernizing the instruments and work processes of the employment agency
ANETI, and by focusing on improving matching processes between the supply of the
educational system and the needs of the labor market. This proposed Employment DPL is an
integral part of the response to the request of the Government for Bank support in employment
generation. As requested by the Government, the proposed DPL focuses strictly on topics
pertaining to the labor market, as the area where labor demand and supply meet to determine
actual employment. As discussed, labor demand facilitated by the investment climate, and
quality of labor supply through the education sectors, are covered by other Bank instruments in
the CPS.

B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

80.     The proposed programmatic series of two single-tranche DPLs will support reforms in
the first two years of a five-year program in cooperation with the European Commission (EC).
The Bank and the EC have agreed to jointly support a common policy matrix covering a pro-
employment reform program for five years, focusing on the three objectives described above. It
is expected that the first two years will be covered by two single-tranche programmatic DPLs,
and the last three years by a  60 million EC budget support grant. The common policy matrix
(see Annex 2) currently identifies (i) short-term measures to be taken until May 2010, (ii)
potential medium-term measures to be taken until mid-2011 and (iii) a long-term vision to be
attained in the last year of the program. Both donors joined forces in the identification mission
(October 2009), and in a joint pre-appraisal/formulation mission in March 2010.
81.      In addition to the EC team, the Bank DPL team has cooperated closely with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) team, in particular on matters affecting the macro
environment and growth as well as employment. The IMF has completed an Article IV
consultation in September 2009, with discussions focusing on Tunisia's exposure to the financial
crisis, and the Government's short-term stimulus measures against it. The consultation broadly
supported the Government's macroeconomic policy while encouraging continued reforms to
strengthen the economy's resilience and improve growth and employment.                      Specific
recommendations included: (i) targeting public expenditure very well in order to allow
continued stimulus in 2010 and a faster fiscal consolidation thereafter; (ii) gradual adjustments in
monetary policy taking into consideration potential renewed inflationary pressures; and (iii) a
continued strengthening of the banking sector.

                                                 26
C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

82.     The proposed Employment DPL series is complementary to existing and planned Bank
activities, including investment loans, economic and sector work (ESW), and technical
assistance. The DPL series will provide an instrument for in-depth reform in the labor market
and related areas, thereby forming the legal and policy backbone for other accompanying
operations (see Figure 7).

          Figure 7: Overview of Bank projects supporting employment in Tunisia




83.     Regarding the generation of new and high value-added jobs, i.e. labor demand, the
Integration and Competitiveness DPL (ICL) supported a first generation of measures to:
improve the climate for both foreign and domestic investment; modernize the financial sector;
and to facilitate trade. A follow up Integration and Competitiveness DPL will be delivered in
FY11.

84.    Several education loans provided by the World Bank support the reform of the education
system to make it more responsive to the needs of the labor market. In higher education, the
PARES investment loan promotes autonomy in university management, improves quality and
relevance of programs in response to market needs through the use of competitive allocation of
funds, develops a system of external quality assurance and a establishes a sustainable student
financing strategy which will introduce cost-sharing mechanisms as well as grants and loans for
needy students. In basic education, the PAQSET 2 project aims at upgrading the basic education
teaching process with modern procedures, materials and tools. The proposed Skills Development
Project will improve the employer relevance of vocational skills, through: (i) strengthening

                                              27
employers' influence over and participation in vocational training provision; (ii) enhancing the
accountability of the public training system through a reformed financing system where money
follows the individual; and through (iii) better M&E, including the establishment of a quality
assurance system.
85.     The planned Municipal Development IV Project will support capacity-building for
regional and local development planning and budget management staff, which will also benefit
the entities implementing the regionally contracted ALMPs.

D. LESSONS LEARNED

86.    The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) completion report, the Economic
Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL) series and the Integration and Competitiveness DPL
have provided some useful lessons that have been taken into account in the preparation of the
Employment DPL series (DPL I and DPL II). Namely:
     Increase the alignment between the Bank's program and the country's priorities. This
     DPL series directly addresses Tunisia's highest priority - employment, by focusing on
     improving the employability of labor and the functioning of the labor market.
     Maintain a flexible approach to support the government in a changing environment. The
     programmatic nature of two sequential DPLs, followed by a three-year EC grant,
     introduces flexibility by aiming for a realistic assessment of reform opportunities and
     progress.
     Focus on a few key actions. Even though the ECAL program was successful, a more
     streamlined approach focusing on fewer actions facilitates coordination within the
     Government is needed, as is a focus of authorities' attention on fewer issues. Similarly,
     the previous CAS contained a results matrix with many, detailed and thus inflexible goals
     and indicators. The Employment DPL series introduces flexibility by focusing on key
     issues with a detailed description of expected results and indicators where possible.
     Sustainable reform takes time and the Bank needs to follow the pace of the Government
     for reforms. Appropriate pacing of reform is also important to maintain stability and
     social peace. This Employment DPL series gradually builds momentum for reform: the
     CAS completion record concluded that the previous Programmatic Economic and Sector
     Work (PESW) helped build inter-ministerial consensus within the Government on a set
     of major issues pertaining to employment. Further, a five-year joint donor program
     allows supporting sensitive reforms with a long-term perspective and with the explicit
     inclusion of consultations with social partners.
     Accompany reform program with technical assistance. The more complex measures in
     the policy matrix, like the reorganization of ALMPs and work processes at ANETI, the
     ALMP pilots, the migration regulation and the preparation of labor code reforms, are all
     accompanied by commensurate technical assistance, financed by the EU, the UNDP,
     Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) and the Bank.
     Need to strengthen M&E systems and focus on practical results framework. The
     proposed DPL series focuses explicitly on the monitoring and evaluation of employment
     policies to assist the Government in making informed choices regarding these policies.



                                              28
      Challenges in harmonizing and developing knowledgeable and skilled human resources
      and institutional capacity. The CAS completion report identified gaps in human
      resources and institutional capacity as factor contributing to slow disbursements and
      delays in implementation. The proposed DPL series contributes directly to the
      institutional capacity- building of ANETI as well as of those public institutions producing
      employment data; and indirectly, through technical assistance, to the capacity-building of
      the key program counterparts.

E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

87.     The operation builds directly on the World Bank's analytic and advisory work. Prior to
the request for this DPL series, the Bank, in close cooperation with the Government, conducted a
multi-year programmatic ESW on employment, which produced a series of analytical outputs, as
detailed in Table 5. The recommendations of this study were condensed in the two MILES
policy notes in 2007 and 2008.35
88.    The MILES policy notes and their follow-up technical work prompted the Government to
request the DPL series. The MILES notes provided findings on employment and its barriers that
motivated the actions in this DPL. The key findings are presented in condensed form in the
Country Context section of this PD.
89.     As part of the preparation for the proposed first DPL the Bank team produced and
collected technical notes on:
      The improvement of the ALMP portfolio and of work processes in ANETI (December
      2008).
      The Labor Code and unemployment assistance (FY09)36, following a stakeholder
      workshop with members of concerned ministries and agencies and social partners
      (unions, employers) (Sousse, January 2009).
      The Bank also commissioned an in-depth process evaluation of service delivery at
      ANETI (completed December 2009).
      In addition, a report (Euromed)37 on the institutional and legal framework for statistics
      and data collection in Tunisia fed into the preparation.

V. THE PROPOSED TUNISIA EMPLOYMENT DPL SERIES

A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

90.     The overall objective of the proposed DPL series would be to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of job entry in Tunisia. Concretely, the DPL aims to:
       Axis 1: Facilitate employment through Active Labor Market policies;
       Axis 2: Enhance domestic and international mobility of the labor force; and
       Axis 3: Strengthen the monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of employment data and
       mainstream evidence-based policy-making

B. LOAN AMOUNT AND SEQUENCING

91.     The loan as well as the cooperation with other donors follows a programmatic approach.
The Government is requesting a loan amount of US$50 million from the World Bank for this
first DPL for 2010. A second DPL is expected to follow in 2011 (probably late in the year, so
pertaining to FY12). The EC plans to support the program from 2012 to 2014 through a 60
million grant. The two institutions will use the same five -year matrix as the basis for
disbursement (see Annex 2).

C. POLICY AREAS

92.     The policy matrix (see Annex 2) describes the logic of the program by showing for each
of the three main objectives of the loan, the specific measures to be implemented during the
course of the program. The matrix shows two types of measures: (i) prior actions that are
considered critical to achieve the program's objectives; and (ii) accompanying measures that are
intended to support each reform and set the stage for follow-up measures in subsequent
operations. Given that this is the first of two programmatic one-tranche DPLs, which in turn
mark the two first years of a five-year reform program, the matrix states the measures to be
implemented by the Government under the first DPL, potential measures to be implemented in
the second DPL, and those outcomes to be achieved by the end of the five-year program. The
following section discusses the measures to be implemented under the first DPL only.
93.     The first DPL includes eight prior actions for the first DPL and seven proposed triggers
for the second DPL. They were chosen with three "best practice" principles in mind: (i)
ownership: they are either reflected in the Government's strategic documents such as prior
actions 1 to 4, and/or implementation is already completed by the end of pre-appraisal, such as
prior actions 1 to 6; (ii) importance: they are critical to the ultimate realization of the objectives
of the program and (iii) predictability: their effective implementation can be adequately
monitored. The actions selected strike a balance between the importance of ownership, the
appropriate pacing of reform in light of the required stakeholder consensus, the ambition of the
reform program as well as realism and expected effectiveness of implementation given the
timeframe of this first DPL. This proposed first DPL would set the initial stages for deeper

                                                 31
reforms, and gradually broaden the scope of action into areas that need prior social partner
consultation. This has been the hallmark of successful reforms in Tunisia in the past, and is a
reliable way to guarantee their sustainability.

                       Box 2: Prior Actions for DPL I and Triggers for DPL II
Prior actions for DPL I:
The Government of Tunisia has agreed upon and implemented the following prior actions before the presentation of
the first DPL to the Bank's Executive Board (see "policy areas" section for more details):
Prior Action 1. The Ministry of Higher Education, and Scientific Research (MHESR) and the Ministry of
Vocational Training and Employment (MVTE) have issued Circular (Circulaire) No. 1 dated August 10, 2009
launching a pilot program to provide support for students seeking to establish their own companies upon graduation
through the preparation of business plans (Business Plan Theses or BPTs), and MHESR has published in the
National Gazette Order (Arrêté) dated June 30, 2009, to allowing such BPT as undergraduate theses.
Prior Action 2. MVTE has published in the National Gazette Decree No. 349 dated February 9, 2009, providing
for a complete re-structuring of the ALMP Menu towards better efficiency.
Prior Action 3. MVTE has published in the National Gazette Decree No. 87 dated January 20 2010, under which
the National Agency for Employment and Independent Work (ANETI) is required to offer individual-centered job
seeking assistance (modern case management) for the long-term unemployed.
Prior Action 4. MVTE has published in the National Gazette, Decree No. 87 dated January 20, 2010, which, inter
alia, encourages increasing involvement of the private sector and non-governmental organizations in the delivery of
employment services.
Prior Action 5. The International Employment Division responsible for international labor intermediation has been
established at ANETI, has initiated engagement with international employer associations and facilitates language
and technical training for prospective migrants in cooperation with the International Organization for Migration
(IOM).
Prior Action 6. MVTE has published in the National Gazette Decree No. 2009-2139 dated July 8, 2009 to
establish the National Qualification Framework (NQF), including a commission responsible for its implementation,
and MVTE has issued an Order (Arrêté) setting forth the composition and operating mechanism of the
implementing commission.

Axis 1: Facilitate employment through Active Labor Market Policies

94.      Policy actions within this area fall into two categories:

      1. Tap new sources of job creation
      2. Facilitate employment through well targeted and efficient ALMPs
95.      The prior actions for this policy area are:
       Prior Action 1. The Ministry of Higher Education, and Scientific Research (MHESR)
       and the Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment (MVTE) have issued Circular
       (Circulaire) No. 1 dated August 10, 2009 launching a pilot program to provide support
       for students seeking to establish their own companies upon graduation through the
       preparation of business plans (Business Plan Theses or BPTs), and MHESR has
       published in the National Gazette Order (Arrêté) dated June 30, 2009, to allowing such
       BPT as undergraduate theses.
       Prior Action 2. The MVTE has published in the National Gazette Decree No. 349 dated
       February 9, 2009, providing for a complete re-structuring of the ALMP Menu towards
       better efficiency.
       Prior Action 3. The MVTE has published in the National Gazette Decree No. 87 dated
       January 20 2010, under which ANETI is required to offer individual-centered job seeking
       assistance (modern case management) for the long-term unemployed.
       Prior Action 4. The MVTE has published in the National Gazette Decree No. 87 dated
       January 20, 2010, which, inter alia, encourages increasing involvement of the private
       sector and non-governmental organizations in the delivery of employment services.
96.     Prior Action 1 supports the Government's objective of generating new jobs through self-
employment, while specifically addressing the needs of the growing pool of graduate first time
job-seekers. These unemployed first time job-seekers are in many cases graduates in law,
economics and business ­ disciplines that are usually conducive to entrepreneurship. This prior
action is supported by the Presidential Program (2009-2014), which calls for: (i) "the
development of new employment opportunities (especially) in the area of social outreach
services, in both known and new professions"; (ii) "a new legal basis for individual start-ups";
and (iii) several measures to facilitate start-up financing and incubation, such as higher credit
ceilings for the public development banks.
97.    Prior Action 2 addresses the issue of inefficiency in the ALMP portfolio. Previously, the
sheer number of ALMP programs (more than 20) made them difficult to monitor and control
financially. There was also evidence that some ALMPs suffered from substitution effects and
deadweight loss, due to unconditional access by both job-seekers and employers. The new menu
includes therefore `filters', i.e. conditionalities of access, for both beneficiaries and employers.
98.     Prior Action 3 addresses the effectiveness of ANETI's intermediation, by introducing a
more targeted client orientation. Assisting the long term unemployed, often the hardest to place,
will include case management, providing the option to sub-contract this activity to the private or
third sectors. This action is also in line with the Presidential Program, which commits the
Government to: (iv) "stewarding the upgrading of the employment offices in order to dynamize

                                                  34
their role in the matching of labor supply and demand"38, as well as in line with international
best practice.
99.    Prior Action 4 primarily addresses ANETI's capacity constraints by allowing the agency
to sub-contract specific services to the private and third sectors. This is an important first step
towards the liberalization of private provision of employment intermediation.

Tap New Sources of Job Creation

100. The pilot ALMP with BPT and company start-up (incubation) (Prior Action 1) began in
the 2009-2010 academic year. Over 250 "licence appliquée" programs from every university
country-wide participated, with a total number of about 20,000 eligible students. Out of these,
1,702 have applied, some of them teaming up in groups of two, so that the total number of
proposed projects is 1,506. One-half of these have been randomly selected to participate in the
pilot program. These participants will write their final year thesis on a business idea with a
detailed business plan (BPT). They will receive tutoring in the form of start-up training and
supervision from their university professors and private sector experienced coaches. During this
process, students will develop a business plan (BP) which they will submit to a jury for
evaluation (by June 2010). At the same time, the BPT will fulfill the academic thesis requirement
for undergraduates. This possibility has already been certified by an arrêté approved by the
MHESR (30 June 2009).
101. Once all BPs are submitted, the top 50 winners will receive a prize package which
includes a monetary reward of TND 15,000, 7,000 or 2,000 (equivalent to $ 10,200, 4,760, or
1,360).39 For prize winners, the money will count as own funds and will be directly transferred to
a venture capital fund supporting the enterprise, according to a procedure laid out in the
operations manual of the pilot program. All participants will further benefit from coaching for
the start-up of the enterprise (registering, setting up etc), available through the pépinière
(university incubator) system and through ANETI. They will also have access to financing from
the public micro- and meso-credit banks BTS (Banque Tunisienne de Solidarité) and BFPME
(Banque pour le Financement de la Petite et Moyenne Entreprise), who participated in designing
the program. All applicants initially completed a detailed application which will serve as the
baseline survey. A follow-up survey two years later of these individuals (one year after start-up
of the firms resulting from the theses) as well as the randomized implementation of the program,
will allow for a rigorous evaluation of the program's impact.
102. The main challenge of this pilot is institutional coordination. A cross-ministerial
management unit supervises implementation of an intervention which covers elements delivered
by three different ministries and their agencies:            ANETI delivers the customized
entrepreneurship course; the API, through the pépinière, offers business coaching while the
theses are written, and university professors provide primary supervision for the thesis exercise.
For ease and quality of implementation, local management units have been established, headed
by a university representative, and including representatives of API and ANETI. A central
steering committee, comprised of General Directors from the three ministries, follows up on the

38
  Programme Presidentiel 2009-2014, "L'emploi, une priorite absolue", 20 subpoints on employment, 2009
39
  A sponsorship round to finance the prize money is being conducted among private enterprises and has already yielded TDN
80,000, which has been deposited in an earmarked special account at ANETI.

work of the management unit. It is expected that recent university graduates will encounter more
employment opportunities through participation in the BPT program. A survival rate of 65
percent40 of the founded companies for at least one year is expected. In case of good
performance, the pilot program will be scaled up. This pilot ALMP would be fully implemented
and the prize money for competition winners disbursed by the beginning of DPL II.
103. In addition to the above described prior action 1, which is a condition for disbursement,
the Government has chosen to pursue an accompanying measure, which will provide additional
support to the objective of Tapping New Sources of Job Creation. The MVTE, together with
other concerned Ministries, is preparing a pilot ALMP for Community Childcare. Under this
pilot, early childhood development (ECD) services in poor urban communities would contribute
to: (i) reducing unemployment by creating employment opportunities for poor unemployed
women with relevant skills; (ii) alleviating poverty by allowing participating mothers to engage
in productive activities; and (iii) increasing poor children's human capital ­ integrated socio-
cognitive development and better school preparedness ­ through the provision of quality
affordable community ECD services for poor children ages 6 and younger. The pilot scheme
would include 350 satellite centers (providing home-based and community-based care) reaching
approximately 3,500 to 4,200 children in five poor urban areas of Tunisia. Poor unemployed
women with relevant skills would be trained to provide childcare in their own childcare
enterprises, and a conditional cash transfer (CCT) would help beneficiary families to cover the
childcare costs.
104. For DPL I, the MVTE has written the terms of reference (TOR) and has contracted a
consultant, with the support of UNDP, to design the pilot with the CCT scheme.
105. By the start of DPL II, the Ministries in charge of preschool activities will have used
experiences from the pilot to draft and publish in the National Gazette a Decree setting forth new
quality standards for the local provision of social childcare. This is a proposed trigger for the
second DPL.

Facilitate employment through well-targeted and efficient Active Labor Market Policies
(ALMPs)

106. A fundamental re-structuring of Tunisia's ALMP menu (Prior Action 2) has been
required by Decree (arrêté) 349 of February 2009. This Decree resulted in the bundling of over
20 programs into six generic ALMP. The first two are targeted to university graduates, (i) a
subsidized internship (stage d'initiation a la vie professionnelle, SIVP) which can be applied for
after six months own job search, and (ii) a vocational conversion training for graduate first time
job seekers that have not been able to find work during three years (contrat d'insertion des
diplômés d'enseignement supérieur, CIDES). CIDES is usually a dual apprenticeship tailored to
the demands of a specific employer that guarantees hiring the candidate afterwards. (iii) The
equivalent ALMP for non-graduates is the CAIP (contrat d'adaptation et insertion
professionnelle). (iv) The contrat de reinsertion dans la vie active (CRVA) is targeted to
previously employed jobseekers and offers them a training package tailored to the demands of a
specific new employer, who in turn guarantees hiring the trainee. Further, the Decree continues a

40
  A study of micro-enterprises financed by Banque Tunisienne (BTS) in 2006 found a survival rate of 62 percent on average and
a higher one for university graduates.

                                                            36
previously successful ALMP, (v) a comprehensive package of training, coaching and incubation
support for start-ups41, and (vi) introduces a new ALMP that will be designed and implemented
by the Governorates, at the de-central regional level.
107. Almost all ALMPs (except the start-up program and the regional ALMPs) are now
targeted to specific job-seeker groups and include access conditions: (i) and (ii) are conditional
on an individual's own job-seeking efforts, and (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are conditional on the
employer hiring a share (under ALMP type (i) described above) or all (all other ALMP types)
candidates that participate in the tailored program.
108. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of such programs is notable. For example, the UK's
New Deal, a portfolio of ALMPs targeted to specific job-seeker groups, has had a significant
impact on insertion rates, particularly among young job-seekers.42 Further, evidence from
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that well-defined and appropriate access
conditionalities for ALMPs can be more important for achieving successful employment
insertion than the actual content of the ALMPs themselves.43 Finally, tailoring an ALMP to the
needs and criteria of an employer (as CIDES, CAIP and CRVA do) can make a substantial
difference in terms of employment success.44
109. The most important challenges in the implementation of the new Decree are the stricter
access conditions, which are new in the Tunisian context. Higher-education graduates, who are
quick to register with and rely on ANETI, need to learn that their personal job search, prior to
participating in such programs, is their responsibility. Further, employers may be hesitant to
guarantee hiring even after a training program tailored to their needs, as not many of them are
used to co-managing training programs with the public employment agency. They, too, will have
to learn to be more vocal and pro-active in the shaping of training programs, so that the programs
truly prepare individuals for a specific job. The expected outcome of this specific reform is the
establishment of more efficient public labor market intermediation efforts.
110. The expected results of this reform are: (i) better transparency and manageability of the
ALMP menu, and, therefore, (ii) greater efficiency in use of resources. ANETI's own
performance contract with the MVTE also foresees increased (iii) employer take-up of ALMPs
and program participant employment. We would assume that (i) above would allow ANETI to be
more successful in placing job-seekers. As the overall placement rate is dependent on the
business cycle, we chose the percentage of submitted job offers that ANETI manages to fill in a
year. Unfortunately (ii) above is hard to measure. While ANETI will certainly save money if
job-seekers place greater emphasis on their own prior job search, the unit cost per beneficiary
will not decrease. Rather, the easier to place will probably not even enter ANETI's files.
Similarly, while the stricter employer conditionality will reduce deadweight losses, and thereby
the numbers of individual take-up, those who do participate in these programs will have done so
due to a real need and the tailored training expense will be higher rather than lower in those

41
   Although in Tunisia the unemployed are strongly encouraged to use start-up support, and the ALMP is used on a larger scale
than in most European countries, the survival rate of the founded firms is quite decent at 62 percent.

cases. We, therefore, suggest measuring results through ANETI's own performance contract, and
report the employer take-up rates for the ALMP with the strongest employer conditionality,
CIDES and CAIP.
111. The MVTE is envisaging a longer-term reorientation of ANETI's work processes towards
modern case management45 and priority-oriented customer profiling, and the first step towards
this has been realized with Decree 87 of January 2010. (Prior Action 3). Article 41 of this decree
introduces modern case management for the long-term unemployed, i.e. for those jobseekers on
ANETI's files that are the most difficult to place. This measure responds to the capacity
constraints of ANETI described in Section III, which currently favors a quantitative and
unpersonalized management of the unemployed. This is likely to have serious consequences for
these individuals who have the lowest probability of insertion. Giving priority to the long-term
unemployed in ANETI's activities is, therefore, a first and important step towards profiling job-
seekers into groups according to specific risks. The exact definition of `long-term unemployed'
is still being finalized by ANETI's management, but will certainly include, according to ANETI,
job-seekers who have been unemployed for at least three years and who belong to the official
poverty list (`familles necessiteuses'). In addition, the Decree allows for this case management
to be sub-contracted to the private and third sectors. This will likely relieve ANETI's capacity
constraint both in terms of required staff and in terms of case management expertise.
112. Although case management is widely seen as the `gold standard' of modern employment
services, rigorous international evidence on its effectiveness is still scarce. A recent reform that
introduced several of the elements of the Tunisian ALMP reform is the so-called `Hartz' reform,
which was phased in in Germany and introduced, among other activities, case management. The
`Hartz' reform was carefully evaluated ex post, using quasi-experimental econometric and
qualitative methods. This evaluation found a positive effect on probability of insertion that was
highly dependent on circumstance (e.g., young men residing in areas with few job offers and
employment offices with an extremely high workload (Eastern Germany) benefited most).46
113. The implementation challenges for this Decree are likely few. ANETI has some experience
with outsourcing and is already providing some training programs through private or third sector
trainers. Appropriately formulating and supervising the content of sub-contracted case
management, might be a challenge particularly given no prior in-house experience with this.
However, ANETI is also currently benefitting from a twinning-arrangement with a European
employment agency, mediated by the EU which explicitly includes support in the supervision of
case management. The expected outcome is that public employment services are better targeted
and that the share of the long-term unemployed decreases from 16 percent to an inferior
percentage.
114. By the start of DPL II, ANETI will have implemented the first phase of reorganization,
including the restructuring of regional and local offices in line with efforts to reorganize work
processes of the agency. (Benchmark action.)


45
   "Case management" in the area of employment services means, at the minimum, (i) opening and following up an individual
file for each jobseeker, (ii) developing an individual strengths and needs assessment and (iii) an individual development plan. It
also means following up the plan with the jobseeker. The case manager also refers the jobseeker to further or outside sources of
further interventions, for example to improve his/her health or education.
46
   Mosley, Hugh (2006): Neuausrichtung der Vermittlungsprozesse, WZB and Infas, Berlin and Bonn 2006

                                                               38
115. Responding to the concern with regards to ANETI's low coverage of the general
workforce (covering only 21 percent of all jobseekers in 2007 according to the latest data
available to the team), a suggested trigger for DPL II will be the following: by mid-2011,
ANETI will have effectively implemented their current plan to launch mobile units in under-
served regions in the South and South-West (interior). These units (specifically buses) will be
equipped similarly to an employment office and will have access to Intranet. The buses would
be active in rural and poor regions, and cater primarily to individuals with less than a secondary
education. The expected outcome of this effort is an increase in the coverage of public
employment services. Specifically, it is expected that ANETI will increase its coverage rate in
the overall workforce (not just university graduates) from 21 percent (2007) to 35 percent
(2012).
116. In response to the evidence on ANETI's capacity constraints, the MVTE has begun
taking steps to increase the involvement of the private and third sector in the delivery of
employment services. This is a politically difficult undertaking, because private employment
intermediation is currently forbidden by the Labor Code and is opposed by the trade unions who
have quality concerns with regards to private intermediation services. Still, several private
intermediators already operate in Tunisia, without the supervision of the labor inspection.
117. The Government's objective is, therefore, to gradually increase the role for private and
third sector provision until the full liberalization of private intermediation, subject to a legal
framework that regulates the standards for the sector, takes hold. A first major step is the
publication of Decree 87 of January 2010 under DPL I (Prior Action 4), which allows and
encourages ANETI to involve the private sector and NGOs in training and coaching under the
start-up program, and in providing case management to the long-term unemployed. Training and
coaching under the start-up program can also be accessed by the job-seeker on his/her own
through a newly introduced training voucher. The changes introduced by this Decree are
reflective of a paradigm shift in Tunisian public employment services.
118. The `Hartz' reform program described above provides a carefully evaluated example of
changes similar to those described above. The `contracting of third parties' was newly permitted
under the `Hartz' reform for several employment service tasks, such as profiling, application
management and case management. While the evaluation did not find a higher success rate of
private providers over public services on average, a positive effect of subcontracting was found
among those agencies that suffered capacity constraints. Therefore, as in the earlier example,
sub-contracting some services to the private sector was particularly successful for men in Eastern
Germany (a region with generally fewer available jobs and more job-seekers than the national
average.) Training vouchers as a means of subcontracting were evaluated separately and showed
a strong positive effect (+8 percent) on beneficiaries' overall probability of insertion. The
effects were particularly significant for older job-seekers (ages 55 and older). 47
119. The challenges in implementing this new approach are expected to be moderate. As
mentioned above, ANETI has previous experience with outsourcing. Still, international evidence
with regards to the introduction of sub-contracting indicates that there is a learning curve in the
contracting agency in terms of matching job-seekers to appropriate providers, and in terms of
monitoring and supervising of providers. As mentioned, the twinning-arrangement with a

47
     Mosley, Hugh (2006): Neuausrichtung der Vermittlungsprozesse, WZB and Infas, Berlin and Bonn 2006

                                                             39
European employment agency should help ANETI also weather this challenge. The expected
outcome is a more efficient provision of employment services through increased private sector
involvement. It is expected that the share of ANETI's budget for ALMP channelled through
private provider or NGOs increases from its current 5 percent to at least 10 percent by 2012.
120. The Government would pursue this development under DPL II, and prepare a
comprehensive legal framework, based on a background study of the sector and the actors
currently operating in this sector. The study and draft legal documents would be the subject of
consultation with key stakeholders. Following the results of the consultation, a document has
been submitted to the relevant Ministers with reform options to encourage the creation of private
enterprises specialized in job placement. This is a trigger for the second DPL.

Axis 2: Enhance domestic and international mobility of the labor force

121.     Policy actions within this area fall under two categories:
   1. Improving labor market dynamics to allow for re-structuring of the production structure
   2. Moving towards managed migration to benefit from increased international mobility of
      the workforce
122.     Critical Benchmark Actions for this policy area include:
        The MVTE has sent an invitation letter on May 18, 2010 that specifies the composition
        of the inter-departmental commission ("IDC") with the objective to elaborate reform
        options for: (i) employment regulation in the Labor Code to achieve greater mobility of
        the workforce; and (ii) the protection for laid off workers to improve its coverage and
        performance.
        The IDC has met on May 29, 2010 and approved the TOR for a study to: (i) assess the
        coverage and performance of the current protection for laid off workers and (ii) formulate
        options for policy reform.
123.     Prior actions for this policy area include:
        Prior Action 5. The International Employment Division responsible for international
        labor intermediation has been established at ANETI, has initiated engagement with
        international employer associations and facilitates language and technical training for
        prospective migrants in cooperation with the International Organization for Migration
        (IOM).
        Prior Action 6. The MVTE has published in the National Gazette, Decree No. 2009-2139
        dated July 8, 2009 to establish the National Qualification Framework (NQF), including a
        commission responsible for its implementation, and MVTE has issued an Order (Arrêté)
        setting forth the composition and operating mechanism of the implementing commission.
124. The two Benchmark Actions constitute the first step towards adapting the legal
framework currently governing the labor market from its focus on the protection of jobs to the
protection of incomes. It is expected that the following will be achieved at the end of the five-
year program: (i) a modified Labor Code that enables firms to react to economic realities by
adjusting their factor inputs, including labor, and thereby lowering the transaction costs for open-

                                                   40
ended employment; and (ii) a modern and efficient safety net for workers who currently have no
job , that can respond to the needs of the entire workforce in terms of coverage and eligibility, as
well as to the Government's fiscal requirements. This vision is anchored in the Presidential
Program for Employment (2009-2014), which commits to: (i) "the improvement of the labor
market legislation, with a view to adapting to the new economic situation and to new forms of
work", and to (ii) ensuring "no family without work or source of income until 2014." The path
of reform enabled by this essential Benchmark Action forms the very core of the five-year
cooperation between the Government and the program's two donors, the Bank and EC.
125. Prior Action 5 addresses the vacuum in international labor intermediation that is currently
being filled by illegal intermediators. The establishment of the International Employment
Division within ANETI moves international labor intermediation activities towards a legalized
and regulated scope of action.
126. Prior Action 6 addresses the lack of a coherent and competency-based qualification
framework (i.e., the NQF) widely accepted by employers having the potential to signal the level
and quality of individuals' qualifications to employers abroad.

Improving labor market dynamics to allow for Restructuring of the production structure

127. The Inter-Departmental Commission (IDC) on Facilitating Labor Mobility would mainly
focus on any modifications to the Labor Code and on strengthening of the safety net for
redundant workers. In order to ensure informed decision-making, an important first step would
be to evaluate the performance of the present unemployment assistance scheme and to formulate
proposals for possible reforms. These proposals would be submitted to a multi-partite
commission (comprised of members of various ministries: MVET, MSASTA, Finance (MOF),
MDIC, Industry but also eventually social partners). The IDC would aim to increase the
flexibility available for firms in adapting to structural changes; and responding to economic
shocks, while providing better protection for workers within a dynamic and evolving labor
market. Commission members may undertake a study tour in countries that have implemented
similar reforms. As mentioned in Sections II and III, the existing unemployment assistance
program is very limited. At the end of the five-year program, the Commission will have worked
out options for a way forward and will have brokered an agreement on the best way to protect
and reconcile the interests of employers and employees.
128. A major challenge facing this IDC in addressing these issues is extremely sensitive
nature of the issues which are central to the social contract between the Government and the
Tunisian population. Additionally, it will require a high-level of inter-institutional coordination
between agencies involved in employment issues, most notably Ministries of Employment and of
Social Affairs; and will rely on credibility of the proposed reforms to achieve change. Labor
legislation is a sensitive area for reform in any country, and particularly, in the context of high
structural unemployment rates and an economic crisis which has resulted in increases in
unemployment. In addition, while the MVTE is responsible for employment services,
employment policy and M&E, MSASTA is responsible for the Labor code, Labor inspection
services and for salary negotiations with the unions. Partnership with the private sector is
limited. Given the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of available programs, the social
dialogue sometimes focuses on maintaining the status quo and protecting existing jobs rather
than creating new jobs and providing workers with the capabilities to obtain them.

                                                41
129. The Benchmark Actions we propose break out of this mold, and thereby also facilitate the
transition out of the Government's short term crisis-response measures. It is expected that these
efforts will move employment legislation from centering on job protection to focusing on income
protection. It is envisaged that restrictions for open-ended redundant workers, which allow
employers easier economic adjustment, will be revised and that the share of redundant workers
with access to unemployment benefits will increase from 5.4 percent in 2007 to a higher level
after the implementation of the reform. As benchmarks, unemployment insurance coverage is 11
percent, 16 percent, and 43 percent in Brazil, China, and U.S., respectively (2009).
130. The trigger actions for DPL II address the substance and implementation of reform
options going forward. By the time DPL II begins, the IDC will have consulted with the relevant
stakeholders options to reform (i) employment regulation and (ii) social protection mechanisms
for laid off workers. The commission will also have submitted a corresponding document to the
relevant Ministers.

Move towards managed migration to benefit from increased international mobility of workforce

131. ANETI established an internal division responsible for international labor intermediation
(emploi international) in December 2009, trained the Division's employees, and designated one
international representative, in each of the 91 local offices, to be in charge of facilitating
international job offers by spring of 2010 (Prior Action 5). The EU-financed AENEAS program
is providing technical and financial assistance for this project, aiming to build the institutional
capacity of ANETI to provide international labor intermediation for migrants, thereby increasing
the share of legal Tunisians abroad while at the same time reducing incentives for illegal
migration.

132. The newly established Division within ANETI (emploi international) focuses on three
target regions: Europe, North Africa, and the Gulf countries. In Europe, for example, Tunisia
has bilateral agreements with France and Italy but the country is unable to fill current visa quotas
(only 16 percent of quota to France was filled in 2009). In all target regions and countries,
emploi international currently focuses on identifying the needs of the labor market and in
establishing contacts with employers and employer associations. Emploi international also
collaborates with IOM to provide language and technical training to prospective migrants to
Italy. Facilitating migration and equipping migrants with relevant skills and knowledge may
lead to brain drain. However, brain drain is not considered a political economy concern in
Tunisia, given the current lack of employment opportunities for qualified people in the national
labor market and the ongoing transformation into a knowledge-economy, which will ultimately
profit from the experiences of Tunisians abroad. The main challenge of emploi international is
its financial sustainability after EU-funding stops at the end of 2010. It is expected that this
Division's work will result in more and better matching of migrants into jobs abroad. It is
expected that the number of: 1) work visas issued to France will increase from 1,546 (2010) to
3,600 in 2012; and CVs sent to employers and employment agencies abroad increases from
currently 1,000 to 2,500; and that the 3) share of international employment contracts facilitated
(of the total number of contracts facilitated by ANETI) increases from 0.003 percent (2010) to
1.5 percent (2012).



                                                42
133. As a trigger for DPL II, a decree for regulating the activities of private international
employment agencies will have been submitted for presidential approval. An expected result
from this activity will be a legalized and supervised private international intermediation system
in addition to ANETI's emploi international. All private and public labor intermediators will be
required to collect demographic and other basic information on individuals placed abroad in a
migration form.
134. As a benchmark, ANETI will also have initiated collaboration with the public institutions
of vocational and professional training to put in place a pilot program for pre-departure training
including a rigorous impact evaluation component. The institutions include MVTE, CENAFFIF
(Centre National de la Formation de Formateurs et de l'Ingenierie de la Formation, an
autonomous agency of MVTE in charge of the training of trainers and curricula development for
vocational education), and ATFP (Agence Tunisienne de la Formation Professionnelle, an
autonomous agency of MVTE that offers pre-service training in public training centers).
135. A main barrier to international migration is the lack of agreement between Tunisian and
foreign qualifications and competencies.        A national, competence-based, qualifications
framework can help increase the employability of Tunisians abroad. In July 2009, the MVTE has
issued a decree to announce a competence-based NQF and by mid May 2010, an inter-ministerial
commission will be established to coordinate the implementation of the NQF (Prior Action 6).
The design of the NQF was led by the Direction Générale de la Normalisation et de l'Évaluation
(now part of the MVTE) and CENAFFIF and supplemented by a technical group consisting of
representatives of the Prime Minister, the Ministries of Higher Education, Education, and
Employment, employer associations, unions, and other associations in the fields of hotel
business, agriculture, and tourism. Implementing the NQF will require time and strong
coordination among several stakeholders (mainly CENAFIFF, unions and employer
associations). The main challenges in implementing the NQF are assuring good governance and
quality assurance which are critical for its acceptance among Tunisian and international
employers. Similar to the establishment of an internal division responsible for international
labor intermediation at ANETI, it is expected that as a result of this action there will be increased
and improved matching of migrants to jobs abroad. It is expected that the proportion of training
centers (both public and private) providing a degree that is valid and recognized under the NQF
increases from 33 percent (2010) to 40 percent (2012).
136. By the start of DPL II, as a benchmark action, CENAFFIF will have worked with the
aforementioned stakeholders to translate competences established by the NQF into training
programs for two sectors of relevant job markets abroad. In addition, CENAFFIF would review
and compare differences and similarities in training programs and organizational structure in the
same sectors in other migration destinations in Europe, North America, and Gulf countries.

Axis 3: Strengthen the monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of employment data and
mainstream evidence-based policy-making

137.   Policy actions within this area fall under three categories:
   1. Coordinating data production
   2. Harmonizing data nomenclature


                                                 43
   3. Mainstreaming evidence-based policy making

138.    The prior actions for this policy area include:
        Prior Action 7. The MDIC has issued in 2010 an Order (Arrêté), referred to in the 1999
        Statistical Law, which stipulates the official procedure for public agencies to transmit
        data files to INS for statistical purposes.
        Prior Action 8. The National Statistical Institute (INS) has harmonized its nomenclature
        of products with the nomenclatures of the United Nations and the European Union, for
        statistical purposes.
139. Prior Action 7 addresses constraints to data sharing from public agencies to the INS. This
includes agencies that collect employment-related data in addition to those obtained by the INS,
for example during the annual Labor Force Survey. Systematic evidence-based policy making
could be improved by assuring a better information flow among public agencies and outside
users, as well as a through regular monitoring of employment-related data.

140. Prior Action 8 responds to the need for a nationally and internationally harmonized
system of industry activities and codes. Once adopted nationally, employment-related data
collected by different agencies will be internally consistent and comparable, regardless of the
original source.

Coordinate data production

141. The MDIC has issued an Order (arrêté) which stipulates the official procedure for the
transmission of data to the INS from public agencies (Prior Action 7). Currently, the INS
receives data from other public agencies through bilateral agreements or informal arrangements.
Transmission procedures are not formalized, however, and the degree of coordination varies by
agency. The main challenge will be the regular enforcement of the Order from the reporting
agencies. The expected outcome of this reform is a regular transmission of data and more
efficient data-sharing system among public bodies. Specifically, it is expected that the number of
formal conventions for the transfer of data that are signed between the INS and public agencies
increases from zero (2009) to seven (2012).
142. In addition to the prior action described above, INS has established a technical committee
that is responsible for coordinating the production of employment data, which is seen as a critical
condition for achieving the program's objectives. Efforts to coordinate the production of data on
employment are also underway by the CNS. A working group to monitor demographic and
social statistics including employment statistics has been formed, which includes representatives
of producers and users of statistics. These working groups meet and deal with various issues
relating to statistics or employment. A challenge related to these committees within the INS or
the CNS is to ensure that they meet on a regular basis and make decisions. The expected result
includes better coordination of the production of employment statistics and greater coherence of
these statistics.
143. By the time DPL II begins, the technical committee meets on a regular quarterly basis
and publishes an annual schedule for data production and publication, which will be available on
the INS website. The ministries and public agencies routinely transmit data to INS as per the

                                                44
official procedure established under Prior Action 7. In addition, ministries and public agencies
will have access to data from the INS on demand, as per the official procedure.
Harmonize data nomenclature

144. The INS has produced two reports on new official nomenclature for Tunisia: i)
Nomenclature Project of Tunisian Activities, 2009; and ii) Project for the Tunisian Classification
of Products, 2009. The aim is that the classifications of activities and products used in the
statistical information system on employment be unified at the national level and harmonized
with the relevant international classifications. These classifications have been revised as official
standards by the Tunisian National Institute of Standardization and Industrial Property
(INNORPI). The classification of Tunisian products 2009 (CTP.2009) has been adopted as
standard No NT 120.02 (2009) of 28 February 2010. This nomenclature is consistent with the
common international standards, i.e. the CPC version 2 of the UN and the EU CPA. 2008. The
classification of activities (NAT.2009) is adopted as standard No NT 120.01 (2009) of 28
February 2010, subject to amendment or cancellation of the Order of 1996. This nomenclature is
consistent with ISIC Rev.4 UN and the EU NACE Rev.2. A challenge remains in the application
of the new nomenclature, which is currently on a voluntary basis. The expected outcome of this
reform is the availability of a nationally and internationally harmonized nomenclature. To
achieve a high utilization of the harmonized nomenclatures, the INS and ONEQ will each adopt
a specific work program to apply the new nomenclature.

145. By DPL II, a similar revision to the national nomenclature of occupations (from 1997)
will be in effect. The nomenclature will be revised in order to harmonize it with the standards of
the International Labour Organization (ILO), through a corresponding modification of Decree
number 97-2452 of December 15, 1997.

Mainstream evidence-based policy making

146. Under DPL I, the Government has chosen a series of benchmark measures to support
evidence-based decisions with regards to employment policy: (i) the MVTE has published
Decree (No 349, February 2009) with the objective of systematically reinforcing the M&E of
ALMPs. ANETI manages the ALMPs under performance contracts with MVTE, which contain
target indicators for each ALMP. (ii) As a concrete example, ONEQ has published a monitoring
report on Instrument 32 of the Funds 21/21. (iii) ONEQ has also developed objectives for an
Information System which closely follows graduates of Vocational Training, Higher Education,
and the ALMPs as they enter the labor market. It is expected that these efforts would promote
and facilitate access of relevant employment data to policy decision-makers.

147. As a trigger for DPL II, the ONEQ, together with CNSS, INS and ANETI will publish an
action plan to introduce the use of a unique identifier in all national databases.




                                                45
                          Box 3: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Ownership - Reinforce ownership
The Government of Tunisia's program supported by the first Employment DPL is well-covered both by the XIth
National Development Plan (NDP) and the National Consultation on Employment (NCE). The NDP's strategic
objectives are to: (a) accelerate the pace of growth in order to reduce unemployment, boost incomes, and
consolidate Tunisia's progress in the reduction of poverty; (b) preserve macroeconomic stability; (c) uphold social
achievements and human development; and (d) preserve natural resources. The measures supported by this DPL
focus on the achievement of (a) and (c). All detailed measures proposed in the policy matrix (annex 2) reflect
recommendations given by the NCE. Further, they are those measures that the Government believes are necessary
and politically feasible.

Harmonization - Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated and
accountability framework
The program is jointly supported by the World Bank and the European Commission (EC) and these development
partners have collaborated effectively throughout identification and pre-appraisal and have coordinated the content
of the program. Both donors and the Government have carefully discussed and agreed on the proposed policy
matrix.

Customization - Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The policy matrix reflects the Government's priorities and lessons learnt by the three institutions in supporting
similar programs of the Government. The Bank has been flexible with regards to the Government's preference in
terms of both the tranching and preparation schedule.

Importance - Choose only actions that are critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
In harmony with the findings of OPCS's Development Policy Lending Retrospective 2009, this Development Policy
Loan (DPL) focuses on a single sector only. The Government has asked the Bank to maintain the focus of this DPL
on three labor market areas: ALMPs, internal and external workforce mobility, and monitoring & evaluation
(M&E) of employment policies. Each are crucial to the Government's job creation, productivity and results-based
policy agenda. This focus, reflected in the relatively small number of Ministries involved allows the Bank's efforts
to be more targeted. It also allows counterparts to coordinate efficiently in order to achieve results.

Transparency and Predictability - Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and
performance-based financial support
The selected prior actions can be effectively monitored, providing predictable and performance-based financial
support. Tunisia has always strived to implement all the measures of its program matrices in the past, as well as its
prior actions. Recourse to waivers has been exceptional in the past.


VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

148. Unemployment is the most pressing social issue in Tunisia at the moment and the
President's Program gives employment a very high priority. At the same time, however, since
employment is at the core of the social contract in Tunisia, it is also a sensitive issue. For any
reforms to the Labor Code or unemployment assistance efforts to succeed, the Government
needs to enlist the support of different stakeholders, including influential unions. Rigorous
analysis of existing employment data provides a factual basis for a productive dialogue among a
broad set of stakeholders. Baseline information on job-seekers is available in the documents

                                                        46
listed in Table 5. In addition, the country team is undertaking simulations with regard to the
impact of proposed measures to address the current crisis. Further, consultations with UTICA,
the employers' association, and UGTT, the workers' union, have helped deepen the
understanding of the political economy of potential reforms and highlighted the need for
effective communication of the proposed measures.
149. The proposed Employment DPL should contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of
job entry. The key findings of previous World Bank work highlight the persistence and high
level of unemployment and the segmentation of Tunisian labor markets. These findings were
described in the Country Context section of this PD.
150. The proposed reforms are expected to facilitate job creation and productivity growth,
while helping to improve the prospects for vulnerable groups in accessing formal sector jobs. By
proposing to shift protection from jobs protection to protection of workers' income, they would
re-balance existing structural inequity with likely changes to social welfare and overall positive
distributional consequences. This far-reaching impact underscores the importance of the policy
reform supported by this DPL.
151. The Bank's analytical work from aggregate data (see Section IV), shows that the current
unemployment system has negative distributional effects. Only permanent workers laid off for
economic reasons are entitled to unemployment assistance (that is only 5.4 percent of all people
laid off). Formal layoff procedures that entitle people to this assistance are difficult and therefore
often avoided by employers. Currently access to detailed statistical data from the LFS or the
Consumption Survey is restricted (see also Section III ­ Monitoring & Evaluation of
Employment Policies). We are at this stage unable to demonstrate how unemployment correlates
with poverty patterns either through household surveys or other specific poverty mapping.
However, based on international evidence, there is consensus on the positive aggregate effects of
increased labor mobility and on the positive distributional impact of an effective net of income
protection for workers.
152. A set of national social protection programs and centers are in active for vulnerable
groups (persons with disabilities, vulnerable children and adolescent, homeless etc. The
definition of vulnerability is twice the minimum salary (SMIG)). Efforts are also underway to
extend national micro-credit programs (such as The 2626 Fund) in all areas of the country to
support income-generation projects, especially in popular urban neighborhoods. The overall
impact of such social protection programs on poverty and employment patterns for vulnerable
groups is currently not known. A comprehensive social safety net assessment is foreseen as an
analytical underpinning of DPL II in 2011 in order to identify opportunities for better
effectiveness and integrated impact of social protection programs.
153. What follows discusses the main foreseen social and poverty impacts of each individual
measure supported by DPL I.
154. The reform should facilitate employment through ALMPs (Objective 1). As previously
mentioned, this DPL lays the groundwork for phasing out the Government's short-term actions
by modernizing the portfolio and administration of ALMP. Those individuals laid off during the
economic crisis will be able to access better employment services, at the central and the local
level, through new job opportunities and expansion of self employment via ALMPs. Young job-
seekers have explicitly been targeted in programs by the MVTE to provide them with relevant

                                                 47
professional training and adequate job opportunities. International evidence has shown that
graduate entrepreneurial activities can be promoted and undertaken early ­ even when future
entrepreneurs are still students.
155. The proposed action to tap new sources of job creation through the support of BPT as
well as the call for proposals to design a pilot ALMP with CCT to support community childcare
in poor neighborhoods, provided by unemployed female graduates of ECD-related fields, are
well-targeted towards characteristic pockets of unemployment and provide opportunities for
direct positive impacts of this reform. These measures, however, should be regarded as first
steps that will be further developed in preparation of DPL II based on the results of the pilot
activities
156. Furthermore, the first step in reforming ANETI's work procedures includes the
introduction of personalized case management for the long term unemployed. The 'long-term
unemployed' are defined as (i) individuals who are out of work for three or more years; (ii)
members of 'familles necessiteuses' (low-income households, see Box 2); and (iii) university
graduates (which are indeed harder to place on the labor market than people with vocational
education). This measure can be expected to have a direct positive effect on the labor market
insertion and the income of this particular vulnerable group.
157. The proposed action to reduce the unconditional access to all ALMPs and to add new and
stricter conditions for eligibility for many ALMPs poses a distinct social and poverty risk in the
short-term and in a crisis situation. The assumption is that this measure will provide incentives
for the unemployed to increase the intensity of their individual job-search. This action however
risks increasing the barriers for young job-seekers in the short term, and as such may have a
limited negative social impact. In the longer term, however, the measure, as demonstrated in
other countries, is likely to change behavior and strengthen the young job-seekers' ability to
access the labor market on their own. Although the Bank has good reason to expect a similar
positive outcome to those experienced in other countries48, it is uncertain what the outcome of
these measures would be in the Tunisian context.
158. The proposed objective of enhancing domestic and international mobility of the labor
force (Objective 2) (in this regard, adapting the Labor Code to increase workforce mobility) is
the measure that is assumed to have the strongest positive distributional effect in the long run.
However, at the same time it also carries a short-term negative social risk. Tunisia's strict
employment protection legislation de facto reduces the access to jobs among newcomers to the
labor market (including youth and women) as they cannot compete with well-established groups
such as prime-age males who are already in well-protected jobs (see Country Context). This
barrier to formal job entry can also prevent them from being covered by formal social insurance.
159. Moreover, in the presence of higher severance costs for laying off workers with
permanent contracts (likely older and more experienced) laying off may disproportionately affect
young workers, who are more likely to have a temporary contract. Established workers hired
under permanent contracts are those for whom the bulk of employment protection legislation

Mandatory Activation Program", IZA DP no. 2504

applies. They are likely to suffer from radical reforms that soften the legislation as this might
increase the chance they will lose their jobs.
160. The case study of Colombia in the early 1990s is often used to illustrate the experience of
introducing reforms that soften barriers against layoffs while simultaneously expanding
performance and coverage of the social safety net for laid-off workers. The analytical review of
this reform process indicates that greater flexibility may on one hand explain part of the surge in
unemployment during periods of economic recession (Kugler 2000). At the same time, the
evidence shows that the duration of unemployment decreased as a result of more relaxed
legislation and that exit rates from unemployment into formal employment rose more than exit
rates into informal employment (Kugler 2004).
161. As part of the reform efforts to improve labor market dynamics to allow for restructuring
of the production structure towards higher value-added sectors, proposals to strengthen the social
safety net for workers outside of firms (laid off workers and needy groups) will be considered.
This will be a first step towards modernizing and expanding Tunisia's safety net for the
unemployed, so that basic revenue can be protected during unemployment spells.
162. Specific government programs, targeting the poor and needy, such as the PFN have
contributed to reducing the levels of extreme and moderate poverty but are not adapted to
address emerging vulnerabilities around employments shocks. These programs will be appraised
in the Social Safety Net Assessment undertaken by the Bank to be finalized in FY11.
163. The policy proposal to move towards managed migration to benefit from the international
mobility of the workforce is expected to have positive socio-economic impacts. Legalizing and
regulating public and private labor intermediation will ensure a more efficient placement of
Tunisians abroad, thereby increasing the positive externalities of international migration for
Tunisia through remittances and other channels.49 Efficient intermediation in combination with
a transparent and recognized NQFs helps to counteract "brain waste".50 Over the long term,
however, the cost of skilled migration might potentially outweigh the benefits, if the depletion of
skills is a binding constraint to economic development. This is not an immediate concern for
Tunisia, given an increasingly educated workforce and an insufficient demand for academically
qualified labor. Yet, it is important to begin laying the groundwork for data collection (such as
household or migration surveys) to allow for proper monitoring of the determinants and
consequences of migration.
164. The policy reforms supported by this DPL series to foster Monitoring, Evaluation and
Dissemination of Employment Data (Objective 3) ­ namely enhancing and coordinating data
production, improving access and management of national data with a view to mainstream
evidence-based policy-making ­ is not expected to have any adverse socio-economic effects.
However, if in the future, Tunisia has regional employment data and employment projections for
each governorate and has made all administrative and survey employment data available on a
central server, this would be extremely helpful in improving poverty mapping and targeting of
social programs.

49
   Research indicates that skilled migration may have additional positive externalities, such as an increased return to human
capital investments due to an increase in the emigration rate; knowledge and innovation transfer from the Diaspora; cross-border
business networks; and transfer of norms and values. World Bank (2010): "Labor Migration from North Africa: Development
Impact, Challenges, and Policy Options. "
50
   Brain waste occurs when the skills and capabilities of migrants are underutilized in the labor market of the receiving country.

                                                               49
165. A merger of data from all relevant social security systems with employment data and
poverty mapping would also likely allow for improvements in M&E capacity. Improved
monitoring and impact evaluations will be critical in documenting the impact of reforms on
vulnerable and targeted groups and in order to perform more detailed poverty and social impact
assessments in Tunisia.
166. The key question is whether the proposed policy reform measures are adequate to avoid
further marginalization of vulnerable groups, such as youth and women, and if the Government
will be able to follow through with reforms in the face of political inertia or opposition. Policy
reform with regards to employment is likely sensitive in the Tunisian context as it is a core issue
of the social contract between the government and the Tunisian population. Fundamental
changes will imply a gradual reformulation of that contract as well as social change. However, a
balance has to be struck as security for some will likely result in reduced employment
opportunities for others.
167. Further social analysis would be useful not only to clearly identify those who gained and
who lost as a result of the reforms, but also to gauge ownership and to assess the likelihood that
stakeholders' would assist or obstruct the project's development objective. The analysis would
also position DPL II to improve the poverty orientation of the reform by including both
qualitative and quantitative assessments of reform programs, i.e. by improving household survey
data as suggested.

B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

168. This operation is a DPL in support of a program of reforms for which the environmental
requirements of OP/P8.60 apply. Overall, policies supported by the proposed loan are not likely
to have any significant adverse impact on the country's environment, including forests and other
natural resources. Safeguard policies (such as OP 4.01 Environmental Impact Assessment) do
not apply to this operation.
169. The reforms supported by this DPL are expected to facilitate employment through
ALMP, to s enhance domestic and international labor mobility and strengthen the monitoring,
evaluation and dissemination of employment data and mainstream evidence-based policy-
making. Most of these reforms will not have any impact on the environment. There are,
however, a few reforms which could have a negative environmental impact and are detailed
below:
170. The pilot ALMP with BPT. The funds will count as own funds and will be directly
transferred to a venture capital fund supporting the enterprise, according to a procedure laid out
in the operations manual of the pilot program. All participants will further benefit from coaching
for the incubation of the enterprise (registering, setting up, etc.), available through the pépinière
(university incubator) system and through ANETI. They will also have access to financing from
the public micro- and meso-credit banks, BTS and BFPME. 50 enterprises founded by students
participating to the Business Plan Competition will receive grants ranging from 2,000 to 15,000
TND. Some of these newly created micro-enterprises could have negative environmental
impacts. An analysis of a draft pipeline of projects ideas showed that most of the projects
consist of micro-enterprises providing services. Therefore, given the fact that the micro-
enterprises will have limited financial and human resources, it is very likely that environmental

                                                 50
impacts resulting from their activities will be both limited and reversible. It must also be noted
that these companies will be subject to the existing Tunisian environmental legislation.
171. Pilot ALMP for Community Childcare: The pilot scheme would include 350 satellite
centers (home and community-based) reaching approximately 3,500 to 4,200 children in five
poor urban areas of Tunisia (average of 10 to 12 children per center). It must be noted that this
pilot program would not entail any new construction and that the services provided will meet the
quality standards set by the Ministry of Women, Family, Childhood and Senior Citizens
(MWFCS).

C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

172. Implementation and coordination responsibilities: The responsibility for implementing
the program in Government rests with the MDIC which will coordinate all relevant activities
with other Ministries. The Government will take the lead in monitoring progress in
implementation.
173. Supervision by the Bank. Regular supervision will allow the Bank to continue providing
policy advice and technical assistance to the institutions involved in the implementation of the
program of reform. The Bank will continue to maintain dialogue with the relevant Government
ministries and will conduct regular reviews in close collaboration with other partners. This will
take the form of joint missions with the EC and shared analytical work and technical assistance.
174. M&E: The M&E of the program and its expected results will be fully embedded in the
M&E framework of the NDP. The Bank and other development partners will continue to
provide support to the Government to strengthen M&E, improve data quality and management
and enhance capacity for using development outcomes to inform policy making. The Bank's
program of investment lending incorporates aspects of M&E in each of the sectoral operations
and administers trust funds in support of M&E; this work will naturally feed into the overall
efforts of the Employment DPL.

D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

175. No major fiduciary issues are expected in the proposed DPL. The Government's public
administration operates in a structured and reliable manner, with adequate controls, as well as
uniform public accounting rules and procedures.
176. Financial Management Diagnostics and Risk Rating. Given the Bank's experience in
Tunisia and the primary conclusions from the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) work currently in progress, it has become clear that the country's public finance system
is governed by a highly developed legal and regulatory framework that offers significant global
guarantees in terms of viability and transparency. This system relies not only upon the principle
of the strict separation of the functions of authorizing officers and finance officers but also
mandates key internal control rules as well as internal and external auditing rules. The Tunisian
system also relies upon high quality administrative structures and strong human and material
resources. Overall, the Tunisian public expenditure system presents a very low budgetary and
financing risk. Additionally, yearly Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA) based
on Bank expert knowledge continue to maintain there is a low fiduciary risk. The low risk rating

                                               51
is due in large part to the steady and continued efforts and reforms supported by the Government
to modernize and improve the efficiency of the public sector including public financial
management activity during the last several years. These reforms are still ongoing.
177. The reporting and accounting are reliable, even though there is a room for improvement
and modernization; the computerization of the budget and accounting is rather simple, but well
spread among the public operators and its architecture allows a timely reporting. The cash and
debt managements are made in a professional way, due notably to a strong technical assistance
of the Bank. The whole area of control and audit is comprehensive and reliable, but still lacking
sufficient public disclosure, notably for the annual report of the General Auditor ("Cour des
Comptes") which is only partially disclosed.
178. The ongoing PEFA exercise recommended improvements including: (a) reducing the
delays to produce the year-end government financial statements; (b) further simplifying the a
priori internal controls while continuing to strengthen the ex-post controls and internal audit; (c)
further accelerating the implementation of the functional classification of expenditure that will
contribute to an accounting system reform; and (d) undertaking multi-annual budget and
performance-based budgeting. Public financial management reforms conducive to further
efficiency remain central to the government agenda, therefore, PEFA recommendations would be
used by Government to assess areas where performance will need to be improved.
179. Flow of funds (including foreign currency exchange) is subject to standard public
financial processes. Tunisia has had no safeguards assessment undertaken by the IMF.
However, during many years of working with the Tunisian government, the Bank has had no
major fiduciary issues in relation to the funds flow. The Government budget is comprehensive,
unified and subject to centralized treasury account. Cash flow and debt are professionally
managed under generally satisfactory conditions. Moreover, the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT)
has been audited for the past several years and no weaknesses have been reported by any
previous independent audit. The auditor's opinions were issued with no qualifications.51
180. Loan proceeds are deposited in a government designated account at the BCT and
transferred to the Treasury current account for government budget. The MOF will then provide
a confirmation of this transfer to the World Bank, indicating that the total amount of the loan was
received.

E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

181. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for Development
Policy Loans (DPLs) and will be disbursed through a single tranche. Once the loan has been
approved by the Board of Executive Directors and becomes effective, the proceeds of the loan
will be deposited by the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in a
dedicated account of the Borrower at the Central Bank of Tunisia, upon submission of a
withdrawal application. The Borrower should ensure that upon the deposit of loan proceeds into


51
   The Central Bank publishes in the Annual Report the "Financial Statement and co-auditors report" The 2008 report is already
publicly available and the team will request the 2009 report as a way to get a better knowledge of the Central Bank
environment".

                                                             52
said account, an equivalent amount is credited to the treasury current account at the Central Bank
of Tunisia. .
182. The Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency
account and credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds of the loan are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the
Borrower to promptly upon notice refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to
IBRD. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration
of the accounts relevant to this loan will be the responsibility of the Central Bank of Tunisia.
183. Although an audit of the use of the funds may not be required, IBRD reserves the right to
require audits of the deposit account at any time.

F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

184. There are four moderate to high risks covering the political, macro, institutional and
technical spheres and mitigation measures have been set up to address each.
185. On the political side, it will be important to promote greater efficiency and equity and to
build the reform process on broad national consensus. The actions supported by this proposed
DPL will serve as first steps to gradually build momentum for reform. In addition, the Bank has
pro-actively supported the Government's communication about employment policies to
stakeholders and the social partners have been included in the dialogue on options for reform in
the areas of employment from the very beginning.
186. In terms of macro-economic risks, Tunisia is still experiencing the aftermath of the
economic crisis and the level of and changes in employment opportunities will largely depend on
the business cycle. DPL I has been carefully designed to include measures that can mitigate the
crisis' impact on employment in the short and long term (e.g., the sequencing of reform
measures is mindful of the impact of the crisis).
187. Ensuring adequate institutional and technical capacity to support reform implementation
as well as ensuring cooperation between different ministries (such as MVTE and MSASTA) is a
key challenge. Moreover, ministerial personnel changes at high technical and political levels can
happen without prior notice and affect the ownership of the DPL series. The Government is
aware of this issue and this has been dealt with to some extent by augmenting the teams for
international cooperation and for statistics and by forming inter-ministerial commissions with
representatives from Ministries as well as other concerned parties. Similarly, several actions
require cross-institutional cooperation.

                                                          graduates,     and     ensured     equity     and

Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President of the World Bank Group
World Bank, Washington, D.C.


Letter of development policy


Mr. President,

Tunisia has achieved considerable success in the liberalization and modernization of the
economy, the development of human resources, the consolidation of social well-being and
progress towards the establishment of the foundations of sustainable development.

This performance was made possible by perseverance in the introduction of reforms in the
economic and social areas, guaranteeing the continuity and effectiveness of development work
and helping to improve the country's ability to meet challenges and resist external shocks.

These sustained reform efforts enabled Tunisia to achieve average GDP growth of 5.2 per cent a
year at constant prices over the last ten years. It also promoted diversification of the productive
base, with an increase in the share of the service sector, which exceeded 58 per cent of GDP in
2009, compared with 47 per cent in 1996, and the emergence of new growth sectors
characterized by their high knowledge content. In addition, the rate of job creation showed a
marked increase over this period, reducing the unemployment rate by more than two points. The
improvement in income and the decline in unemployment helped to reduce poverty and to
expand the middle class, which now accounts for 81 per cent of the population.

In 2008 and 2009, the international economic situation was marked by the fall-out from the
financial and economic crisis. In this context, and despite the difficulties encountered by certain
export sectors, the Tunisian economy developed in relatively favorable conditions. As soon as
the first signs of this crisis became apparent, the Tunisian Government was careful to take the
necessary precautions to limit its effects and contain its fall-out.

For this purpose, an action plan was launched early in 2009 to preserve the momentum of the
economy and encourage its opening to the outside world. This plan includes temporary
measures to support firms affected by the decline in external demand (assistance with staff

                                                63
training, payment facilities for customers with cash flow problems, action to promote their
exports). It also includes a program to support the integration of the Tunisian economy in the
global economy and to improve its competitiveness, with a view to reducing transaction costs,
simplifying and optimizing foreign trade procedures, improving access to financing and the
business climate and consolidating the economic and financial bases of the economy. This
program has been designed and implemented with the support and financial assistance of the
World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Union.

Thanks to the measures adopted, the momentum of growth and investment was preserved and the
financial equilibrium was protected: GDP growth was 3.1 per cent in 2009, the current balance-
of-payments deficit is only 2.5 per cent of GDP and the budget deficit is only 3 per cent. At the
same time, foreign exchange reserves grew and represented 180 days of imports at the end of
2009, and indebtedness declined from 38.8 per cent of GDP in 2008 to 38.7 per cent in 2009.

However, the labor market was under pressure mainly due to a mismatch between labor supply
and demand, despite the measures taken to mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis. A
total of 50,000 jobs were created and the unemployment rate increased by only 0.8 percentage
points thanks to the measures adopted in 2009. The unemployment rate for university graduates
continued to increase, reaching 22 per cent in 2009. Because of this situation, the acceleration of
job creation and the reduction of unemployment became a fundamental axis of the 2009-2014
Presidential Program and a priority for the Government.

In this situation, the Tunisian Government committed itself to meeting the employment
challenge, particularly by accelerating the structural transformation of the economy in order to
increase productivity and create enough skilled jobs.

In this context, the Government opted for an integrated employment strategy reflecting the
interdependencies and complementarities between factors linked to: (i) labor demand; (ii) labor
supply; and (iii) a labor market with a legal framework reflecting the new economic context and
taking into consideration new types of employment.

The employment strategy will also require better monitoring of the situation and evaluation of
key policies and trends in the labor market as well of employment policies and programs, and
better dissemination of information to the actors concerned.

Consequently, the employment program has three axes:

     i.   Facilitate employment through active labor market policies;
    ii.   Strengthen the functions essential for domestic and international mobility of the labor
          force;
   iii.   Strengthen the monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of employment data.

1) Facilitate employment through active labor market policies




                                                64
The goal of active labor market policies (ALMPs) is to facilitate successful insertion in the labor
market on a cost-effective basis. The measures envisaged to reinforce ALMPs as regards
assistance to job seekers are:

       Adoption of innovative ALMPs to allow the creation of new jobs for university graduates
       who choose to prepare a business plan instead of fulfilling the requirement of an
       internship upon graduation and who plan to start up businesses after obtaining their
       degree. Assistance to these young people in the form of support structures and funding
       should result in successful insertion in the world of work.

       Launching of a pilot project to promote community services in poor districts so as to
       improve access by low-income groups to services such as pre-schools, remedial classes
       or assisted living, through a system of conditional cash transfers. The goal is to reduce
       school failure rates in these districts, to enhance creditworthiness and thus promote the
       creation of independent activities by young graduates and to reduce unemployment
       among women with the right qualifications.

       Fundamental restructuring of the portfolio of ALMPs, bundling the 20+ programs into
       six generic ALMPs, and introducing... both for beneficiaries and employers.

       Reforms to encourage the creation of businesses specializing in job placement.

       Reorganization of the work processes of the National Agency for Employment and
       Independent Work (Agence Nationale pour l'Emploi et le Travail Indépendant ­ ANETI)
       with a focus on the long-term unemployed and the hard-to-place job seekers. This means
       offering individual-centered job seeking assistance (modern case management, remark of
       the translator) to this group, which may be subcontracted to the private sector and NGOs.

2) Strengthen the functions essential for domestic and international mobility of the labor force

The goal is to develop policies to facilitate mobility of the workforce, including legislation
allowing businesses to adapt their production factor input in case of shocks, social coverage
guaranteeing an income for laid off workers and facilitation of legal migration for the benefit of
the national economy.

The measures advocated to make the labor market more dynamic and to increase the mobility of
the working population include adapting the legal framework for employment to the
requirements of the economic context and the new types of employment and protecting the
income of workers laid off for economic reasons. They could also include a new regulatory
framework for private employment intermediation at the international level and a competency-
based national qualification framework allowing transparent recognition of qualifications and
skills. This could improve the employability of individuals and expand opportunities for
placement of Tunisians in suitable jobs abroad.

More specifically, the reform measures that we envisage are:


                                                65
       Creation of an interdepartmental commission to evaluate existing legislation and
       mechanisms and propose reforms to strengthen the ways for businesses to adapt to
       structural changes and economic shocks and improve social coverage for laid off
       workers.

       Institutional capacity-building to enable ANETI to provide international work force
       intermediation for emigrants, thus increasing the number of Tunisians with legal status
       abroad and at the same time reducing illegal immigration.

        Coordination of the implementation of the competency-based national qualification
       framework to improve the match between supply and demand on the international labor
       market.

3) Improve monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of employment data and mainstream
evidence-based management

The goal is to improve and develop employment statistics and to disseminate them with
maximum transparency, following quality criteria reflecting best international practice in this
regard.

In order to achieve this goal, a system of employment statistics will be established, involving the
public statistical agencies concerned, in order to ensure close coordination between such
agencies. The agencies involved in this system will be upgraded to improve their capacity to
produce and disseminate the necessary data on employment and the labor market. The
architecture and the basic statistical instruments of this system (concepts, nomenclatures, ...)
will be developed and upgraded in compliance with the relevant international standards.

In addition, the dissemination of employment statistics will be improved so as to facilitate access
to such data by the various categories of users and to improve the sharing of the data, with the
goal of allowing decision-makers and various stakeholders to monitor employment and
employment data on a regular basis. Procedures will be introduced to transmit the administrative
databases containing employment data to the National Statistical Institute, in order to enrich the
sourcing of employment statistics. Procedures for access to individual-level survey data
gathered by the National Statistical Institute will be formalized, so as to facilitate access by
public and private users, while respecting data confidentiality in accordance with the statistical
principles generally accepted internationally.

Action already adopted or under way to improve the availability of employment statistics:
revision of employment concepts and statistical nomenclatures to bring them into line with
international standards, introduction of quarterly household labor force surveys, updating of the
directory of businesses and of employment modules in business surveys, greater use of
employment-related administrative sources.

In order to pursue this action and attain the goals of this program (loan), the following reform
measures and actions are proposed:


                                                66
       Promulgation by the Ministry of Development and International Cooperation of an order
       establishing the official procedure for transmission of data to the National Statistical
       Institute by administrations and public agencies, for statistical purposes.

       Standardization of the nomenclature of economic activities used in nation-wide
       employment surveys and their harmonization with the United Nations and European
       Union nomenclatures.

       Creation by the National Statistical Institute of a technical committee to coordinate the
       compilation and dissemination of employment statistics among the public agencies
       concerned. The committee is drawing up a program of activities to contribute to the
       creation of a consistent system of employment statistics.

        Adoption and mainstreaming of evidence-based management to systematically improve
       the monitoring and evaluation of ALMPs.

In conclusion, the Tunisian Government believes that the program of reforms described in this
letter will enable Tunisia to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of job entry in Tunisia.
Implementation of this program would be greatly facilitated if the request for rapid disbursement
of US$50 million were to be granted by the World Bank.

                Tunisia-- Assessment Letter for the World Bank
Background

Tunisia's sound economic policies and structural reforms, underpinned by increasing trade
openness, led to higher growth in recent years and allowed it to strengthen its footing to face
the current global crisis. Tunisia enhanced its resilience with a reduction in public and external
indebtedness and a significantly improved reserves position. Nonetheless, while relatively
insulated from international financial contagion, Tunisia continues to be exposed to the
uncertainties related to economic recovery in its partner countries, particularly in Europe. The
medium-term outlook is favorable, based on the projected global economic recovery.

Tunisia is weathering the impact of the global crisis relatively well. Real GDP growth slowed
down from 4.6 percent in 2008 to 3.0 percent in 2009, reflecting mainly a fall in exports of
manufactured goods to EU countries. This drop was partially offset by buoyant growth in the
mining and energy sectors and in some services. Domestic demand was sustained by
investment and strong consumption fueled by salary increases. Inflation declined from an
average of 5 percent in 2008 to 3.7 percent in 2009, but picked up to 5.2 percent (year-on-year)
in March 2010.

The current account deficit, after widening in 2008, contracted in 2009 owing to lower import
prices and resilient tourism and remittances receipts. Despite the decline in foreign investment
inflows in 2009, reserves reached US$ 10.6 billion at end-2009 (5.4 months of imports).

The authorities promptly deployed measures to contain the impact of the global economic
slowdown, including a fiscal stimulus package of about 1.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and a more
accommodating monetary policy by the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT).

The fiscal deficit increased to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2009 (from 1.2 percent in 2008), partly as a
result of the stimulus package. However, steady economic growth allowed the public debt-to-
GDP ratio to decline further from 47.5 percent in 2008 to 47.2 percent in 2009. Revenues
dropped slightly in 2009, in line with the relative slowdown of economic activity compared to the
previous year. The increase in expenditure was contained by lower subsidies for staple foods
and petroleum products, reflecting for the most part lower world prices.

Banks were not directly affected by the global financial crisis since they rely only marginally on
external financing. The banks' soundness indicators continued to improve, but the level of non-
performing loans (NPLs) remains relatively high (15.5 percent in 2008). Growth in credit to the
economy decelerated somewhat from 14.0 percent in 2008 to 10.6 percent in 2009. The good
performance of the financial sector, combined with abundant liquidity due to an accommodative
monetary policy, contributed to a particularly buoyant stock market.
IMF Staff Assessment

The performance of the Tunisian economy was relatively strong in the context of the global
crisis, due to good fundamentals resulting from sound policies implemented over the years. The
growth outlook is favorable, but downside risks are still present--pertaining to the speed of the
recovery in Europe--and Tunisia faces challenges related to the still high level of
unemployment.

The authorities' temporary expansionary fiscal stance was appropriate to mitigate the impact of
the global crisis. The 2010 Budget Law extends the fiscal stimulus into 2010, given the still
uncertain outlook in partner countries.

Over the medium term, the authorities intend to revert to fiscal consolidation in order to maintain
the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path. A key pillar of the strategy should be the
reduction in subsidies, through the continued effective implementation of the new oil price
adjustment mechanism and improved targeting of measures to support the poorer segments of
the population. A timely reform of the pension system will be necessary to avoid an
unsustainable burden on the budget in the future.

The BCT's monetary policy stance has been appropriate, with a cautious easing in 2009 to
accommodate demand support. It should remain closely coordinated with fiscal policy, and the
BCT should consider a gradual approach in withdrawing the monetary stimulus, taking into
account potential excess liquidity and renewed inflationary pressures, as well as the risks of
deteriorating prudential indicators of the banking system. Over the medium term, the authorities
are encouraged to continue strengthening the effectiveness of monetary policy and
implementing the building blocks for the planned inflation-targeting framework.

The exchange rate remains broadly aligned with its fundamentals and the authorities' policies
are consistent with external stability. The authorities are encouraged to continue anchoring the
exchange rate policy to their medium-term objective of a freely floating exchange rate.

Prudential indicators of the banking sector continued to improve, but the level of NPLs remains
high. The authorities have implemented regulations that prevented the emergence of new
NPLs, but should make more resolute efforts to reduce the older stock in order to further
strengthen the banking system's resilience, particularly in light of the planned gradual opening
of the capital account. It will be important to monitor closely individual banks and to proceed
with plans for further enhancing the quality of bank services.

The regulatory and supervisory frameworks should continue to adapt to financial sector
developments. A more forward looking approach to banking supervision is necessary, including
in the context of the future implementation of Basel II. Comprehensive stress testing is needed
to assess better the potential vulnerabilities of the banking system and prepare appropriate
contingency plans.

The Tunisian authorities have followed a pragmatic approach to trade and financial integration.
Tunisia participates actively in the regional integration effort, and negotiations with the EU to
extend the Association Agreement to services could become a key step forward. Ongoing tax
and customs administration reforms would continue to improve the business climate and
enhance geographic diversification.
