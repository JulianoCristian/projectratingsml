{"cdata!": "The Project would finance essential\n            imports of agricultural machinery and materials, as well as\n            vehicle spare parts, to improve the production and marketing\n            of Tanzania's major export and food crops. It would\n            support the Government's Export Rehabilitation Program,\n            which consists of producer price increases, improvements to\n            the foreign exchange allocation system, preliminary steps in\n            improving parastatal efficiency and measures to promote\n            non-traditional exports. Under the project, the Government\n            would further strengthen its foreign exchange budgeting\n            system, begin to prepare its development and recurrent\n            budgets on a multi-year basis and develop an agricultural\n            policy action program aimed at increasing overall\n            productivity in the sector. The Export Rehabilitation\n            Program faces substantial risks, including the possibility\n            that additional concessional financing will not be made\n            available from other sources, resulting in the need to cut\n            imports even further and hence reducing the benefits of the\n            proposed credit. There are also likely to be delays in\n            recruiting key technical personnel needed for achieving\n            export recovery targets in 1982 and 1983."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
