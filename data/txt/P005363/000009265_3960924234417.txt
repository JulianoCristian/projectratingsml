MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:         Project Completion Note on Morocco
BNDE VI (Loan 0890-MYC)
Attached is a copy of the "Project Completion Note on Morocco - BNDE VI (Loan 0890-MYC)"
prepared by the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office.
A PCR was not prepared after project completion. Instead, the project was included later into an
OED study covering the history of the relationship between BNDE and the Bank Group during the 1970s
and beyond. Since the lessons of experience related to the 1970s are known from audits of other BNDE
projects and from the study, an audit of this project is not planned.
