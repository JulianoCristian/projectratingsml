{"cdata!": "The loan will meet part of BNDE's\n            requirements for the financing of import component of\n            specific industrial enterprises. The terms of the loan will\n            be those normally applied to Bank loans to development\n            finance companies, including the standard commitment fee.\n            Unlike the fifth Loan Agreement with the Bank, there should\n            be no specific limit on the use of Bank funds for public\n            sector projects eligible for BNDE's financing under its\n            policy statement. The proceeds of the loan should be used to\n            finance direct imports, or the equivalent of 65 percent of\n            off-the-shelf procurements, representing the import element\n            of these costs. The free limit should remain $500,000, with\n            an aggregate free limit corresponding to $6 million. The\n            maximum amount of Bank funds to be used for a single\n            investment project should be fixed at $3.5 million. The\n            definition of BNDE's borrowing basis should be amended\n            in order to exclude the part of provisions needed to cover\n            realistically estimated loss possibilities, and BNDE should\n            seek annually its auditor's opinion regarding the\n            adequacy of this estimate. Under the proposed definition,\n            BNDE's limit on term debt should be set at 6 times its\n            borrowing basis. BNDE does not place the foreign exchange\n            risk upon its borrowers. This book assesses the performance\n            of family planning programs in developing countries, looking\n            at their contributions and their costs. Attempts at\n            identifying the attributes and approaches critical to\n            effective programs are examined. This book draws on research\n            to provide not a primer on running programs but a broad\n            overview of what makes programs succeed. Focusing on family\n            planning programs and their operation, it notes but does not\n            elaborate on the contributions that other social development\n            interventions make to an ongoing reproductive revolution,\n            which is gradually transforming demographic prospects and\n            individual lives. The reproductive revolution is evident in\n            the transitions to lower fertility that are occurring in all\n            developing regions: over two decades the average number of\n            children per woman has fallen by a third. As fertility\n            falls, so do infant, child and maternal mortality. Women\n            spend decreasing proportions of their lifetimes giving birth\n            and caring for young children. Despite progress, fertility\n            is still high overall, and real reproductive choice is often\n            an illusion. The developing countries produce most of the 90\n            million people added to world population every year -- the\n            largest increases in human history. Maternal mortality in\n            developing countries is ten times as high as in industrial\n            countries, Not surprisingly, a quarter of married women\n            express some unmet need for contraception."}, "docdt": "1973-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
