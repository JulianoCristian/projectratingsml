APPRAISAL OF
BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
SUMMARY
i.         This report appraises BNDE for a sixth Bank loan; it updates the
situation and prospects of BNDE described in Report R 71-97 of May 6, 1971.
The fifth Bank Loan was fully committed as of December 1972.
ii.        Morocco's economic performance stagnated in 1971 and 1972, partly
as a result of two abortive coups d'etat, in July 1971 and August 1972. The
level of fixed investment in manufacturing and mining, which boomed in 1970,
was not sustained in 1971 and 1972.
iii.       But investors' confidence is returning.  The 1973-1977 Development
Plan should be ready this summer, likely with more emphasis on industrializa-
tion. Simultaneously new financial incentives for investments are being
worked out. These factors should hike private investment decisions.
iv.        The present investment incentives system has favored capital-intensive
investments and put little emphasis on exports and employment creation. The new
investment incentive policy, to be implemented this summer, aims at rectifying
these bias. The Government advised the Bank that no interest rebate will be
granted to BNDE's borrowers before eligibility criteria have been established,
probably not before the end of 1973.
v.         BNDE continues as the paramount source of term financing for in-
dustry in Morocco. During a good part of 1972, BNDE's managerial control
weakened and the company experienced organizational difficulties. Symptoms
were a deterioration in BNDE's financial administration and in the quality
of BNDE appraisal work. BNDE's management has recently taken satisfactory
steps to improve the situation and some improvements can already be noticed;
these efforts should soon come to full fruition, given the stock of expe-
rienced personnel in BNDE.
vi.        As part of the improvement underway, BNDE is building up its
capabilities to monitor the economic impact of its projects. Much more has
to be done in this respect, and BNDE agreed, to start with, to calculate
economic rate of returns for projects attracting loans over DH 5 million.
The project coverage of this technique will be broadened successively.
vii.       In December 1972, Mr. Mustapha Faris, former Minister of Finance,
was appointed BNDE's President and General Manager. Mr. Faris is well re-
garded in the Bank, but he still has to make his mark on BNDE.
viii.      BNDE's approvals of business, after a 150% increase in 1970 over
1969, declined by 33% in 1971, and a further slight decrease occurred in
1972. This decline is due to the precarious political situation.



- ii -
ix.        BNDE's financial position is satisfactory, and its profitability
continues to improve. BNDE's long term portfolio is diversified and of good
quality. Arrears are at a manageable level, and reserves exceed by a con-
siderable margin realistic estimates of possible losses. However, as such
loss risks have increased, BNDE's provision policy needs to be reviewed to
take this development into account.
x.         BNDE's future business will undoubtedly be affected by the evolu-
tion of Morocco's general situation. If no further destabilizing events
occur, it seems reasonable to expect that entrepreneurs' investments deci-
sions will not drop in 1973, and that actual investments will grow about 7%
in 1974 and thereafter. BNDE's operations are expected to follow this pat-
tern and the volume of its direct operations in 1973, based on a substantial
pipeline of projects, is estimated to grow about 15% over the low 1972 level.
With direct loans for imports likely to remain BNDE's major activity, BNDE
has projected its future commitments for the period 1973-74 at about $66
million, including $56 million to finance imports.
xi.        BNDE is now in a better position to tap domestic and foreign capi-
tal, since its lending rate was raised to 9%. First inroads were made in
1971 and 1972, and further foreign and domestic capital is in sight. BNDE
should pursue actively its search for term capital on the international
market.  BNDE's management informed the Bank of its intention to have an
international borrowing program ready by the end of 1973. It is not ex-
pected, however, that such commercial borrowings will materialize before
the end of 1974. Taking prospective resources into account, BNDE is still
faced with a resource gap of about $28 million for 1973-1974. It has turned
to the Bank to meet this gap.
xii.       Despite the needs for improvements in its organization and in the
quality of its output, BNDE remains a suitable and creditworthy borrower for
another Bank loan. However, these weaknesses call for a shorter period than
the usual one for which Bank loans meet development finance companies' re-
source needs. Consequently, a loan in the amount of $24 million is recom-
mended, which should help cover BNDE's prospective resource gap through the
sumner of 1974,
xiii.      The terms of the proposed loan should be those normally applied
to Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard com-
mitment fee. There would be no specific limit on the use of Bank funds for
public sector projects eligible for BNDE's financing under its policy state-
me.nt. The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance direct imports, plus
tnie equivalent of 65% of off-the-shelf procurements, representing the esti-
mated import element of these costs. The free limit for investment projects
would remain at $500,000, with an aggregate free limit corresponding to $6
million. A maximum amount of Bank funds to be used for a single investment
project (private or public) would be established at $3.5 million. The defini-
tion of BNDE's borrowing basis would be amended in order to exclude the part
of the General Loan Reserve needed to cover realistically estimated loss pos-
sibilities. Under the proposed definition, BNDE's limit of term debt should
be set at 6 times its borrowing basis.

BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE), estab-
lished in 1959, has received five loans from the World Bank, totalling $97.5
million.  In 1962, IFC became a shareholder.  The most recent loan from the
Bank, signed on May 20, 1971, was fully authorized against sub-projects in
December 1972 and BNDE needs fresh resources. This. report appraises BNDE
for a sixth Bank loan, and focuses on developments since the previous Bank
loan was made.
II. BNDE'S ENVIRONMENT
Economic Performance of Morocco
2.01      The economic situation in Morocco was reviewed in "Memorandum on
Current Economic Position and Prospects of Morocco" (EMA-42), distributed to
the Executive Directors in September 1971. In 1971, gross domestic product
increased by 5% in real terms, a slightly lower rate than in the preceding
three years. An increase of 6% in agricultural production compensated for a
slowdown in industrial production growth (4.1% as compared with 8% in 1970).
2.02      The composition of GDP by sectors has not changed significantly.
Agriculture, accounting for about 28%, is still the most important sector,
followed by commerce with about 20%. Industry and handicraft account for
12.5%. Mining accounts for only 4.5% and is declining. Exports of manu-
factured products (non food) have increased regularly, totaling about $85
million in 1971, more than double the 1967 level. Tourism, the largest
single foreign currency earner, increased by 11% in 1971.
2.03      After a 19% increase in 1970, gross fixed capital formation remained
at almost the same volume in 1971 (DH 2.7 billion) and, as a percentage of GNP,
decreased from 15% to 14%. Preliminary information suggests that the decrease
continued in 1972, and that gross fixed capital formation declined to 13% of
GNP in that year.
2.04      Tentative estimates have been made on fixed investments in
manufacturing and mining which show these investments evolving from DH 520
million in 1967 to DH 780 million in 1970. (During the same period, BNDE's
disbursements evolved from DH 50 million to DH 62 million). Preliminary
information suggests that this level of investment was not sustained in both
1971 and 1972.



- 2 -
2.05       Approvals by the Investment Commission of private industrial in-
vestment proposals (Aanex 1) oscillated between DH 135 million and DH 180
million per year during the period 1965-1969. In 1970 they reached about
DH 300 million and in 1971 declined to DR 254 million. After a sharp de-
cline in the second half of 1971, approvals picked up in 1972, and reached
Di 310 million. It seems that, despite two abortive coups d'etat in July 1971
and August 1972, the Moroccan business community is bent on investing in indus-
try. As a corollary, loan applications received by BNDE in the first two and
half months of 1973 involve potential investments in excess of DR 500 million.
2.06       Final data for 1972 are not yet available but GNP is estimated to
have grown by 3% to 4%. The Third Development Plan (1968/72) has ended, and
the fourth one (1973/77) is still under preparation in Morocco but likely to
have greater emphasis on industrialization and an increasing role of the
public sector. The new Development Plan will identify a number of projects
to be undertaken by private sponsors, for which financial investment incen-
tives will be available. Therefore, publication of the Plan will have an
impact, not only on public projects decisions, but also on private ones.
2.07       Improvements, particularly in industrial exports, will remain neces-
sary although the current account in the balance of payments is temporarily
satisfactory, due to low imports of capital goods connected with the stagna-
tion of investments. Morocco may still need to rely on capital inflows, in-
cluding foreign assistance provided on concessionary terms, to sustain an
annual economic growth of at least 5%.
Investment Policies and Incentives
2.08       Future industrial  investments are likely to be influenced by poli-
cies which are in their final stages of preparation in Morocco. The thrust
of Moroccan industrial policies and related financial incentive measures
have been the subject of discussions between the Moroccans and the Bank Group
for several years. These talks brought out that there could be advantageous
changes in the incentive system which so far had favored capital-intensive
investments, and had put little emphasis on promoting industrial exports and
employment creation. Also the granting of incentives had been determined on
ad-hoc basis and without clearly being guided by well defined policy criteria.
2.09       During negotiations for the proposed loan, the Government representa-
tives advised the Bank that new investment incentive policies for industry are
being prepared and there is hope that they would be ready this summer.
Three principal features are contemplated:
(i) The investment grant - a one-time Government contribution
to a project's investment cost - and any other grants, will
be abolished and replaced by income tax exemptions which
are neutral vis-a-vis labor intensive or capital intensive
investments; some incentives favoring capital intensive in-
vestments may be retained (accelerated depreciation, customs
exemption on equipment) but are likely to be less important
than hitherto;



(ii) Incentives will be defined selectively according to five
broad sectors (manufacturing in general, manufacturing for
exports, mining, tourism, and shipping-fishing), geographical
regions, and importance of projects, thus replacing the pos-
sibility of granting all available incentives to investments
in all sectors, as presently practised; there will presumably
be greater incentives for manufacturing for export than for
manufacturing in general;
(iii)  Each incentive will be granted automatically to any investor
meeting predetermined criteria within the broad framework
described under (ii). Investors should thus be in a posi-
tion to know their chances of getting certain advantages and
take their investment decisions accordingly.
These features embody Bank advice for a better industrial policy and the
dialogue on further progress is expected to continue. The Bank has agreed
on measures with BNDE to help BNDE in its project selection through an im-
proved monitoring system of project's economic merits.
Financial Environment
2.10       Morocco has 18 commercial banks and five specialized financial in-
stitutions, including BNDE. As of December 31, 1972, demand deposits with
commercial banks stood at about DH3.69 billion, a 20% increase over the
December 1971 figure. Total deposits in 1972 grew by about 20% over those
in 1971, to a level of DH4.5 billion. At the end of 1972, total outstanding
loans by the banking sector stood at DH3.55 billion, after a growth of 9%
during the year. Total outstanding medium and long-term loans were DH650
million in 1970 and DH850 million in 1971 1V. BNDE's share of these term loans
is about one third, reflecting its key position in the economy.
2.11       BNDE's key position derives from its being the only financial
institution authorized to provide the manufacturing sector with contractual
long-term financing (with duration over 5 years). In addition, BNDE plays
a major role in the distribution of medium-term loans by commercial banks
to the manufacturing sector. Initially extended by commercial banks at
their own risk, these loans can be presented to the Central Bank (Banque
du Maroc) for rediscount, if appraised and approved by BNDE. Banque du
Maroc currently estimates that about 75% of total medium term loans extended
by commercial banks to the manufacturing sector are medium-term rediscountable
loans. BNDE's role in these operations is limited to giving the Banque du
Maroc technical advice; no BNDE financing is involved. The loans have terms

bank loans registered as short-term are in fact medium term, as the
banks extend roll-over facilities.



-4-
up to 5 years and bear a minimum interest of 6.5% for the final borrower.
Banque du Maroc's rediscount rate is 3.5/8% and BNDE's commission is 0.75%.
The commercial banks bear the primary risk of default of the final borrower,
with BNDE guaranteeing only against the risk that commercial banks may default
vis-a-vis the Banque du Maroc. Since the possibility of such defaults is re-
mote, BNDE bears practically no risk. These operations do not appear in BNDE's
balance sheets, but contribute to its earnings.
2.12       The medium term rediscountable procedure enables BNDE to determine
appropriate terms for the needs of a borrower, and thus to propose its help
to clients who would not otherwise have become long term borrowers. BNDE
appraises medium term rediscountable loans in the same way as its own direct
loans. In the Banque du Maroc's opinion, BNDE is the only entity in Morocco
equipped to satisfactorily appraise industrial medium term loans.
Relations with the Government
2.13       BNDE is, in the Government's view, the country's appointed instrument
to provide long-term finance to private industry and other private productive
activities. The Government is a direct source of funds for BNDE, as well as
a guarantor of BNDE's foreign borrowing. The Government subsidy on BNDE's
borrowing costs (see para 4.28), although discontinued since BNDE's lending
rate has been raised to 9%, still has and will have for some years a size-
able impact on BNDE's profitability. The Government nominates nearly one-
half of BNDE's Board members and BNDE's President and Director General, and
has a special representative in the Board (Commissaire du Gouvernement). The
Government's influence on BNDE's policy direction is substantial. However,
BNDE has succeeded in maintaining a reasonable degree of autonomy in its fi-
nancing decisions.
III.  THE COMPANY - POLICIES, ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES
Policies
3,01       Annex 2 contains BNDE's Policy Statement.  Since the fifth Bank
Loan was made one change was occasioned by the fact that, as of December 31,
1971, BNDE's aggregate equity investments had reached DII 38 million (net of
provision) about the same amount as its net worth at that date. Therefore,
int June 1972 BNDE's Board adopted a resolution, following consultation with
the Bank, limiting BNDE's aggregate equity investments to the total of its
net worth plus the part of the General Loan Reserve not needed to cover
real loss possibilities, and the amount of the Government's subordinated
loans falling due after 15 years at any given time. As of December 31,
1972, this limit would have been DH 61 million.



-5-
Shareholders and Board
3.02      BNDE's ownership, after the share capital increase which took
place at the end of 1972 (para 4.03), is shown in Annex 3. This share in-
crease includes, for the first time, a greater number of private Moroccan
parties. The Board (Annex 4) meets about four times a year, sets BNDE's
policy and approves all loans. It has delegated to an Executive Committee
the power to review all proposed operations and to approve loans up to DH 4
million. BNDE's Board members - with the exception of the IFC representative -
have a tendency to rely on BNDE's management's judgements.
Management Organization and Staff
3.03       On December 18, 1972, Mr. Mustapha Faris, former Finance Minister,
replaced Mr. Bargach as President and General Manager of BNDE. His nomina-
tion was made by the Government pursuant to an arrangement in effect since
1966 and agreeable to the Bank Group. Mr. Faris is well regarded in the
Bank but it is too early to pass a judgment on the effect his appointment
may have on BNDE. Some shortcomings in BNDE's internal organization, namely
lack of coordination, overlapping and scattering of responsibilities, became
accentuated about a year ago, and resulted over most of the year in a serious
deterioration in the quality of BNDE's output. Apart from this feature,
BNDE's financial administration also suffered, as this responsibility was
scattered between several units. One of Mr. Bargach's contributions to BNDE
was the recent reorganization of the institution to overcome these shortcom-
ings.
3.04       The reorganization was approved by BNDE's Board in its broad lines
on September 11, 1972 (Annex 5), and its main features are:
(a) BNDE's activities are split in two groups with clearly defined
tasks. The first one includes legal and administrative matters,
financial management and promotion. The second one is in charge
of all project work, that is appraisal, follow-up, economic
studies and equity portfolio.
(b) Each group is headed by a Deputy General Manager. These two
Deputy General Managers are to work in close relation with the
General Manager through a "Coordination Committee."
Mr. Sefrioui, Deputy General Manager since early 1970, heads the first Group,
and Mr. IIansouri, Deputy General Manager since June 1972, heads the other.
This scheme removes the overlap of responsibilities which were the origin of
many shortcomings. Responsibilities are now clearly defined, and this struc-
ture should permit an efficient delegation of responsibilities. Although this
change is very recent, some improvements are already noticed in the quality
of BNDE's follow-up work and financial administration. BNDE has already



-6-
responded to some suggestions to improve the quality of appraisal, which
should benefit from this new set-up. There is no indication that Mr. Faris
plans to change BNDE's present organization.
3.05       BNDE's staff of 105 includes 50 professionals, as compared with
43 in 1970. BNDE has competent and experienced officers, but a number
of of its staff are new, and need to build their professional experience.
The quality and dedication of a good part of its staff are the grounds for
the expectation that BNDE will regain its earlier strength and improve the
quality of its output.
Appraisals
3.06       Since the end of 1971, the quality of BNDE's appraisal reports,
which had been reasonably good before, began to decline. There were indica-
tions of an overall deterioration in the quality of BNDE's work. BNDE was
still good at collecting information; however, the more difficult and impor-
tant task of submitting the information to a critical scrutiny in order to
derive operational conclusions became neglected. The decline in the quality
of appraisals derived from the weakening of BNDE's internal organization, and
particularly from the fact that no senior officer was clearly in charge of
coordination and quality control of BNDE's output. Recently, BNDE's manage-
ment took steps to help solve these problems (see para 3.04). With the new
organization, and due to the overall good quality of its staff, BNDE should
be able before long to do a much better job; this improvement needs to en-
compass, as explained in para. 4.19, the assessment of the economic merits
of the projects.
3.07       Procurement.  BNDE has not, as a rule, required competitive biddings,
or even international shopping, i.e. several offers for its projects. BNDE's
engineering section, while adequately dealing with the technical aspects of
BNDE's financed projects, does not pay adequate attention to the choices
available to projects, concerning the capital cost of equipment. During
negotiations, BNDE agreed that its appraisal reports will include a review
of the procurement aspects of the projects, together with BNDE's judgement
that the equipment is reasonably priced, and the basis for such judgment.
3.08       For some important projects, BNDE's involvement came at a stage
where the equipment had already been chosen, orders given to foreign suppliers,
and sometimes partially paid, before BNDE has had the chance, through its
technical review, to help shape the project. During loan negotiations, BNDE
gave assurances that it will try to avoid to get involved into projects at a
late stage. In some cases when this is impossible, BNDE will exercise special
care in its appraisals, especially as regards procurement aspects.
Project Supervision
3.09       While the technical supervision of projects under construction is
handled satisfactorily, follow-up after implementation needs strengthening
both as regards the number of clients visited and the substance of the work



-7-
done.  Furthermore, there was almost no feed-back of results to the appraisal
staff. The new internal organization gives more weight to the follow-up ac-
tivity, and involves more competent staff to carry out the job. In fact,
appraisal officers are supposed to work with the follow-up unit. A sample
of very recent follow-up reports prepared after the reorganization shows
better quality than earlier ones. BNDE seems now aware of the importance
of both the information gathering and, through end-ase, the feedback to the
appraisal team. During negotiations, BNDE agreed that its project appraisals
will contain, as background information, evidence of findings gathered through
BNDE's follow-up.
3.10       Disbursements.  BNDE disburses the proceeds of its loans pari-passu
with other sources of funds, and checks that every disbursement is justified
by progresses in the implementation of the project. This practice is satis-
factory.
IV. RESOURCES, OPERATIONS, PORTFOLIO AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Resources
4.01       From its inception up to 1970, BNDE relied mainly on the Government
and the Bank for its resources.  As of December 31, 1972, 61% of its outstand-
ing resources were Bank funds. In 1970, for the first time, BNDE tapped new
sources of funds.
4.02        Local Currency.  Except for two small bond issues in 1961 and 1963,
for only DI 9 million, BNDE until recently has relied for its local currency
resources on its own net worth (DH 52 million at the end of 1972) and on
three Government loans totalling DH 40 million. BNDE's access to the capital
market is subject to Government approval, which is conditioned by the Govern-
ment's forecast of its own borrowing needs and those of the Electricity Au-
thority and Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (C.I.IH.). In 1971, following
understandings reached with the Bank, the Government authorized BNDE to
float two bond issues for a total of DH 20 million. In May 1972, and
January 1973, two other DH 20 million issues were made. Guaranteed by
the Government and subject to income tax, these issues have a 15-year term
and carry an interest rate of 6.25%. In the past, BNDE bonds were bought
only by banks and insurance companies. The 1973 issue was subscribed by
individual investors. BNDE plans to float another DH 20 million bond issue
in June 1973 and has already the Government's authorization for doing so.
BNDE has additional resources in the form of three, six and nine-month
bonds that BNDE issued in 1961, which have been renewed each year with the
approval of the Ministry of Finance without any problems thus far. De facto,
they represent long term resources. 1/
1/    These bonds, covered by a Government guarantee, are held by insurance
companies only and bear interest rates between 3.43% and 3.63%. They
stand at the stable level of DII 10 million and are included in BNDE's
statement of resources.



4.03       In December 1972, BNDE increased its share capital by 62% from DR
20 million to DH 32.4 million. The main features of this operation were:
(a) BNDE paid its existing shareholders a stock dividend of
12% of the existing share capital before increase.
(b)  A right issue of DH 10 million was declared.  IFC and
foreign investors (including banks established in Morocco
but foreign controlled) fully waived their rights. Gov-
ernment and Moroccan public institutions waived 40% of
their rights.
(c)  The rights waived were sold for 26% to three new foreign
banks (Bank of Tokyo, Long Term Credit Bank, Kuwait
Investment Fund) and the rest was sold to new private
MSoroccan investors, including many individuals.
The placement of BNDE's shares with Moroccan individuals meets one of the
basic objectives of the Bank Group, held ever since its association with BNDE
in 1962. This share issue, and the 1973 bond issue, were heavily oversubscribed
in the Moroccan market. This gives some indication that there is, at present,
a market for BNDE's bonds and shares in Morocco. As a result, BNDE plans to
have its shares listed on the Stock Market sometime in 1973.
4.04       Foreign Sources.  For foreign resources, BNDE has until recently
relied primarily on the Bank, which has loaned it nearly $100 million. Until
1970, the only other foreign loan was from USAID $3 million, the bulk of which
BNDE cancelled due to disbursement difficulties. But with improved income
prospects resulting from a recent increase to 9% in its lending rate, BNDE
is now in a better position to tap foreign sources of capital. In 1971, it
secured a loan from the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) for Dli 46 million 1/,
Furthermore, in January 1972, BNDE signed with the Kuwait Development Fund a
loan of DH 12 million, for the financing of a large sugar-refining project
(SUCRAFOR) which is also financed by the Bank through BNDE. In addition to
Bank funds, BNDE's foreign borrowings, already obtained and under negotia-
tion, total about $30 million 2/. Thus BNDE is making progress in broaden-
ing its resource base. But a delay in covering the foreign exchange risk
1f    The loan is for 7 years, at a rate of 7%, and is guaranteed by the
Government. Proceeds are tied to French procurement.
2/    BNDE is negotiating another DH 12 million loan from the Kuwait Fund
and has negotiated further DH 50 million, medium term, tied loan, with
a French bank.



-9-
for BNDE's borrowings other than Bank loans 1/ has resulted in accelerated
commitments of Bank funds.
4.05       However, the new resources obtained by BNDE do not have the sane
usability as Bank or Government funds.  The French lines of credit are medium-
term, tied to French procurement (which, anyhow, was in the past the source
of 50% of BNDE's financed procurement). The Kuwaiti loan is linked to a
specific project. Thus far BNDE has not been successful in seeking long-
term, untied funds. Such potential sources have either floating interest
rates, tied to the Euro-dollar rate, or a fixed interest rate substantially
higher than BNDE's cost of its present resources. Since BNDE cannot pass
onto its borrowers the floating interest rate, BNDE fears that such resources
would be too risky. While BNDE did not receive any offer, it considers re-
sources at a fixed interest rate in the neighborhood of 9% as too expensive.
Given its prospects of profitability, however, BNDE could well afford to pay
on some limited amounts a rate as high as approximately its own lending rate,
considering this as a price to pay in order to enter the international capi-
tal market for the first time. During negotiations, BNDE's management in-
formed the Bank of their intention to explore the possibilities of tapping
the international capital market. BNDE plans to have an international bor-
rowing program ready by the end of 1973, apart from the resources already
in sight. However, it would be overoptimistic to assume that these new
possibilities could materialize before some time in 1974.
Resource Position
4.06       BNDE's total long-term resources, net of repayments, totaled DH 536
million on December 31, 1972 (Annex 6); net commitments amounted to DR 463
million, leaving DH 73 million available for further commitment, including
about DH 51 million equivalent in foreign exchange (BNP and USAID loans).
Loan 736-MOR was fully authorized for withdrawal against sub-projects in
December 1972 and there will be a gap in the authorization of Bank funds unti.
the proposed Bank loan is made. This is not detrimental to BNDE because:
i) substantial amounts were uncommitted at end of 1972, mainly from its French
loan, and ii) equipment imports can be financed with local resources. In
addition, BNDE has floated a new bond issue (para. 4.02) in January 1973.
Characteristics of Operations
4.07       BNDE is active in three major fields:  direct loans, equity invest-
ments and rediscountable medium-term loans. (The latter was discussed in
para 2.11). The direct operations have the following main characteristics.
1/    ]3NDE is covered against the foreign exchange risk on all its foreign
borrowings including Bank loans, after approval of the contract by the
Ministry of France. BNDE has to bear -- and will benefit from -- changes
at each time a repayment has to be made not exceeding 1.5% in the Dirham's
official parity at the time of the disbursements.



- 10 -
4.08       Volume.  From BNDE's inception in 1959 to December 31, 1972, BNDE
approved 428 direct loans and equity operations for a total of DH 809 million
(US$192 million equivalent). An analysis of BNDE's operations is given in
Annex 7. BNDE is primarily a lender and now has about 180 borrowers, about
20% of them repeat customers. Total equity participations approved since
BNDE's inception represent only 5.8% of direct operations. During 1967-69,
BNDE's annual approvals of direct operations hovered around DH 60 million.
In 1970, they reached the record level of DH 167 million, boosted by the
good investment climate prevailing at that time and by a few very large
projects. In 1971 they decreased to around DH 130 million, with one large
project representing as much as 32% of the year approvals. 1972 approvals
are only DH 97 million 1/. Its level of business having developed fairly
rapidly, BNDE did not need to actively promote new business. As BNDE has a
monopoly in long-term financing for industry, its level of approvals quite
representatively reflects, with some time lag, the level of investment deci-
sions in Morocco; therefore the fluctuation in BNDE's business is not due to
BNDE's attitude, but is a direct reflection of Morocco's economic and political
situation.
4.09       Equity Investments.  In the late sixties, BNDE made equity invest-
ments of only Dli 2 million, partly due to its own reluctance and to the scarci-
ty of good opportunities. The Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI) 2/
has further reduced BNDE's investment opportunities by its purchasing, to-
gethier with the Government, freshly floated shares of existing enterprises.
To help broaden BNDE's role, the Government agreed during negotiations for
the fifth Bank loan that BNDE would hsrave freedom to seek out share invest-
ment opportunities, and the Bank encouraged BNDE to do so. In 1971 and 1972,
BNDE made 14 equity investments for D- 26.8 million.
4.10       Two of BNDE's larger equity investments in 1971 were on account of
a Government policy, which aims at Moroccan-zation of foreign controlled
enterprises b; -thieving 50% Moroccan ownership. At the occasion of new
investments bJ coziipanies which the Government wishes to have 'Moroccanized,
new shares are issued and offered to Morrocan institutions and private in-
vestors. The investments so far made by BNDE were attractive because the
shares were bought at par, while the companies had substantial reserves.
BNDE intends to keep for some years the shares acquired through Moroccaniza-
tion to improve the yield of its equity portfolio and to compensate for some
of its bad investments made earlier. Eventually, however, BNDE will sell to

private Moroccan buyers with as wide a distribution as possible and as quickly
*as practicable, its participations acquired through I-Ioroccanization in order
to broaden share owmership in the country and to revolve its own resources.
This is a stated objective of BNDE.
4.11       Size and terms of Loans.  Through 1969, the size of direct loans
approved by BNDE averaged DH 1.9 million. The large projects approved in
1970 increased the average to DH 4.2 million. The next year, the average
was DII 2.6 million. For 1972, the average size is DI! 2.7 million. Loans
under DH 5 million represent 54% of amounts approved since bNDE's inception.
The average size may seem hiigh in comparison with the size of Morocco's in-
dustry. but it should be remembered that the small industrial units have
also recourse to other sources such as leasing facilities (para 4.16) and
medium-tern loans. BNDE's loans to industry have terms of 5 to 12 years
and up to 15 years in the case of hotel loans, a field which, as far as Bank
financing is concerned, has been taken over entirely by CIH. The weighted
average duration of BNDE's outstanding loans is 7.5 years, including 1.5 year
of grace.
4.12       Interest Rate.  BNDE's interest rate was first increased from 7,
to 8% in July 1971 and then to 9% on January 1, 1972.  BNDE's borrowers can,
since January 1972, benefit selectively from an interest rate rebate of 2
percentage points.  To date, however, no rebate has in fact been granted.
The Government advised the Bank that there will be no such rebate until a
basis for borrowers' eligibility has been established, probably not before
the end of 1973. The Bank's views on the subject are being sought, and the
subject will be further discussed with the Government during the course of
this year. Broadly, the Ploroccan authorities are aware of the Bank's views
that selectively granted rebates should be in harmony with the eligibility
criteria for other financial incentives benefitting industrial investors.
4.13       Sectors and Purpose.  The sectoral pattern of BNDE's approvals
(including medium-term rediscountable loans) has remained unchanged in the
past two years. Textiles and food processing still account for roughly 34%
of BNDE's approvals, while mining and petroleum industries account for 26%.
Given BNDE's monopoly of long-term lending to industry, BNDE supports all
industrial sectors and its lending operations follow approximately the sec-
toral breakdown of private industry in Ilorocco. About half of the amount
of BNDE's approvals have been directed toward expansion and modernization
programs. This appears a reasonable split since, after ten years of indus-
trial investment in Morocco, BNDE is now receiving more and more requests
for repeat financing.
4.14       Project Sponsors.  Because of BNDE's policy limitations on direct
financing of Government enterprises, 85% of BNDE's client enterprises (for
the direct operations) are privately owned. In the last two years, 85% of
the projects approved (in number) were predominantly Moroccan owned, re-
flecting the existence of an active community of Moroccan entrepreneurs.
An attractive developmental feature is that the new projects approved by
BNDE are overwhelmingly sponsored by Moroccans.  BNDE does not discriminate
as between national and foreign clients.



_ 12 -
4.15        Import Component.  As in the past, about 90% of BNDE's commitments
continue to be directed toward financing imported equipment. The import
component of the total cost of projects financed by BNDE has been about 45%
during the last three years, and did not show any significant trend toward
a reduction.
4.16       Maroc Leasing.  An important feature of BNDE's financing is its sup-
port of Maroc Leasing, which was established in 1965 under the sponsorship of
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas and BNDE, owning 43% and 26% respectively
of Maroc Leasing's share capital at the end of 1971. Maroc Leasing leases
equipment to small and medium-size firms with purchase options at the end
of the lease period. Maroc Leasing has so far relied heavily on BNDE for
its resources. As of December 31, 1972, BNDE had outstanding loans 1/ to
Maroc Leasing of DH 22.7 million, i.e., 45% of ]Aaroc Leasing's resources,
the remainder being equity. Maroc Leasing's business has been growing fast
from 1966 (DI 8 million annual leases) to 1970 (DU 24 million annual leases).
Business reached only DlI 17 million in 1971, in line with the general economic
recession after the abortive coup in July of that year. During the first 6
months of 1972, only DH 7.5 million leases were signed, reflectinig the con-
tinuing effect of the political situation. Maroc Leasing's operations are
profitable (10-12% on share capital in the past years) and are directed main-
ly towards contracting firms (33% of outstanding leases), textiles (19%), and
food processing firms (16%).  Maroc Leasing's finance of industry complements
that offered by BNDE. Its focus is different from BNDE's in that it typically
finances individual pieces of machinery rather than whole projects. Both
large and small companies use Maroc Leasing financing. The size of individual
contracts seldom exceeds DH 700,000; in the first four months of 1972 the
average size of lease contracts was of about DII 440,000, slightly less than
that of previous years. Mlaroc Leasing is performing a useful function in
making credit available quickly for small plant expansions.
Imapact of BNDE's Operations
4.17       The importance of BNDE for the financing of the industrial sector
in 'Sorocco is evidenced by the fact that BNDE is financing more than 75%O of
thla industrial projects approved 2/ by the Investrment Coxrxission (see Annex
8) and its direct financing typically accounts for 40% of thc total cost of
projects it finances. (Considering all of BNDE's operations, including
iiedlium-term rediscountable loans, BNIDE's involvement represents 30% of total
cost of projects.)

4.18       The following features of BNDE projects, financed and reviewed by
the Bank in the past two years (Annex 9), provide some indications of the
economic impact of BNDE's operations.
(a) Exports. Manufacturing exports are relatively recent for
Moroccan industrial enterprises, because for most of industry's
existence, the enterprises have been aiming mainly at import
substitution. In view of the opportunities opened by Morocco's
1969 association with the EEC, and because of the limited domes-
tic market, Moroccan industries have begun to explore more ac-
tively export possibilities. Of the 22 manufacturing projects
financed under the fourth Bank Loan (660-MOR), five were expected
to export more than 50% of their production. Of the 45 manu-
facturing projects authorized under the fifth Bank Loan (736-
MOR), six are expected to export more than 50% of their pro-
duction and five others between 10% and 50%. Nearly all the
exporting companies are in food processing, although some tex-
tile firms also export. However, these figures are based only
on appraisal data. In the future, BNDE's follow-up reports
should include an assessment of the actual exports of its clients.
(b)  Employment.  BNDE's projects financed by the fifth Bank Loan show
an average cost per job ranging from about $9,000 (for those with
total investments of less than $1.5 million) to about $17,000 (for
those with total investments up to $3 million). The latter exclude
the highly capital intensive oil refineries and sugar projects.
There is no evidence that the decisions made by BNDE unduly
favored capital intensive projects. However, as said earlier,
the incentive system favored capital intensive projects in
rSorocco. The new system, if implemented according to stated
intentions, should help alleviate this bias.
(c) Effective Rate of Protection. During loan negotiations in 1971,
BNDE expressed its intention to make effective rate of protection
calculations on its projects; it has been doing so for about one
year and a half. However, BNDE experienced at first difficulties
in gathering the necessary data and not all of its projects have
been subjected to this test. The actual effective rate of protec-
tion calculations were made on some 20 projects, including all
projects sent to the Bank for approval and a good number of those
below the free limit. The effective protection, on this sample,
ranges from zero to 100%. Projects enjoying the highest protec-
tion are metal products and paper, those enjoying the lowest are
in food processing. Projects in the important textile industry,
in which some enterprises are making inroads into exports, seem
to enjoy 50% to 70% effective protection. These figures are
often inflated by high projected profits. With an assumed lower
but still attractive 15% return, effective rate of protection
decreases by 20-30%. The available sample is still too limited
to draw general conclusions. BNDE will continue calculating the
effective rate of protection of its projects.



- 14 -
4.19       To improve the measure of the economic merits of BNDEts projects,
it was agreed during negotiations that BNDE will calculate the effective rate
of protection and the financial rate of return, with and without the incen-
tives granted by the Government, including the 2% interest rebate. In addi-
tion, BNDE undertook during negotiations to calculate the economic rate of
return of at least those projects which request BNDE's financing in excess of
DH 5 million, likely about 25 to 30% of BNDE's projects. This exercise will be
carried out during the commitment period of the proposed Loan. It is ex-
pected that, after this trial period, economic rate of return calculations
will become a standard feature of BNDE's appraisal technique.
Evaluation of Loan and Equity Portfolio
4.20       Loan Portfolio.  On December 31, 1972, BNDE had loans totalling
DH 334 million outstanding in some 180 companies.  91% of the portfolio is
in companies that are now in operation, the remaining in companies still
under construction. On December 31, 1972, total principal in arrears was
DH 8.4 million. There were 35 companies in arrears of over three months
(Dl 6.2 million in principal and DH 2.3 million in interest). Portfolio
affected by principal arrears over three months was DH 18 million, e.g. 5%
of total portfolio. This represents an increase over the past three years,
but BNDE's arrears remain at a manageable level.
4.21       Fourty-six percent of BNDE's arrears are in the textile sector.
Morocco's textile industry went through a difficult period a few years ago,
and it is now recovering. The share of textiles in BNDE's portfolio, which
was 35% in 1967, decreased to 15% in 1972. The higher purchasing power
resulting from good harvests in the last three years and the emerging textile
export possibilities, should continue to improve this sector's performance.
Nevertheless, BNDE's textile portfolio requires special attention by BNDE's
management, and frequent reviews of its exposure in this sector should be made
by BNDE's Control Department. None of the loans guaranteed by the Government,
mainly loans to public sector industries, are in arrears. Provisions 1/ (Gen-
eral Loan Reserve) are at about the level of outstanding loans in arrears of
over three months and are more than sufficient to cover real risks. Further-
more, BNDE has good security on each of the loans in arrears. Overall, BNDE's
loan portfolio is sound and well protected.
4.22       Equity Portfolio.  Details of BNDE's equity portfolio as of Decem-
ber 31, 1972 are given in Annex 10. BNDE invested in 34 companies for a
total of DH 50.4 million, out of which DH 47.2 million has been paid in.
Specific provisions of DH 3.2 million have been made for investments in
eight unprofitable companies.
4.23       BNDE's dividend income increased about five times between 1968 and
1972, from DlI 387,000 in 1968 to DII 1,807,000 in 1972, although the latter
represents a return of only about 4% of equity portfolio in that year. This
1/    A further discussion of provisions is in para 4.26.



- 15 -
is still low. The equity participations made in 1971 (DH 17.9 million) to
help lIoroccanize foreign firms, should increase the return on BNDE's equity
portfolio in the future.
4.24       BNDE's equity portfolio (as of December 31, 1972) may be broken
down as follows:
% of Equity   Acquisition   Estimated
Number    Portfolio        Cost        Book Value
------DII raillion--------
Profitable Companies
Distributing Dividends        19        60.7          30.6            43.8

tion or about to start        3         10.3           5.2             5.2

34       100.0          50.4            61.7
Host comipanies in the first category hlave excellent prospects.  Of the 12
tnprofitable companies, several are expected to beconme profitable in about a
year. Overall, the book value of BNDE's equity portfolio is about 23%. above
its acquisition cost. Three Companies, representing about 24% of BNDE's port-
folio, are listed on the Bourse of Casablanca, all of then in the first group.
Financial Performance and Position
4.25       Audit.  BNDE's accounts are audited by Price W4aterhouse & Co.,
Casablanca. The accounts for 1971 and earlier years have received an un-
qualifieC opinion from the auditors. The 1971 audit report did not include
an analysis of the value of collateral received by BNDE for clients operat-
ing at losses.  BNDE has already asked its auditors to correct this short-
coming for the audit of BNDE's 1972 accounts.  The existing audit arrange-
ments will be continued.
4.20       General Loan Reserve.  An agreement wyith the Government made in
1962, allows BNDE to retain tax free provisions 1/. BNDE has taken full
advanta2e of this privilege. BNDE considers the whole armount of the pro-
vision so established as part of its net wortlh. Althouglh it is likely that
the General Loan Reserve exceeds substantially the aiimount of provisions
needed to cover BNDE's loss risk on its loan portfolio, the General Loan
Reserve shiould not be entirely included in BUIDE's net worth. For financial
analysis purposes, real provisions should be cotmputed and bi. charged against
1/    Tlii- provision can amount to up zo one-seventh of        i aunual filancitl
income of BNDE plus 0.15, of new rediscountable creutis granted each
year.



- 16 -
income.  Only the excess over provisions actually needed slhould be considered
as free reserves and counted as part of BNDE's net worth 1/. However, with
the growth of B3NDE's portfolio and the recent increase of its arrears, there
is more likelihood than in the past of real losses. It would be appropriate,
therefore, for BNDE to make notional provisions in each year to cover real
loss possibilities. A careful review of BNDE's portfolio has shown that, of
the 5% of portfolio affected by arrears of over three months, 3% represented
real loss risks. It would therefore be prudent to make provisions at that
level. This percentage needs to be reviewed- every year. The analysis of
BNDE's projected financial results uses this percentage.
4.27       Profitability.  Annex 11 shows BNDE's audited income statements
from 1968 to 1971, and provisional accounts for 1972. The main features
of BNDE's profitability are summarized in the table below:
(in Dl '000)
1968   1969   1970   1971        1972

- Year-end share capital        14.9    16.3   18.6   22.3        18.6
LMNDE's profitability has been improving because of increasing leverage, and
because administrative expenses, as a percentage of average total assets, re-
mained practically constant at 1.2% during 1968-1971. Taking into account
notional provisions at the level of 3% of the increnental portfolio, and
applied also for the past for comparison purposes only, the result would be:
1/    If BNDE wished to distribute these "excess" provisions to its share-
holders, it would have to pay incomne tax at the rate of 48%. In case
of liquidation, losses on the loan portfolio would be written off
against the General Loan Reserve, and any remaining part of this re-
serve to be distributed would have to pay taxes. Until such a dis-
tribution takes place, there is no tax incidence. Before any distri-
bution, any tax liability of this nature should be considered as part
of BENE's net wvorth.

Year-end share capital         13.4   13.8   14.1   13.2    13.5
As shown in the above table, BNDE's 1972 net profits, after conservative pro-
visions, represented 13.5% of the share capital. Compared with CIH and SNI,
BNDE is doing reasonably well, but returns in commercial banking and industry
are generally higher in Morocco.
4.28       Through 1971, BNDE was entitled to a Government subsidy of up to
2% for borrowing costs exceeding 5%, so long as it did not raise its lending
rate above 7%. Even though the subsidy no longer applies to BNDE's new bor-
rowings, it still has a large impact on BNDE's profits. In 1972 it amounted
to about DH 3.6 million, as compared with profits (before notional provisions)
of DH 6.1 million.
4.29       BNDE has been paying dividends since 1964.  It paid 6% in both
1968 and 1969 and 7% in 1970, 1971 and 1972. BNDE can well afford paying
a dividend of 7% (a 50Z pay-out ratio). This is in line with dividends paid
by other financial institutions in Morocco, e.g. CIH paid 8% in 1971. Since
shares of industrial companies have, over some time, found a market through
banks, once they earn a 7% dividend, BNDE's shares should be marketable.
The success of BNDEts 1972 capital increase is good corroborative evidence.
BNDE now wishes to have them listed on the Stock Exchange.
4.30       Financial Position.  Annex 12 presents BNDE's audited balance
sheets from 1967 to 1971, and a financial situation as of December 31, 1972.
Total assets increased particularly fast in 1971 (33%) as a result of high
commitments in 1970. The current ratio on December 31, 1972 (including
early maturities of loans and borrowings) was 1.20:1. BNDE's liquidity
position is stronger than it appears at first glance: about one-fourth of
BNDE's current liabilities (DR 9.3 million) are the three months "bons de
caisse", which have been continuously renewed with the Finance Ministry's
authorization since 1961. It is unlikely that these bonds will not be re-
newed in the future. BNDE's long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1972
totalled DH 324 million, of which DH 40 million were subordinated Government
loans, and DII 236 million Bank loans (73% of total long-term resources).



- 18 -
4.31       BNDE's net worth, including the General Loan Reserve, increased
from DH 30 million in 1968 to DR 52 million in 1972. The General Loan Re-
serve totalled DH 16.2 million (84% of total reserves) at year end 1972.
If a provision for real loss possibilities were made at 3% of outstanding
loan portfolio (DH 10.4 million), only DH 5.8 million of the General Loan
Reserve (made for tax reasons) could be considered as part of BNDE's net
worth, which, at the end of 1972, would then be DH 41.7 million instead of
DH 51.7 million. Under this assumption, the book value of BNDE's shares (ex-
cluding unrealized capital gains on equity investments) would still be 129%.
BNDE's shares are not yet traded, but taking into account the tax liability
on the General Loan Reserve and a 3% provision deducted from net worth, the
theoretical market price for BNDE's share should be in the bracket of DH
60-65 per share (DH 50 par value).
4.32       The Bank Loan Agreements limit BNDE's debt to five and a half times
BNDE consolidated capital and surplus. So far, the full amount of tax free
provisions was considered eligible for inclusion in equity because real loss
possibilities have in recent years appeared minimal. On that basis, BNDE's
debt/equity ratio was 4.0:1 as of December 31, 1972. With provisions for
possible losses estimated at 3% of portfolio excluded from equity, the ratio
was 4.6:1 as of December 31, 1972. The ratio of total debt to equity was
6.3:1 if the full amount of tax free provisions are included in the equity basis.
V.  BNDE'S FUTURE OPERATIONS
Prospects for Industrial Investment in Morocco
5.01       As stated before, private and public investment in Morocco remained
almost constant during 1970, 1971 and 1972, after having experienced a sharp
increase over the annual average for 1966-1969. Investment decisions, as
evidenced by Investment Commission approvals, after a decrease in 1971, picked
up again in 1972, as a result of a return of investors' confidence, and reached
a level slightly higher than in 1970. Thus, actual investments in 1973 should
not be less than in 1972.
5.02       Forecasting the level of private industrial investment in Morocco
after 1973 is difficult. Obviously, greater development efforts should be
made in order to promote growth in production and to cope with the increasing
unemployment problem. A new development plan for the 1973-1977 period is
under preparation and is expected to be published in the summer of 1973.
It is expected to include policies designed to achieve higher employment,
and industrial development will be one of the priorities. The involvement
of the public sector in industry is likely to increase. Some factors are
working in favor of Morocco's economy, namely the country's association with
the EEC, wihich provides for liberalization of Moroccan exports and European
tariff cuts, and growing sub-contracting possibilities, mainly in textiles
from European enterprises. Whether these possibilities will materialize
or not depends on the general climate in Morocco. If no further de-stabiliz-
ing events occur, 1973 may be a year of reorientation and investment should



- 19 -
not drop from the 1972 level. In this case, the economic forces and market
pressures in Morocco could bring about an increase in industrial investment
of about 7% during 1974.
BNDE's Forecast of Operations
5.03       Direct Loans.  BNDE's forecast of operations over the period 1973-
1977 is shown in Annex 13. It takes account of projects already approved by
the Investment Commission, as well as BNDE's own pipeline of projects as of
March 1973.
5.04       Gross approvals of direct loans amounted to DH 113 million in 1972,
nearly the same amount as in 1971. It is worth noting that 40% of the total
is for two large projects (out of a total number of 34 projects), underlining
BNDE's sensitiveness in recent years, to a few large operations. For the two
year period 1973 and 1974, approvals are forecast to total about DH 260 mil-
lion. This forecast results from a review, on a case-by-case basis, of BNDE's
pipeline and appears reasonable. For 1975 and 1976, an annual increase of
about 7% has been projected, based on the plausible expectation that BNDE
would keep its share of term financing of industrial investment in Morocco.
Forecast of approvals of rediscountable medium term loans are put at a level
of DH SO million a year. However, this part of BNDE's activity has no im-
pact on its financial situation, but an increase of these activities would
improve BNDE's profitability.
5.05       Equity investments.  BNDE's equity operations approvals in 1972
were DH 9 million.  BNDE estimates that, from 1973 on, equity investment
approvals will average about DH 8 million a year. This target seems real-
istic. It is in line with BNDE's policy limitation on the aggregate amount
of equity investments BNDE can hold.
5.06       Resource Requirements.  To meet its forecast commitments through
1977, BNDE will need resources of about DH 676 million ($161 million equiv-
alent). As of December 31, 1972, BNDE had DH 72.8,million of commitable re-
sources. Over the two-year period 1973-1974, BNDE's financing needs are ex-
pected to be DH 279 million, out of which about DII 237 million equivalent
to finance imports. BNDE was already able to float, in January 1973, another
DH 20 million bond issue in the domestic market. BNDE has obtained the Gov-
ernment's authorization for another bond issue by the middle of 1973. 1/
Prospects for 1974 are unclear as the Government may have to raise substantial
amounts of money to cover investments under the future Development Plan.
5.07       Concerning foreign borrowings, BNDE's plans have not developed as
fast as the Bank would like, for reasons explained in para. 4.05. The only
sources which are readily available for BNDE are medium-term, tied funds from
1/    The issue is planned for DH 20 million.  Chances of placement, given
the result of the recent issue, are good.



- 20 -
France, and possibly from Belgium. BNDE cannot rely too heavily on such
sources, because it needs to match the maturities of its assets and liabili-
ties, and procurement problems may arise. However, BNDE should not wait
passively until it reveives atttactive offers and should not be altogether
inhibited by the cost of long-term foreign sources. The spread BNDE has on
its total resources, and BNDE's prospects of profitability, should permit
BNDE to borrow on a limited scale at higher costs. But this is a question
of attitude of BNDE's management, and Morocco's current political situation
would probably make it difficult for BNDE to borrow abroad in the very near
future.  This should not detract BNDE from looking for funds.  Meanwhile,
BNDE expects iri the period 1973-1974, to raise another French loan of about
DH 50 million, and another loan from Kuwait of DII 12 million, the latter
being directed towards specific subprojects. This seems realistic. 1/
5.08       BNDE's resource availabilities over the two-year period 1973-1974
are summarized below:
Local Resources   Foreign Resources   Total
Available for commitment                                                      -
as of January 1, 1973        DHI26.8 million   DII 46 million       D11172.8 million
Cash generation 1973-1974      DI 12.9 million           -            DH 12.9 million
1973 bond issues               DIl 40   million          -            DH 40   million
Second Kuwait Fund loan             -              DH 12 million      DHI 12   million
Second French loan (half
the amount) /2                   -              DII 25 million      DH 25   million
DH 79.7 million   DH 83 million       DH162.7 million
The total resources of DH 162.7 million available to BNDE for the period 1973-
1974 will not cover BNDE's total commitments, that are expected to be at a level
of DH 279 during the period (see para. 5.06). BNDE is looking to the Bank to
finance the remaining gap of DH 116.3 million ($28 million equivalent).
1/   Since BNDE's international borrowing plan (see para. 4.05) is unlikely
to materialize befote the end of 1974, no account has been taken of
these borrowing possibilities in assessing BNDE's resource availabil-
ities over the two-year period 1973-1974.
2/   BNDE expects this loan to be available sometime in 1974.  It is there-
fore reasonable to assume that only half of the amount will be usable
for commitment purposes.



- 21 -
5.09       If BNDE were to obtain from the Bank full coverage of its resource
gap (DII 116 million), BNDE's available foreign exchange resources would develop
as follows in 1973-1974:
-    Uncommitted foreign sources as of
January 1, 1973 (French loan)               DIi 46 million
-    Second French loan (half) /1                  DH 25 million
-    Kuwait loan                                   DH 12 million
-    Requested Bank loan                           DH116 million
Total                         DH199 million
/1    3NDE expects this loan to be available sometime in 1974.  It is there-
fore reasonable to assume that only half of the amount will be usable
for commitment purposes.
In any case, the Bank can only cover BNDE's overall resource gap. In these
circumstances, BNDE would still have to use local currency resources up to
DH 38 million to finance imports, as its needs for import financing are fore-
cast at DH 237 million. Given the recent improvements in tIorocco's balance
of payments (see para. 2.07), as well as the ready access to foreign exchange
in Morocco for the purchase of imported equipment, such financing should not
be difficult.
Financial Projections
5.10       Projections rest on the expectation that forecast of business will
be carried out and that resources will be available. Projected income state-
ments for the years 1973 to 1977 appear in Annex 14, and financial ratios in
Annex 15 1/. BNDE's income is enhanced by the 1972 increase in its lending
rate. As for dividend income, BNDE forecasts only a moderate increase from
4% of equity portfolio in 1972 to about 7% in 1977.  No capital gains have
been forecast. Administrative expenses are reasonably forecast to remain
at about 1.1% of average total assets throughout the period.
5.11       All7owing for an annual provision charged against income equivalent
to 3%' of the portfolio increment, profit after tax as a percentage of year-
end net worth is expected to grow from 10.8% in 1973 to 15.5% at the end of
1/    Tn all financial projections, the General Loan Reserve is treated along
the lines recommended in para 4.26 but the full tax-free provisions,
as allowed under the 1972 Agreement with the Government, are used in
calculating BNDE's tax liabilities.



- 22 -
the period. This is satisfactory. Net profits as a percentage of year-end
share capital, starting from 14.7% in 1973, increase steadily over the period
to reach about 33% in 1977. BNDE plans to distribute a 7% dividend out of
1972 results and expects to raise the rate to 8% from 1975 on. The pay-out
ratio would decrease from 32% in 1972 to about 24% in 1977, and BNDE could
well afford to pay a higher dividend earlier that it now envisages.
5.12       Projected sources and uses of funds appear in Annex 16.  Debt service
coveracge remains adequate during the period: 1.9:1 in 1973 to 1.4:1 in 1977.
Anlual interest coverage over 1972-1977 remains at about 1.4:1. Projected
balance sheets through 1977 appear in Annex 17. Growth in total assets will
slow down from 21% in 1972 over 1971 to about 6% at the end of the period.
5.13       Debt Limit.  Existing Bank Loan Agreements limit BNDE debt/equity
ratio to 5.5 times its equity including the full amount of the General Loan
Reserve. As explained in para 4.26, the amount needed to cover loss possi-
bilities has been currently estimated on a conservative basis at 3% of loan
portfolio. Account has to be taken of this reduction in BNDE's borrowing
basis when recommending a contractual debt equity limit for the proposed
Loan.  Keeping BNDE's borrowing powers at the same level as now - in terms
of the absolute amount of debt - would imply a contractual debt/equity limit
of 6.5:1. But this is excessive when viewed in light of BNDE's recent in-
ternal problems, Morocco's general situation, and the total debt/equity ratio
(including the Government subordinated loans into debt) which would poten-
tially be as high as 11:1. This would be too much. In setting an appropriate.
contractual debt limit, one should also take account of the protection afforded
to a creditor from the DH 40 million borrowings from Government, which are
subordinated to senior debt in the event of liquidation, and of BNDE's good
guarantees from Government and banks on a substantial part of its portfolio.
Taking all these factors together, a prudent contractual debt limit, with the
proposed definition of the equity base (i.e. provisions are excluded from
equity but all subordinated debt falling due after the final maturity of the
Bank loan are inicluded as part of the borrowing base) would be 6:-1. Under
such a limitation, BNDE's ratio of total long term debt to net worth would
not exceed 9:1.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
6.01       BNDE has remained the principal Moroccan institution for financing
private industrial investment in Morocco, mainly through long-term loans for
imported equipment. As a result, its operations reflect the general trend of
industrial investment in Morocco. Since 1971, through its own volition and
induced by the Government's Moroccanization aims, BNDE has substantially
raised its equity investments. BNDE has good relations with investors and
banks in Morocco, and with the Government.

6.02       Last year, for the first time, BNDE reduced its heavy reliance on
its two principal sources of funds, the Government and the Bank, by tapping
new domestic and foreign sources.  These initiatives were facilitated by an
increase in BNDE's lending rate.  BNDE has already obtained borrowings from
France and Kuwait, and can expect to tap again the same sources.  However,
BNDE has not so far obtained long term, untied resources, other than a rela-
tively small loan from the Kuwait Fund for a specific project.  Prospects
for BNDE's raising more long term money than now from abroad are not bright
in the short run, due to current political uncertainties affecting Morocco.
In tne near future, BNDE will continue to depend on the Bank for a substan-
tial part of its resources.
6.03       About a year ago, BNDE had been experiencing organizational prob-
lems, mainly a lack of control by the top management of the company on the
quality of BNDE's staffts output.  As a result, internal coordination prob-
lems, largely overcome before that time, had reappeared, and appraisals suf-
£ered. BLIDE has taken steps to improve this situation. A satisfactory frame-
work for better coordination and quality control is now in place. BINDE
knows that the new organizational framework is not a panacea, and that
careful attention and supervision is needed to implement this move suc-
cessfully.
6.o4       BINDE's organizational weaknesses have not yet affected its finian-
cial position, whiich is sound.  Arrears, while higher than a few years ago,
remain manageable.  They are well covered by provisions.  To permit a i,ore
realistic analysis of its financial position, BNDE should establish notional
provisions that would reflect realistically estimated loss possibilities.
It should not try, however, to arrange for changes in its present agreemient
with the Government regarding the constitution of the General Loan Reserve,
wiilich has valuable fiscal advantages to BNDE. This exercise should be under-
taken by BNDE every year, and the auditor's opinion regarding the adequacy of
these provisions should be included in the audit report. BNDE's profitabil-
ity is reasonably good. It has been improving due to increasing leverage.
6.05       Despite the political uncertainties which affect lIorocco's business
outlook, and which partly explain the levelling off of investments in 1972,
BNDE could increase its 1973 operations above the level of 1972. Beyond 1973,
investors' confidence which seems to be returning in Miorocco, together with
other conditions generally favoring investment, could permit BNDE to carry
out a substantial volume of business over the next five years. New economic
policies nlow being prepared in Morocco are expected to put nmore emphasis oln
industrialization, and BNDE should continue to play an important role as fi-
nancier of the industrial sector. There are good chances that the new In-
vestment Code will provide for incentives which are by themselves conducive
to job creation and promotion of exports, and which will be administered auto-
matically.

Recommendations
6.06       The fifth Bank loan to BNDE is fuilly committed.  On top of the re-
sources it has recently mobilized, BNDE will soon need additional funds to
cover its co,mmitments. As explained in para. 5.03, BINDE seeks a $28 million
Bank loan to cover its resource gap for the 1973-74 period. Though B]NDE is
still to cure organizational problems, they are not of such a weight as to
rule BNDE out from further Bank financing, and BNDE remains a suitable and
creditworthy borrower for a sixth loan from the Bank.  However, these
organizational problems of BNDE must influence the specific recommendation
for the amaount of the proposed loan.  It is prudent to have the proposed
sixth Bank loan cover a shorter period than the usual two years. The Bank
therefore should help cover BNDE's resource gap only for a period of 18
months starting January 1, 1973.  aNDE's resource gap, if it carries out
its business as projected, would be the equivalent of $21 million for that
period. However, this figure does not take into account one large project
which has not yet been approved by BNDE, because of difficulties in nego-
tiations with the sponsors. BNDE's management is confident that this proj-
ect will eventually be formalized, and has requested the Bank to allow for
this project in BNDE's resource gap. The Bank, though less convinced on
this point than BNDE, has agreed to retain this possibility as a contingency.
BNDE's additional resource needs involved are $3 million equivalent. There-
fore, a loan of $24 million equivalent is recomrended. It will be disbursed
as shown in Annex 18.
6.07       The terms of the proposed loan should be those norrially applied
to Bank loans to development f inance companies., including the standard com-
mitment fee.  Contrary to the fifth Bank Loan Agreement, there should be
no specific limit on the use of Bank funds for public sector projects eligi-
ble for BNDE's financing under its policy statement. The proceeds of the
loan should be used to finance direct imports, plus the equivalent of 65%
of off-the-shlelf procurements, representing the import elemnent of these
costs.  The free limit should remain $500,000, w^ith an aggregate ftee limit
corresponding to $6 million. A maximum amotmt of Bank funds to be used for
a single investment project (private or public) should be affirmed at $3.5
million.  The definition of BNDE's borrowing basis should be aiiended in
order to exclude the part of the General Loan Reserve needed to cover real-
istically estirmated loss possibilities, and BNDE should seek annually its
auditor's opinion regarding the adequacy of this estimate. Under the pro-
posed definition, BNDE's limit on term debt should be set at 6 times its
borrowing basis.

BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT EOONOMIQUE
Statement of Policy
(Approved by the Board of Directors on March 29, 1963 and amended
on March 7, 1966, September 24, 1968, December 22, 1969, March 26, 1971
and June 6, 1972.)
1.       BNDE's general investment policy should be stated along the
following lines:
(a) BNDE's obJective will be the encouragement of productive
investment in Morocco, chiefly in the industrial field.
To that end it will assist particularly in the financing
of private industrial enterprises to which the major por-
tion of its resources will be devoted.
(b) BNDE will assist a non-private enterprise only in special
circumstances, and when private capital cannot be found on
reasonable terms to carry out the project;
(c) BNDE will assist a non-industrial enterprise only when
capital cannot be found elsewhere on reasonable terms.
(d) Projects (loans or other investments) which are not ex-
actly covered by the above criteria, and for Which, accord-
ingly, BNDE does not deem possible to assume the risks,
mwight be financed when the Moroccan Government finds these
projects justified in the public interest, provided their
financial risk is entirely assumed by the Government, either
by a 100% unconditional guaranty of the Government or of
a Government Agency duly authorized to give such a guar-
anty or by the financing of such operation by Government
funds at Government's risks, those resources being segre-
gated from any resources of BNDE.
An enterprise will not be considered "private" if the Government or any
of its agencies directly or indirectly hold 50% or more of its outstanding
votihg stock.
2.       BNDE will consider enterprises only on the basis of their
economic and financial merits. To this end, projects will be analyzed
as to their economic desirability, technical feasibility, financial sound-
ness, management competence, etc., to insure that only sound productive
ventures are financed. BNDE will finance only projects which:



ANNE 2
Page 2
(a)   have a high economic priority, and
(b)   promise to provide a satisfactory rate of return on the
investment.
BNDE will perform adequate supervision of the operations it finances.
3.       BNDE should, as appropriate, make use of a variety of forms of
investment, incluading, within the limits of sound financial practice,
equity participations, and the underwriting or participation in the under-
writing of securities sold by investment enterprises.
4.       In order to assist the development of the Moroccan capital
market, BNDE should stand ready to sell portions of its investments to
other privat;e investors, with due respect to its own interests and to
those of the other participants in the investments sold.
5.       When one or more commercial bank participates with BNDE in
lending to an enterprise, BNDE should exert every effort to ensure
that the terms of all the loans, taken together, are well suited to the
needs of the enterprise.
6.       BNDE should, whenever appropriate, extend technical assistance
to its clients in respect of the formulation, execution and operation of
projects.
7.       BNDE should not normally make direct loans or other investments
in favor of one single enterprise aggregating more than 15% of BNDE's
paid-up capital, reserves and outstanding long-term Government loans,
with the exception of such loans and investments which are covered by
a Government guarantee or guarantee from the Caisse Centrale de Garanties
or by a bank guarantee after examination of the financial position of
the bank conce-led.  In entering into discounting arrangements with a
commercial b&_.), involving contingent liabilities, BNDE will limit the
amount of its individual commitments on the basis of its assessment of
the financial position of the bank concerned and in the light of NDE's
s hare eapital and reserves.
8.       In general, 3NDE should not take any single equity participation
larger than the smaller of (a) 10% of BNDE's paid-up capital and reserves
and (b) 25% of the share capital of the investnent enterprise concerned.
In the case of underwritings, BNDE might take a large comitment in the
faith that it will not in fact have to take up more than the proportion
of shares here indicated. In any event, the total aggregate equity invest-
ments shall not exceed:
BNDE's share capital plus free reserves plus the maturities of
the government subordinated loans falling due after 15 years,
plus thkt part of the General Loan Reserve which exceeds real-
listically estimated loss possibilities.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
9.       BNDE will build reserves consistent with sound financial
practice. It will annually appropriate a portion of its income to re-
serves. Appropriations will be made so as to build up total reserves to
a level that is appropriate to the aise and quality of BNDE's portfolio
of loans and equity investments, while permitting the distribution of an
adequate dividend to BNDE's shareholders. The Board of BNDE will review
every year the situation in this respect.
