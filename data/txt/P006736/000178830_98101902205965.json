      two-year segment of a railway rehabilitation program, which\n            is part of CNR's investment plan for 1973-76, and of a\n            Program of Action. The Project was first appraised by the\n            Bank in 1971; the appraisal made it clear that the project\n            execution would have to concentrate on (a) the ability of\n            CNR's management to achieve the desirable operating\n            targets and financial results (b) the need to reduce losses\n            on, and ultimately close, certain uneconomic lines and (c)\n            the need for continued substantial financial contributions\n            from the Government to CNR. These issues were thoroughly\n            considered by the Government and CNR who agreed in principle\n            with the Bank on an appropriate course of action for dealing\n            with them."}, "docdt": "1973-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
