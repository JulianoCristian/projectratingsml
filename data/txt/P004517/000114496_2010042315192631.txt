Dear Sir:
                  Philippines - Extension of Closing Date for
                                Financial Sector Adjustment Loan
                                (Loan No. 3049-PH) and
                                Amendment of Schedule 4 to Loan Agreement
      Thank you for your letter o December 14, 1992 in which you
requested a further extension of the Closing Date for the above Loan
from December 31, 1992, until June 30, 1993.
      In considering yout request we have noted the progress you are
making toward achieving the amendments required to the Central
Banking Act and the proposals which are are pursuing ffor the
financial restructuring of the Cenrral Bank.
      Based on the discussions between our recent mission and
officials of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, the
Bank is prepared to extend the Closing Date as you have requested,
and to amend Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement by adding a new
condition (as number 10), namely, that "the finances of the central
bank have been restructured to the Bank's satisfaction".
      We would need to be satisfied at least that the restructuring
results in the Central Bank (or any successor institution performing
the functions of a central bank) being financial sound and able to
operate as an independent central bank.
      Kindly confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment as
tthe duly authorized representtive of the Borrower, by signing and
dating the form of confirmation set forth below.
