Your Excellency:
      We refer to the Loan Agreement (Financial Sector Adjustment

requesting the Bank to amend the Loan Agreement to reflect the
co-financing arrangement with the Export-Import Bank of Japan
(JEXIMBANK) and to incorporate a cross-default clause in respect of
the JEXIMBANK loan.
     The Bank is pleased to inform you that, pursuant to the above
request, it hereby agrees to amend the Loan Agreement as set out in
the Attachment hereto.
     Please confirm the agreement on behalf of the Borrower, to the
foregoing amendment by signing and dating the confirmation form on
the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us for our
record.
                                               Sincerely,
                                            Praful C. Patel
