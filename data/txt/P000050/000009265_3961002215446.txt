MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOC'ATION
TO TE EXEClUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPVB.IC OF ANGOLA
FOR THE
TRANSPORT RECOVERY PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to The People's Republic of Angola for SDR 30 million, equivalent to US$41
million on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a transport recovery
project. The project would be co-fineaned by a grant from the Swedish International
Development Authority (SIDA), and would receive parallel financing from France's Caisse
Centrale pour la Cooperation Economique (CCCE), and the Danish International Development
Agency (DANMIDA) totalling US$9.3 million equivalent.'
2.   CntrSectorBakgrond. Angola, one of the largest countries south of the Sahara with
an area of 1.2 million sq.knm., a population of 10.6 million (growing at 2.8% per year), and a
GNP per capita estimated at $620 (1989), has excellent long-term development potential due to
its fertile land and abundant mineral resources, oil in particular. Since Independence in 1975,
however, the economy has become highly distorted because of inadequate economic policies, a
mass exodus of skldled manpower, and civil war. Agricultural production and distribution have
been disrupted by war. Prior to Independence, Angola was an important net exporter of
ariculural products, but in recent years has become increasingly dependent on food imports, and
food aid, to supply urban populations which have burgeoned in part because of insecurity in the
countryside.
3.    Th" Angolan infrastructure sector was a major casualty of the long lasting civil strife and
poor economic management. Transport infrastructure is severely deteriorated as a result of war
destruction, and lack of adequate maintenance, in urn due to insufficient funding and weak
institutional capacity. Consequently, inadequate infrastructure has become a major bottleneck to
the resumption of economic activity. Existing assets are in urgent need of maitenance and
rehabilitaon to avoid their loss.  The country needs a sizable assistance program for
rehabilitation investments, organizational restructuring, human resource development, and
managerial and operations improvement, and a large part of this is urgent.
4.   Project Objectives. Consistent with the Bank's strategy for Angola and as a complement
to the Infrastructure Rehabiliation Engineering (IRE) project approved on July 16, 1991, the
objectives of the proposed project would be to: (i) restore and preserve surface access to large
portions of the country by addressing the most urgent infrastructure rehabilitation and
maintenance needs; (-d) promote employment in the private sector through the development of
small and medium enterprises using labor intensive technologies in road maintenance activities;

(iii) assist In Improving and developing an adequate institutional framework- for the sector,
especially for the management of main roads and the operations of the Luanda railway and the
port of Lobito; and (iv) introduce appropriate sectoral policies, especially with regard to cost
recovery and transport facilitation.
S.   Eroject Description lThe proposed project-as described in Schedule A and in the SAR-
would support the folowLag high priority components of an emergency Transport Recovery
Program including the rehabilitation of roads and bridges, the port of Lobito and the Luanda
Railway and institutional development.
6.   The road and bridge rehabilitation conwonent provides for the rehabilitation and
preservation of 700 km of the paved highway network and the repair of about 25 wardamaged
bridges, in strategic locations on the main road network with the objective of early reopening of
the primary road network. Support would be provided to a labor W gnr jmond training (LM
sub-component through the creation and operation within the Angola Highway Institute (INEA)
of a training unit for contract management for the execution of labor intensive road maintenance
works. Initay, the tasks will include clearing of vegetation along the roads rehabilitated under
the project, and along the main roads within the city of Luanda. The objectives are to train and
promote small and medium enterprises for road works and generate employment in road
maintenance activities.
7.   The Lobito Port operations        aims to Improve port operations and transport
services for a region with a high potential for agriculture. It consists of insttutional assistance
for the port's operations and management to help with the implementation of an action plan with
appropriate performance targets; procurement of spare parts and equipment; and minor structural
repairs.
S.   Ibe  WI=  rehabnk ationWMRQnt provides the minimum assistance required to enable
the Luanda Railway (CFL) to sustain and increase commercial traffic between Luanda and
Malange. The project would include an action plan based on performance targets, including
insttutional assistance, track and structure rehabilitation, and overhaul of equipment and rolling
stock.
9. Besides assistance to relevant transport entities described above, the project would include
studies on (i) privatition and liberalization in road transport, and (ii) intemodl transport
facilitation, including the regulatory framework of maritime transport, port institutions, customs
operations and do ation, and the freight-forwarding and insurance industries. Lastly,
technical assistance will be provided to assist the Ministy of Planning (MNPLAN) with overall
project coorinaidon.
10.  Pje  kpemnation. The project would be implemented under the coordination and
monitoring of the existing proje*x coordination unit of MINPLAN-under the same arrangements
as for the IRE project. Each project component will be the responsibility of a component
coordinator. The reponsible ministries will (i) give individual component coordinators ample
authority to manage, monitor; arrange for audit, and report on the execution of their respective
component, and (ii) delegate to the agencies concerned the responsibility for technical
management of their component Theses agencies: INEA for the road and bridge component,
Port of Lobito for the port component, and CFL for the rail component will be given



-3 -
responsibility by their respecive ministries for the management of their component (bidding
preparadon and processing, contract monitoring) and will report to the project coordination uwit.
11.  Projc.L Sustalnabil.. Overall, the project would contribute to the sustainable recovery
of the country's economy by reconneting its various regions and allowing resettlement of war-
displaced populations in areas with high agricultural potential. It also would contribute
substaially to the development of the transport sector, and especially of the commercial
transport agencies-Port of Lobito and CFL-by improiing their performance, especially cost
recovery. In the road sector, the project would promote maintenance, labor- intnsive techniques
under contract, and resource mobilization which in turn are indispensable first steps toward long-
term sustalnability.
12.  Lessons Learned from Pevious IIDA hnvolvement. The proposed project is the second
investment in physical infrastructure supported by the Bank Group in Angola, after the Lobito
Benguela Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project approved on January 7, 1992. Therefore,
there are no direct lessons to draw from prior Bank experience in this country. However, lessons
have been drawn from other experiences elsewhere: with regard to implementation, existing
institutional structures will be strengthened instead of relying on ad hoc project implementation
units; it is also proposed that the role of the implementing agencies be limited to that of contract
management for civil works, with supervision through technical assistance, rather than attempting
to perfm implementation tasks directly.
13.  Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project addresses one of Angola's highest
priority needs - the rehabilitaion of the country's battered infrastructure base - and is a
prerequisite to the economy's recovery. It fits well into the Bank Group's strategy for the
country, which stresses reconstruction. This project would complement the on-going IRE project
which was conceived prior to the peace agreement in 1991, and was not intended to start the
actual rehabilitation of infrastructure in the interior of the country. It would strengthen existing
institutions in the infrastructure sector and introduce basic principles of cost recovery. The Bank
bas a unique catalytic role to play in assisting the government in the design, financing and
implementation of this high priority recovery program. The project would enable the Bank to
play an important coordinating role in the transport sector where donor interest is strong, but so
far not well coordinated.
14.  Acions Agreed upon. During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following
matters: (i) submission to IDA of INEA's annua road work program and budget, each year by
November 1; and of a three-year Public Investment Program for the transport sector by
November 1, 1993, and yearly by November 1, thereaft  for review, comments and agreement;
(i) organization of a first-year review no later than twelve months after credit effectiveness to
monitor project implementation and performance of the agencies concerned, (ill) proposals to
control truck axle loads; (iv) plans of action concening the CFL railway mnd fte Port of Lobito,
including tariff measures; (v) action plan for fuel taxation to improve cost recovery; and (vi)
implementation of a program for removal of land mines on the project work sites.
15. Conditions of Effectiveness would be: (i) implementation of fuel taxadon measures to
ensure collection of the equivalent of at least $US15 million per year, of an action plan to contol
truck axle loads and vehicle control at selected locations, and of action plans for the operation
of Port of Lobito and CFL, including performance objectives and tariff measures; (ii) signing of



-4 -
implementation agreements with the various agencies and ministries Involved In project
implementation; (Mii) signing of a letter of Transport Sectr Policy; and (iv) opening of a project
account and initial deposit of US$1 million equivalent. Conditions of Dibursement for the civi
works would be the hiring of consultants for work supervision, and certification of legal
ownership of land for the training unit.
16.  gmir monme l Ag,ets. An environmental analysis was carried out with the ass!stance of
a consultant for the road component during project preparation Its findings were that: ithe
project would have a substantial positive social and environmental impact by (a) Improving road
drainage, which in turna would limit the erosion risks, and (b) removing war-caused wrecks and
scrap metal left alongside the roads and on the sites of destroyed bridges. However, the study
r6ecommended that arennin be paid to the design and execution of civil works to alleviate the
potential risk of disttrbances caused to people and/or the natural environment as a result of these
works; this concem has been duly reflected in the project detailed desigp.
17.  PaQ       Teive Categories. The project would contribute to the following categories:
(i) public secor refnrm would be supported through improved management and cost recovery;
(ii) employment generation would contribute to poverty alleviation; (iii) privatzation and private
sector promotion would be achieved by training in management and labor-intensive techniques
in road rehabiLitation and mainenance; (iv) food security would be improved by encouraging
agricultura pursuits and improving transport conditions; and (v) environmental conditions would
be improved by repairs to road drainage, and removal of war-caused wrecks and scrap metal
alongside roads, and also by the removal of mines along the roads and on bridge sites which is
necessaryI prior to undertaking the project civil works.
18.  Prqbc Benefit. Ihe rehabilitation of the transport sector is a prerequisite to economic
recovery of Angola. Direct economic benefits would be sharply reduced operaing costs in road
transport, and reestablishment of traffic tc the interior of the country. The overall project
beneficiaries would be a large proportion of the Angolan people who would have restorAd access
to large areas of the country, the agricul.ure sector, and the inhabitants of major cities and semi-
urban rural centers hroughout the country who would enjoy the benefits of enhanced food
security and cheaper food prices. Immediate direct beneficiaries of the project would be the
people (mostly unilled workers) who would be hired to execute project works: (1) about 4-5,000
workers would be employed by contractors over two years, and (ii) over the medium/long tem,
an additional 4,000 workers could be employed by small and medium enterprises trained under
the project (LPT sub-omponent). The overall project Economic Rate of Return is 30%. A risk
analysis was carried out for individual project componens to test the rate of return's sensitivity
to construction costs, traffic growth rate and induced traffic. Test results show that under worst
case assumptions, the rate of return of individual sub-components would generaly remain well
above the opportunity cost of capital estimated at 10%.
19.  RikI. Ihe risks inherent in the project result from (i) government's limited capacity to
ensure adequate local fincing for the project, and (ii) weak institutional capacity to manage the
project, both of which may cause delays in project impl io  and thus permit further
deterioration of trasport infrastructure and services. Unfamiliarity of project stff with Bank
procedures, and a potentially unstable political environment could also lead to significant delays.
The project design reduces the potential consequences reated to these risks. As for the
counterpart funding issue, government would provide for the local costs only, the lager part



-5-
being for road maintenance activities, and cost recovery mechanisms would be developed to help
generate the resources needed. As for the weak institttional capacity, the bulk of project-
financed road works would be carried out under contract and supervised by consultants, which
would limit the risk associated with INEA's current insdtutional weakess.
20.  Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

C. BANK GQ&JJP'S INMTIAL EXPERIENCE
1.   Angola joined the Bank, IFC and MIGA in September 1989. The Barl s initial approawh
has been to nuirture trust between Angola and the Bank so as to develop wue type of mature
partnership that the Bank has with other Borrowers; to help strengthen the coutry's weak
institutions; to assist in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure by carying out pre-
investment studies aimed at addressing evident, high-prionty bottlen.cks; and, finally, to initiate
a dialogue on policy reform priorities and reconstruction needs. IDA lending to Angola in FY91-
92 was planned before the political and economic policy breakthroughs of 1991 and 1992, and
in the context of a "start-up' IDA assistance program of limited scope, with emphasis on capacity
building, along with preparation work for high-priority projects for rehabilitation of physical and
social infrastructure. Concurrendy, the Bank began an active economic and sector work program
to build knowledge of the economy and identify the main policy reform priorities. The projects
approved in FY91-92 consist of a Credit for Economic Management and Capacity Buildin:,, an
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Engineering Project, an Urban Environment Project for the Lobito-
Benguela area (the second largest urban area in Angola), an Education Project, and a Power
Rehabilitation Project.
2.   The Economic Management and Capacity Building Credit became effective in December
1992. It was off to a slow start, partly because of inexperience and lack of familiarity with Bank
procedures and pardy because of objective difficulties in the working environment and logistic
supports. The project is now staffed with a good team of competent and dedicated professionals;
the office is reasonably well organized; satisfactory work procedures have been established; and
implementation is underway. Some key components, notably human resource development, are
on target, while others, such as the studies on economic liberalization, are just starting. Credit
disbursements are about five months behind appraisal projections, but are expected to accelerate
in the first half of 1993 after several large contracts are signed. The Infrastructure Rehabilitation
*             Engineering Credit became effective in February 1992, and implementationhas been satisfactory
though disbursements are about three months behind schedule because of delays in processing
payments and disbursement applications.
3.   Project implementation will receive the attention that the Borrower's relative inexperience
and institutional weakness require. Consequently, in order to build the implementation capacity
of this Borrower who is relatively unfamiliar with Bank procedures, and to help ensure that
operations get off to a good start, the allocation of resources for supervision planned for PY93-95
is about 30% higher than the regional average. Country procurement assessment and training wil
be given high priority. The first Country hnplementation Review (CIR) is planned for 1993. The
Bank's Resident Mission, which is in the process of being established, is expected to make a
major contribution in project implementation and supervision.
