ratings during the initial years, when\n            instability resulting from the resumption of war impeded\n            progress, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory. The\n            physical targets of improving access to the capital city for\n            movement of both people and goods were achieved. Also, the\n            project succeeded in sensitizing the Borrower to reform\n            issues, particularly with respect to cost recovery,\n            enhancing the role of the private sector in small\n            maintenance contracts and strengthening transport agencies.\n            Sustainability of the project benefits is unlikely in view\n            of continued conflict within the country and instability of\n            the macro-economic environment. Overall, both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include the following: During project preparation, special\n            efforts should be made to provide training in Bank\n            guidelines on procurement, disbursement, and financial\n            management to the staff of implementing agencies. Given the\n            still-ongoing civil war and lack of access to most of the\n            road network, the road agency must be restructured to\n            improve planning ad monitoring of the financing\n            arrangements. Over-optimistic conditionalities in agreements\n            which are not fully supported by detailed action plans make\n            the reform program difficult to implement and make the\n            project objectives unsustainable. Measures of quality\n            assurance related to design, works, and operation must be\n            implemented. Road safety should be included."}, "docdt": "2000-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
