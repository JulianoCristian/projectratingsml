i.  I1NT1iUOUC1iUN
1.01      The Government of Colombia and Cerro Matoso, S.A. (CMSA) have
requested a Bank loan of US$80 million equivalent to finance exploitation of
the Cerro Matoso nickel laterite deposit, located near the provincial town of
Montelibano (Map IBRD 12480). The Project will involve the mining and bene-
ficiation of an annual average of approximately 780,000 dry metric tons (DMT)
of ore, grading about 2.7% Ni, to produce 19,164 metric tons (MT) of nickel
contained in ferronickel with a grade of 37.5% Ni. Cerro Matoso's entire
output will be sold on a long-term, take-or-pay basis to Billiton Metals (a
Dutch Corporation of the Shell Group) for resale primarily in the European
and Japanese markets.
1.02      Project preparation is well advanced.  The ore body is well-known
and extensive pilot plant testing has been carried out. Letters of intent
have already been issued to the prospective suppliers of the rotary kiln and
dryer and the electric smelting furnace--which together constitute about 55%
of the total equipment cost--and, based on a start of implementation in
June 1979 1/, it is expected that the plant will be operational in the second
quarter of 1982. Construction management and supervision of engineering and
procurement will be provided by Bechtel (US).
1.03      The plant will be owned and operated by Cerro Matoso S.A., a
Colombian corporation in which 45% of the equity will be held by ECONIQUEL,
a Government-owned Colombian Corporation, and 55% will be held by private
shareholders (20% by CONICOL, S.A., a US Company in which the Hanna Mining
Co. holds 97% of the shares, and 35% by Billiton Overseas, Ltd., a British
subsidiary of the Shell Group). Hanna--which currently mines a similar type
of ore in the US--will be retained to provide technical assistance for at
least the first five years of operations.
1.04      Total financing for the Project, including interest during construc-
tion and working capital, is expected to be about US$340 million equivalent,
including US$216 million in foreign exchange. In addition to the Bank loan,
which will finance 37% of the Project's foreign exchange requirements,
financing will be provided by a US$25.6 million loan package from US Exim-Bank,
up to US$120 million in loan funds from Chase Manhattan Bank (US) and by
equity from the shareholders. The Bank loan will be the first major loan for
a single industrial project in Colombia since the 1963 loan to Acerias
Paz del Rio, the country's largest steel mill. 2/ The Project was originally
submitted to the Bank in 1971 but underwent considerable modification there-
after. It was eventually pre-appraised by the Bank in 1976 and an appraisal
mission, consisting of Messrs. Hilton, Kotschwar and Soncini, of the Industrial
Projects Department, visited Colombia in March-April 1978.
II. THE NON-FUEL MINING SECTOR IN COLOMBIA
A.   Sectoral Composition
2.01      Historically, this sector has been relatively insignificant, with
the possible exception of gold and iron ore. Although, as indicated in
1/   Notice to proceed was issued July 2, 1979.

Anrkex 2-,i there are geological indications of, inter alia, copper, lead-
zinc, asbestos, bauxite and phosphates, exploration efforts so far have been
minimal, chiefly owing to a lack of incentives for investment in high-risk
mining projects (paras. 2.06-2.08). The result has been that the share of GDP
originating in the mining sector is eve1.. 'ower in Colombia (0.9% in 1976) than
in such countries as Mexico (1.2%) and Argentina (1.2%) and considerably lower
than in mineral-rich countries such as Bolivia (15.4%) and Chile (13%).
1.   Current Operations
2.02      Metallic Minerais:  As sihown in Annex 2-2, output of metallic
minerals, except for iron ore, is insignificant. Iron ore, however, is
currently mined on a larger scale by Acerias Paz del Rio in Boyaca, for use
in its steel plant at Belencito. The only significant unexploited metallic
ore body in Colombia, well enough known as to be considered commercially
proven, is the Cerro Matoso nickel deposit.
2.03      Precious Metals:  Gold has traditionally been mined by artesianal
methods, mostly from placer and, cn a small scale, from vein-type deposits.
Only three medium-sized companies employ any degree of mechanization. The
metal is refined locally to separate the associated silver and platinum and
is sold to the Banco de la Republica. Officially, production in 1977 was
263,000 troy ounces of gold, 26,000 troy ounces of platinum and 100,000 troy
ounces of silver.
2.04      Emeralds:  Colombia has a virtual world monopoly in the production
of gem grade emeralds. In 1973, cifficial figures showed 109,000 carats
produced. However, the mines had to be closed in 1974 because of law and
order problems and no official production has been reported since. In 1977,
Empresa Minera Boyacense--a joint venture between private interests and the
Government's mining agency--was granted a five-year concession for the ex-
ploitation of Muzo, the major deposit formerly in production.
2.   Exploration
2.05      Exploration is currently, being carried out by AMOCO (US) in northern
Choco, in order to delineate a possibly significant porphyry copper deposit
grading 0.6%-0.7% copper. Also irL Choco, the Instituto Nacional de Geologia
y Minas (INGEOMINAS), which is the Government's geological service agency,
is exploring another porphyry prospect with UNDP assistance. In the course of
UNDP's program, at least seven gecchemically anomalous zones have also been
found in the central and coastal ranges of the Colombian Cordillera, and the
possibility of substantial copper porphyry discoveries appears to be good.
B.   Government Mining Policy
2.06      Historically, mining policy has been ill-defined and investment
in the sector has received a low priority. Foreign capital in non-petroleum
minerals has been minimal, and very little credit has been available to local
entrepreneurs.  Of total commercia,l bank credit extended from 1971 to 1976,



D- 3 -
only 0.5% was for extractrPe industries and outstanding mining credit at
mid-1976 was less than US$8 rillion.
2.07      The basic principles of Colombiaii mining legislaion are embodiei4
L.vi De;je. t2   or L7 C .Gernerally, all mlneral deposits are the property oF
the State.  All new foreign investment in the mining sector mtust be approved
by the Ministry of Mines and Energy.  There are no significant tax incentlve.oe
to stimulate foreign investment in the sector and mineral rights are no
granted muchll more seiectively, with title to large areas being reser;i- fo-
state erntit-ies,
2 .08     Although the overall picture' is not coniducive to rapid development t
the Coverinment has recenitlv begun actively to promote joint ventures between
state entinties and foreign corporations. Although, in certain subsectors,
specialized agencies have been created (eg., ECONIQUEL for nickel, CARBOCOIL
for coal and COILtRANIO for uranium), the Government's usual vehicle for sutch
investments is Empresa Colombiana de Minas (ECOMINAS).  Since a major cor-
straint on development of the mineral sector has been inadequate investmen!t
in exploration and mine development, the Goverinmentt has also established
INGEOMINIAS, wbich is Involved in mineral exploration.  However, INGEOMINAS
has only limited fundinig and without easier access to domestic credit or
significant incentives to foreign investors, it is unlikely that this and
the other entities can lead to a radicel restructiuring of what has been
historically a neglected sector.
C.  Develope,ntal Priorities
2.09      Outside petroletum, the Government's priority is exploitation of the
country's important coal reserves, particularly the Cerrejon project, where
CARBOCOL is in association with INTERCOR, a subsidiary of EXXON (US), and
where Bank assistance is envisaged.
2.10       In the public sector, the Government intends to continue its policv
of direct participation, either through ECOMINAS or through specialized
agencies, and to take advantage of the technical expertise of expatriate
partners acting as operators. In the private sector, there is so far little
attempt at coordinating the broad range of Government policies which affect
the large number of individual firms.  However, it is clear that there is a
need for expanded technical assistance, greater access to credit, a more
market-oriented pricing policy, greater emphasis on promoting the mergers Cor
small, uaeconomic mines and coordination and simplification of the process of
granting mineral concessions. This will entail a considerable strengtheninig
of the Government institutions serving the mining sector and may require the
creation of new financial institutions for exploration and mining.
!II. THE NICKEI, MARKET
A ,   a ck l, > cxond
3W1       As iAdicated below, market prospects for nickel at the present
time are unaclear and rather modest.  As shown in para. 3.38, there is a



-4 -
possibility that, even by 1985, there will still be an albeit small surplus
nickel capacity and there must, therefore, be some question whether nickel
prices will rise to levels which would support major new greenfield projects.
In this context, Cerro Matoso enjoys three distinct advantages.
(a) a firm take-or-pay contract for up to 100% of the product
(paras. 3.50-3.54);
(b) an orebody with 2.6% Ni, 1/ almost double that of most other
prospects and considerably better than many existing
operations (para. 5.15); and
(c) estimated capital and operating costs which are substantially
lower than other nickel prospects and which, indeed, compare
favorably with most projects implemented over the last
ten years (para. 8.08).
3.02      At the present time, Cerro Matoso is the only greenfield nickel
project under serious consideration, although a number of other prospects
are being investigated with a view to implementation by 1985 if the market
warranted them (para. 3.22). Whether these other projects will materialize
is, however, in doubt since there is no consensus at the present time whether
the overcapacity which presently exists is a temporary aberration which will
work itself out by 1981 (which is a position generally endorsed by nickel
producers), or whether it reflects a fundamental downward shift in the demand
curve for nickel (which is a view put forward in a number of independent
studies, e.g., the December 1977 report by Australian Mineral Economics Pty.)
If the latter view should prevail, Cerro Matoso may be the last greenfield
project for some years,. However, as indicated in Chapter IX, even under such
a pessimistic scenario, Cerro Matoso would still be financially viable and,
indeed, could do better than a number of recently implemented projects,
including sulphide operations in Australia.
3.03      Given the lack of general agreement on market trends, the present
analysis provides ranges for both future demand and capacity based on, inter
alia, GDP and steel growth rates and alternative hypotheses as to the likeli-
hood that specific projects will actually come on stream. The resulting
supply/demand balance (para. 3.38) indicates as a best estimate that, although
Class I nickel prices are likely to remain depressed through the early-1980s,
by 1985 prices are likely to have risen to approximately US$2.95/lb in 1979
terms (as compared to about US$2.08-US$2.20 in early 1979) and that they will
continue at or about this level thereafter. Even should there be no real
price increase, however, the Cerro Matoso Project would remain viable (para.
9.18) although at such prices established producers, such as Greenvale
(Australia) or Marinduque (Philippines), could not cover their full costs.
B.   Structure of the Industry
3.04      One of the major changes which has recently taken place is in the
structure of the industry. Historically, nickel has been the most highly
concentrated natural resource industry in the world. As recently as 1950,
the International Nickel Company of Canada (INCO) controlled 85% of production
1/   The ore extracted during the 25-year concession, under the envisaged
mining plan, will yield an average grade of 2.7% Ni (Annex 5-2).



- 5 -
in market economies and even in 1970, it still held 50%. However, this is
changing. In spite of the fact that the three producers who have tradition-
ally dominated the industry (INCO and Falconbridge of Canada and Societe le
Nickel of France) still control over 50% of the market, a number of new-
comers have recently entered and competition has now increased, particularly
in the production of Class II nickel (para. 3.07). Annex 3-1 gives a brief
description of the three major producers and of six of the more important
recent entrants (AMAX, Freeport Minerals and Hanna of the US; Sherritt
Gordon of Canada; Western Mining of Australia; and the Anglo-American Corpora-
tion of South Africa) and indicates the inter-linkages within the industry.
3.05       In spite of the difficulties they have experienced in entering the
market, these smaller producers often command considerable financial resources
and (as in the case of AMAX) they have been able to absorb considerable losses
in their nickel operations in order to increase their market share at the
expense, primarily, of INCO:

3.06       In addition, state mining companies in the USSR and Cuba have
managed to maintain about 22%-23% of the total world market and are clearly
not subject to the same economic pressures as the established producers.
What the intrusion of the newcomers and the increasingly aggressive role
of state companies mean is that INCO (and, to a lesser extent, Falconbridge
and Societe le Nickel) can no longer control output so as to influence prices
and optimize long-term profits. WhiLe one should not overestimate the degree
of competitiveness in the industry, -there are a number of additional companies
(including major petroleum and steel producers) actively considering nickel
production and, in addition, there is the longer-term threat of deep-sea
mining (para. 3.25)--all of which militate against a return to the classic
oligopoly of the last 50 years.



-6-
C.   The Role of Nickel
3.07      Nickel's value lies primarily in its ability to alloy with other
elements to impart increased strength and ductility. It is, however, not
a homogenous commodity and certain uses are restricted to specific types of
nickel:
-    Class I nickel is essentially pure, with a nickel
content approaching 100%, and has unrestricted use;
-    Class II nickel varies from 20% to 95% nickel and has
more or less restricted uses.
3.08      The major forms of Class I nickel include electrolytic cathodes
(produced by INCO and Falconbridge), pellets (INCO), powder (INCO), granules
(Falconbridge), briquettes (AMAX and Western Mining) and "rondelles" (Societe
le Nickel). The most important forms of Class II nickel are ferronickel
(produced by Falconbridge, Societe le Nickel, Hanna and INCO), oxide sinter
(Cubaniquel and INCO) and INCOMET (INCO). Ferronickel is produced most
commonly in the forms of pigs or ingots and usually has a nickel content of
20%-40%. Oxide products, on the other hand, often contain up to 90% nickel,
with an average nickel content of around 75%-77%. In 1976, Class I products
held about 55% of the world market and ferronickel and nickel oxide--both
Class II products--held about 35% and 10%, respectively.
3.09      The normal use of nickel is in the manufacture of six groups of
semi-finished products:
Nickel Used by Major Semi-Fabricated Product Group
% of
Nickel Use
1.  Stainless Steel        50    a) ferritic steel (< 0.5% nickel)
b) austentic steel (8%-12% nickel)
c) martensitic steel (0.5%-2.5% nickel)
d) age-hardened steel (3%-8% nickel)
2.  High Nickel Alloys    16    a) general corrosion and heat-resistant
alloys (30%-70% nickel)
b) superalloys (with aluminum or titanium)
c) electrical and magnetic alloys (60%-80%
nickel)
d) controlled expansion alloys
e) copper and brass alloys

3.10       Of these, as indicated below, ferronickel can be used for all
purposes except for plating and in superalloys and low alloy steels:

Class I                                                               Class II

Miscellaneous                  Other Nickel Oxides
3.11       Indeed, for the major user of nickel - the stainless steel industry -
cheaper grades of ferronickel may actually have an advantage over Class I
product:
(a) as the average size of the electric furnace increases,
metal losses through vaporization become significant
and the economic incentive to charge as little expensive
material as possible increases;



(b)  the introduction of Union Carbide's AOD steelmaking
process 1/ allows a lower grade of nickel, with higher
impurities, to be used by making it easier to control the
chemistry of chromium, silicon, manganese and sulphur; and
(c)  there is up to US$8/ton of savings in Fe units from using
a ferronickel charge with about 60%-80% Fe, which is not
insignificant in a highly competitive steel market.
3.12      Along with, for example, aluminum and molybdenum, nickel is a
"modern" metal with many of its applications occurring in high-technology
fields. In 1973, for instance, 16% of nickel consumed in market economies was
used in the chemical industry, 13/' in electronics, 8% in petroleum and 6% in
the aircraft industry. Only 3% was used in the construction industry. Nickel
is, however, potentially vulnerable to substitution. To some extent, there is
already substitution of low-nicke]L (and high-chromium) ferritic steels for
more expensive, high-nickel austenitic steel, particularly in the US where,
historically, austenitic steels have accounted for the bulk (65%-70%) of
stainless produced. There is also considerable research into the substitution
of ceramic parts for nickel in gas turbines. However, at present prices,
these trends are unlikely to pose a major threat to the historic role of
nickel. Perhaps more important is the growing use of plastics and coated
steel in the automobile industry which may erode traditional outlets for Class
I nickel.
D.   The International Nickel Market
1.   Historic Consumption of Nickel
3.13       Since nickel is a relatively modern metal, it has historically
enjoyed a higher growth rate than most others. Indeed, since 1900, the
average annual growth rate has been about 6% and from the end of World War II
to 1974/76 the average annual rate was even higher, although demand has tended
to exhibit 4-6 year cycles closely related to crude steel production. As
shown below, however, 1974 represented a peak and the current growth is only
about 3% per annum:

3.14       One of the rdasons for the lower growth rate at present is the
relative decline in military expenditures in the US following the termina-
tion of the Viet Nam war. A more important reason is the increasing economic
maturity of the developed market economies. As indicated below, the more
highly developed economies tend to have a higher per capita consumption of
nickel but a relatively low marginal propensity to consume. As more countries
approach or surpass US income leve:Ls, a significant flattening of their re-
spective nickel consumption growth rates can be expected to occur (para. 3.32)
and this will have a serious impact: on future demand for nickel.

i.15      fi should, however, be pointed out that, even over the post-1974
period, consumption of Class II nickel has increased substantially faster
than that of Class I. Indeed, the aiverage annual growth rate of Class I
nickel from 1966 to 1975 in market economies was only 0.4% while that of
Class II product was 9.4%. ia Japan, wher-e- economic recovery was faster
than in the US and Western Europe, the average growth rate for Class II nickel
was 13.2%. Although in the major markets there was a sharp downturn for all
forms of nickel in 1974/75, in each market the recovery by Class II nickel
has been considerably faster than that for Class I product. The reason for
this is clearly, at least in part, a function of the greater cost-consciousness
which world steelmakers are now hav:Lng to show in a highly competitive steel
market.
2.   Historic Supply of Nickel
3.16       Until the late 1950s, niclcel mine production was dominated by
Canadian sulphide ores which, in 1950, contributed about 95% of total nickel
supply in market economies. Since then, however, declining ore grades in
Ontario, changing steel technology and the entry of new firms into the indus-
try have led to greater geographic dispersion which has, in large part, been
associated with the shift to exploitation of lateritic ores which constitute
about 80% of world nickel reserves.

3.17      Historically, the supply of refined nickel has also been dominated
by Canadian producers--although both INCO and Falconbridge have tended to
refine much of their nickel through subsidiaries located abroad, in Wales and
Norway respectively. The criteria for location of refining facilities is,
however, affected by the type of ore being processed. For high-grade sulphide
operations, such as those which INCO arnd Falconbridge have historically con-
trolled, proximity to final markets is critical and transportation costs are
less important because of the possibility of concentrating sulphide ores or
shipping them as intermediate matte. One result of this is that Canada--
which presently still controls about 34% of world mine production-only
refines about 23% of the total, while Japan, the US, the UK and Norway--with
insignificant mine capacity--together refine almost 30% of the total. The
distribution of refined nickel production is given in Annex 3-2.
3.18      The increasing importance of laterites will, however, demand in-situ
processing since it is technically and economically infeasible to concentrate
these ores. Because smelting of laterites is extremely power intensive
(para. 6.01), the availability of reasonably-priced electric power may become
critical--particularly in areas like New Caledonia where the existing infra-
structure is virtually non-existent. At present the only significant trade in
unprocessed lateritic ore is from the Philippines, Indonesia and New Caledonia
to Japan. Even this, however, may soon be curtailed as Japan is forced to
close its domestic smelting operations for ecological reasons. At present,
Japan is not a significant importer of finished nickel (the US and the FR
Germany are the two major markets for finished nickel imports with 35% and
10% of total imports, respectively) but this is changing, and Japan will become
a major market for Cerro Matoso's production (para. 3.52).
3.   Projected Supply of Nickel
3.19      Up to recently, short-term market prospects for nickel were rather
bleak. At the end of 1977, there was an enormous overhang of producer inventories
equivalent to approximately six months' sales, which is two times higher than
normal. INCO estimated that, over the period January 1975-June 1977, approxi-
mately 190,000 MT (419 million lb) of finished nickel were added to total
producer inventories, of which INCO alone had added over 100,000 MT. It is
believed that INCO's inventories at the end of 1977 were greater than its
total deliveries during that year and, as of April 1978, it was reported that
INCO's inventories still totalled approximately 160,000 MT. Due to production
cutbacks and a strike at INCO's facilities in Sudbury (Canada), however,
nickel inventories were declining during the second half of 1978 and the first
quarter of 1979 and, by the end of May, were reported to have reached a normal
level. The reason for this overhang, the magnitude of which is indicated
below, is predominantly the over-optimistic demand forecasts made in the 1960s
on the basis of the rapid post-war growth rate for nickel (para. 3.13). A
direct result of this was heavy investment in new (and, owing to the lack of
infrastructure, relatively high-cost) nickel mines which have increased
total installed nickel capacity to approximately 900,000 MT.

3.21      Among the projects listed above which are not already firmly com-
mitted, Societe le Nickel's New Caledonia project will directly feed its new
smelter at Le Havre (France) and the Vlenezuelan project (like those in Brazil)
is geared directly to the local market and, hence, is less influenced by world
market trends.
3.22      In addition to this, there are up to 400,000 MT of "discretionary"
capacity which could come on stream by 1990 if market prospects were to
improve or if non-economic factors were to dictate production. As shown
below, a range of probabilities can be attached to the likelihood that these

3.23      Of these projects, the highest probabilities can be attached to
those which are expansions (such as EXMIBAL and INCO's Indonesian project) and
to those which may be implemented without reference to market conditions (e.g.
the Cuban and USSP projects). Of the other "likely" projects, the AMAX/BRGM



- 14 -
Joint Venture is particularly attractive since it is the only unexploited
deposit which has a Ni content even approaching that of Cerro Matoso (para.
5.15). Infrastructure requirements are, however, very much heavier for the
AM.AX ',RRM prospect.
3.24       A critical factor in determining whether an individual project will
or will rnot be implemented is its capital cost per annual lb, since depreciation
and interest charges together can constitute up to 45% of total costs in early
years. 1/  As indicated in para. 8.08, the capital cost of recent projects has
varied from a low of about US$6/lb to around US$10/lb in 1979 terms. With the
exception of Cerro Matoso which could be implemented for about US$6/lb, it is
unlikely that any of the "discreti.onary" greenfield projects listed above would
be realizable for less than US$10--US$12/lb. Assuming average production costs
for new projects of around US$1.40/lb, this would mean that these projects
could not be viable at prices less than about US$2.60-US$2.90/lb. For some of
the more expensive underground Australian projects, where production costs are
likely to be tup to US$2/1b, the threshhold price would be above US$3/lb.
3.25       In addition to land-bas(ed nickel, there is the additional prospect
of marine nickel from deep-sea manganese/nickel nodules.  Although deep-sea
mining is technically feasible, ilt is not yet clear whether political problems
can be overcome or at what nickel price it would become competitive. Indica-
tions are, however, that, on cost grounds, deep-sea mining might eventually
compete with greenfield lateritic projects, but probably never with Canadian
sulphide operations. In the shorter term, legal problems are, however,
so intractable that it is unlikely that significant quantities of sea-bed
nickel could come on the market biefore 1990 at the earliest and undersea
nickel is therefore excluded from this analysis.
3.26      An additional source of nickel, which is likely to be increasingly
important, is secondary nickel from scrap.  As the real unit cost of primary
nickel supply increases--as it must as a consequence of the increasing
importance of lateritic ores and as the low-cost sulphides ores from Sudbury
are depleted--the economic incentive to recycle nickel will increase.
3.27      Historically, world-wide only 50-60,000 MT of scrap nickel have
been consumed annually, although whenever there has been a significant price
increase for primary nickel there has been a corresponding surge in scrap
usage since scrap nickel generally sells at a 10%-15% discount.  At present,
the proportion of scrap nickel used (about 6% in the US in 1976) is consider-
ably lower than that of aluminum (27%) or copper (47%), at least in part owing
to the need for raw material quality control in producing nickel alloys.
However, in the present and projected steel market, stainless manufacturers
will be anxious to keep down raw material costs and, given improvements in
scrap recovery (particularly in recovering "white" metals) and continued
efforts to increase the flexibility of the furnace charge, this will favour
increased use of scrap in stainless steel production.
1/   Based on figures for the Greenvale project in Australia, where, in 1978
terms, total cost/lb is abouLt US$3.05 of which depreciation is about
US$0.46 and interest charges about US$0.88, or about 44% of total cost.
This, however, may be exceptional since interest and depreciation consti-
tute only about 22% of total costs at FALCONDO in the Dominican Republic.



3.28      Taking into account the foregoing, the table below illustrates
the ranges of potential land-based supp:Ly that could be anticipated from 1980
to 1990:
Projected Nickel Capacity
(000 MT - Contained Nickel)

/a   An attrition rate of 2% per annum has been assumed.
3.29      If only those projects which are considered to be firmly committed
or highly probable are implemented, total capacity will be in the range of
1.05 million MT by 1985.
3.30      It will be noted that the majority of new projects are based on
laterite deposits. Although the carbonvl process allows laterites to produce
Class I product, most lateritic-based projects will produce either ferronickel
or oxide sinter. By 1985, therefore, one can assume that approximately 55% of
capacity will be capable of producing C:Lass II nickel. This is in line with
the projection by AMAX that consumption of Class II product will equal that of
Class I nickel by 1983 (para. 3.49).
4.   Projected Nickel Demand
3.31      The main factors which observers have suggested have resulted in a
fundamental shift downwards in the overall demand curve for nickel are:
(a)  the lower GNP growth rates now anticipated for developed
market economies;
(b)  the greater economic maturity of Japan and many Western
European economies;
(c)  the relative decline of military-related expenditures
in the US and Western Europe;



- 16 -
(d)  the increasing importance of ferritic (low nickel) stainless
steels; and
(e)  the increasing use of plastics and other nickel substitutes
in uses other than for stainless production (e.g., for auto-
mobile trim).
3.32      The most important cf these is the lower economic growth rate fore-
cast. The latest Bank projections foresee real GDP growth rates for OECD
(North) countries as averaging 4.2'%-4.3% during the 1978-90 period, with the
growth rate in the US and the major economies of Western Europe being only
in the 3.8%-4.0% range. As shown below, the Bank has also projected that
steel/GDP ratios for developed economies will actually fall while the income
elasticities of demand for steel (which measure essentially the same thing)
in developing countries will do no more than remain approximately constant:

for steel) and, as we have already! seen (para. 3.15) Class II consumption has
grown significantly faster than that of Class I nickel. Nickel consumption--
and, particularly, Class II nickel consumption--however, is more closely
correlated with the growth of stainless steel than that of raw steel in
general. The proportion of stainless steel as a percentage of the total
steel market has increased, at an annual average rate of about 7%, from only
0.8% in 1962 to approximately 1.3% in 1977.
3.34      Based on the Bank's GDP growth projections and the steel elasti-
cities indicated above, the Bank has estimated that steel consumption will
rise more slowly over the next ten years than over the last twenty years:

Source:  IBRD Economic Analysis and Projections Dept., April 1978.
3.35      These projections are generally in line with those put forward by
other institutions, e.g., a 1977 study by the AISI forecast a world steel con-
sumption figure for 1985 of between 1.0 and 1.1 million MT, as compared with
Bank estimates of between 0.97 and 1.0 million MT, and a UNIDO study forecast
a 1985 total of 1.07 million MT. A recent IISI study, however, forecasts a
somewhat higher total steel growth rate of 4.4% for 1985-90, on the basis
of growth rates of 3.2% for industrialized countries, 8.1% for developing
countries and 4.3% for centrally-planned economies.
3.36      The general consensus that the rate of growth of steel consumption
in developed economies will slow considerably, has serious implications for
nickel since the bulk of stainless steel is produced and consumed in those
markets for which the lowest growth raLtes are projected (Annex 3-3). While
stainless steel will probably continue to increase its share of steel pro-
duction in developed countries at approximately the same rate as heretofore,
it will remain insignificant in the faLstest growing section of the steel
market--the developing countries. Assuming that, in developed economies,
stainless production continues to outpace raw steel production by the same
margin as during the 1955-75 period, but that it does no more than hold its
own in developing countries and centraLlly-planned economies, the average
annual growth rate for world consumption of stainless steel would be approx-
imately 4.5%-5.0% from 1976 to 1980 and 4.0%-4.5% from 1980 to 1985. Based
on the historic relationship between nickel consumption and stainless steel
production, this would imply growth rates for nickel consumption of around
4.5% per annum to 1980 and about 4.0% from 1980 to 1985. As already indicated,
however, it may be overly optimistic simply to extrapolate historic nickel/
steel or nickel/stainless relationships since the market for Class I nickel
is likely to be affected by substitution and since, even in stainless, there
is a shift to lower-nickel alloys. Among more pessimistic observers, the
December 1977 study by Australian Mineral Economics Pty. (AME) projected
a 1976-87 trend growth rate for consumption of primary nickel of only 3.4%



- 18 -
per annum, at least in part owing to the assumption that the nickel intensity
of fixed capital investment will fall as more economies move into the mature
category and as the range of available substitutes--particularly for Class I
nickel--increases.
3.37      The impact of projecting a number of long-term growth rates is
indicated in the table below:

As can be seen, excluding the pessimistic AME study which assumed an OECD GDP
growth rate of only 3.0%, there is a considerable consensus that by 1980
demand will be 800-900,000 MT, that by 1985 it will be 1.0-1.2 million
MT and that by 1990 it will be in the range 1.20-1.40 million MT.
5.   Projected Supply/Demand Balance
3.38      As can clearly be seen in the table below, which compares likely
ranges of supply and demand, it is probable that surplus capacity will con-
tinue until at least the early 1980s. To some extent this can be compounded
by the high levels of inventories (para. 3.19), although these are being run
down as producers were cutting back 1978 production to about 60%-65% of



- 19 -
capacity and both INCO and SLN suffered the effects of strikes. 1/ By 1985,
however, a market for the higher-cost: discretionary capacity referred to in
paras. 3.22 to 3.24 should develop, and by 1990 additional land-based nickel
will be required if deep-sea mining does not come on stream as anticipated:

Anticipated Surplus (Deficit)        180-280         0-50      (230)-0
E.   Nickel Prices
3.39      The price outlook through to the early 1980s is, clearly, not
promising, although the projected supply/demand balance would indicate that
prices will have to rise by the mid-1980s if higher-cost discretionary capa-
city is to be brought on stream.
1.   Historic Prices
3.40       In the past, the nickel industry has been subject to a producer
pricing system, led by INCO. As shown below, this has led to relatively
stable nickel prices (compared with, for example, the cyclicality associated
with copper) and to stable discounts for various impure grades. 2/

3.41      However, during the oversupply of the last 2-3 years, the newer
entrants to the industry began significant discounting from INCO's posted
price and, since early 1977, INCO--whose present average costs are still
substantially below those of its competitors--has dropped its published
prices and has competed aggressively, thereby exacerbating the downward
pressure on prices. Although the precipitous price decline of the second
half of 1977 bottomed out in 1978 and prices actually began to stabilize
and improve during the first quarter of 1978 when producers maintained
their existing price levels, a new round of price reductions took place
early in the second quarter and set the trend for the remainder of the
year. Only by the end of 1978, when inventories were reduced by production
cut-backs and a strike at INCO, whiich was settled only in early June 1979,
did prices begin to improve and the major producers (INCO, Falconbridge and
SLN) returned to the posted price system. During the first quarter of
1979, prices showed a marked upward trend, 1/ but it would be premature to
expect this trend to firm up consiiderably while inventories, although reduced,
are still a factor. As shown below, it is difficult--even taking into account
the oligopolistic nature of the industry--to sustain marked real price in-
creases in the face of the continuing oversupply.

2.   Projected Prices
3.42       Based on the surplus capacity indicated in para. 3.38 and the present
inventories to be worked off, it would be unrealistic to project a major real
price increase for nickel before the mid-1980s. Nevertheless, there is a
consensus that the 1977/78 prices were abnormally low and that there must be
some adjustment to historically more normal levels which will at least earn a
reasonable return to low-cost producers such as INCO and Falconbridge. This
may already be beginning to take place, although it should be noted that the
Windarra sulphide mine in Australia began what is expected to be a two-year
1/   First quarter 1979 average nickel producer prices (Class I nickel) in
US$/lb are as follows: January: 2.08; February: 2.10; March: 2.20;
April: 2.46. In May 1979 INCO announced a price increase of
US$0.35/lb, and by June prices reached the US$3.00/lb level, but it is
uncertain if this price level will be maintained after INCO resumes full
production.



- 21 -
shutdown at the end of June 1978 owing to depressed nickel prices. By the mid-
1980s, however, real price increases above what have historically been consid-
ered normal levels will become necessary if discretionary capacity, which is
likely to cost over US$10/lb in 1979 terms, is to be brought into production.
As sea-bed mining of manganese/nickel nodules becomes more important, prices
will tend to stabilize or, in the view of some observers (and as has been
conservatively assumed in this report), may even show a slight decline.
3.43      Given the dependence of Class II production on stainless steel and
the low steel growth rates which are forecast for developed economies, it is
likely that the historic spread between Class I and Class II prices will
continue. If the steel market in general, or the stainless market in parti-
cular, were to grow faster than presently anticipated, however, this discount
may close and, indeed, it has been suggested that consumers may be willing to
pay a premium for the additional Fe units in ferronickel.
3.44      Based on the foregoing anaLysis, the price forecasts presented below
are a reasonable reflection of the likely impact of the projected supply/demand
picture. The recent behaviour of the nickel market and the changes which have
occurred in the structure of the industry do, however, indicate that these
forecasts should be used with caution:

F.   The Market for Cerro Matoso
3.45      Taking account of the uncertainties surrounding the world nickel
market, the critical factors which will affect the viability of the Project
will be the competitiveness of Cerro Matoso product and the existence of
a take-or-pay contract for Cerro Matc,so's output.



- 22 -
1.   Competitiveness of Cerro Matoso Product
3.46      Cerro Matoso's ferronickel will be in the form of pigs weighing
approximately 20 kg and having approximately the specifications shown below:
Specifications of Cerro Matoso Ferronickel /a

3.47      These specifications on the whole compare favorably with other
ferronickels as shown in Annex 3-4. However, although Cerro Matoso product
will be lower in carbon, sulphur and silica than those of a number of its
competitors, Hanna's own ferronickel from Riddle, Oregon will probably remain
the premium product from the point of view of minimal impurities. Since Cerro
Matoso's product is likely to be fully comparable with other forms of ferro-
nickel, its ultimate competitiveness is, therefore, closely tied to that of
ferronickel generally which, in turn, is tied to the market for stainless
steel where about 75%-80% of fertonickel is used.
3.48      As already discussed, although stainless steel is likely to continue
to grow in importance in developed countries, overall steel growth rates in
those countries are likely to be low. Nevertheless, there are a number of
factors which are working in favor of ferronickel in general and Cerro
Matoso's product in particular:
(a)  the free iron in ferronickel results in a savings of up
to 10% in Fe units which may be important;
(b)  the Ontario operations of INCO and Falconbridge are
increasingly subject to disruption over labor contracts
and a one-month's stoppage would lose more nickel than
Cerro Matoso's annual output;
(c)  much of the domestic Japanese nickel smelting industry
is expected to shut down by 1980/81, at which time a major
new market--which has historically been exceptionally cost
conscious--will open up in which Class II product will
compete at an advantage and in which Cerro Matoso will
suffer no locational d:isadvantage; and



23 -
(d) it is likely that by the early 1980s virtually all stain-
less steel will be manufactured in AOD vessels (para. 3.11),
which will greatly increase steelmakers' tolerance of impuri-
ties and open additional markets to ferronickel.
3.49      An O,iober 1977 study, prepared by AMAX 1/, confirms that by 1983
the split between Class I and Class II nickel will be about 50:50 (as opposed
to approximately 55:45 at present) and that the potential annual market for
Class II products (which is defined as being 90% of the nickel used in stain-
less steel, 90% of nickel used in copper and brass alloys and 50% of nickel
used in ferrous castings) will be about 300,000 MT by 1980 and approximately
500-600,000 MT by 1985. Cerro Matoso's annual output of 20,000 MT (para. 5.01)
would be only about 4% of this total and, given the ready acceptance which
FALCONDO's very similar product has had and consumers' preference not to rely
on a single supplier, there should be no problem in disposing of this quantity.
2.   Marketing Arrangements
3.50      According to the sales arrangements, which have been substantially
finalized, Cerro Matoso will sell 100% of its product to Billiton Metals and
Ores B.V. of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group on a 13-year, take-or-pay basis
after the start of commercial production and that the price will be an average
of the actual prices paid in the markets where the nickel is sold, less a
discount. This discount will be between US$0.13/lb, at prices up to US$2/lb
(representing, at that point, 6.5% of the nickel price), tapering to 5%, at
prices of US$5/lb and up. Without such an arrangement, the viability of the
Project would be in some doubt. Final signature of a contract agreeable
to the Bank will be a condition of loan effectiveness and the contract will
not be amended except with prior Bank approval.
3.51      Although Billiton has long been involved in metals trading and is
dominant in tin production, its experience in nickel is limited. However, in
August 1977, it obtained a 50% interest in the recently-closed Windarra mine
in Western Australia, which in 1976 produced about 13,000 MT of nickel in
concentrates. Billiton is also involved, with Lockheed (US), AMOCO (US)
and other partners, in an undersea mlining consortium.
3.52      Although, as indicated in para. 4.10, Billiton has extensive ex-
perience in mineral exploration and production, what it really brings to the
Project is its marketing expertise. Billiton has individual, wholly-owned
marketing organizations in Holland, FR Germany, the UK and the US. It also
has trading subsidiaries in France and Holland. It is, therefore, particular-
ly well placed to distribute Cerro Matoso ferronickel in the European market.
In addition, it intends to sell in Japan and it was originally envisaged that
Nisshin, Toyo Menka and Kawasaki would join the Project as equity partners.
Although this has not occurred, it is still expected that Nisshin and Kawasaki
will be significant purchasers of Cerro Matoso product.
3.53      Should Cerro Matoso's production exceed the design capacity of the
plant, the remainder would be taken by Billiton on an option basis or be sold

on the spot market, initially on a reimbursable cost basis by Hanna and
subsequently by Cerro Matoso itself.  Since Hanna's own ferronickel production
will at best hold constant, it is expected that there will be little problem
disposing of this through traditional contacts on the world uarket.  It is not
expected, for the time being, that there will be any domestic consumption of
Cerro Matoso's ferronickel.
3.54      In the opinion of the Bank staff, the proposed sales arrangement with
Billiton is critical to the success of the Project since it w-ll remove from
Cerro Matoso the real possibility that, in what may continue a depressed
market in its early years of operations, the Company would be unable to sell
its product and that it would, therefore, accumulate excessive inventories at
a time when it is least able to bear their cost. While the price risk clearly
remains with Cerro Matoso, as indicated in the financial analysis in Chapter
IX, the Project is expected to be far better placed to survive nickel prices
up to 20% or 30% lower than thiose which have been projected than many of the
other mines which have opened during the last 5-10 years.
IV. THE COMPANY AND ITS SPONSORS
A.   Background
4.01      The Cerro Matoso project has had a long and complex history.  The
orebody was located by the Richmond Petroleum Co.--a subsidiary of Standard
Oil of California (Chevron)--in the early 1950s, and the initial Concession
Agreement was signed in 1963. Subsequently, Richmond and the Hanna Mining Co.
set up a 50:50 Joint Venture to finance further exploration in the general
area and established an operating company, Minera Chevron, for exploration of
Cerro Matoso.
4.02      The 1963 Concession Agreement was modified in 1970 to reflect the
establishment of CONICOL S.A. as a subsidiary of Hanna and the consequently
diminished role of Chevron. At the same time, a further Joint Venture agree-
ment was entered into between CONICOL and Empresa Colombiana de Niquel Ltda.
(ECONIQUEL), a subsidiary of the Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI). This
Agreement defined the period of exploitation of the deposit as 25 years, ex-
tendable by 5 years. In addition, it set a deadline of 26 months, extendable
by only 12 months, for construction of the plant. This period was to commence
with the submission of information, which was in fact presented in November
1977. Since notice to proceed was given in early July 1979, and it is expec-
ted that construction thereafter will take about 31 to 34 months, the 38 month
deadline will clearly have to be renegotiated. The Government has indicated
its willingness to grant such an extension. This, and the transfer of the
Concession to the newly-formed Cerro Matoso, S.A., are a condition of
effectiveness.
4.03      The 1970 Joint Venture Agreement was also amended to reflect the
change in the relative shareholdings. Originally, the CONICOL:ECONIQUEL
shareholding split of the joint venture was 67:33. This was subsequently
changed to a 60:40 CONICOL:ECONIQUEL split, with ECONIQUEI, picking up a higher
share of pre-operating expenses.

B.   Ownership
4.04      The J,int Venture led to thLe creation of Cerro Matoso, S.A., (CMSA)
a Colombian corporation which was incorporated in March 1979. The sharehold-
ings are: ECONIQUEL--45%; Billiton---35%; and CONICOL--20%. As discussed
below (para. 9.15), financial covenants were agreed to ensure that CMSA
maintains a sound financial structure.
C.   The Sponsors and Shareholders
1.   Empresa Colombiana de Niquel Ltda. (ECONIQUEL)
4.05      ECONIQUEL was established in 1970 as the vehicle for IFI's invest-
ment in the Cerro Matoso project. IFI is an agency of the Ministry of Economic
Development which operates, under the authorization of Law 16 of 1973, to pro-
mote industrial development through public sector participation. At the end
of 1977, IFI had equity investments totalling approximately Col$2.6 billion
(approximately US$61 million) and loans outstanding of Col$3.2 billion (US$75
million). Amongst its investments in the mining sector are a 38.8% holding in
CARBOCOL (para. 2.08) and a 37.5% holding in a soda ash plant. The Board of
Directors of IFI includes representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the
Central Bank, the Central Mortgage Bank and the Office of the President, as
well as from the Ministry of Economic Development. IFI's authorized capital,
at present, is Col$5 billion (US$118 million) and, if this is to be increased,
approval must be forthcoming from the National Planning Office, the Ministry
of Finance and the Economic and Social Council (CONPES).
4.06      Since ECONIQUEL is a subsidary of IFI, the Chairman of its Board
is IFI's Director-General. Also on the Board are the Minister of Mines and
Energy and representatives of other Government agencies. ECONIQUEL receives
its entire financing from IFI.
4.07      ECONIQUEL's Administration is headed by the Company's Director-
General, who is appointed by the Board of Directors and is assisted by a
7-man Technical Committee. Although several positions on this Committee are
presently unfilled, the quality of the personnel is high and it should serve
effectively to liaise between the private sponsors and the Colombians during
implementation and operations.
2.   Compania de Niquel Colombiano S.A. (CONICOL)
4.08      CONICOL was established in 1970 as a Delaware-registered corpora-
tion. Originally, Chevron held 12-1/2% of its equity but, owing to dilution,
this has now dropped to 3-1/2% and it is anticipated that Hanna, the only
other shareholder, will eventually buy out the remainder. Although CONICOL's
Bogota office is relatively small, the Company retains a full-time lawyer and
includes shipping, importation and industrial relations departments which are
headed by former civil servants who have ready access to senior Government
officials and are well placed to expedite project implementation.

4.U9      TIe Hanna Mining Co. is a publicly-owned, Cleveland-based mining
and transportation Company, whose principal mining interests, given in Annex 4,
include iron ore, coal and nickel in the US, Canada, Brazil and Guatemala.
Selected recent financial indicators are shown below and illustrate that Hanna
(like most other mining companies) has recently hit a depressed market. It
should, however, be pointed out that Hanna's 1978 results were adversely
affected by a 6-week shutdown at Riddle and by a strike which closed down
the Iron Ore Company of Canada in early March. As is also evident, Hanna
tends to be a financially prudent company, and its working capital and debt
service ratios reflect this conservatism.

It has been agreed tat the Joint Venture assets will be gradually transferred
to CMSA, and that tlese sunk costs will not exceed US$27 million.
E.   Organization and Management of CMSA
4.12      The proposed Organization Chart for operations is given on the
following page. Although this is still preliminary, the division of re-
sponsibilities is reasonable. The role of ECONIQUEL's Technical Committee
will be of particular importance since it will: (i) act as technical and
administrative supervisor; (ii) ensure the proper training of all Colombian
personnel; (iii) ensure that the Colombians are supplied with complete tech-
nical and process information; and (iv) ensure that ECONIQUEL is adequately
informed on all decisions contemplated or taken that affect the Project.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope
5.01      The Project consists of the development of an open pit mine to
extract during a 25-years' concession an annual average of 780,000 dry metric
tons (DMT) of lateritic ore containing an average of 2.7% nickel, which is to
be processed into approximately 42.3 million lb (about 20,000 DMT) of nickel
contained in ferronickel with an ELverage grade of 37.5%. The single-line ore
processing facilities will include: coarse crushing and ore stockpiling and
blending facilities; drying, fine crushing and screening facilities with
associated dry ore storage and conveyors; a coal handling and storage system;
coal blending and facilities for the agglomeration of the ore-coal mixture;
calcining in a rotary kiln; ore transfer and smelting in an electric arc
furnace; slag handling and disposal; hot metal handling and refining; pig
casting and shipping. Ancillary on-site facilities will include shops, ware-
houses, medical facilities, utililties, laboratories and offices. Related
off-site facilities will include a townsite, river barge loading and un-
loading facilities, an access road, a natural gas pipeline and airstrip
improvements.
B.   Project Location
5.02      Cerro Matoso is located in northwestern Colombia in the Department of
Cordoba, approximately 430 km south of the port of Cartagena (Map IBRD 12480).
The maximum elevation of the orebody is 270 m above sea level although the
gently rolling, surrounding terrain averages only about 60 m. The main land
use in the area is low-density cattle grazing. The climate is tropical with
an average annual rainfall of 190 cm.
5.03      The project site is connected by about 22 km of gravel road to the
provincial town of Montelibano, with a population of about 10,000, where the
future townsite will be located. Twelve kilometers of graded road connect
Montelibano with the paved highway which leads south to the industrial center
of Medellin (333 km) and north to, the Atlantic ports of Cartagena and
Barranquilla (538 km). Caucasia, approximately 30 km southeast of Montelibano,
is located on the navigable CaucaL river and offers a wharf site for the river
barges which will bring in heavy equipment during implementation, and for
shipping ferronickel out during operations.

C.   Project Description
1.   The Orebody
(a) Geology
5.04      The ore body is a typical nickel laterite, similar to FALCONDO in
the Dominican Republic, in which the nickel occurs in hydrous nickel-magnesium
silicates. It was formed by the weathering and secondary enrichment of a
peridotite plug. The peridotite body is about 2,500 x 1,700 m, bounded by
steeply dipping faults. Most of it is capped by residual soil and decomposed
and weathered ("saprolitized") rock which varies from zero to over 100 m in
thickness. The lower part of this lateritic weathering zone constitutes the
ore body. The end result of the weathering process by which the nickel was
concentrated is a roughly layered deposit with a low nickel iron canga 1/ and
lateritic soils overlying nickeliferous zones of partially weathered peridotite
that, in turn, grades downward into the unaltered parent rock which forms the
sterile footwall. Typically, the highest nickel values are found in partly
weathered material overlying the parent rock.
5.05      The non-economic overburden consists of canga and laterite and
the orebody itself of saprolite, saprolitized peridotite and silica boxwork.
Saprolite is a partially weathered compact material which retains the texture
and structure of the unweathered peridotite. About 75% of the proven reserves
(Annex 5-1) consist of saprolite, averaging around 3.0% nickel, 10%-15% mag-
nesia and around 15% iron. Saprolitized Peridotite is a soft, weathered
material occurring along fractures and bordering joint blocks in the peridotite
bedrock beneath the saprolite. In areas where the weathering and enrichment
are sufficiently intense, ore grade material may result and roughly 15% of the
proven ore reserve is classified as saprolitized peridotite. Silica Boxwork
consists of massive banded veins of chalcedony and quartz occurring along
minor joints and fractures in each of the major zones. Near the surface, most
of this material is essentially barren but boxworks in the lower parts of the
ore zone may carry appreciable amounts of nickel. About 10% of the proven
reserves consists of boxwork ore of various types.
(b) Exploration
5.06      The various exploration programs carried out at Cerro Matoso can
be divided into three phases: (i) From 1958 to 1962 fourteen test pits were
sunk manually of which all but eight were too shallow to reach the nickeli-
ferous saprolites. Thereafter, 66 holes were drilled on a 200 m grid system
1/   Canga:  a hard ferrugineous crust covering part of the orebody, consist-
ing largely of lateritic soil cemented by hydrated iron oxides. Laterite:
a soft earthy soil, generally found immediately under the canga. It
typically contains less than 1.5% nickel, is leached of silica and rep-
resents the end-product of the normal weathering cycle. In a few areas,
the lower part of the zone contains sufficient nickel to be included as
ore. However, only about 2% of the proven reserves for the Project is
derived from this zone.



- 31 -
and 4,500 lb of drill cuttings were sent to the Hanna laboratories for pre-
liminary metallurgical testwork. This was followed in 1962 by a larger,
35 MT sample; (ii) In 1964, a second stage drill program was initiated with
motor-assisted auger-chop drills. The program was designed to fill in the
drilling grid to a 100 m spacing, to reach the bottom of the ore in the
lower regions and to permit a preliminary estimate of ore reserves; (iii)
From 1971 on, a diesel-powered Becker drill was designed specifically for
Cerro Matoso. The drill began operating on a 100 m grid and covered the
entire mining area. In addition, drilling sections 50 m apart were completed
over an area containing sufficient reserves for the first 10 to 15 years of
mining.
5.07      The initial drilling campaign yielded more than 1,500 drill samples.
Since the start of the mechanized drilling program, an additional 31,000
samples were collected and processed. Prior to 1972, all samples were sent
to Hanna laboratories, with 5%-10% being independently check-assayed. Cur-
rently, after the establishment of analytical facilities at Cerro Matoso, only
one in thirty samples is checked by Hanna. A review of 225 check samples
showed an accuracy of + 0.05% Ni, + 1.5% Fe, + 0.47% MgO and + 1.51% SiO2'
5.08       In the opinion of Bank staff, the exploration program has been
carried out in a competent and professional manner consistent with accepted
practices commonly used for a deposit of this type.
(c) Ore Reserves
5.09      Total ore reserves were calculated in 1976.  The ore reserve cal-
culations were based on the standard "area of influence" method. This method
gives good results on blanket-type deposits like Cerro Matoso, where the
horizontal extension of the ore body is disproportionately much greater than
the vertical dimension, and where the characteristics of a single sample
interval cannot be projected for any great distance.
5.10      Because of the characteristic discontinuity of lateritic ore
deposits, rigorous criteria were applied. The basic requirement was that
at least 6 contiguous meters must assay more than 1.5% nickel to qualify for
inclusion in the ore reserve. However, in order to obtain a minimum ore depth
of 8 m, enough intervals of waste were included to make up for this depth.
Isolated intrusions of material containing more than 1.5% nickel above or
below the main ore zone were excluded from the reserve unless the intrusion
would serve to increase the average grade of the waste layer to 1.5% or better.
Internal waste intervals were included with ore zones unless they exceeded 10
m of thickness, in which event they were considered to be strippable.
5.11      Within the measured ore reserves, there is a higher grade central
section. For estimation in this area a minimum vertical ore zone of 10 m
was used and, as far as possible, on:Ly holes with a minimum of 10 contiguous
meters of material assaying over 2% nickel were included. Mine planning has
assumed that this area would be mined first, with mining subsequently expand-
ing into progressively lower grades 1'para. 5.13).



- 32 -
5.12       The exact position of the top and bottom contacts of the ore zone
can be expected to vary significantly over horizontal distances of 5 m or
less. Although every effort will be made to establish the ore-waste contact
during actual mining, it will obviously not be possible to avoid mining s me
waste with the ore and vice versa.  It has been issumed thaS, for every m  of
ore block in the hangingwall and footwall, 2.9 m and 1.9 m , respectively,
are dilution. The chosen mining method is flexible enough to follow the
contacts closely and to be able to separate waste and ore effectively. The
assumed dilution factor, therefore, is to be considered conservative.
5.13      Application of the above criteria to the drilling data resulted
in identification of three stages of reserves, to be exploited sequentially,
which form the mineable reserves for the project as shown below:

5.14       In addition to these reserves, 41 million MT of ore between 1.0%
and 1.5% nickel grade have been outlined in an area immediately adjacent to
the orebody.
5.15       It is the opinion of the staff that the ore reserve calculations
are based on sufficient and accurate data and have been carried out with due
care in a competent and professional manner. The orebody has been explored in
greater detail than usual and very stringent criteria have been applied. As
indicated below, apart from some continuing operations in New Caledonia, this
is the highest grade nickel laterite deposit presently known in the world:

2.   The Mine
(a) Mining and Stripping
5.16      Since most of the Cerro Matoso ore occurs as a relatively shallow
hillside deposit, the ore body is ideally suited for conventional, open-pit
mining and the stripping ratio for the first 25 years is only approximately
1.3:1. The ore block to be mined dur:ing Stage I has been chosen to fit
rationally into the overall mining plan and its initial exploitation will not
prejudice development of Stages II and III later. The operating cost estimates
assume that only 25% of total materia:L will require light blasting whereas the
remainder can be loaded directly by the shovels. As mine development proceeds,
two distinct material types will be separately stockpiled. The iron-bearing
canga will be moved to one stockpile, while footwall rock and lean laterite
with nickel values between 1.0% and 1.5% will be placed in another stockpile
for possible future use. Other stripped material will be placed in waste
dumps. The mine development and production plan (Annex 5-2) calls for the
stripping of about 4.6 million WMT beiFore the start of operations. Pre-
production stripping will begin two years before start-up on a single shift
basis and will intensify during the last year. After production commences,
stripping will be carried out on two shifts, six days per week.
5.17      The Cerro Matoso ore body d:isplays a characteristic lack of
mineralogical uniformity. To obtain optimum metallurgical results, it is
important to maintain the most consisitent feed possible. This dictates mining
and blending of ore from several working areas. Three 7 m working benches
are, therefore, planned to allow for selective mining. The mobile mining
equipment chosen will allow for ample flexibility and mine planning will make
available at all times approximately four times more exposed working face area
than that required. Mining will be carried out on the first shift, 6 days per
week, 300 shifts per year, utilizing ithe same six 31.8 MT trucks as in strip-
ping. Excavation will be by hydraulic front shovels, one on each of the three
benches. Combined production capacity of the three shovels will exceed the
nominal one million WMT per year feed rate required.



- 34 -
5.18      liie equipment selected is conservatively sized and can easily handle
the material. Equipment cycles were based on a 6-hour effective shift which,
in itself, provides a reasonable safety factor.
5.19      The mining methoa and equipmenL cnosen are influenced by the need
for mobility to maintain mining flexibility. The mining plan is therefore
based on hydraulic excavators, end dumping trucks, mobile drilling equipment
and dozers and provides a high degree of flexibility to cope with unforeseen
operational difficulties.
(b) Ore Stockpiling and Blending
5.20      Quality control is essential in this type of process where the
smelting characteristics of the sl]ag, rather than the nickel content, govern
efficiency. This in turn is governed by the magnesia:silica:iron ratios of
the ore. Even a small range of variation can produce either a viscous slag
with associated metallic nickel losses or an excessively fluid slag which
causes erosion of the refractories in the electric furnace.
5.21      In order to optimize the composition of the smelter feed, a com-
prehensive quality control program has been designed including: (i) an
emergency stockpile prior to the primary crusher; (ii) a mechanical sampling
station between the crusher and stacker; (iii) eight stockpiles, each of
which is capable of handling one full day's production and which are available
for blending; and (iv) two blended stockpiles selected from the eight, each
containing one week's ore supply to the processing plant. These are indicated
in the flow sheet on the following page. The quality control procedures
envisaged are based on sound assumptions and backed by statistical simulations
which show that a standard plant feed can indeed be achieved with a high
degree of probability. The approach can be regarded as conservative and is
highly satisfactory.
3.   The Process
(a) Pilot Plant Testing
5.22      Between 1971 and 1976 there were 3 phases of pilot plant testing:
(i) 1971-72: A pilot plant, based on a Shaft Furnace/Electric Furnace (SF/EF)
configuration, was built at Riddle, Oregon, and tests were carried out which
showed that the Cerro Matoso ore could be converted, using this process, into
a high-grade ferronickel; (ii) 1972-73: Small-scale tests were carried out in
Norway by Elkem Spigerverket A/S, which verified that an alternative Rotary
Kiln/Electric Furnace (RK/EF) plant configuration r.ould also produce high-
grade ferronickel and do so at a lower cost; and (iii) 1975-76: A 2.5 ton
per hour RK/EF pilot plant was buailt at Riddle to verify the results of the
Norwegian tests.
5.23      The RK/EF process produces ferronickel by selective reduction using
coal as reductant. This is accomplished by drying run-of mine ore and by fine
crushing and carefully proportioning and mixing the coal and ore. The mixture
is agglomerated, dried and calcined in the rotary kiln, and then smelted in
the electric furnace to produce ferronickel and slag. The ferronickel is

further refined to lower sulphur and phosphorus levels. The advantage of the
RK/EF process is that it allows controlled reduction, which limits the amount
of iron in the metal. Although the RK/EF combination is new in lateritic
nickel smelting, the characteristics of the individual units are well-known
and have been established individually in existing nickel matte operations.
5.24      Determination of the amount of nickel lost in the slag was among
the most important metallurgical information obtained from the pilot tests.
Based on losses in the slag and elsewhere, total recovery of nickel from the
ore is estimated to be 92.3% in Stage I, 91.2% in Stage II, and 89.0% in Stage
III.
5.25      The Riddle tests also provided data for the design criteria used in
the feasibility study. A total of 4,215 DMT of Riddle ore and 3,400 DMT of
Cerro Matoso ore were treated at Riddle, the former being used for "running-in"
the plant and to simulate specific silica:magnesia ratios which were expected
during the operating life of the mine.
5.26      The final phase of the Riddle tests was witnessed by Bank staff and
it is the staff's opinion that the tests were carried out in an exhaustive and
thorough manner. The behavior of Cerro Matoso ore actually expected during
the various stages of mining must now be considered well known.
(b) Design Criteria
5.27      The pilot tests demonstrated that the RK/EF process can produce high-
grade ferronickel using Cerro Matoso ores of widely varying compositions with
equipment long established in the production of ferronickel and matte, thereby
offering the advantage of minimizing the risk when scaling up to commercial
size. A single-line plant was chosen in view of an estimated 30% reduction in
total capital cost as compared to a dual-line plant.
5.28      The actual design calcu:Lations for the rotary kiln were done indepen-
dently by a consultant retained by Hanna and by F.L. Smidth (Denmark), a major
manufacturer of rotary kilns. Bolth arrived at almost identical parameters.
Final size selection of 6.1 m x 185 m was arrived at after it was decided to
lower the calcine discharge temperature from 9000C to 75C°C-8000C in order
to prevent the possibility of material build-up at the discharge end. This
necessitated the lengthening of the final reduction zone.  The kiln size was
based on a smoothly lined kiln with no lifters 1/ or other internals. Though
their addition would have considerably reduced size and cost, it was thought
imprudent to risk the operating problems and increased maintenance experienced
by EXMIBAL and P.T. International due to lifter failure. The technology of
large kilns is well understood and, although the Cerro Matoso kiln will be the
largest for a nickel laterite application, it is not expected that its sheer
size will cause significant problems during startup and operation.

5.29      The hot ore transfer system will be designed to minimize reoxidation
and temperature loss by the calcine from the time the ore leaves the kiln until
it enters the furnace.  In the pilot plant, 300 C-350 C were lost in this pro-
cess.  In similar commercial plants the temperature drop is only 50 0C to 1000C,
and calculations for commercial operations have been made on this basis. The
greater loss in the pilot tests can be explained by the smaller quantities
involved in each transfer and the methocL of distributing feed into the pilot
furnace.
5.30      Smelting in the electric furnace completes the removal of chemically
bound water and the reduction and melting of the feed material. Correctly
estimating the amount of heat required w7as an important element in predicting
the throughput of the commercial furnace! and it is now estimated that power
consumption and thermal conditions for the commercial furnace will be as
shown below.  On the basis of these requirements, it was determined that a
51 MVA electrode furnace would be required.

5.32      Neither Elkem nor Demag, the only designers experienced in electric
smelting furnaces of comparable size, foresee any particular design problems
and independently came up with similar specifications. Since all design
parameters were obtained from an extensive pilot plant campaign on Cerro
Matoso ore, and based on an extensive review of the available data, it is
the eilnion of the staff that the process is appropriate and that no major
uroblems should be anticipated during construction or operations.

(c) The Plant
5.33      Since ferronickel smelting is a continuous operation, all process
facilities will operate three shifts a day, seven days a week. The various
operating steps, which consist essentially of: (i) the drying of the crude
ore; (ii) secondary crushing and screening; (iii) fine ore and coal prepara-
tion; (iv) calcination; and (v) smelting and refining, are described in some
detail in Annex 5-3.
5.34      In the opinion of the staff, the proposed process and facilities
are satisfactory. The flowsheet has been designed with as much flexibility
as feasible, and the disadvantages of a single-line process have been minimized
by inclusion of stockpiles and by independent double-line fine crushing and
screening facilities.
4.   Ecological Aspects
5.35      Although the Government has issued general anti-pollution guidelines,
INDERENA (Instituto Nacional de Recursos Naturales), the Government agency
in charge of enforcement, has not as yet prepared specific and legally binding
legislation. As a result, the project sponsors have decided to build the
plant so as to comply with the US (NIOSH) rules which currently govern Hanna's
Riddle operation.
5.36      The RK/EF process will generate the following waste products and
effluents:  (i) slag, from the smelter; (ii) dust, generated in the dryer
and kiln, secondary crushers, screens and on conveyor transfer and discharge
points; (iii) stack gases, containing gaseous pollutants such as sulphur
dioxide and carbon monoxide; and (iv) process water and sewage.
5.37      Molten slag will be run into casting pits, cooled, broken up and
disposed of in outlying slag dumps. The slags are chemically stable and no
degradation is expected. Dust will be collected at its source throughout
the plant, as described in Annex 5-3. Fugitive dust in the mine will be
controlled by water sprinkling trucks. The main sources of gaseous emissions
will be the 30 m dryer stack, the 50 m kiln stack and the electric furnace
stack. Since the ore is a silicate, no sulphur emissions will originate from
the processed material. Since natural gas will be used for the drying and
calcining processes, the only sulphur source will be the coal used as reduc-
tant.  Some of the SO2 from this source will be emitted to the atmosphere,
although most of the sulphur wil:L be eliminated with the refining slag. It
is therefore anticipated that ground-level concentrations of SO2 will be low
enough fully to meet reasonable pollution standards. Carbon monoxide, which
is generated in the electric furnace, will not be discharged to the atmosphere
but will either be flashed under the furnace hood by introducing measured
volumes of fresh air or flared at the stack by means of a pilot burner.
5.38      It has been agreed that CMSA will take all necessary measures to
ensure that the Project is carried out and operated with due regard to eco-
logical and environmental factors, including reclamation of exhausted mining
areas and waste dumps.

5.   Employment and Training
5.39      During operations, the mine and smelter will employ 716 staff, of
which 497 are expected to be paid hourly wages and 219 to be salaried. During
the first years of production, some of the senior technical and administrative
positions will be filled by experienced expatriates. Among their responsibili-
ties will be the training of Colombian counterparts to be recruited throughout
the country.  Since Montelibano, the provincial town 22 km away, can provide
only a small percentage of the required labor force, it is anticipated that
most hourly-paid labor will come from the industrial centers of Medellin and
Cartagena. The table below gives a detailed breakdown of the anticipated
manpower requirements.

(a)  Project-Sponsored Training Program
5.40      With the assistance of Hanna and SENA, CM'A will carry out a com-
prehensive training program covering foremen, operating labor and maintenance
personnel. Adequate funds have been included in the project cost estimates to
cover these requirements, and a detailed training schedule has been submitted
to the Bank.
5.41      The most immediately critical, needs are probably the mine foremen
and operators who will have to be recruited early, in preparation for the
2-year program of preproduction stripping. Mine equipment operators will
also have to receive approximately 6 months' training prior to the start of
stripping. Out of the 471 plant operators, who will include approximately



- 40 -
48 foremen, it is estimated that about 350 will require some kind of training
and that, of these, 30 will be employed in the mine, 160 in production and the
remaining 160 in the maintenance clepartment. Those who are to be trained for
production will be enrolled in full-time classes 6 months prior to the start
of operations. Also, for 6 months prior to the start of this program, 24 key
operators and foremen will have been undergoing extensive training at Hanna's
Riddle plant. The 160 maintenance tradesmen will receive courses specifically
oriented to the plant's maintenance requirements. Although these courses will
be under the direction of CMSA, they will be administered in close cooperation
with the Government's vocational training agency, SENA. It is expected that
60 key skilled artisans will attend both a 4-month basic course and a 12-month
advanced course. The remainder will attend only the 4-month course. It is
expected that these training requirements will be met approximately according
to the schedule indicated in Annex 5-4.
(b) SENA Training Programs
5.42      SENA, which was established by Decree 118 in 1957, is an autonomous
public agency, administered by a National Council, and financed by a 2% pay-
roll tax levied on all commercial and industrial enterprises, which has estab-
lished a series of regional training centers throughout Colombia. In the indus-
trial sector, it has training centers in Bogota, Barranquilla, Cali, Medellin
and Sogamoso (in Boyaca), where the national mining center has recently been
established.
5.43      Notwithstanding its impressive credentials and liberal funding,
SENA will not be in a position to supply or to train artisans specifically for
Cerro Matoso. It will, however, cooperate in setting up on-the-job training
in conjunction with its normal courses.
5.44      SENA is now beginning to develop a comprehensive training program
for mine-related skills, which will relate to the whole of the mining sector.
This is being prepared specifically at the request of INTERCOR, the EXXON sub-
sidiary which is involved in the Cerrejon coal project. The initial phase
will be primarily concerned with mine and plant maintenance. Subsequently,
it will be expanded to cover operations, and SENA currently has instructors
under training as mine machine operators in Canada.
VI. INFRASTRUCTURE
A.   General
6.01      Cerro Matoso is located comparatively close to an existing township
and transport system and other facilities. Overall infrastructure require-
ments are therefore a great deal lighter than for most other greenfield nickel
projects.  However, as in other nickel laterite projects, the smelting and
refining process is highly energ-intensive. Total energy consumption,
as shown in Annex 6-1, is expected to be about 19.08 kWh per lb of nickel,
which is in line with the energy consumption of Societe le Nickel's New
Caledonia ferronickel operations, though approximately twice the average



- 4.L -
consumption in sulphide operations. As a result, availability of reasonably
priced electric power, natural gas and coal is critical.
B.   Electric Power
6.02      Anticipated annual consumption during normal operations, detailed in
Annex 6-2, is estimated at about 542 GW4h, with an anticipated maximum demand of
73 MVA, of which the electric smelting furnace alone will consume 72%, or 390 GWh.
1.   Power Supply 1/
6.03      The share of electricity in overall energy consumption in Colombia
has grown from 19% in 1960 to 24% in 1975 as isolated facilities have gradually
been interconnected and low-cost hydro--resources developed. Public electricity
service, which supplies 93% of all electricity, is presently provided by
municipally owned companies and national enterprises, as well as by a large
number of their local subsidiaries.
6.04      The two companies that are involved with the Cerro Matoso Project
are:  (i) Interconexion Electrica S.A. (ISA) which was established to inter-
connect the systems of its major shareholer utilities, thus creating a national
grid capable of sustaining large hydroelectric projects. ISA is soon to
become the country's largest electricity enterprise and, by 1984 (upon comple-
tion of the San Carlos II hydropower station), it will own 36% of the country's
generating capacity; and (ii) Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica
(CORELCA), a public corporation, which is a shareholder in ISA, with jurisdic-
tion in seven Departments including Cordoba, in which Cerro Matoso is located.
Presently installed and future capacities for the two companies are summarized
below:
Installed and Future Power Generating Capacity of ISA and CORELCA
(G(Wh)
Proportion of 1984
1978       1984       Total Installed Capacity
ISA                 460         2,530                 36%
CORELCA             582           714                 10%
6.05      Cerro Matoso's smelter will 'be supplied through CORELCA, from a new
ISA interconnection (connecting the largely hydro-based Central system with
the predominantly thermal Atlantic Coast system), since the selected right-
of-way would pass reasonably close to Cerro Matoso (IBRD Map 12480). The ISA
interconnection consists of a single circuit 500 kV transmission line, with a
total length of 523 km, from the San Carlos substation in the Central region
to Sabanalarga in the North. The southern section of the line, between San
Carlos and Cerro Matoso, will be 210 kin long. The system will incorporate two
500/230/34.5 kV terminal substations, each with an initial capacity of 450
1/   For a detailed view of the sector, see also Bank Staff Appraisal Report
No. 1850-CO on the San Carlos I Hydro Power and 500-kV Inter-Connected
Projects, dated December 30, 1977.



- 42 -
.>'.; Lwo ieiate 500/115/34.5 kV substations, one at Cerro Matoso, each
with an individual capacity of 150 MIA; and a shunt compensation system with
a capacity of 600 MVA reactive. The intermediate substation at Cerro Matoso
will be located approximately 8 km east of the site. CORELCA will undertake
to build a short 110 kV li-ne t, Lile plant       suba  5Jon and CORELCA's local
subsidiary, ELECTRICORDOBA, will build a 34.5 kV line, approximately 20 km
long, into the town of Montelibano.
6.06      Close coordination of the construction schedules for the inter-
connection and Cerro Matoso will be required (Annex 6-3). Bids for the line
construction (which is to be financed through another Bank Project 1/) were
opened in April 1978 and ground was broken by January 1979. The line is
now expected to be completed by April 1981. ISA received tenders for the
substations (which are to be financed by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau of the
Federal Republic of Germany) in June 1978. However, the bids received were
declared unresponsive in February 1979 and a redevelopment of tenders will
take place during the third quarter of 1979. Although the transformers and
reactors are on order, it is not env:Lsaged that construction on the substations
will start before May 1980 and completion is not expected before May 1982.
6.07      The envisaged construction time for Cerro Matoso is 34 months, but
power for furnace testing will be required 3 to 4 months before start up. If
CMSA breaks ground in the third quarter of 1979, power will have to be
available at the site between January and February 1982, or before the
completion date of the substations. The Government is well aware of this
and is considering either the installation of a gas turbine or the energiza-
tion of the completed interconnection line at 230 kV at San Carlos as
suitable interim solutions. It has been agreed that the Government will
take all actions required to ensure a timely supply of electricity to the
project and will make interim arrangiements satisfactory to the Bank (para.
11.01).
2.   Power Tariffs
6.08      Generally low rates have caused the Colombian power sector to
experience financial difficulties in the past. The Bank and the Colombian
Government have, therefore, agreed that, under the terms of the loans to the
San Carlos and Interconnection projects, ISA will be required to earn a rate
of return on total revalued assets of not less than 5.5% in 1978, 8% in 1979
and 9% thereafter. It was also agreed that CORELCA's return should not be
less than 5% in 1978, 5% in 1979 and 1980, 6% in 1982 and 9% thereafter.
6.09      CORELCA and CMSA have substantially negotiated a contract including
a tariff formula that would be applied in 1982 when the Project starts produc-
tion. These tariffs, which are a critical cost item for the Project, depend
basically on the proportion of hydro and thermopower fed into the system. 2/
An average tariff of US$0.03 per kWh (in 1979 terms) has been used in the
calculation of the power costs.
1/   The loans for the San Carlos Hydro (Loan No. 1582-CO, US$126 million)
and the Interconnection Project (Loan No. 1583-CO, US$50 million) were
signed in mid-July 1978.
2/   Depending on the hydrological conditions in the Central Region, and the
tncremental spinning thermal reserve capacity to be maintained by CORELCA
for security of supply.



- 43 -
6.10      Since the power tariff is iraportant to the financial viability of
the Project and since the Bank has already obtained agreements on the tariff
structure of the power sector, the signing of such a contract, on terms
satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition of effectiveness. Furthermore,
it will be ensured that the contract for Cerro Matoso should be consistent
with CORELCA obligations under the terns of the Bank loan for the San Carlos
and Interconnection projects.
C.   Fuel
6.11      The second largest operating cost component is the fuel used in
drying and calcining. Either fuel oil or natural gas can be used although,
in the longer term, the possibility of converting to coal may exist. Fuel
requirements are detailed in Annex 6-4.
6.12      Based on economic evaluations the sponsors have now decided to use
natural gas as fuel. A draft contract between CMSA and ECOPETROL assures that
a timely gas supply will be available. The signing of such a contract will
be a condition of loan effectiveness.
1.   Availability and Cost of Natural Gas
6.13      Ninety percent of Colombia's gas reserves are located on the Atlantic
Coast and are, therefore, potential sources of supply to Cerro Matoso. The
major gas iields are the Guajira field, with a production capacity of 450
million ft /day and the J9bo Tablones and Chinu fields, which together have a
capacity of 38 million ft /day. At these production capacities, the reserve
life of the Guajira and Jobo Tablones/Chinu fields would be about 21 and 6
years, respectively. In August 1977, a potentially large gas deposit was
discovered off the coast of Cartagena, at Galerazamba. Additional wells were
drilled in late 1978 in order to define the reserves further, and exploration
is also going on in other potentially productive areas (Map IBRD 12480).
6.14      All developed gas fields are interconnected by pipelines which
transport the gas to the major centers of consumption on the Atlantic coast.
A prefeasibility study by PROTEXA, a Mexican consortium, for a gas pipeline
from the Atlantic Coast to Medellin (and later to Cali and Bogota) is pres-
ently under review by ALCANOS (a Colombian gas transportation company) and
ECOPETROL. In its first phase, this line would reach Medellin with a nominal
capacity of 198 million ft /day. The gas for this line would presumably have
to come from Jobo Tablones and Galerazamba. An investment of approximately
US$300 million is envisaged.
6.15      ECOPETROi has confirmed its willingness to supply Cerro Matoso with
7 to 10 million ft /day. This gas will reach the nickel smelter by a 90 km
pipeline from the Jobo Tablones field, which will be built and financed by
Cerro Matoso.



- 44 -
6.16      The 1978 natural gas price of Col$38.00 (US$0.90) per 1,000 ft  is a
promotional price to give an incentive to switch from oil to gas. Government
policy is to equalize the consumer price with the actual production and dis-
tribution costs in the short term, thereby reducing the present price differ-
ential per thermal unit as compared to fuel oil.  In the longer te m, however,
it is envisaged that the wellhead price of US$0.82 per thousand ft  of gas
will be escalated in accordance with the anticipated price increase of
fuel oil. For this report, it has therefore been assumed that the cost of
gas per thermal unit will be equal to or slightly lower than that of the   3
world market price of fuel oil 1/', or approximately US$2.27 per thousand ft
2.   Availability and Cost of Coal
6.17      Based on the pilot plant results, where a highly volatile coal was
successfully tested as a reductant, anticipated consumption will be about 100
MT per day and a stockpile sufficient for approximately one month's consumption
will be maintained at the smelter. The coal fields at Amaga, which supplied
the test coal, are located approximately 40 km from Medellin (and about 370 km
from Cerro Matoso) and are operated by a number of small companies. Since the
coal required by Cerro Matoso is the fine fraction of mine production, for
which there is no ready local market, no supply problems are anticipated.
There is also a price advantage for fine coal, which sold, during 1978, for
Col$350/MT (US$8.25) as compared to Col$740 (US$17.45) for lump coal. In-
cluding freight, the cost of coaL at Cerro Matoso will be about US$26/MT.
Since no supply problems are anticipated, contracts can be negotiated during
the plant's construction. One mine with whom tentative discussions were held
is Carbonera San Fernando, which has sufficient uncommitted capacity to supply
Cerro Matoso.
6.18      If Cerro Matoso is to convert from natural gas to coal as a fuel
in the future, it would need approximately 120,000 MT per annum, in addition
to the 30,000 MT required for reductant. No experience is available on the
performance of the rotary kiln when fired with coal. For this reason, exten-
sive pilot plant tests would be necessary before a decision on a conversion
could be made.
D.   On-Site Infrastructure
1.   Temporary Facilities
6.19      The temporary plant construction camp will be erected adjacent to
the plant site along the main access road from Montelibano. During initial
construction, only skilled and experienced workers will be used. These
workers are not available in Montelibano and therefore tent or trailer camps
and pre-fabricated portable facilities will be provided. Accommodation for
the construction labor force will consist of 3 separate camp units, each com-
prising four 100-men modules, supported by a centralized food service and
recreation facility. There will also be outdoor recreation facilities and a
packaged medical unit which may be moved to the townsite after construction
and converted to a permanent facility. The campsite near Montelibano will
have the same services on a reduced scale.
1/   Recent price increases in June 1979 were not included.  It is, however,
not clear whether the Colombian Government will reflect this increase in
its gas pricing policy.



- 45 -
2.   Construction Facilities
6.20      Buildings required during construction will be detail-engineered
in Colombia.  Aggregate for concrete is found in the nearby Ure River, and a
crushing, screening and washing plant will be located adjacent to the plant
site. Sand is available in several locations along the San Jorge River.
A concrete batch plant, rated at 100 cubic yards per hour, will meet peak
requirements for concrete output, and will be located near the plant site.
Cement will be supplied in bulk from the Tolcementos plant, some 160 km
distant. A concrete block plant, with a capacity of 1,000 blocks per hour,
will also be installed near the townsite.
6.21      As noted above, permanent power is not expected to be available
until the final phases of construction.. As a result, initial generators
will be sized to meet peak construction requirements. At the townsite, three
250 kW generators will be installed and at the plant, six 750 kW units will be
required, two of which will become part of the permanent plant emergency power
sys tema.
3.   Utilities
(a) Electric Power
6.22      Electric power will be supplied by CORELCA.  At the plant's main
substation, it will be stepped down to 34.5 kV, at which voltage it will be
used to supply the high tension side cf the electric furnace transformers.
Two acdditional power transformers will reduce the voltage further to 4.16 kV
for distribution in the plant.
(b) Natural Gas
6.23      Natural gas will be supplied to the plant by a proprietary line from
the Jobo Tablones gas field (para. 6.15). A pressure reducing station will
be provided. In case of supply failure, the plant can be fueled with diesel
oil from tanks which have sufficient capacity to maintain operations for four
days. This is considered a sufficient security margin.
4.   Civil Works Design
6.24      The 55 hectare plant site will be rough graded and provided with a
drainage system.  Soils are sedimentary, gen2rally clay, and allowable earth
pressure for spread footings will be 2 kg/cm . For heavy foundations, piles
will be used. About 10 hectares will be gravel surfaced for in-plant roads,
parking areas, coal and ore stockpiles. The perimeter will be fenced and
guardhouses will be installed at all gates.
6.25      An independent engineering consultant was retained by the Bank in
September 1976 to review the civil engineering and infrastructure design.
His conclusions were that:  (i) the proposed facilities accord with sound
construction and engineering practices; (ii) estimates of quantities have
been based on reliable data and all relevant factors have been taken into
account; (iii) the construction schedule is reasonable; and (iv) due con-
sideration has been given to the impact of the Project on the community.



- 46 -
E.   Offsite Infrastructure
1.   Townsite
6.26      In line with Government policy, it was decided to locate the new
225 hectare townsite at Montelibano, regardless of any possible advantages
of a location closer to the plant. A master plan has been developed by
HABITAR, a local planning group, arnd townsite engineering has been assigned
to INTEGRAL, 1/ under the overall supervision of Bechtel.
6.27      Housing for salaried employees will be on a subsidized rental basis
and family units will be built as part of the Project. Total salaried staff
on site will be around 186, and it is assumed that the balance will be single,
who will be housed in single staff houses or bachelor apartments.
6.28      The hourly-rated labor force will be approximately 500 persons
and, of these, 150 to 200 men will either be accommodated in single employee
quarters, or come from and prefer to live in the old town of Montelibano.
Therefore, 300 to 350 housing units will be required to accommodate the
balance and a standard house plan has been developed with flexibility to
provide for different size families. In order to encourage stability, it
is considered desirable that hourly-rated employees be homeowners. The
Project will, therefore, only prov:Lde site and services for hourly-paid
workers, and the employee will be expected to purchase his house himself.
Financing would be provided partiaLly by the borrower and partially through
INSCREDIAL, a Government agency which authorizes housing loans, or other
financing agencies. No firm agreements have yet been reached on this, but
the Government has stated that this plan satisfies the conditions for employee
housing as included in the Concession Contract.
2.   Transport
6.29      During construction, about 80,000 MT of freight are expected to
be transported from the port of Cartagena, mostly by river but also over the
road to the plant site. At normal operations, approximately 50-53,000 MT per
annum of ferronickel will be barged down river or trucked to Cartagena for
export. The mine will have its own trucks, to transport the ferronickel to
the river port at Caucasia but the barges will operate under contract, as will
other overland freight trucked into Cerro Matoso.
(a) Roads
6.30      Existing access roads are inadequate and must be upgraded and/or
realigned. The first 12 km segment, from the main highway to Montelibano,
will mainly follow the route of the existing road, but its sub-surface will be
improved and it will be graded and gravelled. Three new bridges have already
been constructed. A new alignment is, however, required for the 22 km section
from Montelibano to Cerro Matoso. There are weight and size limitations on
1/   INTEGRAL is a Medellin-based consulting group which has worked exten-
sively with the Bank in the power sector.



- 47 -
the main North-South highway to Cartagena which limit the maximum weight on
the road to 45 MT and the maximum size to 5.6 m width and 4.5 m height. Over-
size equipment for the smelter during construction would, therefore, have to
come by river barge.
(b) River Traffic
6.31      Loading and unloading facilities will be constructed at Caucasia,
on the Cauca River. The selected site, which is 53 km from the plant, is on
relatively stable hardpan ground but will require limited dredging and sheet
piling for bank stabilization. The river route to Cartagena is 517 km, via
the Cauca, the Magdalena and the Canal del Dique, and turn-around time for
river barge convoys is 13 days. The Project does not expect to encounter any
difficulties when negotiating freight contracts for river transport.
(c) Port of Cartagena
6.32      The port of Cartagena is operated by Puertos de Colombia (COLPUERTOS),
a Government agency. The facilities have recently been enlarged and modern-
ized and cargo throughput in 1977 was 604,000 MT. There are two 200 m long
concrete finger piers and 409 m of marginal wharf available for deep-sea2ships.
There is a total of 96,000 m  of  usable storage area, of which 24,420 m  is
under roof, and the possibility exists for expansion of yard storage area. The
port has an excellent security record and a computerized cargo control depart-
ment. During construction a major portion of incoming freight can be directly
transloaded into river barges. Other freight, however, will have to be un-
loaded and temporarily stored for further shipi ent.  For this, the port will
make available an area of aproximately 6,000 m , which after construction
would be utilized for ferronickel storage. Diesel oil and other fuels can
be loaded directly onto barges at the ECOPETROL distribution terminal outside
Cartagena at Mamonal.
6.34      Liaison between the Project and the port will be handled through
a project expediting office in Cartagena. In order to speed up equipment
delivery, all shipments will go in bond to Cerro Matoso where they will be
cleared through a customs zone specially created for this purpose. A Gov-
ernment authorization to this effect has already been granted.
VII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Management and Organization
7.01      During implementation, technical supervisory, engineering, con-
struction and procurement services will be provided by Bechtel. Bechtel will
also act as Project Manager on behalf of the owners and the scope of its work
will include procurement, sub-contractor selection, supervision, scheduling
and expediting for both process plant and infrastructure items. There will
be two separate contracts covering work in San Francisco and in Colombia. The



- 48 -
signing of these contracts will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Bechtel's proposed organization chart for project implementation is given
in Annex 7 and is based on the assuamptions shown below:
Bechtel Proposed Consultant Requirements
Average Cost
Man-Months           Total Cost   per Man-Month
Expatriate   National       (US$000)         (US$)
Field office                 810        2,947        12,247          3,260 /a
Project office               397        2,196         7,804          3,010 /a
San Francisco office      2,938           -          16,393          5,580 /b
4,145         5,143       36,444 /c       3,924
/a   Includes payroll fringe benefits and relocation and settling-in
allowances.
/b   Includes allowances for indirect costs and out of pocket expenses.
/c   Does not include Bechtel's fee which is estimated at US$5.7 million.
7.02      In addition, it is expected that approximately 154,000 man-hours
of local engineering services, primarily relating to infrastructure, will be
provided by INTEGRAL Ltda. (para. 6.26).
7.03      Although Bechtel will have overall responsibility for project imple-
mentation, Hanna itself will be responsible for selection of mining methods
and equipment, establishment of mining and stripping plans and opening up of
the mine. Since Hanna is an experienced lateritic nickel-mining company, this
division of responsibility is appropriate.
B. Implementation Schedule
7.04      Project preparation is well advanced and letters of intent for
the kiln, dryer and furnace have already been issued. The latter is the
most critical item since the detailed design of the structural steel for the
furnace building and, hence, the issuance of the steel bid packages, depend
upon it. Contracts for erection of the construction camps, ancillary build-
ings and the concrete batch plant will also be awarded soon thereafter.
Preliminary design work is required for the plant and equipment foundations
to assure an early issue of the piling contract bid documents. Road design
is essentially complete and traff:ic connected with the supply of construction
materials and equipment can be ma:intained. In order to meet the schedule, it
may be necessary to carry out some construction work concurrently with the
engineering of that specific section. An implementation schedule is given on
the following page. On the basis of the Notice to Proceed being given in the
third quarter of 1979, plant start-up is expected for the first half of 1982,
or within less than three years. The implementation schedule looks realistic
and is attainable under normal circumstances. 1/
1/   For contractual purposes, a slightly more conservative estimate has been
assumed.

8.02      The total base cost of the Project is based on Bechtel's early 1979
update of their original feasibility study (June 1976), which had assumed a
January 1977 start of implementation. These revised figures are in line with
Bank staff estimates and are a fair reflection of the capital cost of the
Project. 1/
8.03      Since letters of intent haves already been issued for the kiln and
dryer and electric furnace packages (which constitute approximately 55% of the
estimated total equipment cost), a smaller physical contingency has been added
to these items to cover design changes. For other items, a physical contin-
gency of 10% has been used.
8.04      The local currency component is primarily civil works, labor and
bulk materials; the foreign component is predominantly equipment and engineer-
ing services. The price contingency amounts to approximately US$25 million
(Col$1 billion) and total physical and price contingencies are about 18% of
the total base cost of the Project. This is in line with other industrial
projects recently appraised and reflects the fact that the Project is very
well defined and has a relatively short implementation period.
8.05      The estimates are based on the assumption that the Project will
be exempted from all import and customs duties and INCOMEX, the Government's
importing authority, has indicated that Cerro Matoso qualifies for this
exemption.
8.06      Initial working capital requirements, which, together with the
assumptions used, are given in more deatail in Annex 8-1, are estimated to
total US$35.8 million (Col$1.5 billion) through to full capacity production.
Of this figure, only US$16.3 million, which accounts for the working capital
required at start-up in 1982, will be externally financed. The remaining
US$19.7 million will be financed by internally generated funds.
8.07      Interest during construction, which is estimated at US$27.4 million
(Col$1.2 billion) through April 1982, has been calculated on the basis of the
financing plan outlined below (para. 8.09) and loan disbursements commencing
in late 1979.
8.08      The total project cost, in April 1979 terms, excluding price escala-
tion, working capital and interest during construction, is about US$6.0/annual
lb. This compares favorably with other recent projects, such as Greenvale
(approximately US$10.0/annual lb), Marinduque (US$8.1/lb), PT International
(US$9.1/lb) and EXMIBAL (US$8.5/lb). Among greenfield projects, only FALCONDO,
which was completed in 1971 at a capital cost per annual lb of around US$6.3
in April 1979 terms, would be comparable. The competitiveness of Cerro Matoso
is a function of the uniquely high quality of the deposit, the relatively low
1/   As indicated in para. 6.16, however, they are based on the assumption
that gas and oil will be priced at world market levels. If Colombian
fuel prices were to stay at prestent levels, there would be a capital
cost savings of about US$3.0 million, as well as a substantial reduction
in operating costs.

infrastructure requirements and the comprehensive drilling and testing pro-
grams so far carried out (para. 5.15). No other greenfield project is likely
to be realizable for less than US$10-US$12/annual lb in 1979 terms.
B.   Financing Plan
8.09      The financing plan for the project is as follows:
Cerro Matoso: Financing Plan
US$ million      %
A.   Equity
(i) Existing Equity /a
-  ECONIQUEL             10.0          3.1
-  CONICOL               15.0          4.7

/a   Unrevalued assets as at end-1978.
/b   Of this amount, US$12.8 million will be provided by Ex-Im
Bank and US$12.8 million by complementary private financing.
/c   Working capital in 1982 (US$16.3 million) is financed by
loans and equity as part of the basic project cost.
8.10      On the basis of this financing plan, the equity ownership of CMSA
at start-up would be ECONIQUEL 45%, Billiton 35% and CONICOL 20%, and this
financing plan and ownership structure is appropriate for a project of this
type. The schedule of equity payments will be made so that the debt to equity
ratio will not exceed 73:27 during project execution, and will reach 65:35
upon Project Completion, as defined in para. 8.16.



- 53 -
8.11      The Chase Manhattan loan will be available as a revolving credit
until early 1983, at which time it will be converted into a 6-1/2 year loan
with one year of grace. Interest will be LIBOR plus 1-1/4%. For the present
report, it has been considered that the loan will be for 10 years, including
4 years' grace, and on effective annual interest rate of 11-1/4% through
mid-1981, and 10% thereafter has been assumed. The Chase loan will be secured,
inter alia, by assignment of sales proceeds. The Bank will share equally in
this and all other securities created for the external lenders.
8.12      The US Ex-Im Bank loan, which has been agreed to, will be for 13
years, including 3 years of grace. The Ex-Im Bank portion (US$12.8 million)
will carry an interest rate of 8-5/8%, and the private portion will be at a
commercial rate, which has been assumed to follow a similar trend as in the
Chase loan. Neither the Chase nor the Ex-Im Bank loan will carry a Government
guarantee and both will be lent directly to CMSA. The Bank loan, which will
also be lent directly to CMSA, will be for 14 years, including 4 years of
grace, and will carry an interest ratE which, together with a guarantee fee
payable to the Government, will bring the cost to the borrower to 10% per
annum.. A commitment fee of 3/4% will be payable on the undisbursed portion.
CMSA will bear the foreign exchange risk of other currencies to the US dollar,
except for some offsetting of this by a reduction in the fee paid to the
Government, where the cost of the loan exceeds 10% per annum in US dollar
terms, over the life of the loan. It has also been agreed that the guarantee
fee paid to the Government will not be, in any case, less than 1%.
8.13      With regard to overrun financing up to Project Completion, it has
been agreed that the shareholders will make available up to US$86 million in
additional equity to cover cash flow cleficiencies, should they occur.
The Chase loan will be for up to US$120 million and since only US$100.9 of
this will be drawn down as part of the basic project financing, it has been
agreed that the difference--US$19.1 mi'llion--be added to the overrun facility,
bringing it to a total of US$105.1 million.
8.14      Taking into consideration not only the strong project management
team and detailed capital cost analys:is, but also the Project's unique ad-
vantages relative to other nickel prospects (para. 5.15) and the consequent
improbability that the sponsors would abandon Cerro Matoso prior to Project
Completion even if the agreed overrun funds were to be exhausted, the limited
overrun commitment indicated above is acceptable for this Project.
8.15      It has been agreed that until Completion of the Project, no debt
will be contracted that would result in CMSA's total outstanding long-term
debt exceeding US$225.6 million, including the full amount of the Chase loan
(para. 8.13).
8.16      It has also been agreed thal: Project Completion will be defined as:
(i) completion of physical construction of the plant and associated facilities;
(ii) operation of mine and plant facilities at 90% of the quarterly effective



- 54 -
production capacity 1/ over a continuous 90-day period; (iii) maintenance
of an average of 80% of the annual effective production capacity 1/ over a
continuous 12-months period; (iv) achievement of a 1.4:1 current ratio at the
time of Completion; and (v) a demonstrated ability to service all long-term
debt from internally generated funds during the 12-month period referred to
under (iii) above.
C. Procurement
8.17      A letter of intent for the dryer and kiln, expected to cost about
US$13 million equivalent, has already been signed with F.L. Smidth (Denmark)
after international competitive bidding (ICB) in conformity with the Bank's
guidelines. For sound technical reasons (para. 5.32), the sponsors sought
quotations for the electric furnace package only from Elkem (Norway) and
Demag (FR Germany). Elkem's offer was substantially lower and Elkem has
received a letter of intent. The proprietary part of the package, including
engineering, is presently estimated at US$4.1 million in 1979 terms. Based on
the Bank financing the entire package, Elkem will bid the rest internationally
as 8 sub-packages with a total estimated cost in 1979 terms of also about
US$4.1 million. The remainder of the equipment to be financed by the Bank
(US$24.5 million) will be procured according to ICB, except for approximately
16 equipment packages, totalling aLbout US$2.4 million and individually esti-
mated at less than US$0.25 million per package, which will be procured by
international shopping according to Bank guidelines. The gas pipeline will
also be bid internationally.
8.18      Colombian manufacturers are expected to supply about US$10 million,
or 14%, of the total equipment and bulk materials costs; local bidders will be
given a margin of preference, under ICB, of 15% or the applicable duty, if
lower, which a non-exempted importer would have had to pay.
8.19      It is expected that there will be approximately 18 installation,
civil work and erection contracts, totalling US$29.1 million. Although these
will be bid internationally according to ICB, it is likely that most will be
awarded to local contractors. However, owing to rigorous quality control, it
is almost certain that only foreign contractors will be prequalified for
installation of refractories. The total value of the contracts which might
be awarded to foreign companies is estimated at a maximum of US$5 million.
8.20      As indicated, Bechtel has been selected as project engineer.  It is
proposed that the Bank finance the foreign exchange cost of that part of the
Bechtel contract covering services in Colombia, estimated at about US$11.1
million. Presentation of signed contracts covering Bechtel's work both in
Colombia and San Francisco, which are satisfactory to the Bank, will be a
condition of loan effectiveness.
1/   Quarterly and annual effective production capacity have been defined as
an output of 12,283,000 and 49,813,000 lbs of nickel contained in
ferronickel, respectively.



- 55) -
8.21       Since the notice to proceed given on July 2, 1979 (para. 1.02),
the detailed engineering has reached such a stage as to allow towards the end
of the third quarter of 1979 the placement of firm purchase orders for the
most critical equipment packages, the dlryer, kiln and electric furnace. To
cover the required down payments, a provision for retroactive financing of up
to US$2 million (or 2.5% of the total loan amount) has been made, to permit
withdrawals from the loan account in respect of such payments, prior to the
date of the loan agreement but after August 1, 1979.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of the Bank Loan
8.22      The Bank loan of US$80 million will finance goods and services as
shown in the table below:
Cerro Matoso: Allocation of Bank Loan
US$ Million       %

Total                              80.0          100.0
8.23       It is expected that, for those equipment items to be financed by
the Bank, only about US$4.4 million (or 5.5% of the Bank loan) will be for
contracts awarded to local suppliers.  As shown in Annex 8-2, the loan is
expected to be fully disbursed by mid-1983.
IX. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Production Schedule
9.01      Production figures have been based on 3 mining stages over a 25-year
life and are summarized below. These figures assume 90% plant availability
with an allowance every 7 years for the relining of the kiln and every 10
years for the relining of the furnace.

9.03      The table below compares this start-up with other major nickel
projects that have come on stream during the last five years. Of these,
however, only FALCONDO is strictly comparable since both process lateritic
ores, use electro-smelting and similar refining processes and produce high-
grade (35%-40%) ferronickel. The main difference consists in calcining, where
FALCONDO uses shaft furnaces.

9.04      While it would be unreasonable to expect Cerro Matoso to match
FALCONDO by producing over design capacity from the first year, the assumed
learning curve is realistic. Hanna will not only operate a plant in which it
is a major shareholder, but it has also been involved with the Project for a
number of years and has conducted most of the pilot tests itself. The Cerro
Matoso process is not particularly complex, and the proposed training program,
in which Hanna will participate (para. 5.40), is adequate.



- 57 -
9.05      Based on the preceding learning curve and assuming commissioning
in April 1982, the production build-up is forecast as shown below:
Cerro Matoso: Summary Production Build Up
Ore Mined         Nickel          % of Effective

1985         765            49,822                100
B. Operating Costs
9.06      Operating cost estimates in constant terms, which are detailed in
Annex 9-1, are based on Bechtel's feasibility report. However, unit prices
have been modified in line with the analysis presented in Chapters V and VI.
9.07      The operating cost per lb of nickel at full production is approxi-
mately US$0.97 in April 1979 terms. 1/ As shown below, this is substantially
lower than other recent plants.

9.08      The lower operating cost per lb projected for Cerro Matoso
vis-a-vis FALCONDO is a function of: (i) the higher-grade ore body at Cerro
Matoso (approximately 2.6% Ni as an average as opposed to 1.6% at FALCONDO);
(ii) the fact that all power consumed at FALCONDO is internally generated with
imported fuel oil; (iii) the use of naptha as the reductant in the shaft kilns
at FALCONDO as opposed to coal; and (iv) the greater efficiency of rotary as
opposed to shaft-type kilns.

9.10      From 1984 onwards, Cerro Matoso will be in a healthy financial
position, with a debt-service coverage of not less than 2.0 times and a
current ratio of 1.5:1 or better. At full production in 1985, the profit
break-even point will be about 50% of capacity and the cash break-even point
59% of capacity. Year-by-year break-even analyses and other financial indi-
cators are given in Annex 9-5.
9.11      These projections have been made on the basis of assumptions in-
dicated below:
(a)  Revenue:  a discount of 5% and 3%, respectively, has been
applied in the first and second years to reflect possible
initial problems with quality control;
(b)  Depreciation:  an accelerated method of depreciation (fixed
percentage on declining balance) has been assumed, at the
following rates:
Industrial buildings                         5% per annum
Plant machinery and equipment               10% per annum
Vehicles                                    20% per annum
In addition, it has been assumed that pre-operating expenses and
interest during construction will be amortized over 5 years;



- 59 -
(c) Tax Incentives: it has been assumed that Cerro Matoso will
benefit from duty exemptions (para. 8.05). The Project will
also benefit from a depletion allowance which allows mining
companies to deduct from the taxable base up to 10% of the
"mine-head" value of the nickel, which is determined by the
market price less transportation charges, processing costs
and all other costs incurred after mining;
(d)  Government Royalty:  according to the Concession Contract,
an annual royalty will be payable at the rate of 8% of the
mine-head value;
(e) Transfer to Legal Reserves: 10% of net profits must be
transferred to a compulsory reserve which accrues until
it reaches 50% of the Company's subscribed capital;
(f) Taxes: there are two applicable forms of taxation:
-    a corporate income tax, at the rate of 40%; and
-    local real estate taxes, which are assessed on the
net plant value at the rate of 0.002% per annum;
(g) Dividends: it has been agreed that no dividends will be
paid if to do so would reduce the current ratio below
1.3:1 and that dividends in any one year may not exceed
net profit after tax less transfer to reserves. A remit-
tance tax of 20% is payable on profits remitted abroad; and
(h) Hanna Technical Assistance: Hanna will charge Cerro Matoso
US$0.01/lb of nickel produced for administrative support
and US$0.015/lb for technical assistance. During the first
five years, these rates will be increased with inflation up
to a maximum of US$0.0275/lb. It has been assumed that
this technical support will be required over the life of
the Project.
D.   Financial Rate of Return and Distribution of Benefits
9.12      The pre-tax financial rate of return for the Project has been
calculated in real terms and is expected to be about 17%. If costs incurred
prior to 1979 are excluded and if the quality discount which has been assumed
in 1982 and 1983 were also excluded (para. 9.11), the return would be 19.7%.

Exclusion of Sunk Costs and QuLality Discount                  19.7
9.13      Additional returns have also been calculated for each of the
sponsors using, as costs, the total new equity to be injected into the Project
and, as benefits, the dividends (net of remittance taxes for the private
sponsors). As shown below, the returns to each sponsor are more attractive
than the internal financial return might indicate:
Cerro Matoso: Financial Returns to Sponsors
ECONIQUEL       Private Sponsors
Base Rate                              22.0%              19.0%
Capital Cost up 20%                    19.2%              16.4%
Benefits down 20%                      18.6%              15.8%
9.14      The returns to the sponsors are estimated to start in 1984 with the
first payment of dividends which accrue in the same ratio as their percentage
of equity invested in the Project.  The Government, however, in addition to
ECONIQUEL's dividends, receives royalties and income tax, local and remittance
taxes. In a typical year (1988), at full production, the inflow to the
Government and the sponsors would be as outlined below and indicates that
approximately 75% of total benefits accrue to the Government and its agen-
cies (including ECONIQUEL). 1/

E.   Financial Covenants
9.15      To ensure maintenance of a sound financial position and to safeguard
the position of the l nders, even in t:he event that nickel prices do not
increase as now projected (para. 3.44), the following covenants, in addition
to those stipulated in paras. 8.15 and 8.16, have been agreed:
(a) CMSA will not be permitted to declare or pay divi-
dends if after payment of such dividends, the
debt:equity ratio is above 60:40 or the Company's
current ratio would be less than 1.3:1;
(b) for t:hree years after Project Completion, CMSA will
not be permitted to make capital investments outside the
Project of more than US$10 million equivalent in any one
year without the specific approval of the Bank; and
fc)  CMSA may not incur long-tern debt in addition to that
already identified in the fiLnancing plan presented in
paras. 8.09-8.13 prior to Project Completion, and after
Project Completion only if after incurring such debt the
debt:equity ratio of the Company would not exceed 60:40.
9.16      In addition, the following security provisions in which the Bank
will share pari passu with the other 'Lenders have been agreed: (i) the
assignment of the proceeds from all nickel sales to a special account,
(ii) mortgage and pledge of assets; and (iii) assignment of the Concession
and the key contracts entered by Cerro Matoso to carry out the Project.
F. Major Risks
9.17      In the opinion of Bank staff, technical risks are small.  The ore
body is well-known and of an exceptionally high grade. Mining will be a
simple, truck and shovel, open-cast operation and will, in addition, be
carried out with the management assistance of Hanna, which has had exten-
sive similar experience.  The processing of the ore, likewise, has been
extensively studied and the final choice of the rotary kiln/electric furnace
route is the product of detailed pilot plant work. Although the staff ini-
tially had reservations about the sizing of the kiln (para. 5.28) and furnace
(para. 5.31), it is now apparent that these should not pose a problem and in
terms of technical risk, the only area where some concern remains is the
availability of adequate power at the time of project start-up (para. 6.10).
9.18      As discussed in Chapter III, however, the market for nickel is
likely to remain depressed during the early operating years and--based on the
supply/demand balance indicated in para. 3.38--it must be considered possible
that prices may not rise as fast in real terms as has been assumed in this
report (the annual average rate of real increase is approximately 5% from
1978-85). However, as shown below, except for 1982, CMSA would remain able to
service its debt from internally generated funds even if prices were to fall



- 62 -
by 30% from the levels which have been projected. Indeed, if there were
no increase in real terms from the US$2.08/lb average level for the first
quarter of 1979, the Project would still be able to maintain a debt service
ratio of 1.3 times and above. The vulnerability of CMSA to price falls below
US$2.08/lb in 1982-84--though remolte--is, however, a reason for not permitting
a debt:equity ratio for the basic Project cost above that proposed.

X. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.  Economic Rate of Return
10.01     The economic return has been calculated from the financial cost/
benefit streams which have been amended: (i) to eliminate all taxes and
duties; and (ii) to exclude all transfer payments, including social security
charges. No shadow pricing of foreign exchange has been used and, since a
tight labor market is anticipated in the region, there is no shadow pricing
of skilled or unskilled labor. The costs and benefits associated with the
housing policy which Cerro Matoso S.A. intends to follow (para. 6.28) have
not been quantified since insufficient data is presently available. However,
US$1.0 million has been excluded from the capital cost stream to cover im-
provements to the existing town of Montelibano which are unrelated to the
Project.
10.02     The basic economic rate of return, shown below, is 19.4%.  If the
quality discount assumed for 1981 and 1982 and sunk costs prior to 1979 are
excluded, this return would rise to 22.2%.

Benefits down 20%                                    12.9
Exclusion of Sunk Costs and Quality Discount                   22.2
B.   Foreign Exchange Effect
10.03     The estimated foreign exchange generation from the Project is
detailed in Annex 10. In an average year of full production, net foreign
exchange inflows are expected to be about US$68 million equivalent in 1979
terms--or more than 50% of the Project"s base foreign exchange cost.
C.   Regional Impact 1/
10.04     Present Government strategy is directed at improving the distri-
bution of the benefits of growth, inter alia, by implementing rural develop-
ment programs aimed at low income groups. The Cerro Matoso Project will be
instrumental in this by: (i) providing employment for up to 1,800 workers
during implementation and about 720 during operations (para. 5.39), some of
whom will come from the town of Montel:ibano and the rest from other parts of
the country; (ii) providing upgraded social services in and around Montelibano,
including new hospital facilities, improvements to sewage and power and resur-
facing of the roads and airstrip (paras. 6.26 and 6.30); (iii) encouraging up
and downstream industries, including quarrying (para. 6.20), road and river
transportation (paras. 6.30 and 6.31), the local construction industry (para.
6.28), local manufacture of refractories and the domestic steel fabrication
industry. On top of this, the Project will serve in some measure to rectify
the imbalance of the economy, where development is critically dependent on
coffee exports and in which mining presently contributes less than 0.9% of
GDP. In the longer term, the training opportunities (paras. 5.39-5.44) for
artisans and skilled workers will provide a substantial social infrastructure
upon which can be built a better-balanced industrial sector and the management
skills which will be passed on will be of critical importance in other natural
resource industries, e.g., in petroleum and coal.

XI. AGREEMENTS
11.01     The following major agrieements and assurances have been obtained:
(a)  from CMSA:
(i)  that CMSA will not change the conditions of the Billiton
contract (or other scheduled documents) without the prior
approval of the Bank (para. 3.50);
(ii) that, as part of the overall information pertaining to
the Project, it will provide the Bank with detailed infor-
mation on pollution and that the Project will be carried
out and operated with due regard to ecological and environ-

(v)  that the Company will adhere to certain definitions of
and conditions for Project Completion (para. 8.16);
(vi)  that the Company will neither pay nor declare dividends
if to do so would decrease the Company's current
ratio below 1.3:1 or increase the Company's debt:equity
ratio above 60:40 (paras. 9.11 and 9.15);
(vii) that for a certain time the Company will not make annual
capital investments of more than US$10 million without Bank
approval (para. 9.15); and
(viii) that the Company will not incur long-term debt in
addition to that already identified in the financing
plan (paras. 8.09-8.13) prior to Project Completion;
and that after the Completion Date the Company will
incur debt only if after incurring such debt, the
debt:equity ratio does also not exceed 60:40 (para.
9.15);
(b) from CMSA and ECONIQUEL/IFI, CONICOL/HANNA and BILLITON/SHELL:
(i) on a training program, for which Hanna will provide
technical assistance (para. 5.40);



- 65 -
(ii) that financing will be provided to cover the basic
Project cost, as detailed in para. 8.09;

with Hanna on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank (paras. 9.11 and 9.17).
(c)  from the Government:
(i)  that it will cause SENA or some other agency acceptable
to the Bank, to participate in the proposed training
program for CMSA personnel (paras. 5.40 and 5.44);
(ii) that it will take all actions required to ensure a
timely supply of electricity to the Project and that
the Bank will have ample opportunity to comment on
any interim power solution which may be proposed and
that any solution which may be adopted should be
agreeable to the Bank (para. 6.07).
11.02     The following are conditions of loan effectiveness:
(a)  signature of the Sales Contract with Billiton (para. 3.50);
! (b) signature of power and gas contracts (paras. 6.10 and 6.12);
(c)  signature of engineering contracts with Bechtel which are
acceptable to the Bank (para. 8.20); and
(d)  signature of co-financing agreements and all other scheduled
documents as defined in Section 1.02 (b) of the Loan Agreement.
11.06     Given the preceding assurances and agreements, the Project is suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$80 million to CMSA for 14 years, including 4 years
of grace.

CERRO MATOSO NICKEL PROJECT
SIGNIFICANT NICKEL PRODUCERS
A.   Industry Leaders
1.   INCO (Canada):  INCO was formed in 1902 and by 1920 it controlled
almost 90% of the world's nickel output. Although its share had
dropped to around 35% by 1976, it still mines the largest and
richest copper-nickel orebody, the Frood-Stobie complex, near
Sudbury, Ontario. In spite of its domination of Canadian sulphide
mining, INCO is less well placed outside of Canada since it failed
to obtain any significant interest in Australia.
Nevertheless, it has an 80% stake in the EXMIBAL project which has
recently started up in Guatemala and also controls the PT Inter-
national project in Indonesia. Among the major nickel companies,
INCO is the only one which controls a significant captive market,
with majority holdings in Huntington Alloys (US) and Henry
Wiggin Ltd (UK) and minority shareholdings in Shimura Kako, Tokyo
Nickel and Daido Special Alloys (Japan).
2.   Falconbridge (Canada):  Falconbridge was established in the 1920s
and has managed to retain control of about 6-10% of world production,
primarily through the phasing in of its Dominican subsidiary,
FALCONDO. Like INCO, it is predominantly a sulphide producer
based on the Sudbury basin although all nickel, copper and other
by-products have been historically refined in Norway and marketing
of finished nickel has been mostly in Europe. Although a Canadian
corporation, ownership of Falconbridge has been in US hands since
the 1960s.
3.   Societe Le Nickel (France):  from 1950 to 1976, SLN - which controls
extensive reserves in the french colony of New Caledonia - had
increased its share of the world market from 7% to about 9%. Not-
withstanding this, it experienced severe financial problems in
1972-73 and 50% of the company is now owned by SNPA, a major
French oil producer. The remaining 50% is owned by IMETAL, a
Rothschild holding company in which AMAX (US) has a minority
stake.
B.   More Recent Entrants
1.   AMAX (US):  with mining interest in Botswana and New Caledonia and
its own smelter in Louisiana, which also has a substantial stake in
IMETAL (France);
2.   Western Mining Co. (Australia): which is partially owned by Selection
Trust (UK), which in turn is a major shareholder in AMAX, and which
has now become the third largest free-market nickel producer;

ANNEX 3-1

3.   Sherritt Gordon (Canada):  whose domestic mining operations closed
in 1976, but which owns 11% of Marinduque (Philippines) and 11%
of the PT Pacific project in Indonesia;
4.   Freeport Minerals (US):  whose Cuban interests were nationalized
but which now has a 50% stake in the Australian Greenvale project;
5.   Anglo-American Corporation (South Africa):  which is a partner
with AMAX in Botswana, is investigating projects in Brazil and
owns JCI (Rhodesia) and the Rustenburg Platinum Mines in South
Africa; and
6.   Hanna Mining Co. (US):  which - in addition to its interest in
Cerro Matoso - operates the only nickel mining and smelting operation
in the US and which has a 20% interest in INCO's EXMIBAL project.

CERRO MATOSO NICKEL PROJECT
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESSING PLANT 1/
1.        Drying:  Crude ore will be reclaimed from the blended stockpile by
a front-end wheelloader and a variable speed apron feeder will discharge onto
the dryer feed belt conveyor. The dryer will be designed to treat a maximum
of 185 WMT per hour to reduce the moisture content from 35% to 7%. Provision
will be made for an emergency stockpile to permit the dryer to be unloaded in
case of process interruption or power failure. Dryer off-gas will be cleaned
in cyclones and an electrostatic precipitator. The collected dust will be
re-introduced into the process. The cleaned exhaust gases will be drawn by a
fan through the dryer stack and discharged to the atmosphere.
2.        Secondary Crushing and Screening:  Due to the abrasive nature of
the ore, the secondary crushing and screening circuit will consist of two
independent lines. The dryer discharge conveyor will pass the stream of
dried ore to one of two vibrating screens. The 10 mm screen undersize will
go directly to the screen discharge belt, and the oversize will go to a
Hazemag-type impact crusher.  The screen discharge belt will feed the under-
size, via a transfer belt, to one of three 4-hour capacity fine ore bins, or
to a covered conical pile of 10,000 MT. Dust will be controlled at the
screens, crushers and all transfer points and drawn to a baghouse where the
dust-laden air will be cleaned and exhausted. Collected dust will be returned
to the circuit.
3.        Fine Ore and Coal Preparation:  Each of the three ore bins, as well
as the coal bin, will have a variable speed belt feeder at their draw points.
The ore bins will be alternately filled, sampled and discharged, and the
feeder belt will be equipped with a continuous weight scale. Dust collection
equipment is included at all discharge and transfer points. Dust is recovered
in a baghouse and returned to the circuit via a screw conveyor.
4.        Approximately one month's coal supply will be stored in an open
yard and will be reclaimed to an eight-hour bin, which discharges to a
transfer conveyor fitted with a belt scale that will combine the required
amounts of coal and ore on the balling plant feed conveyor. The balling
plant feed conveyor will deliver to a twin paddle-type mixer, where water
will be added in controlled proportions. The mixer will feed a 7.6 m variable
speed balling disc, where the ore-coal mixture will be brought up to a final
moisture content of approximately 22% and agglomerated. Provision has been
made for a 6-hour emergency stockpile of green pellets.
5.        Calcination:  The kiln feed conveyor will transport the pellets to
the 6.1x185 m kiln, which will be smoothly lined and fired in a controlled
manner with a long flame and additional air injection through on board riding
1/   See flowsheet (page 35).

fans.  The kiln will discharge the calcine through its refractory-lined hood
surge hopper. Exhaust dust and gases will be collected and ducted to a
multiple cyclone. Coarse particles in the cyclone underflow will be returned
and the cyclone overflow will be scrubbed and exhausted through the 50 m kiln
stack. The dust slurry from the scrubber underflow will go to a thickener
with overflow water being recirculated. The thicknener underflow will be
pumped to a density control tank and reintroduced at the balling disc.
6.        Smelting and Refining:  The hot calcine will be drawn, via transfer
containers supported on a shuttle car, to the furnace charge hoisting shaft
and thence to one of nine furnace charging bins via an overhead crane. The
51 MVA, three electrode electric furnace is designed to operate on Soderberg
electrode paste and will include hydraulic hoists and automatic slipping
devices. The furnace cover will be of the suspended type. The furnace shell
will be cylindrical and equipped with three tapholes for slag and two for
metal. Dust and gases will go to a baghouse where the dust will be separated
and returned. Carbon monoxide emissions will be closely monitored since its
presence may indicate abnormal furnace conditions. If present, it will be
flared either in the furnace stack or in the furnace itself by introducing
excess air.
7.        Slag will be tapped about 6 times a shift and run through refractory
lined launders to one of two slag casting pits and, ultimately, to dump areas.
Ferronickel will be tapped about five times a day. In order to reduce impu-
rities, the metal will be poured into a 40 MT refining ladle and transferred
to the refining station. The ladles will be heated with 5 MVA electrodes and
stirred by electric induction. Sulfur will be removed by treating the metal
with burned lime in the presence of silicon. To improve slag fluidity, fluor-
spar will also be added. Phosphorus will be removed by oxidizing with iron
ore and fluxing with lime.
8.        From refining, the hot metal ladle will be moved to the 60 MT per
hour pig casting machine which discharges the 20 kg pigs into a trommel,
where they are cooled and cleaned. The pigs are then sorted and stacked
manually and finally strapped in 2 MT lots onto pallets to be transported by
fork lift truck to the shipping and storage area.
