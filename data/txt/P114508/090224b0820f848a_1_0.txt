                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will assist the Government of Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative in decreasing the number of polio cases and ultimately eradicating the disease in
                         Pakistan. The development objective is to assist Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio through supply of the Oral Polio Vaccine for the country's supplementary
                         immunization activities during 2009-11.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The TPPEP became effective on August 19, 2009 and has already disbursed 100% of its funds to UNICEF for procurement of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) needed for the
                         Supplementary Immunization Days (SIAs) for polio eradication. Despite significant allocation of resources, there was a funding gap to purchase vaccines for SIAs from July 2011 to
                         December 2012. As a result, the Government of Pakistan requested the Bank to provide additional financing (AF) for TPPEP using the same buy- down mechanism. Based on this
                         request, and due to the emergency situation following the increased caseload of reported polio infections and continuing security issues, the Bank approved an additional IDA Credit
                         of US$ 41 million in April 2011 together with an extension of the project Closing Date until December 31, 2012. During the same period, the Government of Pakistan requested
                         additional funds from the Government of Japan and an additional US$ 65 million was approved in August 2011 by JICA with similar loan conversion arrangements with the Bill and

                         Melinda Gates Foundation. As agreed before, the Bank team selected competitively a firm to carry out the Independent performance audit to report on the results achieved during the
                         implementation for the original TPPEP amounting to US$ 74.8 million. Preliminary results received by the team indicate that the audit results are meeting the project triggers and if
                         unexpected issues do not arise, the Bank is expected to initiate the buy down for the original credit of the TPPEP.

                         The AF for the TPPEP became effective on September 1 2011 and a second AF was signed on 24th of OCtober 2012. Project implementation had been satisfactory for the TPPEP
                         and for the ongoing AF. The first and second AF project has, as of July 30, 2013, disbursed nearly 99% of the project. The vaccine procurement from the first AF has been completed
                         and orders have been placed for vaccines from the second AF. The second AF project was originally processed as an IDA credit, however resources from the Bill and Melinda Gates
                         Foundation have now become available for a partial buy down of the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is rated moderately satisfactory in implementation progress and moderately satisfactory on achievement towards attainment of its development objectives. The vaccines
                         procured until June 2012 are financed from these AF resources and vaccines and operational financing are expected to be adequate until Dec 2013. The second AF has been
                         restructured as funds have been made available by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for partial buydown of the credit.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
