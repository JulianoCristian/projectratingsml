1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

       The Islamic Republic of Pakistan had a population of 170,093,999 at the time of project
appraisal. Pakistan’s total land area equals 796,100 square kilometers, spreading over four
provinces – Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP, formerly North West Frontier Province),
Punjab, and Sindh – and four territories – the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), the
Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). The
FATA is comprised of seven tribal agencies – Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Kurram, Orakzai, North
Waziristan, and South Waziristan.

        During the first half of the 2000s, Pakistan’s economy grew at an impressive pace,
reporting GDP growth of 9%. But with being a large importer of fuel oil and other commodities,
Pakistan experienced terms of trade shock resulting from the global food and fuel price hikes in
the mid-2000s. The global financial crisis in 2008 only accentuated the economic difficulties with
increasing current account and fiscal deficits. Given this fiscal constraint, public expenditure
including for health diminished in 2008-2009.

        Prior to 2008 Pakistan had exhibited improvements in its intermediate health outcomes that
included increases in access to antenatal care (61%), skilled attendance at birth (36%), and the
proportion of fully immunized children (76%). In particular, the Expanded Program on
Immunization (EPI) vaccinated approximately 5.1 million children every year, helping to
significantly reduce morbidity and mortality due to vaccine preventable diseases. Beyond the EPI,
Pakistan also conducted a number of special National Immunization Day (NID) and Sub-National
Immunization Day (SNID) campaigns beginning in 1994 that contributed to the global effort to
eradicate poliomyelitis (polio). This highly infectious disease, caused by a virus that invades the
nervous system and mainly affects children under five years of age, can result in irreversible
paralysis or premature death. Children of the poor, often living in crowded unhygienic conditions
and with lower levels of immunization coverage, present the greatest risk from infection and severe
consequences. Through the vaccination campaigns, however, an estimated 20,000 paralytic cases
of polio a year were being prevented. Despite this progress, challenges in the health sector
remained, including leaving up to one fourth of children unimmunized and vulnerable to polio.

       The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) launched in 1988 by the World Health
Organization (WHO) had been highly successful, with the incidence of polio cases dropping by
99 percent globally since 1988 to only 1315 new cases in 2007. In Pakistan, its own Polio
Eradication Initiative (PEI) had made satisfactory progress in efforts to eradicate polio since 1997.
The annual number of new confirmed polio cases decreased substantially from 1,147 in 1997 to
32 in 2007 (Figure 1), with a concomitant decrease in the number of infected areas.

        Pakistan’s success came at the heels of continued nationwide and effective implementation
of Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs) that included NIDs, SNIDs, and mop-up
campaigns for isolated polio cases and outbreaks. The average vaccination rates exceeded 97
percent during the early to mid-2000s. In support of Pakistan’s PEI since 2003, the International
Development Association (IDA) at the World Bank made available US$112 million in financing
as part of two previous Partnership for Polio Eradication Projects (P081909 in 2003 and P097402
in 2006). These projects assisted with successfully financing the procurement of Oral Polio
Vaccine (OPV) that ensured regular and timely supply of OPV for SIAs. Pakistan also received
support for its PEI from other donors and technical partners, including WHO and the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which financed the operational costs of supplemental
immunization activities and of surveillance/social mobilization activities, respectively.

       In 2008, however, Pakistan saw an upsurge in virus transmission that resulted in 117 new
confirmed cases (50 percent from the known transmission zones and 50 percent from other zones).
Globally, the number of new polio cases increased as well to 1,652 during that same year. The
Government of Pakistan (GOP) addressed the upsurge with a plan to intensify SIAs albeit requiring
additional resources. With a weakened economic environment that arose from external shocks and
growing fiscal deficit, the GOP sought financing for a third IDA-supported Partnership for Polio
Eradication for the procurement OPVs for SIAs.

        As part of the WHO led multi-country effort contributing to eradicating polio from the
world, the Third Partnership for Polio Eradication Project (TPPEP) in Pakistan was intended to be
implemented from August 2009 to December 2011. The financing proposed involved an
innovative “buy down” mechanism that utilized a Specific Investment Project on standard IDA
credit terms, but one that contained a special provision for third party donor funding to i) pay the
service and commitment charges of the credit during the Project’s implementation phase, and ii)
purchase the net present value (NPV) of the IDA credit upon successful completion of the Project.
Buying down, or purchasing, the IDA credit would be triggered if targets related to timely delivery

                                                                                            2
of vaccines at the district stores of the Department of Health and high coverage rates for OPV were
attained, as determined by an independent performance audit. If the audit indicated that the targets
were not met, then Pakistan remained obligated to pay back IDA on the terms of the credit. The
proposed approach was consistent with the previous IDA-supported partnership projects.

        The proposed TPPEP aligned with the priorities of the GOP to strengthen public health
programs, including those focused on immunization and communicable diseases. Moreover, the
Project remained consistent with the primary objective of Pakistan’s FY06-09 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), which was to assist in reducing poverty through improvements in health status
and higher productivity levels. Reducing potential lifelong disability and death from polio
increases people’s capacity to benefit from education and employment opportunities, and reduces
the burden on the health care system. IDA’s involvement was considered valuable given IDA’s
likely contribution to: (i) ensuring timely availability of OPVs for SIAs; (ii) maximizing the results
of the investments of other donors and technical partners who finance operational and surveillance
costs for polio eradication; (iii) maximizing the achievement of the previous two IDA projects;
and (iv) underscoring IDA’s continued commitment to the GPEI.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

        The project’s development objective as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) is
to assist Pakistan’s efforts to eradicate polio.

Project Outcome Indicators (as stated in the PAD):
   1. OPV coverage is at least 90% verified by finger marking in the targeted accessible
        population (children under five) of all high risk districts during August 2009-June 2011.
   2. Number of confirmed polio cases reported
   3. Coverage of Vitamin A supplementation of at least 80% in the provinces during July 2009-
        June 2011.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators (as stated in the PAD):
    1. Procurement of UNICEF certified OPV and delivery to Government of Pakistan’s
       Expanded Program on Immunization for use in the supplemental immunization activities.
    2. Timely arrival of OPV at the district stores of the Department of Health in all the district
       stores at least three days before each of the SIAs.

The indicators to measure project performance and trigger the IDA buy-down include (as stated in
the PAD):
    1. OPV coverage is at least 90% verified by finger marking in the targeted accessible
       population (children under five) of all high risk districts during August 2009-June 2011.
    2. Timely arrival of OPV at the district stores of the Department of Health in all the district
       stores at least three days before each of the SIAs.

1.3   Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

        The Project went through restructuring to request Additional Financing (AF) to cover a
funding gap for procuring OPVs between July 2011 and August 2012, and to extend the Project
Closing Date to December 31, 2012. As part of the restructuring, which was approved on April 21,
2011, the Project made a slight adjustment to the PDO and Indicators. First, the restructuring
modified the PDO stated in the PAD and the Results Framework (RF) to align with the PDO in
the Financing Agreement (FA). The objective of the Project as stated in the FA was to assist
Pakistan in its efforts under its PEI to eradicate polio from its territory. Second, changes to key
indicators included i) specifying that the target number of confirmed polio cases must be measured
on an annual basis; ii) reducing by half the target number of new polio cases per year from 50 by
2011 to 25 by 2012; iii) removing the date parameters on indicators for OPV and Vitamin A
supplemental coverages to reflect that the Project was to be implemented beyond the original
December 30, 2011 Closing Date; and iv) adding a new indicator to track the number of children
immunized in SIAs during the project period in order to fulfill the Bank’s Core Indicator mandate.
The RF indicators in the datasheet include both the original indicators with revised targets and
parameters, and the added indicator (see Annex 10 for changes to PDO and indicators).

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

        The project was intended to benefit all Pakistani children below the age of five. Because
those living in poor and unsanitary conditions are more susceptible to polio and traditionally have
had low immunization coverage, the project was also meant to have a strong poverty focus and
greatly benefit the poor community.

1.5    Original Components (as approved)

        Component 1: Procurement, timely supply, and effective use of OPV (Total estimated
cost at appraisal US$92.65 million; actual IDA financing US$74.68 million). Although
Pakistan’s PEI comprised of three components – (i) procurement, supply and effective use of oral
polio vaccines in SIAs for the purpose of immunizing children under five years of age; (ii)
supplemental immunization activities; and (iii) surveillance – the TPPEP was to support only the
first component and finance the purchase of OPVs for SIAs, just as in predecessor projects. The
focus on timely supply and effective use of OPVs stems from Pakistan’s revised PEI strategy of
interrupting increased transmission of polio and eradicating polio through intensified SIAs. This
approach involved increasing the number of SIAs annually to six and the coverage rate of each
round to 90%, both of which in turn required an increased amount of OPV. Project funds would
not be handled by the GOP but transferred directly to UNICEF, the designated vaccine supplier
under an agreement between the GOP and UNICEF. Accordingly, only UNICEF was to provide
financial management and accounting for the funds and provide semi-annual reports to the
government with copies to IDA. IDA would use these reports to monitor the outstanding balance
and the funds received and spent by UNICEF.

       Not Applicable

1.7    Other significant changes

        Level II restructuring to provide AF, extend the Closing Date, align language of PAD
PDO with PDO in Legal Agreement, revise language in indicators to reflect extension of
Closing Date, and add one key outcome indicator (Approved by the Board on April 21, 2011).
In response to the GOP’s request, the Board approved project restructuring on an emergency basis
to cover a funding gap in financing the procurement of OPVs from June 2011 to August 2012. The
shortfall resulted from the scale-up of activities under Pakistan’s emergency plan to halt the
dramatic increase in cases in 2010. The surge in polio cases resulted from the widespread
transmission of the virus that primarily came from ongoing population movements following
large-scale floods in 2010 and the persistent conflict in the KP and FATA that resulted in limited
vaccination campaigns in those areas. Specifically, Pakistan had developed the National
Emergency Action Plan 2011 for Polio Eradication (NEAP 2011), which required additional
amounts of OPVs for SIAs based on the following: i) the new GPEI belief that SIA coverage in
Asia needs to increase to 95% if it hoped to stop epidemic transmission; ii) the new WHO
recommendation that all target groups receive at least six doses of vaccines every year; and iii) the
new recommendation from the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of national and international
experts that eight rounds of SIAs per year continue in 2011 and 2012. Changes to the Project
included:
 Emergency AF, US$41 million (Special Drawing Rights (SDR) equivalent 26.1). The Project
    met the eligibility for Emergency AF. The AF was implemented under the same institutional
    arrangements. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the United Nations
    Foundation (UNF) committed to support the AF through the same buy down mechanism. The
    buy down trigger indicators remained the same as the original project. The project design and
    scope of TPPEP remained intact under the proposed AF.
 Extension of Closing Date by one year to December 31, 2012.
 Alignment of PAD PDO with PDO in FA. The PDO stated in the PAD was aligned with the
    PDO stated in the FA. The PDO in the RF reflects the aligned language.
 Addition of one key outcome indicator and removal of time-bound parameters from the original
    indicators. One new indicator was added to monitor progress towards achieving PDO, namely,
    total number of children immunized for polio during project period at SIAs to meet the Bank’s
    Core Sector Indicator mandate. In addition, the time bound parameters from the original
    indicators (see description of changes in Section 1.3 and Annex 10) were removed to reflect
    the extension of the Project Closing Date.

        Level II restructuring to provide AF and extend the Closing Date (Approved by the
Board on October 2, 2012). The full disbursement of the original loan and first AF, along with a
separate loan acquired from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), were expected to
cover the required OPVs through December 2012 and beyond to June 2013, and interrupt
poliovirus transmission by the end of 2011. However, poor implementation of strategies in key
high risk areas as dictated in the NEAP 2011 resulted in continued increases in cases. To counter

                                                  5
this, the GOP approved an intensified strategy under an Augmented NEAP 2012 that aimed to stop
transmission by the end of 2012. In addition, the TAG recommended that the eight rounds of SIA
per year be continued in 2012 and 2013. This entailed facing another funding gap for purchasing
vaccines between February 2013 and June 2013. On June 15, 2012, the GOP submitted a request
for another restructuring, which was processed on a fast track basis as a normal IDA credit, to
ensure that the financing for OPV during the campaigns remained uninterrupted. The restructuring
included:
 AF, US$24 million (SDR 15.8). These funds financed the purchase of vaccines required for
    February – June 2013. No changes were made to the PDO, indicators, institutional arrangement,
    and financial Management (FM) and procurement procedures. The financing was processed
    without third party resources to undertake a buy down of the credit.
 Extension of Closing Date by one year to December 31, 2013.

        Level II restructuring to extend Closing Date to June 30, 2014 (Approved by the
Country Director on June 4, 2013). The GOP requested on May 21, 2013 to extend the closing
date of the credit by six months to June 30, 2014. The extension allowed the GOP to use
undisbursed funds to finance SIAs in the next fiscal year. The savings came from the decreased
procurement of vaccines as a result of the reduced number of vaccination campaigns held from
originally planned. The reason for the decrease in campaigns was the violence against polio
workers. This extended the duration of available financing both from the Bank and from JICA to
enable the procurement of vaccines till at least June 2013.

       Level II restructuring to include partial buy down (Approved by the Country
Director on September 11, 2013): This restructuring amended the FA for the second AF to reflect
the new partial buy down clauses. The BMGF obligated US$10 million to be used to pay the
commitment charges, service and interest charges on the credit. Any leftover balance from the
US$10 million was to be used to pay the NPV on the principle amount of the credit. This would
bring down Pakistan’s cost of borrowing, as it would only be responsible for the repayment of the
remaining principal amount of the credit not bought down by BMGF (and any charges, which may
accrue if there are delays in the repayment of the remaining principle).

       Level II restructuring to cancel funds (Approved by the Country Director on
December 23, 2013). The restructuring cancelled the undisbursed amounts under the original and
first AF credits (IDA 64616 of SDR40,506.81 and IDA 4927 of SDR80,555.10), effective
November 21, 2013, the date the Bank received the request for cancellation from the GOP.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

       Soundness of background analysis: The project was prepared prior to the closure of the
previous Polio Eradication Project on June 2008. Throughout the preparation stage, the Bank
sought input from staff who had been involved in the previous polio eradication project, and
worked in close collaboration with technical agencies like WHO and UNICEF. The analysis
supported an effective program strategy, utilizing what worked effectively in the previous project.
In doing so, the analysis took into account lessons learned, such as maintaining a simple design,

                                                 6
following a straightforward objective that supported only one component, and incorporating
existing infrastructure and procedures for its implementation. Therefore, other project alternatives
were considered but rejected. Overall, the approach reflected lessons learned from IDA-supported
Health, Nutrition and Population projects in Pakistan and in the South Asia region specifically by:
(i) working closely and in coordination with the development partners; (ii) keeping the design
simple and well-defined; and (iii) using the regular structures for program management, like the
existing EPI system, rather than a separate stand-alone Project Management Unit.

        Assessment of the Project Design: Despite the increase in the number of polio cases from
32 in 2007 to 117 at the time of project preparation in 2008, it was expected that the country would
likely interrupt Wild Polio Virus (WPV) endemic transmission by the end of 2009, with only
sporadic cases appearing in isolated areas in the following two years. Thus, the Project’s timeframe
of 28 months (August 2009 – December 2011) to conduct NIDs, SNIDs, and targeted mop ups
appeared adequate at the time. The estimated OPV needed for the SIAs during the project period
was approximately 551 million doses, of which 71% was to be intended for NIDs (11 rounds),
25% for SNIDs (5 rounds), and 4% for mop up and outbreak responses. The estimated cost was
US$92.65 million. IDA was to finance OPV procurement for US$74.68 million, while the
Government of Japan was expected to provide the remaining US$7.95 million in parallel financing
with GOP expected to finance US$10.02 million. The six annual SIAs planned remained consistent
with GPEI recommendations. As in the predecessor project, IDA would finance the procurement
of OPV though UNICEF based on an agreement between the GOP and UNICEF. The Bank
accepted using UNICEF’s procurement procedures for the procurement and supply of OPV. The
costs of supplemental operations and surveillance would be financed by WHO and UNICEF,
respectively, with support from various partners. This approach bypassed potential problems with
Pakistan’s lack of procurement capacity at the time. According to FY06-09 CAS, procurement
irregularities was a significant problem in Pakistan, in large part due to a weak regulatory
framework that discouraged due diligence in contract awards and stifled open competition.

        The Project design took advantage of all the institutional arrangements already in place
from a previously implemented project. Specifically, the proposed project aimed to use existing
EPI structures and management systems to receive and deliver OPVs to district stores and to
generate estimates of the required amount of OPV required to conduct the SIAs. Although EPI
was a national program, its implementation was decentralized to well-established structures at the
provincial and district levels accustomed to conducting SIAs. An Inter-Agency Coordination
Committee (IACC) at the national level coordinated with international and domestic partners for
the overall strategy of the SIAs. Coordination Committees in place at the district levels – comprised
of government officials of relevant departments, local political and social leaders, and
representatives of non-government organizations and development partners – played a role in
coordinating district health management teams and the heads of all line departments. With no new
structures to be created at the national and sub-national levels, the design allowed for a quick start
up without disrupting the PEI program that needed to effectively deliver OPVs and continue with
SIAs in order to maintain a high level of immunity if it hoped to interrupt transmission of the virus.

       In terms of the practicality of the PDO and component, they represented follow-ons from
the previous project, thus keeping the momentum from the progress already made despite the
remaining challenges to eradicating polio from the country. The link between providing support

                                                  7
for the procurement of OPVs to achieving the PDO is based on the rationale that providing the
OPVs in a timely manner will give the GOP and its partners sufficient time to plan and manage
SIAs; and successfully conducting SIAs by meeting appropriate vaccination coverage rates will
interrupt the transmission of the virus, resulting in a decline in the number of cases reported.
Although the Project monitored the timely supply of vaccines, vaccination rates, and number of
new cases, the results chain assumes that the process in between, i.e., the implementation of SIAs,
would be done efficiently, which may not necessarily be the case. Including at least one indicator
to assess how the SIAs were implemented would have helped explain any potential disconnect
between a situation where the EPI store receives all vaccines on time at the front end, but then not
coinciding in a reduction in cases down the road. Also, the PAD highlighted security concerns,
particularly in KP, FATA, and Balochistan, as clear impediments to achieving polio eradication.
As a mitigation measure, Pakistan’s Revised PEI Strategy proposed enhancing the involvement of
local communities, religious leaders, and warring parties. Although this mitigation step falls in the
purview of Component 2 (Supplemental Immunization Activities), tracking its progress would also
have helped explain any gaps in the design or disconnect between Project inputs and achieving the
PDO. Moreover, the fact that coverage rates were tracked only among accessible target populations
hid the potential impact of unprotected, unmonitored children who may not be accessible but
subsequently contribute to spreading the virus, such as when large scale population movements
with unprotected children go into polio-free areas.

       The buy-down mechanism allowed Pakistan to borrow on concessional terms from IDA to
address specific development problems and see these loans turn into grants upon successful
achievement of results. Because of the generous loan terms, each grant dollar would unlock
US$2.50-3.00 for Pakistan to fight polio. To determine whether or not to trigger the buy down, an
independent agency competitively selected by the Bank was to conduct a performance audit within
three months of expending the IDA funds to evaluate the results of two performance indicators
(see Section 1.2). The BMGF and UNF agreed to provide funds to buy down the debt incurred by
Pakistan for successfully implementing the project.1

2.2        Implementation

        Flood. The floods in late July to August 2010 in KP, Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan
affected about 20 million people, destroyed 2 million homes and 514 health facilities, and
submerged one fifth of Pakistan’s land area. This natural disaster forced large-scale population
movements, with huge segments of the population living in crowded temporary housing with
inadequate water and sanitation facilities. The situation exposed many who had never been in
contact with the polio virus, which subsequently contributed to the widespread transmission of the
virus. Not surprisingly, the increase in cases in 2010 came mainly after the floods, with only 27
polio cases reported in July to 85 in October and 144 by end December 2010. In the aftermath of
the floods, WHO led the response to conduct immunization activities in the camps for the flood-
affected population. Controlling the increase in cases required additional SIAs and mop up

    The BMGF for the original credit, the first AF, and the second AF; the UNF for the original credit and the first AF.


                                                             8
campaigns that eventually created a shortfall in available funding to complete the TPPEP as
scheduled.

        Security challenges for vaccinators. Just as the 2010 flood situation had settled down,
security issues became a growing concern for the remainder of the Project. Attacks on vaccination
teams and community health workers, many of whom were drawn from the country's 100,000
strong army of Lady Health Workers (LHWs) became an issue. During the last two years of the
Project (2012-2014), militants attacked and killed more than 30 LHWs, mostly in Sindh and KP.
The threat of attacks terrorized and forced health workers to be accompanied by armed police as
they went door-to-door looking for children to inoculate. In one such incident, however, the
shooting of a police officer who escorted polio vaccination campaign workers terrified health
workers, who immediately went back to their homes, suspending the campaign in that village.
Worsening security issues during this time reduced the number of campaigns conducted and the
amount of vaccines procured, resulting in savings that could not be fully utilized by the end of the
Project.

        Vaccination Bans. No health polio vaccinator had been able to enter North Waziristan and
South Waziristan in FATA since June 2012 when the Taliban militants banned all polio campaigns.
This scared parents in the area from participating in the vaccination campaigns. Even before then,
however, the militants were already suspicious of polio vaccinations, which were characterized by
radical clerics as a western plot to sterilize Muslim children. In mid-June 2014, however, about
half a million people in North Waziristan fled their homes as military operations against terrorist
factions in the area began. The internally displaced families were forced to pass through army
checkpoints, where children were offered vaccination. Within two weeks, almost 200,000
previously unreachable children were vaccinated. As with the security issues, the ban resulted in
fewer funds being used; consequently, the GOP requested a Closing Date extension to allow for
additional time to use funds and procure more OPVs.

        Management. Inventory management for vaccines remained a weak area during project
implementation. The main issues involved a) periodic inventory reconciliation that were not
conducted; b) inventory records that were maintained manually; c) inventory that could not be
traced by batch number and expiry date once issued from the federal EPI Cell; d) delays in
preparing OPV Mapping document that UNICEF required to procure vaccines; and e) delays in
delivering OPVs to stores. In spite of the delays in OPV arrival, OPVs held at the various stores
for EPI activities were used as a buffer stock until the OPVs designated for SIAs arrived. This
helped in avoiding delays in conducting actual SIAs. There was no provision under the project to
support the inventory management systems. The Bank continued to highlight these weaknesses
during supervision missions and as a result, the GOP with UNICEF support carried out a vaccine
management review.

        Change in implementation agencies. While overseeing the routine immunization
program, the EPI Cell under the Ministry of Health (MOH) had also been the implementing agency
for the Project. With the passing of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan on July 1,
2011 however, the Project’s institutional arrangements changed. The Ministry of Interprovincial
Coordination (MoIPC) took over some of the federal functions of the MOH, including the EPI
Cell’s role in implementing the Project. Subsequently, the GOP and UNICEF signed a special

                                                 9
procurement agreement that allowed the MoIPC to decide the required type and the number of
doses of vaccines for each SIA round. With the establishment of the Polio Monitoring Cell at the
Prime Minister’s (PM’s) Office also in 2011, the functions related to the oversight and technical
guidance for the national polio eradication efforts were taken over by this unit. While this led to
an increased focus on polio activities and strengthened the political and administrative
commitment behind the program, it also resulted in decreased coordination between the polio
eradication initiative and routine immunization activities. The GOP undertook additional changes
in 2013 with the creation of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and
Coordination (MONHSRC), which took over federal functions related to the EPI Program, the PEI,
and health in general. This helped improve the coordination between routine immunization
activities and polio eradication.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

        M&E Design: The monitoring and surveillance system for the program, including for SIAs,
was well established even prior to the first Polio Eradication Partnership Project in 2003. TPPEP
made use of the same system, thereby ensuring utilization, and further strengthening of the existing
capacity and sustainability. The TAG reviewed the status of PEI at least annually and provided
overall guidance. The Project identified four indicators (three originally from the PAD and one
added after the first restructuring) to monitor its progress toward achieving the PDO, as well as
two intermediate outcome indicators (both originally from the PAD). The baseline data came from
the EPI unit that managed Pakistan’s routine immunization and oversaw the SIAs. To collect data,
the Project utilized the country’s well-established monitoring and surveillance system accustomed
to tracking the progress of SIAs. The indicators used to monitor progress included: (i) SIA
coverage data; (ii) output monitoring of quality and coverage of SIA; (iii) SIA outcome monitoring
through Adverse Events following Immunization surveillance; (iv) periodic progress assessment
reports of the TAG/independent coverage and quality evaluations based on independent
performance audits that measured the achievement of performance indicators; (v) Vaccine Arrival
Reports which, besides the vaccine arrival time, also provided details of vaccine conditions at
arrival – right temperature, quantities, and expiration dates. Although the indicators selected served
to monitor how the timely purchase and delivery of vaccines can contribute towards achieving the
PDO, an assumption was made that once OPVs reached the EPI Federal Store that the vaccines
would be efficiently managed, such as tracking wastage. The population target was calculated by
applying growth rate projections to the 1998 population census figure, taking into account that a
third of births were unregistered.

         M&E Implementation: SIA coverage data was regularly reported by recording the
number of children immunized during each round against the number in the target group.
Monitoring of indicator targets and coverage, based on the revised RF’s indicators list and targets,
was to be completed immediately after each SIA in all districts. The work was to be done by
district-level semi-independent teams consisting of national and district staff and WHO/UNICEF
consultants. However, a 2012 UNICEF report on Improving Eligible Enumeration and OPV
Management found that insufficient time was set aside for compiling and consolidating reports at
the end of each campaign day. As a result, checking of data was ineffective and simple arithmetical
errors went through from Tally Sheets to Area-in-Charge reports. The report also found that in two


                                                  10
SIAs, much of the reporting was done either verbally or via phone texts, and frequently with no
paper records. As a result, reported data may have been unreliable.

         The Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance system, considered the gold standard for
detecting polio cases, in Pakistan had been fully operational and had maintained international
standards for quality in key indicators since 2000. These indicators included: (i) non-polio AFP
rate - at least one non-polio AFP case per 100,000 persons aged < 15 years; and (ii) completeness
and timeliness of stool specimen collection – at least 80% of AFP cases with two adequate stool
specimens collected from patients within 14 days of onset of paralysis. In addition, Pakistan
employed environmental surveillance that involved testing sewage and other environmental
samples for the presence of poliovirus as a means of confirming WPV infections in the absence of
cases of paralysis. Regular monitoring of cases also occurred at Union Council level, PM Polio
Cell, and at each of the Chief Minister’s offices at the provincial and district.

       M&E Utilization: The Project utilized data for planning SIAs, including vaccine
requirements and geographical areas/population groups needing focused attention. Data were also
used to assess vaccine needs for SIAs and financing requirements in order to request AF. Based
on M&E findings and to address persistent transmission of the poliovirus, the Bank team
recommended that the current technical and implementation strategy needed to be reviewed.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

        The Project was rated as Category C. As was already being practiced in Pakistan prior to
this Project, small plastic vials containing the OPV were to be disposed off in accordance to WHO
guidelines for immunization campaigns. However, UNICEF’s report on OPV Management found
many instances where empty vials were discarded with the municipal trash, rather than into proper
waste facility. The FM performance remained ‘Satisfactory’ for most of the Project’s life. The IDA
financed OPV procurement through UNICEF and as per the Fiduciary Principles Accord between
UN and The World Bank, accepted the UNICEF FM arrangements for the Project. The Project
successfully disbursed 100% of its funds to UNICEF for procurement of OPVs needed for the
SIAs. The only reporting requirement for the project was submission of semi-annual financial
reports by UNICEF to the GOP, but these were submitted with delay though the life of the project.
UNICEF’s weak contract management may have contributed to the delayed preparation and
submission of reports. Another reason for the delay simply related to dealing with different
financial year periods as defined by the GOP and UNICEF. The delay in the GOP receiving the
reports in turn affected the timeliness of the GOP’s financial reporting to the Bank. With regards
to procurement, UNICEF was required to receive an “OPV Mapping” document to initiate the
vaccine procurement process and needed nine weeks to process the procurement request. However,
the approval process of OPV Mapping prior to the issuance of the purchase order, which was
primarily done by UNICEF in consultation with the GOP, was subject to last minute changes from
WHO. This sometimes led to longer than anticipated completion times. This points to a lack of a
system for estimating district-level OPV requirements in time in order to effectively plan and
execute the procurement process. To streamline the process, a database of estimated children to be
vaccinated before the start of each year could be used to effectively plan for OPV procurement
and subsequent logistics.


                                                11
2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

        Upon fully disbursing each of the IDA funds (original credit, first AF, and second AF), an
independent agency competitively selected by the Bank conducted performance audits of the
Project. The performance audit reported on timely vaccine procurement, its use, and the
immunization coverage of children. The Performance Audit Report for the original credit and first
AF reported that performance targets were met, which triggered buy downs of the credit. The
report for the second AF, however, concluded that the trigger targets were not achieved.

        Moving to a zero polio case environment in Pakistan remains a challenge. Pakistan’s
Economic Affairs Division indicated that other development partners (JICA and the Islamic
Development Bank) would meet the immediate needs for Polio activities. To certify the country
as polio-free, Pakistan would need to continue SIAs for at least three years following the last
confirmed case to ensure total elimination. Until global eradication is achieved, SIAs with high
coverage will be necessary to prevent reintroduction of the virus into Pakistan. To reach this goal,
the GOP recently developed a Special Operational and Security guidelines, and has involved
security forces and military action to gain access to what use to be inaccessible areas. Working
with different sectors may provide alternative strategies to challenging environments. The GOP
also requested the Bank to focus its future efforts on strengthening routine immunization in the
country. The Bank is currently preparing a project with the GOP to revamp the governance,
management, and accountability systems for routine immunization to ensure equitable
immunization in Pakistan.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of PDO and design/implementation (combined rating): Substantial.

        Relevance of PDO: Substantial. The Objective was consistent with the CAS for the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan 2006-09 that listed polio eradication as a key health outcome,
emphasizing the need to strengthen immunization programs and control communicable diseases.
Pakistan’s Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2009 underscored the country’s
commitment to conducting NIDs to eradicate polio, while indicating that the major brunt of such
disease fell to the poor and vulnerable population. More recently, the Pakistan’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period FY2015-19 underscored the Bank’s interventions in
polio eradication as contributing to improved access to child health services, providing high impact
to the Bank’s twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The Banks’ support in
eradicating polio aligned well with Pakistan’s own efforts as evident from the most recent 2014
NEAP for Polio Eradication.

       Relevance of design and implementation: Substantial. Given the anticipated challenges
in covering the population within known transmission zones hampered by an unstable security

                                                 12
situation, the design could have focused more on developing solutions to target and boost
vaccination coverage within the security compromised areas. In addition, indicators to monitor
such progress could have been added into the framework as part of project restructuring, which
was undertaken several times. To the GOP’s credit, it revised its NEAP annually to address
changing transmission patterns in the virus and to highlight evolving strategic plans to combat
polio; however, lack of accountability may have led to poor management of the implementation
of SIAs and OPV use.

        The continued reports of polio in Pakistan, as well as recent recommendations to increase
the number of SIAs conducted per year and to increase vaccination coverage rates, meant that
SIA’s had to be maintained and at an enhanced level. With the GOP’s repeated requests for
financial support to procure OPVs to be used in the SIAs, the one component under this Project
remained relevant. Given that the cost of procuring and supplying OPVs represented 50% of the
cost to conduct SIAs, IDA financing remained a significant contributor to Pakistan’s PEI.

       The arrangement with UNICEF to procure OPVs remained relevant. While Pakistan’s EPI
program has had a strong history of conducting SIAs, its procurement capacity remained limited,
especially for large-scale international procurement. UNICEF not only provided the purchasing
power for such purchases, but also ensured adequate supply of OPVs. Moreover, Pakistan
benefited from a price break on OPVs as part of the UNICEF Procurement Service.

         The innovative buy down mechanism remained relevant throughout the life of the Project.
In fact, three separate FAs were signed under the Project, all of which included a buy-down option
that allowed third party donors to purchase Pakistan’s IDA loans upon successfully meeting
performance targets. In total, the principal amount and associated interest fees under the original
loan (US$74.68 million) and first AF (US$41 million) were fully bought down by the BMGF and
UNF. Although Pakistan used the funds from the second AF to procure OPVs for SIAs during the
last year of the Project, it failed to meet the performance targets during this period that would have
triggered the buy down of the second AF.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

        Rating: Modest. The development objective of the Project was to assist Pakistan’s efforts
to eradicate polio. Between August 2009 and June 2014, the Project supported the procurement,
supply, and effective use of OPVs in SIAs (actual: US$142.72 million). During this time, JICA
donated a substantial amount to purchase OPVs (actual: US$30 million). Following the approval
of the second AF, the Project also benefited significantly from additional funding from the Islamic
Development Bank (actual: US$110.58 million).

        The Project exceeded in achieving three – PDO indicators 1, 3, and 4 – of the four PDO
indicators. Based on data from SIAs held between June 2013 and January 2014, the coverage rates
averaged 95% (range of 90-97%), thus meeting the target of 90% coverage in accessible
populations of high-risk districts. The latest data on the total number of children immunized during
three SIAs between January and March 2014 exceeded the target (target: 32,000,000; actual:
32,060,840), reaching a 99% coverage rate. Project data from 2012 (actual: 33,329,429) and 2013
(actual: 34,327,874) also showed that the vaccination campaign consistently exceeded the target.

                                                  13
These results are encouraging since the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-2012 recommended that in
certain high density districts in Pakistan, a population immunity of >95% in children under five
years of age must be achieved to stop transmission.

        Despite these accomplishments under the project, increases in polio cases continued to be
reported in 2010-2011 and in 2014 (Figure 2). The first upsurge came in the aftermath of
catastrophic floods in August 2010 when the country witnessed mass migration that resulted in
large populations living in crowded and unsanitary settings. The situation coincided with the peak
transmission season for the poliovirus and created prime conditions for spreading infection. The
GOP, with support from WHO, responded with an intensified focus on scaling up SIAs, which
helped bring down the number of cases the following year. Around this time, however, the
vaccination ban in FATA, as well as the continuing security issues in Sindh and KP, brought about
significant barriers to implementing SIAs that lasted throughout the remainder of the Project,
culminating with 306 polio cases at the end of 2014. Of these 306 cases, 277 (91%) were from the
FATA, KP, and Sindh areas where the Project could not safely provide support. The Bank team
highlighted that prevailing security issues in FATA and KP affected more than 90% immunization
coverage of the targeted population (children under five years) in those areas. At one point in 2011,
nearly 75% of the confirmed cases were being reported from these high-risk districts. Despite
achieving 95% coverage rates in non-endemic polio transmission areas in Pakistan, polioviruses
thrived in active transmission zones within areas that were inaccessible to the project team. This
provided an environment where the poliovirus had opportunities to penetrate transient gaps within
highly vaccinated areas to infect unprotected children and allow transmission.

        Although the total number of cases increased over time, the proportion of cases reported in
five of the six provincial/territorial areas actually went down (Table 1). Only FATA reported an
increase in proportion of new cases, moving up from 12% in 2008 to 58% in 2014 (Table 1). At
the project closing in June 2014, 100 new cases (PDO indicator 2) for the year to date were reported
from three provinces (FATA, KP, and Sindh). Seventy-three percent of the cases originated in
FATA, 17% came from KP, and 10% from Sindh, all of which had security problems where the
Project could not provide support. No cases were reported in the rest of the country at the time,
which points to successfully achieving and maintaining an adequate level of immunity in these
areas. While these areas have since registered sporadic cases through December 2014 but after the
Project closed, they have not resulted in a sustained transmission. During the project preparation

in 2008, cases had been reported in all six provinces with a more equal distribution pattern that
indicated a more endemic viral transmission covering a wider geographic area.

        Figure 3 depicts the number of polio cases reported since 1982. It also shows that while
the average annual number of cases during the implementation of the Project was more than twice
the average annual number during the previous Polio Partnership Projects (143 cases annually
versus 62 cases), the registered cases are significantly lower compared to the 1982-1993 period
prior to implementing NIDs in Pakistan (1,295 cases annually) and to the 1994-2002 period when
Pakistan began conducting NIDs but before IDA’s involvement (426 cases annually).

        Much of the increase in cases since 2009 originated from areas with security problems. The
ban in FATA, which began in June 2012, made that area unsafe and inaccessible, creating a
veritable transmission zone. This was a challenging project with people dying to provide
immunizations. Military operations in June 2014 and November 2014 finally paved the way for
vaccinators to access children in FATA, where almost 200,000 and more than 700,000 children
were vaccinated, respectively. Considering the broader issue of polio immunization and in light of
the prevailing situation in FATA, KP, and Sindh, Pakistan could have taken more aggressive action
sooner to curb the disease from its territory, including working with different sectors to provide
alternative strategies to challenging environments.

3.3        Efficiency

        Rating: Modest. A recent study assessed the global investments and progress achieved
since the GPEI was launched in 1988, with post-eradication policies extended out to 2035. In total,
more than eight million cases of paralytic polio in children will have been prevented, translating
into real savings from reduced treatment costs and gains in economic productivity. The estimated
economic benefits of the GPEI came to between US$40-50 billion based on activities from 1988
through 2035 (assuming eradication of WPV in 2012 or shortly thereafter). Low-income countries
gain the most, accounting for approximately 85% of the net benefits as a result of the huge
incremental number of paralytic polio cases prevented. Today, GPEI’s investment of $9 billion
since 1988 has already generated net benefits of $27 billion, out of the estimated $40-50 billion
previously estimated. Once eradication is achieved globally, an estimated two million cases would
be prevented in the first decade. Within a few decades, this would amount to tens of billions of
dollars in savings after covering costs of the program. In addition to the benefits of eradicating
polio, the analysis also reported the health benefits of 'add-on' interventions of the GPEI, such as
the systematic administration of Vitamin A and other life-saving interventions, which result in an
additional US$17-90 billion in benefits. 2

        The sole component of this Project supported the procurement, supply, and effective use
of OPVs for SIAs. Not fully achieving both intermediate outcome indicators provided evidence of
the delays experienced by the Project. And while no substantial impact could be seen that might
have restricted the amount of OPV drops given to children who should have received them,
weaknesses in the management of OPV use and M&E existed, as discussed in the implementation
and M&E section above. The amount expensed for procuring the OPVs was 191.11% over the
originally planned amount (US$74.68 million vs. US$ 142.72 million). The additional expenses
came about due to the GOP’s request for unanticipated AF to cover the cost of procuring additional
OPVs following increases in polio cases and new SIAs recommendations to increase the number
of immunization campaigns while striving for 95% coverage rates. In addition, the Closing Date
of the Project was extended twice, once for an additional 12-month period and another for an
additional six-month period. Therefore, while the Project turned out to be more expensive and
longer than originally planned, this was a direct result of the floods and the general emergency
situation to which the Bank responded very efficiently.

3.4        Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The overall rating is based on the following sub-
ratings: (i) Relevance of the objectives and design/implementation – Substantial; (ii) Efficacy in
Achieving the PDO – Modest; (iii) Efficiency – Modest.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

        (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The Project contributed
to SIAs that delivered vaccines to poor, remote and underprivileged communities whose
immunization coverage tends to be lowest. Moreover, these communities were highly vulnerability
to polio due to unsanitary and crowded living conditions. However, recent reviews indicate that
there continue to be pockets within the population that refuse to accept the polio vaccine; more
work needs to be done to ensure that these groups benefit from the program. SIAs involved
working with the LHWs, teachers and other local functionaries, as well as emphasized the
inclusion of women in the vaccination teams, all of which helped address the stringent norms on
the seclusion of women and the mobility restriction of females in parts of the country.

        (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening. The PEI, and more specifically the SIAs,
demanded an elaborate system of organizing large-scale campaigns, and the program effectively
responded to the same. Each NID round involved organizing about 80,000 teams, including
70,000 mobile teams, 9,000 fixed teams and 4,600 transit teams to cover about 30 million eligible
children across the country. In addition, each campaign was supervised and monitored by about
800 campaign support persons, 15,000 area in-charges and 2,700 zonal supervisors. Over the years,
the national program staff at various levels, including those working in vaccine stores, acquired
much experience and valuable skills in ensuring that the vaccine reaches the districts in time for
the scheduled SIA.

        (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). Fifteen days prior
to each SIA, all program and non-program health functionaries at all levels were focused on micro-
planning, including staff designated to work on routine immunization. For the health staff at clinics
with limited capacity, maintaining routine immunization functions became a challenge, especially
in light of the number of SIAs conducted each year. With Pakistan still struggles with reaching
adequate rates of fully immunized children, Pakistan will need to find a balance between these
competing priorities.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

        Rating: Substantial. The key constraints/challenges to eradicating polio in Pakistan have
been described in earlier sections. The PEI had prepared a plan and projected the financial
requirements for the same. The program would, through different strategies, focus on the difficult
to reach areas/populations, the changing epidemiology of the disease, and the volatile and
unpredictable security situation. Social mobilization and community involvement has played an
important role in the success of the program to date, and would have to be further strengthened to
ensure full coverage and acceptance by certain groups. The institutional arrangements for program
management are well established. However, polio eradication in Pakistan will continue to be
challenging, both in terms of mobilizing adequate resources, program management, addressing the
constraints imposed by security concerns and responding to the changing epidemiology. As it is,
80% of all global polio cases in 2014 came from Pakistan. Therefore, a sustained effort from the
GOP, along with international partners will be needed to make any headway moving forward.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank designed a project aligned with Pakistan’s
CAS 2006-09 that listed polio eradication as a key health outcome. This was clearly defined in the
PDO. In addition, the Bank team reviewed the national situation based on the reports of the Global
Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, which affirmed that interruption of poliovirus was still
achievable despite increased transmission. The Bank team also requested the WHO to schedule an
assessment of- and plan for revisiting the polio eradication strategy to the GOP by the beginning
of the project. An implementation covenant for the project was related to updated program strategy
approved by the TAG. While the impact of the floods in 2010 could not have been predicted, the
issue over security concerns had long been a standing problem in Pakistan. While the increase in
intensity in violence and upheaval against polio vaccination since 2012 was unforeseen, the Project
could have incorporated mechanisms to ensure accountability with regards to mitigating the risk.
Also, identifying an indicator to account for how OPVs were managed between receiving them at
the Federal store and NID implementation could have provided management accountability and
helped isolate weak links along the results chain.

        The design incorporated an innovative buy-down mechanism to convert the term of a
normal IDA development credit to grant terms through provision of additional external donor
resources under clearly defined performance criteria. The buy down mechanism, which was
successfully implemented in the previous polio partnership projects, provided to Pakistan an
appealing IDA package that allows for a more concessional financing for activities. This meant
getting access to lower cost money when and if the targeted IDA credit is paid off/converted to a
grant. In addition, the financing significantly helped with large vaccine purchases made by
UNICEF, ensuring stable vaccine supplies. From the donor’s perspective, it offered the
opportunity to leverage their funds while ensuring that the aid was tied to performance.

(b) Quality of Bank Supervision

        Rating: Satisfactory. The Project’s Task Team Leader changed three times over the life
of the Project. However, each one of the Team Leaders had experience in managing Bank-funded
development projects. Also, there was no indication that these transitions had any negative effect
on the supervision of the Project. Throughout the Project, the Bank team frequently followed up
on project activities and a team of Bank specialists carried out regular implementation support
missions. A review of the Bank’s supervision budget (Annex 4) indicates that the Bank team
remained engaged in the Project, allocating 131 staff weeks and US$346,370 to supervise project
implementation that amounted to US$69,274 per year.

         As evident from the ISRs, the team was candid in highlighting potential obstacles and
offering solutions on how they could be resolved. The Bank team remained proactive throughout
the life of the Project to ensure implementation progressed. The Bank was responsive to the GOP’s
five requests for restructuring, including two AFs that were approved within three and a half

                                                 18
months from receiving the written requests from the GOP. The AFs allowed the GOP to respond
to the changing polio situation on the ground, while at the same time continuing with planned SIAs
without interruption. The first AF (US$41 million) provided funding to procure OPVs to support
19 SIAs between July 2011 and February 2013, while the second AF (US$24 million) provided
funding to procure OPVs to support 12 SIAs between March 2013 and March 2014.

         Supervisory missions by the Bank team, together with the joint missions with JICA and
relevant development partners, mainly WHO and UNICEF, were instrumental in monitoring
performance and responding to the needs towards achieving the project’s objectives. The Bank
continued to highlight the weaknesses in OPV management during supervision missions and as a
result, government with UNICEF support carried out a vaccine management review.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The overall rating is based on the following sub-
ratings: (i) Bank Performance at Ensuring Quality at Entry –Moderately Satisfactory; and (ii)
Quality of Supervision –Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance (Implementing Agency)

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. Despite the ongoing efforts towards interrupting the
circulation of the WPV in Pakistan, an increase in the number of cases continued, with a surge in
cases after the flood. The GOP responded initially in 2011 in the aftermath of an increasing number
of cases related to those affected by the flood, by developing urgent measures as part of the NEAP
for Polio Eradication 2011. The NEAP put more focus on displaced and migratory populations and
the high-risk geographic areas for aggressive interventions. This was placed under the direction of
the President of Pakistan to show the GOP’s commitment. By its own account, however, the NEAP
did not succeed due to the government’s weak implementation. When polio cases in 2012 and
2013 increased, this time as a result of security issues and vaccination ban, the GOP introduced an
Augmented NEAP, with implementation strategies recommended by the TAG to help increase
monitoring of the program performance and introduce procedures to address mobile and transit
populations and other high risk populations. Moreover, regular monitoring systems were in place
at the Union Council level, PM Polio Cell, and at each of the Chief Minister’s offices at the
provincial and district levels. The GOP was quick to take action in forecasting the need for
resources, and provided sufficient time to make requests for additional financing. This helped
ensure that the momentum to move forward with the planned SIAs was not interrupted. As stated
earlier however, Pakistan could have taken more aggressive action overall in its battle to eradicate
polio from the country.

       The GOP worked with the independent review and performance audit of this IDA buy-
down project, which was undertaken by an independent agency competitively selected by the Bank.
Records for vaccines were maintained at the EPI cell and it was noted that the quantity of vaccines
issued by the federal EPI cell were in agreement with the quantity of vaccines received by the
provincial EPI cell. However, the information related to batch number, dispatch voucher, and

                                                 19
expiry date was not available at the provincial EPI cell. Stock checks were carried out randomly
at federal, provincial and district level but no report was prepared and there were no documented
procedures for periodic physical verification of inventory.

(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The overall rating is based on Moderately
Unsatisfactory rating for Government Performance.

6.     Lessons Learned

        Simple design: The project had a simple design focused solely on procuring and supplying
OPVs through UNICEF, and a straightforward objective of supporting Pakistan’s PEI to eradicate
polio. Having a relatively simple Project design and objective made measuring success much
easier. However, future projects must be designed to effectively monitor their contribution to the
PDO through the results chain framework, which require a critical review of assumptions
underlying proposed project activities.

        Utilizing existing program management: The Project was entirely implemented through
existing structures without any need for making additional arrangement for Project implementation.
This design utilized skills that staff already had in positions necessary to implement the Project,
with a caveat that technical assistance may still be considered to address the significant weaknesses
in certain areas. By taking advantage of existing infrastructure, the Project not only saved time and
financial resources by not having to set up a Project-specific implementation agency, but in
addition, the cost of the staff were already absorbed as part of the GOP’s budget. Hence,
sustainability beyond the Project’s life becomes more likely.

        IDA buy-down mechanism: The project successfully used the innovative IDA-buy down
financing mechanism, which had been used for the first project and similar projects in China,
Botswana and Nigeria. Future projects with measurable outcomes could be considered for a
similar buy-down mechanism.

        Polio eradication versus effective control and routine immunization: Any future Bank
support for polio elimination from Pakistan and the other endemic countries would need to find
the right balance between polio eradication and routine immunization strengthening. The
increasing number of required SIAs and staff time allocated for its implementation inadvertently
hurts the health system’s service delivery due to disruption of routine EPI services. Future Bank
financed projects may also need to assess whether the simple provision of OPV for SIAs is
sufficient, or supporting other elements of the program may provide greater leverage for effective
policy dialogue and program implementation.

         Awareness and ability to respond to changing environment: Countries need to be flexible
in managing its projects. As in this case, the Project had to deal with several unexpected challenges
(flood, vaccinator security, immunization ban). Pakistan managed to develop annual NEAPs to
adjust strategies in response to the changing environment, though successful implementation was
critical. More recently, Pakistan developed Special Operational and Security guidelines, and has

                                                  20
involved security forces and military action to gain access to what use to be inaccessible areas.
Working with different sectors may provide alternative strategies to challenging environments.

Component 1: Procurement, timely supply, and effective use of OPV (actual expenditure
US$142.72 million3)

Procurement of OPV, which constituted the single component of the project, was efficiently
managed by adopting the same arrangement as used for the previous projects. OPV was procured
and supplied to GOP under an agreement between GOP and UNICEF. The National Program
Manager, EPI, was responsible for receiving the OPV at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad,
and for its in-country storage, distribution, administration and use. The oral polio vaccine from the
Federal EPI store is dispatched to Provincial EPI stores based on consolidated estimates prepared
by the EPI teams at union council level along with detailed microplans.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The net present value and economic rate of return were not estimated at Project Appraisal since
the benefit was seen as providing a global public health good.

The sole component of this Project supported the procurement, supply, and effective use of OPVs
for SIAs. The amount expensed for procuring the OPVs was 191.11% over the originally planned
amount (US$74.68 million vs. US$142.72 million). The additional expenses came about because
of the need to cover the unanticipated cost of procuring additional OPVs following increases in
polio cases and new SIAs recommendations to increase the number of immunization campaigns
while striving for 95% coverage rates. Although the Project turned out to be more expensive, this
was a direct result of the floods and the general emergency situation as described in the main text
of the ICR.

A recent study 4 assessed the global investments and progress achieved since the GPEI was
launched in 1988, with post-eradication policies extended out to 2035. In total, more than eight
million cases of paralytic polio in children will have been prevented, translating into real savings
from reduced treatment costs and gains in economic productivity. The estimated economic benefits
of the GPEI came to between US$40-50 billion based on activities from 1988 through 2035
(assuming eradication of wild polioviruses in 2012 or shortly thereafter). Low-income countries
gain the most, accounting for approximately 85% of the net benefits as a result of the huge
incremental number of paralytic polio cases prevented. Today, GPEI’s investment of $9 billion
since 1988 has already generated net benefits of $27 billion, out of the estimated $40-50 billion
previously estimated. Once eradication is achieved globally, two million cases are expected to be
prevented in the first decade alone. Within a few decades, this would amount to tens of billions of
dollars in savings after covering the costs of the program. In addition to the benefits of eradicating
polio, the analysis also reported the health benefits of 'add-on' interventions of the GPEI, such as
the systematic administration of Vitamin A and other life-saving interventions, which result in an
additional US$17-90 billion in benefits.
