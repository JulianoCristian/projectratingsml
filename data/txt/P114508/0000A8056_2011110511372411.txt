                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will assist the Government of Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative in decreasing the number of polio cases and ultimately eradicating the disease
                         in Pakistan. The development objective is to assist Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio through supply of the Oral Polio Vaccine for the country's supplementary
                         immunization activities during 2009-11.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The TPPEP became effective on August 19, 2009 and has already disbursed 100% of its funds to UNICEF for procurement of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) needed for the
                         Supplementary Immunization Days (SIAs) for polio eradication. These resources were used for SIAs until July 2011. The project has a "Buy-Down"mechanism with the Bill and
                         Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations Foundation, which reduces the costs of the Bank"s concessional (IDA) lending terms to grant terms if targets related to high
                         coverage rates for OPV and timely delivery of vaccines in the districts are attained. As Polio cases continue to be reported (with increased reporting in 2010), the Government of
                         Pakistan (GOP) introduced an Emergency Plan for Polio Eradication for 2011 /12. Despite significant allocation of resources, there was a funding gap to purchase vaccines for SIAs
                         from July 2011 to December 2012. As a result, the Government of Pakistan requested the Bank to provide additional financing (AF) for TPPEP using the same buy- down

                         mechanism. Based on this request, and due to the emergency situation following the increased caseload of reported polio infections following the floods of 2010 and continuing
                         security issues, the Bank approved an additional IDA Credit of US$ 41 million in April 2011 together with an extension of the project Closing Date until December 31, 2012.

                         The AF for the TPPEP became effective on September 1 2011. The implementation of the 18th amendment of the constitution of Pakistan from July 1, 2011 transferred most

                         functions of the central Ministry of Health to the provinces and transferred the few remaining functions (vaccine procurement, EPI oversight, Polio eradication program oversight) to
                         the Ministry of Inter Provincial Coordination.

                         Project implementation had been satisfactory for the TPPEP. However, AF TPPEP implementation was delayed as the GOP was in transition to implementing the 18th amendment in
                         the months of April to AUgust 2011. The GOP appointed the MoIPC as the delegated agency for the TPPEP only in mid August 2011. Therefore, the AF effectiveness got delayed
                         until September 1 2011. The expectation is that the project may continue to face implementation challenges given the continuing security situation in Pakistan, the increasing number
                         of reported cases compared to the same period last year and the reporting of new out breaks and cases from areas that had reported zero cases.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is rated moderately satisfactory in implementation progress and moderately satisfactory on achievement towards attainment of its development objectives.

                         The project has a Buy-Downmechanism with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations Foundation, which reduces the costs of the Bank"s concessional (IDA)
                         lending terms to grant terms if targets related to high coverage rates for OPV and timely delivery of vaccines in the districts are attained. The Government of Pakistan introduced an
                         Emergency Plan for Polio Eradication for 2011 /12. There was a funding gap to purchase vaccines for SIAs during July 2011 to December 2012 and this was resolved by requesting
                         additional financing from IDA under the same buy down mechanism up to December 2012. Based on this request, and due to the emergency situation following the increasing
                         caseload following the floods of 2010, the Bank approved an additional credit of US$ 41 million in April 2011.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
