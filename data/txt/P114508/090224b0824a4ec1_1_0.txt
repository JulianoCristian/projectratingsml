                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will assist the Government of Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative in decreasing the number of polio cases and ultimately eradicating the disease in
                         Pakistan. The development objective is to assist Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio through supply of the Oral Polio Vaccine for the country's supplementary
                         immunization activities during 2009-11.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The TPPEP became effective on August 19, 2009 and has already disbursed 100% of its funds to UNICEF for procurement of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) needed for the
                         Supplementary Immunization Days (SIAs) for polio eradication. Despite significant allocation of resources, there was a funding gap to purchase vaccines for SIAs from July 2011 to
                         December 2012. As a result, the Government of Pakistan requested the Bank to provide additional financing (AF) for TPPEP using the same buy- down mechanism. Based on this
                         request, and due to the emergency situation following the increased caseload of reported polio infections and continuing security issues, the Bank approved an additional IDA Credit
                         of US$ 41 million in April 2011 together with an extension of the project Closing Date until December 31, 2012. During the same period, the Government of Pakistan requested
                         additional funds from the Government of Japan and an additional US$ 65 million was approved in August 2011 by JICA with similar loan conversion arrangements with the Bill and

                         Melinda Gates Foundation. The successful achievement of results lead to the buy down of the original credit. For the First AF, JICA and the Bank jointly commissioned a performance
                         audit and as the performance indicators were met the First AF is being processed for a buy down.

                         The AF for the TPPEP became effective on September 1 2011 and a second AF was signed on 24th of October 2012. Project implementation had been satisfactory for the TPPEP

                         and for the ongoing AF. The first and second AF project has, as of July 30, 2013, disbursed nearly 99% of the project. The vaccine procurement from the second AF has been
                         completed and a performance audit has been initiated for the second AF with the report expected by Mid June. The second AF project was originally processed as an IDA credit,
                         however resources from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have now become available for a partial buy down of the project.
