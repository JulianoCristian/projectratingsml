                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will assist the Government of Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative in decreasing the number of polio cases and ultimately eradicating the disease in
                         Pakistan. The development objective is to assist Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio through supply of the Oral Polio Vaccine for the country's supplementary
                         immunization activities during 2009-11.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The TPPEP became effective on August 19, 2009 and has already disbursed 100% of its funds to UNICEF for procurement of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) needed for the
                         Supplementary Immunization Days (SIAs) for polio eradication. Despite significant allocation of resources, there was a funding gap to purchase vaccines for SIAs from July 2011 to
                         December 2012. As a result, the Government of Pakistan requested the Bank to provide additional financing (AF) for TPPEP using the same buy- down mechanism. Based on this
                         request, and due to the emergency situation following the increased caseload of reported polio infections and continuing security issues, the Bank approved an additional IDA Credit
                         of US$ 41 million in April 2011 together with an extension of the project Closing Date until December 31, 2012. During the same period, the Government of Pakistan requested
                         additional funds from the Government of Japan and an additional US$ 65 million was approved in August 2011 by JICA with similar loan conversion arrangements with the Bill and

                         Melinda Gates Foundation. As agreed before, the Bank team selected competitively a firm to carry out the Independent performance audit to report on the results achieved during the
                         implementation for the original TPPEP amounting to US$ 74.8 million. Preliminary results received by the team indicate that the audit results are meeting the project triggers and if
                         unexpected issues do not arise, the Bank is expected to initiate the buy down for the original credit of the TPPEP.

                         The AF for the TPPEP became effective on September 1 2011. Project implementation had been satisfactory for the TPPEP and for the ongoing AF. The AF project has, as of June
                         14 2012, disbursed nearly 99% of the project. The vaccines procured until June 2012 are financed from these resources. The JICA financed resources will be utilized until February
                         2013 and the GOP had requested Bank for additional financing. The bank has processed a second AF of $24 million and the agreement was signed on the 24th of October 2012. The
                         second AF is not yet effective as the government still has to finalize the procurement agreement for vaccines with UNICEF for provision of OPV.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is rated satisfactory in implementation progress and satisfactory on achievement towards attainment of its development objectives. The first AF project progress was
                         rated satisfactory. The vaccines procured until June 2012 are financed from these AF resources and vaccines and operational financing are expected to be adequate until February
                         2013. The second AF, after effectiveness the project will be restructured as funds have been made available by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for partial buydown of the
                         credit.

                         The government needs to fully utilize the resources made available under the original project and AF in order for the 2nd AF to disburse.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
