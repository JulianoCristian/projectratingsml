                                Project Development Objective and Description
Original project development objective: The objective of the project is to assist Pakistan in its efforts under its Polio
Eradication Initiative (PEI) to eradicate polio in the country.

Revised project development objective: NA

Project description: The proposed emergency Additional Financing (AF) will provide support for the first PEI
component, i.e., procurement, supply and effective use of OPV, as part of the Polio Eradication Initiative
(PEI), which has three components: (i) procurement, timely supply and effective use of the oral polio vaccine
(OPV), (ii) supplemental immunization activities; and (iii) surveillance. The proposed AF will help meet
urgent increased financing requirements for the procurement of the OPV necessary to meet the vaccine
requirements from July 2011 to August 2012 in support of the National Emergency Action Plan 2011 for Polio
Eradication in Pakistan. The scaling up activities the AF will cover are due to (i) an increased number of
polio cases reported following the large scale floods of 2010 and the ongoing conflict leading to continuous
population movements in 2010; and (ii) changed requirements for vaccination in line with recommendations
of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and the introduction of new types of vaccine:

I.     Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional
credit in the amount of SDR 26.1 (US$41 million equivalent) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
for the Third Partnership for Polio Eradication Project (TPPEP), in accordance with the Rapid
Response to Crises and Emergency (OP/BP 8.00).

2.      The proposed Additional Financing (AF) will help to meet urgent increased financing
requirements for the procurement of OPV in support of Pakistan's PEI and the implementation of
the Emergency Action Plan for Polio Eradication in Pakistan. The scaling up activities the AF
will cover is a result of (i) an increased number of polio cases following the large scale floods of
2010 and the ongoing conflict leading to continuous population movements in 2010; and (ii)
changed requirements for vaccination in line with recommendations of the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and the introduction of a new type of vaccine. The vaccines are to
be used from June 2011 to August 2012. Therefore, the project Closing Date of the original
project (IDA 4616) is proposed to be extended for 1 year, until December 31, 2012.

3.      The Bank-assisted project is part of a global effort to attain polio eradication and is being
supported through an innovative partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF),
and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Rotary International (RI) through the
UN Foundation (UNF). These partners have supported the TPPEP through an IDA buy-down
mechanism under which they repay the IDA credit to the World Bank at net present value if the
project is implemented successfully. The BMGF and RI have committed to support the proposed
AF. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
are partners that provide technical support, funds for surveillance, program costs, and social
mobilization and communication aspects of the PEI of Pakistan. The Japanese Government and
Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) have provided financial support for the
procurement of OPV and technical cooperation for strengthening the routine Expanded Program
on Immunization (EPI). Furthermore, a Japanese Overseas Development Assistance Loan by
JICA is under consideration for covering a part of OPV and Operational costs.


II.    Background and Rationale for Emergency Additional Financing

4.      Pakistan's PEI is part of the GPEI aiming for a global public good, i.e., eradicating polio
from the world. At the time of launching the GPEI in 1988, over 125 countries were reporting
paralytic poliomyelitis (polio) cases with an estimated 350,000 children with polio each year.
With the implementation of the strategies recommended by the GPEI, by 2006, wild polio virus
(WPV) transmission was limited to only four countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and
Pakistan) with a 99% drop in the annual incidence of polio. But by mid 2009, four new countries
(Angola, Chad, Congo, and Southern Sudan) reported reestablished transmission and 15 other
countries reported new importations. By March 2010, ten of these countries with importations
and two of the reestablished countries (Congo and Southern Sudan) were able to stop
transmission of WPV. In addition, in 2010, Nigeria, Afghanistan and India were able to reduce
cases drastically. However, Pakistan reported an increase of polio incidence from 89 in 2009 to
144 in 2010.

cases is shown below.

6.       The large scale floods of 2010 and the ongoing conflict resulting in continuous
population movements contributed to the increase in total number of reported polio cases. While
only 27 polio cases were reported during the months January to July 2010, this number rose to 85
in October and to 144 by end December. Pakistan's polio cases originate from 10 of the 152
districts in the provinces of Balochistan, KP, FATA and Sindh. These districts continuously re-
infect other districts with 40 districts now reporting WPV cases. With the changing global polio
epidemiology in 2010, Pakistan is now the only out of the remaining four polio endemic
countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan) to report an increasing trend of polio cases.

7.      Experience from other polio endemic countries in 2010 confirms that Pakistan can still
eradicate polio from its territory. However, in order to achieve this Pakistan still needs to
overcome many challenges. These include the following: (i) the floods of 2010 forced large scale
population movements with large population groups living together in temporary housing with
inadequate water and sanitation facilities. This lead to exposure of people who had not been
exposed to the polio virus earlier; (ii) the prevailing security situation affecting the populations
of KP and FATA continues to affect adequate (i.e., more than 90%) immunization coverage of
the targeted population (children under 5 years). With nearly 75% of the confirmed cases being
reported from this area the challenge is to overcome the security related barriers to improve
coverage in these highest risk districts. This challenge is compounded by the recommendation
based on recent data that the persistent WPV transmitting districts may need to attain 95%
coverage to develop adequate immunity responses; (iii) the recently introduced environmental
sampling sites in Karachi and Lahore revealed that most sites are positive for wild polio virus
indicating that water and sanitation measures are grossly inadequate; (iv) the high frequency of
Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIA) (approximately eight SIA annually as
recommended by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), which consists of global and local polio
experts) with varying combinations of different types of polio vaccines (tOPV, bOPV and
mOPV1 and mOPV3) recommended for each round can negatively affect the quality of the SIA

                                                                   7
and the overall program performance at the provincial and district levels; (v) the poor
performance of the routine immunization program which provides routine vaccines for 8
childhood diseases including polio could lead to negative effects on the successful eradication of
the polio virus from Pakistan. It is noted that in 2010, as much as 70% of the confirmed polio
cases had not received any OPV through the routine EPI.

8.      With the increase in the number of reported cases of polio in 2010 Pakistan has taken
additional urgent measures to reverse the increasing trend with the finalization of the recently
prepared Emergency Action Plan for Polio Eradication under the direction of the President of
Pakistan. This plan has specifically focused on displaced and migratory populations and the high
risk geographic areas for aggressive interventions. The renewed commitment and interest from
the political leadership to eradicate polio is at its highest with regular monitoring and oversight
functions performed by the Prime Minister's office and at each of the Chief Minister's offices at
the provincial level. Another encouraging trend is that recent epidemiological evidence suggests
that within the highest risk districts, polio cases are now reported primarily from a selected
number of sub-district administrative units known as `union-councils'. Therefore, it is felt that a
polio free status is feasible as large proportions of the people of Pakistan are now living in polio
free areas. Also, the environmental sampling and other genetic studies have indicated that there
is continued reduction of genetic diversity and a marked reduction of the circulating wild polio
viruses and WPV Type 1 cases respectively in Pakistan.

9.      The TPPEP is the third project in a series since 2003 that provided financial resources to
the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to procure OPV as part of the global campaign. The project
was carried out in partnership with BMGF, CDC and UNF with commitments to `buy down' the
credits on behalf of GOP when the agreed performance measures were achieved.

10.     The TPPEP was approved on June 18, 2009 and became effective on August 19, 2009.
The project is designed to support Component 1 of Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative which
consists of 3 components (i) Procurement, supply and effective use of oral polio vaccines, (ii)
supplemental immunization activities (iii) surveillance. The Project Development Objective
(PDO) of the TPPEP is to assist Pakistan's in its efforts to eradicate polio from its territory. The
TPPEP financing was estimated for the period of 2009-11. Of the original credit of US$74.68
million, as of January 20, 2011 US$59.47 million (84%) has been disbursed and the final release
of funds is expected to be completed by March 2011. Based on the estimated cost for vaccines
required for the SIAs under the emergency plan and the number of doses required at each round,
resources are necessary to scale up the activities to achieve the PDO. The achievement of the
PDO is rated moderately satisfactory while implementation progress is satisfactory with all
implementing agencies adequately discharging their responsibilities. The most recent project
review has confirmed that the activities are executed satisfactorily and the borrower is in
compliance with the legal covenants.

11.     The proposed emergency AF is requested to finance the completion of the original
project activities including the scaling up of activities due to an increased number of polio cases.
The original project development objectives, project design and scope of TPPEP will remain
intact under the proposed AF. The following unanticipated reasons for scaling up activities are
outside the control of the Borrower: (i) an increased number of polio cases following the large
scale floods of 2010 and the ongoing conflict leading to continuous population movements in
2010; and (ii) changed requirements for vaccination in line with recommendations of the Global
Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and the introduction of new bOPV vaccine. Based on the
TAG recommendations the immunization coverage during each SIA needs to be as high as 95%
for epidemic transmission to cease in Asian countries. In addition it is recommended that all
target group children should receive at least six doses of vaccines every year. As a result of this
situation, TAG in consultation with the EPI Cell of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Pakistan
has recommended that the same number of SIAs (i.e. eight rounds per year) will be continued in
2011 and 2012. The program will also use the more effective recently introduced bOPV vaccine
during all sub-national SIAs in 2011 and in 2012.

12.     Estimated funding requirement to meet the scaling up of activities: the GOP is requesting
an additional US $ 41 million to purchase the required OPV vaccines during the proposed project
period (to meet the OPV requirement until August 2012) under the same IDA buy down
mechanism as under TPPEP. The resources required for implementation of PEI's components
(ii) and (iii) (SIAs and surveillance) including operational costs, technical assistance, social
mobilization and communications, surveillance are to be funded by other partners supporting the
GPEI (see Table 3).

13.      Eligibility of TPPEP for Emergency Additional Financing: the proposed emergency
AF is being sought in accordance with the policies described in OP13.20 and OP8.00. The
eligibility details are as follows: (i) The IP/DO ratings in the last two ISRs (Archived dates:
January 4, 2011 and April 21, 2010) were Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory. (ii) Of the
original total amount of SDR 50.2 million (US$74.68 equivalent), 84% has been disbursed as of
February 15 2011. (iii) The proposed AF is fully consistent with the original PDO and the
FY2010-13 Country Partnership Strategy. (iv) The proposed additional financing is meeting the
World Bank's mandate to support the global effort to attain polio eradication in the remaining
polio endemic countries, including Pakistan. (v) There are no outstanding or unresolved
safeguard, environmental, social or fiduciary issues in the Project. The additional investments
would not require any changes to the environmental category of the project, nor would they
trigger any new safeguard policies. (vi) The recipient is strongly committed to the PDOs and to
ensuring effective implementation of the project under AF. (vii) The proposed AF activities are
expected to be completed within three years from the current closing date of the Credit.


III.    Proposed changes

14.    The proposed additional financing will be implemented with no changes to original
project design and PDO and minimal changes to the monitoring indicators in the Results
Framework of the project.

 15.    Results indicators: One new indicator will be included to monitor progress towards
achieving PDO, namely, (v) total number of children immunized for polio during project period
at SIAs, which will be monitored annually. In addition, there are minor amendments to the
original indicators (i) to (iv) which are described in Annex 1: Results Framework. The other
indicators and the buy down trigger indicators will remain the same as the original project (see
Annex 1).

16.     Institutional arrangements: The ongoing project is implemented by the EPI Cell of the
federal MOH and the provincial Departments. The proposed AF will be implemented under the
same institutional arrangements without any changes in the disbursement, financial management
and procurement arrangements.

17.     The closing date of the TPPEP will be extended by one year until December 31, 2012.

18.     The revised cost by component is as follows:

IV.    Appraisal Summary

19.    GOP at federal, provincial and district level is committed to polio eradication. The
proposed credit does not require any additional implementation capacity beyond what is already
in place for the PEI and the existing project, i.e., existing public health structures at federal,
provincial and district level with oversight by the MOH. Even with the ongoing discussions on
decentralization under the 18th constitutional amendment, it is not expected that the PEI
management which is currently in the Prime Minister's office will be decentralized and therefore
no major changes in implementation arrangements are anticipated. The credit will be monitored
through the existing monitoring mechanisms and an already fully functional quality surveillance
system. Furthermore, even if there are minor changes to the current arrangements these are not
expected to alter project implementation significantly, as most activities are technically
supported by WHO and UNICEF at all levels of implementation.

20.     Procurement arrangements: Procurement under the project will be conducted under the
Bank's Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works, and Non-Consulting Services under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits & Grants, January 2011. The procurement procedures applied under the
present project will remain unchanged. Based on a request made by the MOH, UNICEF will
continue to undertake the procurement and supply of OPV through its international procurement
division in Copenhagen as agreed in the ongoing project. A new procurement agreement will be
finalized between GOP and UNICEF to accommodate the total project value (AF amount) with
the closing date of the new agreement as December 31, 2012. As under the ongoing project, the
funds will be transferred to UNICEF for the purchase of all OPV vaccines for SIAs during the
extended project period. This special agreement will continue to allow the MOH, based on the
recommendations of the TAG, to decide the required type and the number of doses of vaccines
required for each SIA round.

21.     The Polio Eradication Trust Fund, holding the donor funds required for the buy down,
will be extended to accommodate the revised project Closing Date and increased IDA lending.

22.    Financial management (FM) and disbursement arrangements: The FM risk rating of
the ongoing project as well as the AF is `Low'. The ongoing project has been rated `Satisfactory'
regarding FM arrangements during the last review mission. As per Fiduciary Principles Accord
between UN and the World Bank, the FM arrangements at UNICEF are acceptable to the Bank
and an FM Assessment is not required. This also meets the requirements of OP 10.02 and the use
of UNICEF financial management systems for this project provide reasonable assurance that the
proceeds of the credit will be used for the purposes for which the credit was granted.

23.     The FM and disbursement arrangements for the AF will be the same as for the ongoing
project. The credit proceeds will be disbursed by the Bank directly to UNICEF for procurement
and supply of OPV, according to the procurement agreement between GOP and UNICEF. Funds
will be released to UNICEF based on a blanket withdrawal application from the GOP authorizing
the Bank to make direct payments to UNICEF in the amount requested under this agreement.
Retroactive financing up to maximum of US$ 7.00 million (SDR 4.45 million) is allowed under AF
with a start date of April 1, 2011. As agreed in the original project, UNICEF will continue to
submit semiannual financial reports on the use of funds received, including funds received under
AF, to GOP with a copy to the Bank. These reports will allow monitoring of funds received,
                                               11
spent and balance available. UNICEF will be managing the funds according to UN financial
regulations; therefore the borrower is not required to submit annual audited financial statements.
However, as in the ongoing project, the Bank retains the option to request for an audit.

24.    Environment aspects and safeguard policies: The project does not cause any negative
environmental or social impacts as it is designed to only purchase oral polio vaccines to support
the GOP's program of SIAs. Furthermore, as these vaccines are given as oral drops there are no
environmental effects due to the implementation of the project. The environmental category for
the AF credit will remain unchanged in category `C'.

25.     Exemptions to Bank policy: The proposed AF does not require any exception to Bank
policies.

26.    Terms and Conditions for Project Financing: The proposed AF will be on standard
IDA terms with 35 years maturity including a grace period of 10 years with a 0.75% service
charge and a maximum commitment charge of 0.5% with a special provision for third party
funded Trust Fund to purchase the credit at its net present value once the project has been
successfully completed in accordance with terms of the financing agreement. The project
includes one Effectiveness condition as follows:

                                 Conditions and Legal Covenants:

 Financing Agreement                Description of Condition/Covenant                Date Due
        Reference
 Article V, Section 5.01   New OPV Procurement Agreement, consistent with          Effectiveness
                           Program Implementation Plan, executed and delivered
                           by the GOP and UNICEF, and effective.


V.     Benefits and Risks

27.    The project is expected to reach all children under 5 years (approximately 32 million
children) and therefore it will benefit all Pakistani children. It will also greatly benefit the poor
and more disadvantaged families as the risk of getting infected with polio is known to mainly
affect the poorer sections of a community. Furthermore, with elimination and thereafter
eradication of polio in the world, it will cease to be a public health problem globally. Polio
eradication will also eventually eliminate forever the cost of polio vaccination incurred by all
countries in the world.

28.     The project related risks are identified in Annex 2 ­ Operational Risk Assessment
Framework (ORAF). The overall original risk for the project was estimated as "Low" because of
the simple project design and low fiduciary risks with the direct transfer of IDA funds to
UNICEF and the compliance with the UN systems. The project implementation has been
satisfactory. However, for the emergency AF, the proposed risk rating is "Medium-L", given the
elevated country risks. The attached ORAF details all the risks related to implementation as well
as the mitigation measures.

                            Annex 3: IDA Buy-Down Mechanism
  PAKISTAN: Additional Financing for Third Partnership for Polio Eradication Project

I. Introduction

1.      This annex describes the arrangements for the implementation of the IDA buy-down
mechanism for polio eradication projects, which aims to convert the terms of the standard IDA
credit to grant terms through provision of additional external donor resources under clearly
defined performance criteria. In the context of the Pakistan Emergency Additional Financing for
the TPPEP, resources for the buy-down will become available as a result of an agreement
between IDA, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Rotary International (RI)
through the UN Foundation (UNF). The buy-down mechanism complies with IDA'S existing
financial policies.

II. Partnership

2.      The World Bank's Health, Nutrition & Population Sector Anchor established a
partnership with BMGF, UNF and several technical partners to assist polio eradication by
providing countries with IDA financial resources but without IDA repayment obligations. The
BMGF and UNF agreed to provide funds to IDA-administered trust fund - Polio Eradication
Trust Funds (PETFs) that will buy down the debt incurred by recipient countries for successful
implementation of polio eradication projects. In addition to making commitment fee and service
charge payments to IDA on behalf of the recipients during project implementation, the PETFs
will, upon successful project implementation, buy down the net present value of the principal
amount of the credit.

III. The Mechanism

3.      IDA is extending a development credit to Pakistan. The Financing Agreement will
include two special provisions:
a) the PETFs will pay the applicable service charges and commitment charges, if any; and
b) the PETFs will buy down the principal amount of the credit upon successful completion of the
project (as determined by a performance audit conducted by an independent agency
competitively selected by the Bank).

4.      The buy-down will be funded by two trust funds, one for the contribution of BMGF and
second for RI through UNF. The buy-down mechanism operates in three stages-credit signing,
project implementation, and project completion. These stages are described below.

IV. At Credit Signing

5.      IDA (FRM) determines the discount rate (the prevailing SDR-basket Commercial Interest
Reference Rates (CIRR) on the date of credit signing) and the foreign exchange rate (SDR:
USD) that will be used to calculate the estimated net present value at final buy-down. The
indicated amount is set aside in a special earmarked child-account under the PETFs. The set-
aside amount equals IDA commitment and service charge payments over the projected

                                              20
implementation period and the estimated amount needed to buy down the principal of the credit
at the end of the implementation period. IDA hedges the foreign exchange risk under its existing
currency rebalancing mechanism.

V. During Project Implementation

6.      Under the project, IDA, acting on a request from the recipient country, disburses funds to
UNICEF, the agency responsible for procuring the OPV. UNICEF in turn supplies the vaccines
to the recipient government. Resources in the earmarked child accounts of the PETFs pay the
commitment and service charges on the disbursed amounts during the implementation of the
project.

7.      If the implementation period is substantially longer than initially projected, funds
required to pay service charges could exceed the funds set aside. However, the investment
income on the set-aside buy-down amount will provide a cushion against this risk. If the
implementation period exceeds five years, the responsibility for servicing the credit will revert to
the recipient country unless the BMGF and UNF grant an extension.

VI. At Project Completion

8.      Upon completion of the project, an independent agency competitively selected by the
Bank will conduct a performance audit within 3 months of project closing to determine if the
IDA funds achieved their intended results. The performance audit measures the results for two
indicators:
a) Timely arrival o f oral polio vaccine at the district stores of the Department of Health at
least three days before each of the SIAs; and
b) OPV coverage is at least 90 percent verified by finger marking in the targeted accessible
population (children under-five) of all high risk districts during project period at SIAs.

9.       If the independent performance audit evaluates the project as satisfactory, the IDA buy-
down will be triggered. The earmarked funds in the PETFs will be used to pay off the IDA credit
at the net present value of the credit based on the defined foreign exchange and discount rates to
buy down the principal of this credit (Repayment Amount). IDA will in turn cancel this credit
and release the recipient from any future liability. If the credit is not fully disbursed, the final
Repayment Amount will be calculated on a pro-rata basis. If the independent performance audit
evaluates the project as unsatisfactory, the recipient will remain obligated to pay back IDA on
the terms of the credit.
