                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project will assist the Government of Pakistan's Polio Eradication Initiative in decreasing the number of polio cases and ultimately eradicating the disease in
                         Pakistan. The development objective is to assist Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio through supply of the Oral Polio Vaccine for the country's supplementary
                         immunization activities during 2009-11.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The TPPEP became effective on August 19, 2009 and has already disbursed 100% of its funds to UNICEF for procurement of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) needed for the
                         Supplementary Immunization Days (SIAs) for polio eradication. Despite significant allocation of resources, there was a funding gap to purchase vaccines for SIAs from July 2011 to
                         December 2012. As a result, the Government of Pakistan requested the Bank to provide additional financing (AF) for TPPEP using the same buy- down mechanism. Based on this
                         request, and due to the emergency situation following the increased caseload of reported polio infections and continuing security issues, the Bank approved an additional IDA Credit
                         of US$ 41 million in April 2011 together with an extension of the project Closing Date until December 31, 2012. During the same period, the Government of Pakistan requested
                         additional funds from the Government of Japan and an additional US$ 65 million was approved in August 2011 by JICA with similar loan conversion arrangements with the Bill and

                         As agreed before, the Bank team selected competitively a firm to carry out the Independent performance audit to report on the results achieved during the implementation for the
                         original TPPEP amounting to US$ 74.8 million. Preliminary results received by the team indicate that the audit results are meeting the project triggers and if unexpected issues do

                         not arise, the Bank is expected to initiate the buy down for the original credit of the TPPEP before December 2012.

                         The AF for the TPPEP became effective on September 1 2011. The implementation of the 18th amendment of the constitution of Pakistan from July 1, 2011 transferred most
                         functions of the central Ministry of Health to the provinces and transferred the few remaining functions (vaccine procurement, EPI oversight, Polio eradication program oversight) to
                         the Ministry of Inter Provincial Coordination.

                         Project implementation had been satisfactory for the TPPEP and for the ongoing AF. Initially, AF TPPEP implementation was delayed as the GOP was in transition to implementing
                         the 18th amendment in the months of April to August 2011. The GOP appointed the MoIPC as the delegated agency for the TPPEP only in mid August 2011. Therefore, the AF
                         effectiveness got delayed until September 1 2011.

                         With the increase of polio cases reported in 2011, the GOP initiated aggressive actions and introduced an 'Augmented Plan for polio eradication for 2012'. With the implementation of
                         this plan, the number of polio cases reported for the first half of 2012 has reduced to 22 when compared to the 60 cases reported during the same period in 2011.

                         The World Bank and the Japan International Coorperation Agency (JICA) Pakistan offices signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2012 to further improve collaboration and
                         coordination between the two institutions and to provide well coordinated responses and suggestions during the implementation of the project.

                         The AF project has, as of June 14 2012, disbursed nearly 99% of the project. The vaccines procured until June 2012 are financed from these resources. The JICA financed resources
                         will be utilized until February 2013 and the GOP has requested Bank for additional financing. The bank team is expected to process this request along with a request to supporting
                         the Expanded Program on Immunization.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is rated satisfactory in implementation progress and satisfactory on achievement towards attainment of its development objectives.

                         The project has a Buy-Dow mechanism with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations Foundation, which reduces the costs of the Bank"s concessional (IDA)
                         lending terms to grant terms if targets related to high coverage rates for OPV and timely delivery of vaccines in the districts are attained. The Government of Pakistan introduced an
                         Emergency Plan for Polio Eradication for 2011 /12. There was a funding gap to purchase vaccines for SIAs during July 2011 to December 2012 and this was resolved by requesting
                         additional financing from IDA and also from JICA under buy down mechanisms up to December 2012 / June 2013 respectively. Based on this request, and due to the emergency
                         situation following the increasing caseload following the floods of 2010, the Bank approved an additional credit of US$ 41 million in April 2011 and JICA approved a loan with a loan
                         conversion arrangement with the Bill and Melinda Foundation for USD 65 million in August 2011.

                         With the increase of polio cases reported in 2011, the GOP initiated aggressive actions and introduced an 'Augmented Plan for polio eradication for 2012'. With the implementation of
                         this plan, the number of polio cases reported for the first half of 2012 has reduced to 22 when compared to the 60 cases reported during the same period in 2011.

                         The World Bank and the Japan International Coorperation Agency (JICA) Pakistan offices signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2012 to further improve collaboration and
                         coordination between the two institutions and to provide well coordinated responses and suggestions to the Government of Pakistan.
                         A mission reviewed project implementation in collaboration with JICA in March / April 2012.

                         The AF project has, as of June 14 2012, disbursed nearly 99% of the project and project progress was rated satisfactory. The vaccines procured until June 2012 are financed from
                         these AF resources and vaccines and operational financing are expected to be adequate until February 2013.

                         The original project component is currently being assessed by a competitively selected independent firm. The objectives of the firm are to review project progress in relation to the
                         agreed results. If the verification confirms that the project results are met, the original credit is expected to be converted to a grant with the activation of the 'buy down' supported by
                         the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.
