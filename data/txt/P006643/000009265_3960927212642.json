The second objective is the\n            establishment of an effectively functioning road maintenance\n            and pavement management organization. This project would\n            help the government by: 1) strengthening the capability of\n            MOP's Road Directorate through a more focused training\n            program, 2) reaching normal maintenance levels through a\n            distribution of funds balanced between road investment and\n            maintenance, 3) reestablishing a functional local road\n            maintenance system, 4) improving Vialidad's competence\n            in the economic evaluation of road construction, 5)\n            resolving major traffic congestion problems, 6)\n            rehabilitating road bridges and 6) assisting the Government\n            in external resource mobilization for guaranteed project implementation."}, "docdt": "1989-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
