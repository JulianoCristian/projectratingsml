the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Second Road Sector Project (Chile). The\n            main objective of the project was to support the\n            Government's careful financial management and efficient\n            execution of the road investment and maintenance program of\n            the Ministry of Public Works (MOP). Based on the successful\n            implementation of the previous loans, the Borrower and the\n            Bank reached clear and realistic agreements on financial\n            arrangements, scope of technical assistance and studies,\n            programming of civil works and procurement, disbursement,\n            reporting and monitoring procedures to promote achievement\n            of project objectives. The project was highly successful in\n            the achievement of its objectives. It achieved fully, and\n            even surpassed, all objectives, particularly those related\n            to institutional strengthening of, and financial allocations\n            to, the road subsector, The Bank's performance during\n            preparation, appraisal and implementation of the project was\n            highly satisfactory and was performed with low staffing\n            input. Project outcome was highly satisfactory. The main\n            lesson for future projects is that their successful\n            implementation will require: a) strong commitment by the\n            Government, sector institutions and beneficiaries; b)\n            coherent and flexible project design, based on relevancy and\n            feasibility of project components; c) well-defined and\n            uniform financial, institutional and procurement\n            arrangements applying to the entire program, including\n            externally funded projects; d) clear definition of specific\n            performance targets for individual project objectives; e)\n            favorable macro-economic conditions; and f) adequate\n            agreements with co-financiers, particularly on harmonization\n            of procurement practices."}, "docdt": "1995-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
