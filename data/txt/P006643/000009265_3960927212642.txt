equivalent to approximately US$150 million. In July 1989, a cofinancing
appraisal was carried out by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. If needed
cofinancing of a further US$50 million (the foreign exchange component of
the Chilean Government's contribution) may be sought for the outer year
(1993) from Japan or another source.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONS RUCTION
AND DEVELQPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIaECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A SECOND ROAD SECTOR PROJECT
1.       The fcllowing memorandum and recommendation  on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Chile for USS224 million i, submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would have a term of 17 years, with five years of grace, and
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate. The Government of Chile is
seeking cofinancing from Japan in an amount equivalent to approximately
US$150 million  (17   of  project  cost).    In  July  1989,  a cofinancing
appraisal was  carried  out  by  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Japan.   The
finalization of the proposed cofinancing arrangement is expected by October
1989. The project would be further cofinanced by IDB loans for a total of
US$85 million (9Z of project cost) - of which three are already approved
(US$51 million to be disbursed under the program).
2.       Background.  Chile's extensive and  well built road network covers
some 79,000 km of  which  about  10,000  km  is  paved.   The basic network
consists of 6,000 km of national roads and 17,000 km of regional roads.
Traffic flow over the basic network continued to increase in most years of
the 1978-1988 period, annual growth rates ranging from 2.42 to 18.32
between 1977-88. The importance of maintaining this network is clear given
that two-thirds of all domestic freight is conveyed over roads.
3.       Chile's transport strategy became ^trongly deregulated and liberal
in the second half  of  the  1970s.    As  a  result  of the shift, several
important policy changes occurred includings (i) liberalization of access
to the road transport industry; (ii) elimination of transport sector
subsidies; (iii) charges to private air, 1and, and sea transport for the
use of public infrastructure facilities; (iv) permission to each transport
mode to set its own tariffs, design its services, and develop its own
policies; and (v) equal treatment of all transport modes for purposes of
taxation. However, better diffusion of transport data to improve the
functioning of the market system still needs to be promoted.
4.       During the 1970s, a large  share  of the resources of the Ministry
of Public Works (MOP) was absorbed building the Santiago Metro. This meant
that the rehabilitation and ma:.ntenance of the costly road network,
including the longitudinal road, wihich stretches from Region I in the North
to Region X  in  the  South  were  neglected.    As  a  result  most of the
longitudinal road and a large part of the rest of the network had to be
reconstructed with the help of the Inter-American Development Bank and the
World Bank. Protection of the roads through better enforcement of axle
load limits and proper mainten ice was a condition of Bank assistance, with
which the Government complied. Weigh-in-motion stations were installed and



- 2 -
mobile weighing  equipment  was  purchased.    Axle  load  limit violations
decreased from 5 to 0.5? of all trucks weighed and further improvements of
the system are part of this project (para 6).
5.       The Roads Directorate (Vialidad)  of  the Ministry of Public Works
streamlined its maintenance operation (personnel were reduced from more
than 17,000 to about 4,000), but in the process the Government shifted
responsibility for maintenance of the 56,000 km local network from Vialid4d
to the municipalities, which could not handle the task. As a consequencP,
maintenance  of  the   network   deteriorated   further.    The  Government
subsequently agreed with the Bank that the municipalities neither had the
budgetary nor the human and technical resources to maintain such a large
part of the network and MOP's Roads Directorate (Vialidad) agreed to retake
gradu6ily responsibility for the  whole  network.    To preclude seeing the
Governmt:nt staff grow disproportionately again as a result of this measure,
most maintenance operations were contracted to the private sector, with
Vialidad  concentrating   on   maintenance   planning,   organization,  and
supervision, plus execution of some routine maintenance and weather-
emergency operations. At present some 90Z of Vialidad's expenditures for
works involve the private sector.
6.       Several issues remain to be tackled to sustain the important gains
madet (i) Vialidad's maintenance and investment expenditures need to be
appropriately balanced; (ii further improvement is needed in -nforcement
of axle load limits, especially in forestry areas; and (iii) seasonal
traffic congestion needs to be eliminated, particularly congestiort that
hampers efficient production and marketing of export crops.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.    The proposed Second Road Sector
Project is an integral part of the Bank's macroeconomic and sectoral
assistance strategy for Chile, which concentrates on optimization of
expenditures in infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation, in line with
the Government's stated overall policy objective of increased efficiency in
the delivery of public services.    Five  loans and a credit for a total of
US$389 million were given to Chile in the past, and under the ongoing
Second Highway Reconstruction (Loan 2297-CH) and the First Road Sector
Project  (Loan  2589-CH)   Vialidad   has   made  substantial  progress  in
implementing an efficient program with limited resources. It still looks
to the Bank for further assistance to improve the efficiency and scope of
its road maintenance and rehabilitation program. as the national road
network is not optimally maintained and large amounts of potential benefits
remain uncaptured. The Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM
Model),  developed  by  the  Bank   and  adopted  by  Chile  after  further
refinements to take local conditions into account, has been a catalyst
around which Vialidad's modernization efforts have been built. Programs
such as contractor-executed maintenance and the rules and procedures of
contracting have been  itiproved.    Also,  road  pavement research has been
given special direction.   Under  this  project,  the Bank will continue to
help the Government consolidate the gains achieved and to press for
sufficient budgetary allocations to capture most of the potential benefits
for road users, including those on the local netwo;k.
8.       The main objective  of  the  proposed  project  is  to continue to
support the Government's careful financial management through increasingly



- 3 -
efficient execution of its road investment and maintenance program. A
second objective is the establishment of an effectively functioning road
maintenance  and  pavement  management  organization.    Specifically,  the
proposed project would help the Government tot (i) continue to strengthen
the capability of Vialidad through a more focused training program; (ii)
complete  the  effort  to   reach   normal  maintenance  levels  through  a
distribution of funds balanced between road investment and maintenance:
(iii) reestablish a functional local road maintenance system with imoroved
technical execution; (iv) further improve the Directorate's and ODELAN's
professional excellence in the economic evaluation of road construction and
maintenance activities; (v) resolve the major traffic congestion problems
through a select program of dual carriageways; (vi) rehabilitate the main
road bridges of the country; and (vii) assist the Government in external
resource mobilization for guaranteed project implementation.
9.       Project Description and Cost.    The  proposed project consists of
Vialidad's 1990-93 Road Investment and Maintenance Program, as follows: (i)
the  investments  (39Z  of   base   cost)   to  include  new  construction,
reconstruction and upgrading, mainly financed by IDB and the Government,
with the Bank co-financing the doubled roadways and bridges and related
consulting services and training; (ii) maintenance (56~), which includes
periodic and routine maintenance, a small amount for equipment renewal, and
consulting services and training, all to be cofinanced by the Bank; (iii)
administration (5Z) mainly financed by the Government. The project will be
carried out over a  four-year  period.    It  will be implemented mainly by
contractors and local consultants under the supervision of Vialidad. 'Only
US$70 million of routine maintenance is expected to be executed by force
account (less than  10?  of  the  project  cost).    The  total cost of the
project, including 20? for identifiable taxes and duties, is estimated at
US$907 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$509
million (56Z).   The  Bank  would  finance  28Z  of  the  project  cost.  A
breakdown of the costs and the financing plan is given in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule of the Bank loan are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Chile
are given in Scheiules C and D.   A map of the whole road network and Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7790-CH dated August 18, 1989 are attached.
10.      Agreed Actions.  Major  policy and project-related conditions have
been included under previous road sector projects or during preparation of
the proposed project and faithfully met by the Government of Chile.  During
negotiations, agreement was reached on the content and implementation cost
of the training program, as well as on the following actions: (i) execute a
Road  User  Charges  Actualization  Study  and  review  recommendations and
required implementation action with Bank; (ii) determine the procedures
involved in establishing a well functioning transport information system
for the purpose of publishing transport data on a regular basis; (iii)
evaluate the costs and benefits of Vialidad's training program for the
years 1986 through 1989 to measure the effects of said training program;
(iv) improve the evaluation methodology of dual carriageway roads; (v)
guarantee that the agreed balance between road maintenance and road
investment will not be disturbed; (vi) agree on the size and composition of
a 1989-97 Roads Program, to be modified only with Bank concurrence; (vii)
annually review in detail next year's program with the Bank and agree on



yearly expenditure levels; and (viii) use agreed bidding documents for
international compotitive bidding. The first four above-mentioned studies
would be executed by local consultants or Vialidad staff. The first study
would be completed no later than September 30, 1990, the second and third
studies would be completed no later than December 31, 1990, and the fourth,
no later than December 31, 1993.
11.      Benefit;.  Benefits include  reduction  in vehic_  operating costs
by increasing the transport efficiency of roads and emplcyment generation,
to which the Government attaches a high priority. Further benefits would
accrue to the economy through reducing future investment and rehabilitation
needs. The economic rate of return is at least 502.
12.      Risks.    There  are  few   inherent  risks  associated  with  the
implementation capacity of the Roads Directorate, since it proved to be an
exemplary institution in this regard under ongoing road projects; moreover,
counterpart funds already have been partially agreed as a part of the
Government's rolling three-year  plan.    There  is  little risk of adverse
environmental impact as the program is mainly for maintenance of existing
roads. Dual carriageways (156 km) will be built on already expropriated
right-of-way parallel to the existing two lane roads, hence, there will be
little  social  impact.    The   main  risk  would  arise  from  unforeseen
circumstances related to the change of Government after the presidential
election of December 1989; however, the annual review of the program would
permit necessary adjustments to reflect new circumstances.
13.      Recommendation.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
