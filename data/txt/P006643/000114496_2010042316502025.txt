Re:
Loan Number 3120-CH
(Second Road Sector Project)
Fourth Amendment
Dear Minister:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated September 28, 1989 in respect of the 
above-referenced Project, as amended to date. We are pleased to inform you that the 
Bank agrees to amend the procurement procedures for emergency works so as to allow 
such works to be contracted through shopping procedures up to an aggregate amount of 
$8,000,000.
The Bank, therefore, amends Paragraph 3 of Part C of Schedule 4 of the Loan 
Agreement by substituting the amount referred to in its third line from "$5,000,000" 
to $8,000,000".
Please indicate your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the form of confirmation on the enclosed original letter and returning the same to us.
