and long-term agricultural lending.\n            The credit aims to finance expenditures of:  (i)\n            agricultural export enterprises; and (ii) institutional\n            support to CRDB.  The project will foster greater capacity\n            utilization, improved productivity and efficiency of\n            agricultural exports, and improved agricultural term-lending\n            capacity of CRDB. However, the major benefit from the\n            project is expected to be an increase in Tanzania's\n            exports following the rehabilitation and expansion of viable\n            agricultural enterprises."}, "docdt": "1988-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
