                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised Project Development Objective is to: (1) increase enrollment of children in basic education, with particular attention to gender equity, in 10 governorates; (2)
                         improve quality of teaching in basic education nationally, and (3) establish foundations for improved MoE capacity to carry out its core functions, so as to contribute to
                         the National Basic Education Development Strategy (NBEDS) goals.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This report reflects the status of the Basic Education Development Project (BEDP), financed from the IDA credit 3988-YEM andtheMulti-DonorTrust Fund (TF053721).

                         As a result of the political unrest in the country during 2011, the Bank suspended disbursement from June 28, 2011 to January 29, 2012. With the exception of KfW, other donors took
                         similar measures. Some activities were significantly affected by the long lasting country unrest and subsequent suspension of disbursements. Furthermore, during the last fiscal year,

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                         Report No: ISR7863



                         two donors (the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN) and the United Kingdom Department of International Development (DFID) announced their decisions to reduce
                         their funding to the Project by a total of US$3.6 million equivalent. Similarly, the Government of Yemen expressed its interest in canceling an amount equivalent to SDR 6 million (US
                         $7.7million equivalent) from the IDA Credit. Despite such significant changes in funding, the reduction/cancellation of funding had no significant impact on Project Development
                         Objectives. This is explained by the fact that: (i) most activities were already implemented and most targets were achieved before disbursement was suspended; and (ii) favorable

                         fluctuations in exchange rates between the SDR and US dollar actually increased the amount of available funds, off-setting the reduction/cancellation of funding. However, changes in
                         funding, in addition to the need for extending the project closing date,triggered a restructuring. The project restructuring, which was approved on June 29, 2012, was for: (i) a
                         reallocation of funds across disbursement categories; (ii) the introduction of minor changes in the Results Framework; and (iii) the extension of the closing dates of the IDA Credit and
                         the Multi-Donor-Trust Fund until December 31, 2012 in order to complete remaining activities.

                         As part of three missions held during July - December 2012 that were mainly for the preparation of a follow-on project (Second Basic Education Development Project:BEDP2), team
                         conducted mini-supervision of BEDP at each occasion in view of accelerating the implementation and disbursement. After such constant review and close implementation support, it
                         was concluded that, in spite of the prolonged turmoil and suspension and changes in the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Project Administration Unit (PAU) top management, the
                         project continued to progress steadily. All remaining activities in the end-of-project implementation plan were carefully reviewed and adequately prioritized. As of December 19, 2012,
                         most key activities in the BEDP implementation plan were completed successfully and the MOE was also able to implement several new activities crucial to the sector, which include
                         supervision visits at central, governorate, and district levels and works to review and analyze existing curriculum frameworks.

                         Regarding the activities that were previously delayed, the Bank consistently advised the MOE and PAU to carefully monitor the progress and take actions to facilitate the
                         implementation. EMIS is the most notable case which experienced significant delays due to the inability of a local firm to complete exam data tools. As per the mission’s
                         recommendation during the July mission, an external review of the incomplete part of EMIS system was conducted from November–December 2012 to accurately diagnose the
                         problem and propose technical solutions. The review was successfully completed and the remaining tasks to complete EMIS were finalized accordingly. In order to have solid end-of-
                         project indicators, the latest Annual Education Survey (AES) data analysis was also accelerated. The MOE is now working on preparing the Borrower’s report for the Implementation
                         Completion Report ( ICR) due in June 2013, with inputs from all stakeholders and lessons learned to be reflected in the implementation of the follow on project.
