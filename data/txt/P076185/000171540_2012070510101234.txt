Excellency:
We refer to the Administration Arrangement between the Netherlands Minister
for Foreign Affairs (the "Donor") and the International Development Association ("IDA"
or "Bank"), regarding the Trust Fund for Basic Education Development Project in the
Republic of Yemen (the "Recipient") (TF053719) (the "Trust Fund") effective November

the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation of the Republic of Yemen dated
March 12, 2012, requesting the extension of Closing Date of the Basic Education
Development Project (Credit No. 3988 - YEM) till December 31, 2012, and to your
letter, dated March 27, 2012, informing the Bank of a reduction in the Contribution, and
subsequent discussions with the Bank.
We are pleased to inform you that IDA, after due consideration, has acceded to
the above request. Accordingly, the Administration Arrangement is hereby amended as
follows:
1.    The first paragraph of the Administration Arrangement is amended to read as
follows:
"We are pleased to acknowledge on behalf of the International Development
Association ("IDA") the intention of the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs
("the Donor") to make available as a grant the sum of twenty one million one
hundred sixty nine thousand eight hundred eighty United States Dollars
(US$21,169,880) (the "Contribution") for the Basic Education Development

The Bank will disclose this Agreement and related information on this Trust Fund
