Dear Ms. Orraick,
We refer to the Administration Arrangement between the Government of the

("IDA"), regarding the Trust Fund for Basic Education Development Project in the
Republic of Yemen (the "Recipient") (TF053719) (the "Trust Fund") effective January 5,
2005 (the "Administration Arrangement"), as amended. We also refer to the letter of the
Republic of Yemen dated March 12, 2012 requesting the extension of Closing Date of the
Basic Education Development Project (Credit No. 3988 - YEM) till December 31, 2012,
and to your letter, dated March 15, 2012, and subsequent correspondence, advising IDA
of a reduction in the Donor's Contribution from £15,000,000 to £13,860,000.
Accordingly, the Administration Arrangement is hereby amended as follows:
I.    The first paragraph of the Administration Arrangement is amended to read as
follows:
"We are pleased to acknowledge on behalf of the International Development
Association ("IDA") the intention of the Government of the United Kingdom of
Britain and Northern Ireland, through its Department for International
Development (the 'Donor') to make available as a grant the sum of thirteen
million eight hundred sixty pound sterling (£13,860,000) (the 'Contribution') for
the Basic Education development Project for the Republic of Yemen (the

and conditions specified in the Annexes to this Arrangement."
