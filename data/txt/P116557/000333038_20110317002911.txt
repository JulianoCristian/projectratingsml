                                          March 15, 2011



        Executive Directors approved a First Development Policy Loan in support of the Plan Maroc Vert
for the Kingdom of Morocco in the amount of Euro 150 million (US$ 205 million equivalent) on the
payment conditions set out in the President's Memorandum (R2011-0039).

        Executive Directors welcomed the operation, noting it would improve reforms in the agricultural
sector while advancing environmental and social sustainability and enhancing the efficiency in domestic
food markets. While agreeing that the DPL series is underpinned by significant analytical work, and
builds on lessons and experience learned from previous operations, Directors further suggested careful
monitoring of mitigation measures.
