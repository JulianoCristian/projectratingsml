F. Results Framework Analysis
Program Development Objectives (from Program Document): The overall PDO was the same for
both operations: to increase the agri-food sector’s productivity and diversification with the goal of
maintaining higher rates of agricultural growth and employment. More specifically, the objectives of
the series were to: (i) improve the efficiency of domestic markets; (ii) improve the socio-economic
impacts of investments directed to small farmers; (iii) improve agricultural services; and (iv) improve
the use and management of irrigation water and the planning of irrigation infrastructure.

Objective A: Improved efficiency of domestic markets
A.1. Improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing fruit and vegetable wholesale
markets

under new management model
launched
There has been considerable progress in developing, promoting and putting in place the new
management model based on the guidelines supported as DPO actions. Implementation has started at
Berkane. Discussions are underway for two further sites at Rabat and Meknes, and Government has
requested Bank financing for further investment in the model.
A.2. Improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing slaughterhouses

management model
A concession agreement has been signed with a private firm for management of the new Al-Hoceima
abattoir, consistent with the guidelines issued as actions under the DPO. The sector development plan
2014-2020 (contrat plan) provides for continued modernization of the sector through both upgrading
and concession to the private sector of communal abattoirs.

The targeted result has been partially achieved; building upon the DPO supported actions, the new
private abattoirs at Meknes and Beni Mellal are operational, and Taroudant is under construction and
will be operational in 2015. In addition, there has been substantial progress towards the full target of
seven private slaughterhouses launched, with plans agreed for El-Jadida and three further abattoirs
(Oujda, Marrakech and Rabat) under study with private sector promoters.

Objective B: Improved socio-economic impact of investments directed at small farmers
B.1. Improve the governance and public financial management of projects directed to small farmers

4. Share of new Pillar II projects
submitted by Professional            15%               24%             40%                84%
Agricultural Organizations

Implementation of the investment program for Pillar II projects started in 2008 and has rapidly gathered
pace. Projects are in line with the PARs and with the implementation manual issued as a DPO action.
Procurement, implementation and disbursement are efficient. Organization of farmers and the
promotion of ‘labels and origins’ are a key feature.
The proposal to set up local committees and to include farmer representatives has been implemented
by the establishment of committees at provincial level including representatives of the Chambers of
Agriculture and of farmer organizations.




                                                   7

support

The indicator measures the extent to which small farmers have obtained access to investment finance
under Pillar II of the PMV. There is excellent achievement of the expected result, as measured by the
increased share of small farmers benefitting from Pillar II support: 76% of all small farmers, against a
target of 15%.

Objective C: Improved agricultural services
C.1. Improve the effectiveness of the agricultural innovation system

6. Share of research and
extension projects funded

through    the    competitive
financing mechanism

The competitive research mechanism was applied to the applied research funded by the Direction de
l’Enseignement, de la Recherche et de la Formation. This worked well and the institutional basis is
now being established for all public agricultural research financing to be awarded competitively,
managed by a national steering committee. A framework for research partnerships is being established
and MAPM is setting up a Fonds national de recherche.

7. Number of extension
advisory services contracted to       0                                 60                 51
the private sector

The national agricultural advisory services strategy and an action plan have been adopted by the MAPM
and the Law and the related decree for the accreditation of agricultural advisors have been issued. In
2014, 51 contract (85 percent of the target) have been signed with firms to provide technical support
for the implementation of Pillar II projects.
8. Number of training days per
category of actor (Target: 880       180                 239            880               1,075
days)

The amount of training provided exceeded expected results by 20 percent – and the share of women in
training was 20 percent, double the target of 10 percent.

C.2. Establish an effective food safety control system
9. Number of HACCP-certified
agri-food        processing          300                 450            700                     741

The target has been met, with 390 fisheries establishments and 320 dairy and meat establishments
certified. In addition, a number of fruit and vegetable facilities have been certified.

10. Share of Moroccan agri-

Private sector response to the DPO supported guidelines has been strong with a clear progression
towards risk-based quality and food safety management. Actual achievement was close to target and
represents an important achievement for expanding trade.

collective reconversion to drip
irrigation

PMV support has been an effective incentive for farmers to establish a basis for groundwater
management. PMV has also been effective in convincing farmers to convert to drip irrigation. Focus
now is on crop selection and marketing to reduce overall water requirements.

D.2. Improve the performance of irrigation service operators

13. Number        of   ORDARs
                                       0                -              16                  0

Government continues to review and revise its approach to deconcentration and financial sustainability
of agricultural services. Establishment of the ORDARs is conditioned on progress with this broader
agenda which remains under discussion and review. At the same time, other institutional options –
such as PPPs are being utilized to improve irrigation services.

D.3. Improve irrigation infrastructure planning by the Government
14. Percentage of fully
budgeted irrigation schemes
                                      18%             94%             100%              100%

1. Program context, development objectives and design
1.1 Context at appraisal
Country, macro and sector background
   1. In 2010, at the time of appraisal of the first operation in the proposed two DPL series, Morocco
      was relatively well-placed to withstand the impact of the global downturn which had started in
      2009. There was a background of sound macro management: the budget deficit stood at 2.2%
      of GDP, public debt was declining and manageable, inflation was low and stable, and Morocco
      was increasingly integrating into the global economy. The country had developed strategies
      for sectors with high growth potential which promoted private investment and foreign direct
      investment (FDI). The investment rate stood at 36% of GDP in 2009. The growth strategy had
      resulted in diversification, reduced volatility and declining unemployment (although this was
      still 9.1% in 2009).

   2. Representing 15% of GDP, 23% of exports, and almost half of employment, the agri-food
      sector had been identified as a key growth area, Morocco enjoys comparative advantage in
      many products (citrus, tomatoes, strawberries, grapes, melons, peppers), particularly for export
      of fresh produce to the nearby European markets. However, growth potential was constrained
      by the dualistic nature of farming in Morocco, with most holdings small, semi-subsistence
      farms with low productivity, poor quality produce and limited market integration. These farms
      are largely rainfed and vulnerable to recurrent droughts. They often have aging household heads
      with a low education level (more than 45 percent of the heads of farming families are over 55
      years old, and 81 percent are illiterate), make limited use of modern technologies, and lack
      technical know-how. In order to meet their food consumption and animal feed needs and
      partially in response to the incentives provided by Government subsidy schemes and market
      protection, smallholders typically engage in the production of low-value agricultural
      commodities such as wheat and barley. This large group of smallholder farmers co-exists with
      a small but very efficient group of commercial farmers producing crops (such as citrus,
      tomatoes, strawberries, grapes, melons, and peppers) for high-value export markets and milk
      for domestic markets. This sub-sector of mainly irrigated production accounts for 7 percent of
      GDP, 50 percent of Morocco’s agricultural value added, generates over 75 percent of
      Morocco’s agricultural exports, and provides jobs to 50 percent of the rural labor force.

   3. Rural poverty decreased from 25 percent in 2001 to 14 percent in 2007 largely due to the
      combined effect of increases in the value of agricultural production, diversification of the rural
      economy, and increases in remittances, the contribution to overall inequality of the gap between
      rural and urban living standards in Morocco is the highest of any Middle East and North Africa
      (MENA) country. In fact, poverty rates in rural areas are almost 3 times as high as in urban
      areas and 70 percent of poverty in Morocco remains rural. With a Gini coefficient of 0.6, land
      remains inequitably distributed: a majority of low-productivity smallholders owns only 26
      percent of cultivated land, while a minority of less than one percent of mostly commercial and
      export-oriented farms owns about 14 percent.

   4. Despite some successes in selected commodities, the agri-food sector’s growth potential was
      thus constrained by the dualistic nature of farming in Morocco. This duality was partly a result
      of policies that limited the opportunities of traditional agriculture and smaller farmers. First, an
      antiquated legislative system of commercialization of certain agricultural products designed to
      raise municipal revenues raised the cost and lowered the quality of fruits, vegetables and meat.
      The results have been lower producer and higher consumer prices and reduced incentives for
      quality and value-addition. Second, the effectiveness of the traditional support (extension,
      credit, technology), particularly for small farmers, was eroded due to the absence of an
      integrated approach that took account of the links between production and marketing,
      availability of adequate technical support and attention to quality of the products. Third, the


                                                   11
       participation of the farmers and communities in the design and implementation of support
       policies was limited, with a centralized approach dominating.

   5. To tap the considerable further potential of the agri-food sector and to meet the challenge of
      integrating smallholder farming into a growth-oriented strategy, Morocco developed the Plan
      Maroc Vert (PMV) for the period 2008-2020, designed to transform the sector into a stable
      source of growth, competitiveness and broad-based economic development through a
      combination of agricultural investments and systemic public sector reforms. The PMV
      embodied a paradigm shift from a highly protected sector towards a market-oriented
      agriculture, towards integrated value addition all along the agri-food chain, and towards
      integration of smallholders into the commercial agricultural economy. Institutionally, the PMV
      represented a refocusing of public support on delivery of public goods and services, and
      development of public/private partnerships (PPP) to support the sector.

   6. The PMV targeted combined public (one third) and private (two thirds) investment of MAD
      140 billion 2009-2020 in around 1,500 agricultural projects targeted to small and medium
      farmers in modern irrigation schemes (Pillar I) and low resource farmers in mainly rainfed
      areas (Pillar II).

   7. Water is key to the productivity and sustainability of Moroccan agriculture. The agricultural
      sector consumes 87 percent of water resources in Morocco and faces increasing competition
      from urban and industrial consumers. Climate change is likely to exacerbate water scarcity in
      the long run, with increasing aridity and uncertainty and a growing threat of groundwater
      depletion. Current suboptimal irrigation practices and deficient water service contribute to low
      irrigation water productivity. Average value-added of irrigation water is 1.63 MAD/m3, which
      is well below its potential of 4 MAD/m3. To address these issues, GoM adopted a national
      program for irrigation water conservation (PNEEI) in 2008 to reduce current and future water
      deficits while increasing the productivity of irrigated agriculture by improving water
      management at both farmer and service provider level. In addition, the quality and
      sustainability of irrigation services provided by the Public Agricultural Development Agencies
      (ORMVAs) was constrained by poor maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure, under-pricing
      of water, inadequate allocation of water revenues, and rigid mechanisms for allocating water to
      farmers. Furthermore, coordination of investment planning and financing between government
      institutions involved in the irrigation and the water sectors was weak, resulting in a persistent
      gap between water mobilization capacity through dam storage and area irrigated downstream.
Rationale for Bank assistance
   8. The underlying justification for the Bank to support a DPO focused on policy and institutional
      reforms was that this was the most effective way to formalize the PMV and PNEEI program of
      reforms, build broader government and popular buy-in, and accelerate reform implementation.
      The reforms would then provide the basis for increased investment and productivity, especially
      for resource poor farmers.

   9. The DPO built on recent World Bank operations in the agricultural and agriculture-related
      sectors, particularly several community-based agricultural projects, including the Irrigation-
      based Community Development Project (DRI-PMH) and the Rainfed Agricultural
      Development Project (DRI-MVB). The operation also built on the Bank’s support to
      Morocco’s broad national community-driven development (CDD) program, the Initiative
      Nationale de Developpement Humain (INDH). Particular lessons from these projects included:
      (i) the need for a coherent, bottom-up approach to integrated rural development; (ii) the
      imperative of market development and integration as a motor for agricultural development; and
      (iii) the importance of support structures for producers and producer organizations. In addition,
      for over two decades the Bank had been supporting infrastructure modernization and
      institutional reform in the irrigation sector, and the Oum-Er-Rbia Basin Irrigated Agriculture
      Modernization Project had recently been approved. Hence, the irrigation efficiency objective


                                                 12
          of the PMV DPL, which essentially continued the successful irrigation objective of the 2007
          Water Sector DPL 1, was a natural fit for Bank support.
Contribution of the operation to higher level objectives in the CPS and the country’s overall strategies
and programs
     10. Support to the PMV contributed to the three priorities agreed between Government and the
         Bank for the CPS 2010-2013: (i) growth, competiveness and employment (ii) service delivery
         to citizens and (iii) sustainable development in a changing climate. Specifically, support to
         Government’s institutional reforms in domestic markets, agricultural investment and services,
         and irrigation would achieve the higher level objectives of enhancing growth and employment,
         reducing social disparities, and ensuring sustainability.
Government program supported by the operation
11.     In February 2009, Government requested Bank support to implementation of the public sector
reforms that constituted the heart of the PMV. These reforms were:

     1. Public sector institutional reforms to focus government efforts on essentially public services
        and to make them efficient. These reforms were to reorient MAPM towards regulatory
        functions, to deconcentrate public service functions to the regions, and to delegate selected
        functions to private actors, specialized agencies and professional associations.2
     2. Improved business and financing environment for the agri-food sector. These reforms were to
        improve access to investment financing as well as realigned and improved targeting of
        agricultural subsidy schemes. 3
     3. Free trade and integration into global markets. This component started with negotiation of an
        agricultural free trade agreement with the European Union.
     4. Domestic market liberalization. This provided for increased investment and improved
        management of marketing infrastructure, and liberalization of distribution systems for fruit,
        vegetables and meat, including the introduction of new ownership and management models on
        a PPP basis, a move from fixed taxes to fees-for-services, and the removal of movement
        restrictions on red meat across the country. Investment was to be promoted through PPP
        arrangements.
     5. Efficient irrigation. This component continued the long-standing reform program for
        Morocco’s efficient irrigation sector by providing for delegation of management of large scale
        irrigation (LSI) systems to private operators, increasing water tariffs on large irrigation
        perimeters, extending existing irrigation perimeters, promoting on-farm drip irrigation, and
        ensuring inter-agency coordination of investment programs.
1.2 Original Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)
     12. The series of DPLs was to comprise two single tranche operations designed to support key
         cross-cutting policy and institutional reforms in the PMV (see 1.1 above). The DPLs were to
         be implemented by the Ministry of Finance (MEF) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MAPM).
         A first DPL for Euros 150 million (USD 205 millions), was approved on March 15, 2011,
         became effective on August 24, 2011, and closed on March 15, 2012. A second DPL, also for


1 The Water Sector DPL was originally intended as a four year series of operations. Despite the good results on the irrigation

objective, the series was halted after the first DPL because triggers on sector governance and integrated water resources
management were not achieved by April 2009, 24 months after Loan effectiveness.
2 Deconcentration had commenced in 2009 with the establishment of 16 regional departments of agriculture (Directions

Régionales de l’Agriculture, DRAs); with the restructuring of the existing professional agricultural chambers (chambres
d’agriculture) into 16 regional-level chambers ; with the consultative preparation of 16 regional agricultural plans (Plans
Agricoles Régionaux, PAR); and the signature of results-oriented contracts (contrats programme) on the basis of the PARs
with professional associations for eighteen priority agri-food chains (filières). Delegation was to be to private actors (through
PPP); to specialized agencies (e.g. for agricultural development and for food safety); and to professional organizations.
Delegation had started with the establishment of the Agence pour le Développement Agricole (ADA) in February 2009, and
the setting up of the Office Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits Alimentaires (ONSSA) in March 2009.
3 Implementation began with the signature between MEF and MAPM of an MTEF 2009-2014 providing full financing for the

PMV; and with a restructuring of the Fonds de Développement Agricole (FDA) to support the PMV.

                                                              13
          Euros 150 million (USD 203.2 millions), was approved on March 27, 2013, became effective
          on May 10, 2013, and closed on March 15, 2014.

     13. The overall PDO was the same for both operations: to increase the agri-food sector’s
         productivity and diversification with the goal of maintaining higher rates of agricultural growth
         and employment. More specifically, the objectives of the series were to: (A) improve the
         efficiency of domestic markets; (B) improve the socio-economic impacts of investments
         directed to small farmers; (C) improve agricultural services; and (D) improve the use and
         management of irrigation water and the planning of irrigation infrastructure. These objectives
         were consistent with the diagnostic of what was required to remove constraints and promote
         growth and equity in the sector, and with Government’s reform program, the PMV (see 1.1
         above). The specific objectives were mutually reinforcing, aimed at the overall goals of
         catalyzing the move towards a market-oriented agriculture, towards integrated value addition
         all along the agri-food chain, and towards integration of smallholders into the commercial
         agricultural economy. Because these overall goals represented a structural transformation of
         Morocco’s agriculture sector, they can only be measured in the longer term, beyond the two
         year life span of the DPO. The results framework – and the assessment in this ICRR - therefore
         focus on the results of the four component objectives which were the specific policy areas
         addressed by the operation.

     14. The objectives, outcomes, results and indicators for DPL 1 and DPL 2 are presented in Table 1
         below. Although the objectives of DPL 2 remained unchanged, several of the prior actions
         were changed in order to improve relevance and to adapt to changing external circumstance
         (see 2.1 below). Consequently three of the 14 indicators originally agreed were also changed
         (Indicators # 7, 8 and 13). 4

  Eleven indicators were essentially unchanged for DPL 2, apart from minor improvements in formulation. Indicator # 7 was
changed to take account of delays in issuing the relevant decree to set up accreditation of private agricultural advisers. Indicator
# 8 was improved in DPL 2 by the addition of a gender-specific target. Indicator # 13, tracking increase in farmer contribution
to O&M costs, was dropped in favour of the tracking of a far-reaching reform of agricultural institutions, which was also
intended, amongst other things, to have a favourable impact on cost recovery (see Section 2.2. Indicator #10 was reformulated
in DPL 2 and its target reduced to 0.08. Targets for Indicator # 1 were reduced in DPL 2, the target for Indicator # 6 was
doubled.

1.3 Original policy areas supported by the program
   15. The chosen policy areas corresponded to the four program objectives, all of which formed an
       integral part of the public sector reforms accompanying the PMV (see 1.1 above): public sector
       institutional reforms, improved business and financing environment for the agri-food sector;
       integration into global markets; domestic market liberalization; and efficient irrigation.
1.4 Revised policy areas
   16. No changes were made to the policy areas during the course of the two operations.
2. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes
2.1 Program Performance
   17. The initial program matrix for the series of two DPLs (see Annex 2) comprised 22 agreed prior
       actions or triggers, ten for the first operation and 12 for the second. In addition, the maintenance
       of a satisfactory macro framework was required.

   18. The verified achievement of the ten agreed prior actions in 2010 allowed the first operation to
       become effective promptly after Board approval on March 15th, 2011. The programmatic nature
       of the series required that the second operation follow within 24 months. Government and the
       Bank engaged in intensive follow up and further policy analysis, and the second operation was
       approved on March 27th, 2013. Country developments discussed in Section 2.2 below led to
       three changes in the agreed prior actions for the second operation. These changes were:

   •   The substitution of an agreement on the management model at Berkane for the previously
       proposed action on three wholesale market pilot projects (PA 11). The concept remained the
       same but essentially the target was reduced from three to one.
   •   The addition of the executive decision on market liberalization for red meat (PA 13) to the
       proposed action on concession to the private sector of modernized municipal slaughterhouses
       (PA 12).
   •   The substitution of the transmission of the draft laws creating the ORDARs for the previously
       proposed action raising irrigation tariffs (PA 21).
2.2 Major factors affecting implementation
   19. Several factors affected implementation significantly: (i) the overall strong commitment of
       Government to carrying through the reforms lent impetus to implementation; (ii) more time
       than anticipated was required to reach detailed consensus on implementation of several reforms;
       and (iii) the changing political economy of reform led to a need to revise the approach to
       increasing the autonomy of irrigation services.
The overall strong commitment of Government to carrying through the reforms.

   20. The two operations supported the ongoing PMV program which matched key policy and
       institutional reforms with a major public/private investment program designed to modernize
       Moroccan agriculture and to integrate smallholder producers into the commercial agricultural
       economy. The commitment of MAPM to this program was very strong and, throughout,
       MAPM acted as the motor for implementation of the reforms. This major driver of success was
       complemented by the commitment of MEF which was motivated by the national economic
       requirement to draw down the DPL funding. This translated into a commitment under a
       ‘Medium Term Expenditure Framework’ (MTEF) to greatly increase the funding of agriculture,
       in particular for the investments accompanying the PMV. The importance of the operation for
       the nation as a whole also drove a high level of cooperation with other ministries, particularly
       the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Commerce. In fact, one of the key impacts of
       the DPO was to strengthen the engagement of these two ministries in the PMV reforms, to
       which they had previously been lukewarm. The support of His Majesty the King, the
       engagement of the government as a whole and the strong commitment of the two implementing



                                                   16
       agencies (MAPM and MEF) were important positive factors in the efficient design and
       implementation of the reform program.
Need to reach more detailed consensus on implementation of several reforms

   21. Although all the prior actions were duly taken, in three areas implementation was delayed by
       the need to reach more detailed consensus on issues before operationalization of the reforms.

   22. Improvement of the efficiency of domestic markets (Objective A) was slowed by the need for
       detailed agreement on implementation amongst four ministries – MEF, MAPM, Ministry of
       Commerce, Ministry of Interior – as well as with the relevant local authorities and with private
       investors. These delays were at the root of the decision to scale back the agreed targets on fresh
       fruit and vegetable markets from three to one (see Table 1). At the same time an important new
       reform was added to the Prior Actions - nationwide liberalization of the meat market (Annex 2,
       PA 13). This was a reform on which it had been difficult to build consensus within
       Government, and its inclusion in DPL 2 represented an important contribution to reaching
       Objective A, to improve the efficiency of domestic markets.

   23. The improvement of the socio-economic impact of PMV projects directed to small farmers
       (Objective B) required that the incentive framework be strengthened by generalization of the
       contract farming model. The law providing for a supportive framework for contract farming
       was duly passed in 2012 (Annex 2, PA 15), but its implementation was delayed by the need for
       extensive consultation with industry professionals and farmer organizations, and by the need to
       then obtain the approval of the MEF on the relevant executive orders (arretés). The executive
       orders were issued in late 2014 and the framework is now operational. In the meantime, the
       delay did not hold up the rapid roll-out of PMV projects to small farmers (see paragraphs 42-
       46 below).

   24. Improvement of the effectiveness of the agricultural innovation system (C.1) requires
       operationalization of the decisions already taken. In order to ensure good design and
       implementation of Pillar II projects, it was envisaged that private agricultural advisers would
       be licensed and would play an increasing role. However, delays in preparing and approving
       the necessary decrees to apply the law which was a prior action for DPL 1 (Annex 2, PA 6)
       have hindered the development and use of private advisory services. At the same, time, the
       new national agricultural advisory service agency (ONCA) foreseen under the National
       Agricultural Advisory Services Strategy that was a prior action for DPL 2 (PA 17) is only being
       operationalized at the time of the ICR preparation.
Revision of the approach to making irrigation services managerially and financially autonomous
   25. The objective of improving the performance of irrigation services was originally to be
       supported under DPL 2 by implementation of an adjustment plan for irrigation water tariffs
       which would have allowed irrigation services to become self-financing and so opened up
       potential for private management arrangements and private investment in large scale irrigation.
       With this objective, Government had issued a regulation in 2009 announcing six successive
       biennial tariff increases. However, implementation of the second round of increases sparked
       public protests at a sensitive time (Arab Spring). In consequence, Government postponed
       further increases and studied options. This led to the negotiation of an alternative approach to
       achieving the objective, designed to create financially and administratively autonomous
       irrigation agencies. The history and outcome of this redesign are discussed below (Section 3.2).




                                                  17
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation design, implementation and utilization
   26. The agreed program outcome indicators and targets (Table 1) formed the basis for monitoring
       by MAPM’s Studies and Statistics Directorate (DSS). As discussed above (Section 1.2), the
       results framework was set at the level of the four component objectives of the PDO and
       designed to measure the results of the specific policy areas addressed by the operation. This
       approach reflected the fact that the overall goal – to increase the agri-food sector’s productivity
       and diversification in order to maintain higher rates of agricultural growth and employment -
       could only be measured in the longer term, beyond the two year life span of the DPO. With
       this approach, the indicators and targets were generally well chosen to measure results at the
       level of the four component objectives, except that formulation of some indicators could have
       been improved. For Indicator #3, it was not completely clear what was meant by ‘launched’
       (see para 38); and for Indicator #6, it was not clear that the indicator referred only to
       discretionary public funding for applied research (see para 48). For one indicator there turned
       out to be a disconnect between the indicator and the policy action: Indicator # 5 - and the result
       of an increased share of small farmers in Pillar II projects - were more than satisfied even though
       the framework for contract farming was not yet in place (see para 46). These flaws did not,
       however, impair the achievement or the measurement of the intended results. DSS provided
       updates on progress towards targets and collated qualitative information from all participating
       departments. At completion, DSS prepared a comprehensive completion report (see Section 7
       and Annex 4) and communicated to the Bank final data on achievement of targets as at the
       agreed closing date (March 31st, 2014).
2.4 Expected follow up operations
   27. Government and Bank have agreed that the two-DPL series has been sufficient to advance and
       lock in the PMV strategic agenda in the four chosen policy areas (see 1.1 and 1.3 above).
       Follow-up comprises continued intensive sector dialogue and, in the context of the new Bank-
       Morocco Country Partnership Strategy (2014-2017), support to operationalization of many of
       the reforms. The new partnership includes support to: (1) creation of agro-industrial areas and
       trade and commercialization platforms (linked to Objective A of the DPL Series); (2) PMV
       Pillar II implementation to develop sustainable approaches to improve the livelihoods of small
       famers (linked to Objective B of the DPL series); (3) delivery of research, advisory and training
       services to farmers (linked to Objective C of the DPL series); and (4) implementation of
       institutional reforms to restructure the Department of Agriculture’s decentralized services at
       the regional level into ORDARs and establish regional irrigation utilities to improve service
       delivery to farmer, in addition to further support to the development of drip irrigation (linked
       to Objective D of the DPL series).
3. Assessment of outcomes
3.1 Relevance of objectives, design and implementation (to current country and global priorities
and Bank assistance strategy)
   28. As discussed above (Section 1.1), the DPL series was consistent with a top priority for Morocco
       - support to the modernization of the agriculture sector in order both to increase employment,
       incomes and exports, and to integrate smallholder farming into the commercial agri-food
       economy.

   29. Each of the four objectives supported by the DPL series has retained or increased its relevance
       for the country. The objective to improve domestic marketing efficiency remains important to
       increase producer incomes and value added, to moderate consumer prices, and to position
       domestic producers to compete with imports as the trade liberalization agreements with the EU
       come into effect. The triple objectives of the program to improve the socio-economic impact
       of investment directed at small farmers – to tap the commercial growth potential of smallholder
       farming, to improve incomes and reduce poverty in rural areas, and to strengthen the
       participatory approach – remain high priorities for Morocco. Improvement of agricultural
       services is high on the reform agenda as innovation will be key to retaining competitiveness,
       and support for farmers and producer organizations is a critical catalyst for the ongoing

                                                   18
        transformation of smallholder agriculture. Increased irrigation efficiency has taken on
        increased relevance in view of the apparently growing climatic variability, as demonstrated by
        the recent Bank report assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources in the Oum
        Er Rbia River basin.

   30. The reforms supported under the DPLs remain consistent with the priorities agreed between
       Government and the Bank (see 1.1 above). In the post-Arab spring context, elements of the
       program - strengthening governance, accountability, social and economic inclusion, and
       increased voice and participation - have taken on an increased relevance, both for Government
       and – in the context of the MENA Region’s strategy of ‘doing things differently’ – for the Bank.
       Overall, therefore, the objectives, design and implementation of the DPO remain highly
       relevant to current country and Bank priorities.
3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
   31. Annex 2 presents a synoptic view of the Program objectives, actions, outcomes, indicators and
       results. The tables and discussion below provide a detailed assessment of the expected outcome
       and results of each objective of the DPL series, the actual results as measured by the indicators
       and targets, and an evaluation of progress made towards the agreed objectives. The discussion
       links results to the prior actions set out in Annex 2 (PA 1 etc.).
Objective A: Improved efficiency of domestic markets

   32. Policy analysis conducted prior to appraisal of the DPL series had demonstrated that Morocco’s
       internal agricultural marketing system was highly inefficient. The 38 publicly owned and
       operated municipal fruit and vegetable markets were plagued by decaying infrastructure,
       inadequate management, limited services and poor sanitary conditions. These dysfunctions
       were resulting in high marketing costs, low producer incomes, high consumer prices and weak
       incentives for quality. It was anticipated that, with the advent of trade liberalization, local
       producers would be at a disadvantage in the domestic market. Domestic red meat marketing
       and distribution faced similar challenges. The Objective A: Improved efficiency of domestic
       markets was therefore to improve the efficiency of domestic markets by reducing marketing
       costs and improving marketing services through institutional reforms and modernization of fruit
       and vegetable markets and slaughterhouses, including through contracting with the private
       sector for the construction, upgrading and operation of these facilities. Two contributory
       objectives were specified: A1 to improve the institutional and regulatory framework governing
       fruit and vegetable wholesale markets; and A.2 to improve the institutional and regulatory
       framework governing slaughterhouses.

                                                                                              investment in the
                                                                                              model.


      33. Prior to the DPO, there had been divergent positions of central and local government
          institutions regarding reform of local fresh produce markets, with particularly strong opposition
          from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Local Government, from municipalities,
          and from local vested interests. The DPO helped all parties to reconcile their positions,
          agreement was reached and the reforms were codified in 2010 (PA 1). A national strategy and
          action plan for the restructuring of the fruit and vegetable wholesale markets was adopted,
          providing for the introduction of a new ownership and management model and with all parties
          committed to, and planning for, implementation.

      34. There has been considerable progress in developing, promoting and putting in place the new
          management model. Agreement to implement the model at Berkane was a prior action under
          DPL 2 (PA 11), and inception of the operation was the agreed indicator. The operation has
          been launched through the establishment of an inter-ministerial committee at the local level,
          the promulgation of the text for the local development firm that will develop and operate the
          Berkane facility, and the budgeting of the funds for the local development company to carry
          out all necessary studies. The investment budget (243 million MD) has been allocated. It is
          anticipated that construction will begin in 2015 and will take 16-24 months.

      35. Progress is being keenly monitored. Once the Berkane pilot is underway, the model can be
          progressively generalized. Discussions are already underway for implementation of the model
          at Meknes and Rabat, and Government has requested follow-up support from the Bank under
          the CPS 2014-2017 to develop this type of investment.

      36. For the red meat agri-food chain, reform proposals provided for new ownership and
          management models for slaughterhouses. The legal and enabling framework was introduced
          under DPLs 1 and 2 (PA 2, PA 12 and PA 13), and indicators were set for inception of
          concessions on municipal slaughterhouses (# 2) and for investment in private slaughterhouses
          (# 3).

      37. Regarding Indicator # 2, a concession agreement has been signed with a private firm for
          management of the new Al-Hoceima abattoir. 5 The sector development plan 2014-2020
          (contrat plan) provides for continued modernization of the sector through both upgrading and
          construction of new abattoirs, with management delegated to private operators through
          concessions.


5
  Again, initially under DPL 1 the target was three abattoirs but delays in implementation led to reduction to a
target of one under DPL 2 (see Table 1 and Section 2.1).

                                                        20
   38. The targeted result for Indicator # 3 has been partially achieved. Building upon the DPO
       supported actions, the new private abattoirs at Meknes and Beni Mellal are operational, and
       Taroudant is under construction and will be operational in 2015. In addition, there has been
       substantial progress towards the full target of seven private slaughterhouses launched, with
       plans agreed for El-Jadida, and three further abattoirs (Oujda, Marrakech and Rabat) under
       study with private sector promoters. A decision taken in September 2014 to apply this reform
       also to the Casablanca abattoir provides further evidence of practical agreement and
       commitment to implementing this key reform.

   39. The DPO supported a major reform, essentially the opening of the abattoir sector to private
       capital and management. There have been delays but all partners are committed to pursue
       implementation as evidenced by the satisfaction of the indicator targets and by the
       commitments in the sector development plan (2014-2020).

   40. In DPL 2, a further Prior Action was added in pursuit of the objective - nationwide liberalization
       of the meat market (Annex 2, PA 13). This was a reform on which it had been difficult to build
       consensus within Government, and its inclusion in DPL 2 represented an important contribution
       to reaching Objective A, to improve the efficiency of domestic markets.

Objective B: Improved socio-economic impact of investments directed at small farmers
   41. Analysis of the PMV Pillar II investment program (see 1.1 above) conducted during preparation
       of the DPLs had shown that this ambitious and well-justified program ran certain specific risks,
       particularly: (i) the need for a more participatory, bottom-up approach, notably by giving local
       stakeholders a greater say in the decision-making process; and (ii) the need to ensure vertical
       integration for smallholders through a contract farming model. Overall, Objective B:
       Improved socio-economic impact of investments directed at small farmers aimed to
       improve participation and to expand us of the contract farming model. Two contributory
       objectives were specified: B.1 was designed to improve the governance and public financial
       management of projects directed to small farmers; B.2 introduced measures to establish a legal
       and institutional framework supporting contract farming.

   42. Implementation of the investment program for Pillar II projects started following the
       establishment of the new agricultural development agency (ADA) in 2008. On the basis of
       joint identification of needed improvements during DPL preparation, B.1 supported
       strengthened procedures that would facilitate financing of projects directed to small farmers
       (PA 3) and set up 54 pre-selection technical committees at the provincial level in order to give
       greater access to local stakeholders in developing and approving the program (PA 14).
       Transparency and improved financial management have been strengthened through the
       application of manuals and rules for prioritizing budget allocations and for proposing,

                                                    21
        submitting and implementing Pillar II projects. Transparency and accountability have been
        further strengthened by Internet-based M&E tracking of Pillar II projects.

    43. Implementation of Pillar II projects is proceeding apace with a strengthened emphasis on
        transparency and adaptation to local socio-economic needs and conditions. Project leaders have
        been appointed for each region. Two new project preparation guides have been prepared. A
        model agreement with professional organizations that sponsor Pillar II projects has been agreed.
        Procurement, implementation and disbursement are proceeding, with projects in line with the
        agreed regional investment plans (PARs). Access of smallholders has improved: organization
        of farmers into associations (OPA) is generalized throughout the program, and the share of new
        Pillar II projects which have been submitted by OPAs has reached 84%, well above the target
        of 40% (Indicator # 4). At December 31st, 2014, 492 agreements had been signed with OPAs
        as Pillar II project sponsors, and a further 70 agreements were under signature. OPA
        participation in the technical committees (PA 14) is, however, limited to defense of specific
        projects being presented by the OPAs. As this is a new approach, further efforts are needed in
        order to have genuine participation in the development and appraisal of the investment program.

    44. The reforms under B.1 are accompanied by two recent Bank operations: the Bank-executed
        Special Climate Change/GEF grant for integrating climate change in the implementation of the
        PMV (PICCPMV) is supporting the integration of climate change adaptation measures into
        selected Pillar II projects in five target regions; and the Social and Integrated Agriculture
        Project (ASIMA) supports land and biodiversity conservation in Pillar II projects in marginal
        areas.

    45. In order to improve the incomes of farmers in rainfed and other marginal areas or those with
        very small plots, Pillar II of PMV provides support to introduce new products such as olive
        trees and Barbary cactus to complement traditional grain and livestock production, and assists
        these farmers to market their production with an emphasis on contract farming as a means to
        link farmers to wholesalers and processors. Overall, mechanisms introduced to attract small
        farmers to Pillar II have been effective with small farmer access to Pillar II support having
        increased dramatically (Indicator # 5). By completion date, 76 percent of all small farmers
        were benefitting from Pillar II support. At December 31st, 2014, 492 Pillar II projects were
        underway for an investment of MAD 13.3 billion (USD 1.6 billion), covering 748,000 hectares
        and benefitting 722,000 smallholders. A further 50 Pillar II projects are programmed for 2015,
        for MAD 1.36 billion (USD 165 million), covering 37,000 hectares and benefitting 50,000
        smallholders.

    46. Supported by the DPO, the policy actions were designed to put in place an equitable framework
        for contract farming that would facilitate stronger and more profitable links between
        commercial firms and smallholders, and allow Government to inject incentives where needed.
        The legal framework was set up (PA 4 and 15) but formation of contracts under Pillar II started
        only from 2015 as lengthy negotiations proved necessary with private operators regarding
        incentives, and in the case of some products it proved hard to find qualified private agribusiness
        firms. In late 2014, negotiations were concluded and the decrees setting out contract procedures

                                                   22
        and fixing the level of Government support were issued. Nonetheless, although the percentage
        of small farmers benefitting from Pillar II support was the indicator for the implementation of
        the policy action, the approval and implementation of Pillar II projects has proceeded apace
        (para 43) even before operationalization of the contract farming framework i.e. the indicator
        was met and the specific result achieved, even though the outcome they were designed to
        measure was not in place until the end of the DPO. Now that the framework is operational, the
        number of smallholders participating in Pillar II should increase further and the viability of
        Pillar II projects will be strengthened, because all participating farmers will have better means
        of accessing profitable markets and managing risks.
Objective C: Improved agricultural services
    47. Preparatory analysis of agricultural services conducted prior to appraisal of the DPL series
        identified a disjointed agricultural innovation system and inadequate farmer advisory services.
        At the other end of the value chain, food safety and quality standards were identified as
        increasingly important determinants of competitiveness. The overall objective of C: Improved
        agricultural services was therefore to support institutional reforms that would improve the
        effectiveness of agricultural innovation, advisory and training services (C.1), and to establish
        an effective food safety control system (C.2).

    48. Regarding agricultural innovation, the measures under the DPL series were designed to
        promote demand-driven agricultural innovation partnerships, and to ensure the effective


                                                    23
        transfer of new technologies. The mechanism and the related institutional structures have been
        established (PA 5 and 16) and have proved successful in terms of attracting high quality
        proposals from public and private stakeholders. The competitive research mechanism was
        applied to the discretionary public funding for applied research (Indicator # 6). This worked
        well and the institutional basis is now being established for all public agricultural research
        financing to be awarded competitively, managed by a national steering committee. A
        framework for research partnerships is being established and MAPM is setting up a Fonds
        national de recherche.

    49. A complement to the improved agricultural innovation system was the development of a
        pluralistic approach to delivering agricultural advisory services. MAPM prepared the National
        Agricultural Advisory Services Strategy and Action Plan (PA 17). The Strategy provides for
        the creation of a national agricultural advisory services agency (ONCA) and the implementation
        of sixteen regional plans.          ONCA has been established but preparations for its
        operationalization are still underway, with a target of starting in 2015.

    50. An objective within the National Strategy was the formalization and expansion of private
        advisory services and a specific target was set for this under the DPL (Indicator # 7), focused
        on building experience with contracting private extension services under Pillar II. This has
        advanced rapidly with 51 contracts operational, against an indicator target of 60. The formal
        procedures for accrediting private advisory services and the scaling up of their involvement in
        operations were set out in a law (Law 62-12 on Organization of the Agricultural Advisory
        Profession, published in May 2014) and in the related decree (decret d’application, January
        2015).

    51. Given the important role of women in agriculture, particularly in the Pillar II target group,
        training under Pillar II was monitored and a target of 10% was established for women
        participants. Both the overall quantity of training and the proportion of women trainees
        exceeded targets.

    52. Government has put in place a legal and institutional food safety framework in line with
        international standards (PA 7 and 8). As a result, there has been a strong increase in the number
        of HACCP-certified agri-food processing units. The target against Indicator # 9 has been met,
        with 390 fisheries establishments and 320 dairy and meat establishments certified. In addition,
        a number of fruit and vegetable facilities have been certified. The Indicator # 10 target has not
        been met, but the result is based on a very small number of rejections, so that the percentage
        under-run is not very significant.

      53. The legal and institutional framework set up and the implementation of the rules by ONSSA
          have certainly contributed to increased volume and value added in exports through greater
          awareness and skill amongst industry professionals, as well as reduction in costs due to the
          transition from a control-based system to a risk management system.
Objective D: Improved use and management of irrigation water and the planning of irrigation
infrastructure
      54. Studies over many years have pointed to an increasing water stress for Moroccan agriculture as
          irrigation demand has expanded and competition from urban, industrial and tourism sectors has
          risen. Growing scarcity is expected to be exacerbated by climate change: impacts are already
          being felt and are projected to be quite severe in the longer run. As a result, Government
          adopted an ambitious National Program of Irrigation Water Conservation (PNEEI) which forms
          an integral part of the PMV. The PNEEI supports conversion from gravity fed, flood irrigation
          to pressurized drip irrigation systems in return for farmers committing to improve management
          of groundwater extraction and surface water use. Measures to improve irrigation water service
          delivery, ensure sustainability and raise water efficiency were supported under the irrigation
          efficiency objectives of the Water Sector DPL (2006/7), of which the outcome was rated Highly
          Satisfactory (ICRR, October 30, 2009). 6More recently, the Bank-financed Modernization of
          Irrigated Agriculture in the Oum Er Rbia Basin Project has contributed to improved use and
          management of irrigation water within the PMV/PNEEI.

      55. The PNEEI targets conversion of 555,000 hectares to drip irrigation, including 220,000 hectares
          of collective conversion in LSI areas. Objective D: Improved use and management of
          irrigation water and the planning of irrigation infrastructure was to improve the use and
          management of irrigation water through more efficient and sustainable use (D.1), to improve
          the performance of irrigation service operators (D.2), and to improve irrigation planning (D.3).

      56. Morocco is achieving a remarkable success in promoting pressurized irrigation, and in
          facilitating its adoption by smallholders, linked to sustainable groundwater management. The
          targets for Indicators # 11 and # 12 have been easily surpassed. Groundwater management is
          now the subject of aquifer management contracts, several of which are under preparation under
          the leadership of the basin agencies and Delegated Ministry of Water. In the context of the

    See Section 1.1 above.

                                                        25
        program to spread drip irrigation, declarations of groundwater abstraction points and the
        holding of an authorization for groundwater extraction are requirements: here the relevant target
        (# 11) has been exceeded, providing a basis for progressive regulation and sustainability of
        groundwater extraction.

    57. The target for the number of farmers converting to drip (# 12) has likewise been exceeded. An
        area of 200,000 hectares was converted to drip irrigation 2008-2013, bringing the nationwide
        total to 360,000 hectares by December 2013, mostly through individual reconversion. In LSI,
        infrastructure is now reaching completion to convert an additional first tranche of 66,800
        hectares in major irrigation perimeters (21,000 hectares under a Bank-financed project).
        Funding is being mobilized for a second tranche of 52,000 hectares, also with Bank support for
        about 30,800 hectares. To strengthen groundwater management for sustainability linked to the
        conversion to pressurized irrigation, farmers need to file for authorization for groundwater
        abstraction by the relevant river basin agency. The next step towards sustainable management
        is monitoring of groundwater abstraction.

    58. In order to increase incentives for small farmers to convert to drip irrigation in LSI areas, DPL
        2 provided for a legal amendment reducing (to zero) small farmer contribution to off-farm
        irrigation modernization (PA 20), on the rationale that the heavy cost of pressurization was not
        affordable by small farmers. To date, the necessary amendment has not been cleared by MEF.
        However, in practice, these costs are not being charged to small farmers. MEF assured the
        ICRR mission that the issue would be resolved. The administrative delay has not caused any
        delay in the adoption of drip irrigation by small farmers.

   59. Moroccan LSI schemes are managed by nine public entities (ORMVAs) which are in charge of
       irrigation development and management as well as agricultural development and extension
       services. Government has had a long standing intention to associate private management and
       investment in LSI schemes and, based on studies and on the successful implementation of a
       PPP at Guerdane, delegation of irrigation service delivery to the private sector was included in
       the PMV and the prerequisite improvement of financial and managerial autonomy was to be
       supported under the DPLs. The actions were designed to bring the irrigation water service
       within ORMVAs up towards financial autonomy and to study options for PPP to delegate the
       management of irrigation water service delivery to the private sector.

   60. Consistent with the agreed prior action, before DPL 1 approval (PA 9), Government
       promulgated a tariff adjustments plan encompassing six biannual tariff increases over a 2-year
       period (September 2009 to September 2011). A first tariff increase took place in September
       2009. In parallel, Government conducted studies for PPP on six of the seven ORMVA schemes
       which charge for irrigation water. However, implementation of the second round of increases
       sparked public protests at a sensitive time (see 2.2 above). In consequence, Government
       postponed further increases and commissioned a broadly consultative political economy
       assessment of the overall reform program to determine the optimal pathway to managerial and


                                                     26
       financial autonomy of large irrigation schemes. The results of this study and the then recent
       creation of ONCA in charge of agricultural extension (one of ORMVAs missions) led the
       Government to consider further reforming the ORMVAs, consistent with the original objective
       to improve their financial situation and managerial autonomy. An analysis of possible reform
       options was carried out, with Bank support, which recommended restructuring the ORMVAs
       to refocus them solely on the management of irrigation service delivery.

   61. At the time of appraisal of DPL 2, Government and the Bank agreed to drop the prior action for
       objective D.2 of DPL 2 (implementation of the plan for tariff adjustment) and instead to set the
       submission to the SGG of a draft Law refocusing the mandates of the ORMVAs solely on
       irrigation service. However, building on this analysis, the Minister of the MAPM later decided
       to embed the ORMVA restructuring in a broader institutional reform aiming at regrouping all
       agricultural and rural development services in each region into regional agricultural and rural
       development offices (ORDARs) and to hive off the irrigation service as a separate company, a
       subsidiary of the ORDAR. This institutional restructuring would thus go beyond the original,
       more limited objective of improving the financial autonomy of the ORMVAs and would, in
       effect, put in place the conditions to achieve complete managerial and financial autonomy of
       irrigation management. Among other benefits, this would strengthen the accountability of the
       irrigation service provider and ensure that irrigate tariff revenues are applied to irrigation
       services. It would also allow a more rational and cost efficient staff number and qualifications,
       and eliminate political interferences in water service management. It would also achieve
       another important Government objective that of providing services to farmers and rural people
       integrated at the regional level, so making service delivery more responsive and accountable to
       local stakeholders and clients.

   62. Government and the Bank therefore agreed to change the previously agreed revised prior action
       for DPL 2 (draft Law refocusing the mandates of the ORMVAs solely on irrigation service)
       and instead to set the draft laws for the creation of the ORDARs, which includes the creation
       of autonomous irrigation subsidiaries, as the relevant prior action (PA 21). However, although
       extensive studies of this option have been conducted and the reforms enjoy strong high level
       support, passage of the legislation which was the object of Action # 21 has not yet materialized
       as MEF evaluates the likely impact on public finances (see also Section 2.2 above). The
       Minister of Agriculture (MAPM) has, however, written to the Bank reaffirming government’s
       commitment to this key reform and has requested a Bank Program for Results operation to
       support its implementation. MEF assured the ICRR mission of its support to this reform and
       that it is working with MAPM to finalize the assessment of the financial implications promptly.

   irrigation         investments in
                      irrigation systems


   63. Prior studies had identified weak coordination between the Ministry of Water (responsible for
       dam construction) and MAPM (responsible for developing irrigation) as the cause of a gap of
       108,000 hectares between the area that could be economically irrigated on a sustainable basis
       from existing reservoirs and the area actually developed for irrigation. Prior actions under the
       DPLs therefore provided for integrated investment planning (PA 10) and for adequate funding
       for viable downstream irrigation investment (PA 22). The underlying aim of this measure is to
       ensure that a dam is built only if downstream infrastructure has been studied and if justified,

                                                   27
        investments programmed. Under the MTEF which accompanied the DPL series (see Section
        2.2 above), MEF allocated a considerably higher budget for irrigation (up 132% 2008-2014).
        This allowed rapid catch up: more than 60,000 ha of new irrigation area is currently under
        development or planned, including 21,000 ha at Loukkos, and 42,000 ha in the Gharb (the latter
        may be implemented under a concession with a private operator). In addition, joint planning
        for future development has improved, and there is a good balance between upstream and
        downstream development in current and planned investments. The 100% achievement of the
        target means that all dams programmed were concerted with MAPM.

3.3 Justification of overall outcome rating (combining relevance and achievement of PDOs)

    64. The expected outcomes of the DPL series are all long term, and only incremental progress
        towards these outcomes can be measured in the short term. The expected results set out in the
        policy matrix are generally more specific and progress towards these results can normally be
        measured by performance against the indicators and targets in the Results and Monitoring and
        Evaluation Framework (Table 1 above and Annex D of the PADs). Therefore, overall outcomes
        have been assessed against timely progress towards the expected results as measured by
        meeting of indicator targets and by evaluation of relevant qualitative factors.

    65. Of the 14 indicators, 12 targets have been met or nearly met or exceeded (sometimes by several
        multiples), one target (# 3) has been partially met and all evidence confirms that it will be fully
        met in the next two years; and one indicator (# 13 under Objective D.2) has been missed
        completely. Overall, Objective A has achieved the anticipated results with the launching of
        new contracts for the establishment and operation of fruit and wholesale markets and
        slaughterhouses based on the policy reforms supported by the DPO. Results anticipated under
        Objective B has been largely achieved as participation by producer organizations and
        smallholders is high, consistent with the operational manual supported by the DPO, and the
        framework for supporting contract farming under Pillar II has been (belatedly) established as
        anticipated under the DPO. Confirmation that the overall objective – improved socio-economic
        impact on small farmers – will have to await future impact evaluation. Objective C has been
        achieved with full take-up of the competitive research financing mechanism, use of privately
        contracted extension services under Pillar II, and good progress in the private sector response
        to the food safety reforms supported by the DPO policy and institutional reforms. Objective D
        has been partially achieved with the DPO-supported regulation serving as an effective incentive
        for farmers to participate in groundwater management while converting to metered drip
        irrigation systems which provide the basis for enhanced on-farm water efficiency, and more
        efficient use of water storage infrastructure (dams and reservoirs) through implementation of
        the DPO-supported requirements to ensure sufficient budget allocations to permit full
        development of downstream irrigation. However, establishment of institutional means for
        financially sustainable irrigation management has been delayed.

    66. While the majority of results have been achieved, the delays in progress on the contract farming
        framework, on the reform of the agricultural extension services and on autonomous irrigation
        management result in an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.
4. Assessment of risk to the Development Objective
Rating: Significant
Risk that continued implementation of the reform program may encounter socio-political resistance
    67. At appraisal, a risk was identified that the program for reform of domestic markets (Objective
        A) might encounter opposition from municipalities and from vested marketing interests. This
        risk is real and has been at the root of delays in program implementation (see 2.2 and 3.2 above).
        There is, however, agreement within Government amongst the three ministries involved
        (MAPM, Interior, Commerce) on the program. A PSIA completed under DPL 1 has identified
        ‘winners and losers’, and mechanisms are in place to communicate and consult systematically,


                                                    28
        to demonstrate successful results, and to mitigate negative impacts. These measures are likely
        to be adequate to manage the risk.


Risk that levels of public financing to the agriculture sector may not be maintained
    68. The commitment of MEF to sector financing under the MTEF was a significant contributor to
        the success of the DPO-supported reform program. Now that it has been decided not to continue
        with the DPL instrument, is there continued commitment to financing the sector? In fact,
        sectoral investment programs within the PMV have now been prepared through 2020, showing
        continued high levels of investment to accompany the reforms, and MEF has indicated its
        willingness to make the needed resources available. In addition, Government has requested, in
        the Country Partnership Strategy for the period 2014-2017, investment operations for the
        operationalization of the reforms made under the two DPLs, e.g. agriculture modernization,
        support to ORDAR creation, rural development; in addition to further support to the
        development of drip irrigation. These investments will also ensure that all required technical
        assistance is available.
Risks for the ownership, sustainability and economic viability of Pillar II
        69. The impressive rate of implementation of the Pillar II investment program (see Section 3.2)
        creates risks, which poor smallholders are least able to bear. These risks are essentially three:
        (1) An ‘ownership’ risk, as the original PARs were essentially drawn up on the basis of a top-
        down appreciation of the technical and economic possibilities for agricultural development;
        there was little in the way of ‘participatory diagnostic’. Implementation of early sub-projects
        was often on a turnkey basis with little involvement of farmers (for example, plantations
        established on farmers’ land by contractors and then maintained and irrigated by the contractors
        for a two year maintenance period). The greater level of participation introduced by the
        governance reforms (para 42) and the ongoing update of the PARs strengthen procedures for
        managing this risk. A more ‘bottom-up’ approach could be tested, possibly drawing inspiration
        from the INDH.
        (2) A ‘sustainability’ risk, which stems from the program concept of transformation of semi-
        subsistence agriculture to a market-oriented smallholder economy, and from the resulting
        changes in cropping from largely cereals to high value cash crops and value added through
        processing. This transformation requires close follow up, training and hand-holding over an
        extended period. There is a risk that most effort will be concentrated on physical investment
        rather than on the development of farmer skills. To manage this risk, there is scope to build in
        the needed technical and commercial follow-up and support either through the new ONCA or,
        perhaps better in view of the specialized nature of much of the support required, through
        contracting, including with the new private agricultural advisory services.
        (3) An ‘economic’ risk, as the whole viability of the projects depend on achieving maximum
        value added at production, processing and marketing levels. The risk is that if the whole value
        chain is not capably managed and end products cannot be sold profitably, farmers will lose
        money and the projects will fail. To mitigate this risk, professional management of processing
        facilities will be essential, either through private firms or through well-trained and supported
        farmer management associations (GIEs). Links to profitable markets through contract farming
        or other arrangements, including taking into account the very limited financial capacity of small
        farmers, will be critical.
    70. A participatory updating of the PARs was to be undertaken in 2013 but the results are not yet
        available. A mid-term review of the entire PMV has also been undertaken but the results of
        this were not available at the time of the ICRR mission. The results of these reviews will be
        crucial to evaluating progress so far and proposing any needed corrections. However, firm
        results can only be known in several years’ time, especially as many of the projects are slow-
        maturing (tree fruits, for example). For now, full implementation of the contract farming


                                                   29
        approach (B2) and strengthened extension and advisory services (C1) can make a key
        contribution to managing the risks.
Risks that the MAPM institutional reform program cannot be carried through or may not produce the
expected results
    71. MAPM undertook an ambitious restructuring of its services in 2008 with the creation of 16
        DRAs. Subsequently ONCA has been established to group all advisory services together, whist
        a further restructuring of all agricultural services together into an ‘office’ at the regional level
        has been foreseen with the proposed setting up of ORDARs. The challenge of operationalizing
        these changes may have some effect on service delivery. The risk could be managed through
        a synoptic evaluation of service requirements and delivery mechanisms, which could then
        perhaps be translated into project-based support to implementation.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower performance
5.1 Bank performance
5. 1 (a) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry of the DPL series
Rating: Satisfactory
    72. The DPL series supported key objectives of the PMV, a broad reform program for the
        modernization of the agriculture sector that had been conceived and developed by Government.
        Bank involvement began with the publication of the 2008 World Development Report
        Agriculture for Development and with a sector-wide diagnostic of the key challenges and
        constraints facing the Moroccan agri-food sector (Morocco Agriculture Sector Policy Note,
        2009 and Morocco Agriculture Sector Review, 2010). Specific studies on cereals policy,
        contract farming, climate change and governance further deepened the analytical basis so that
        when Government requested the DPL series, the analytical underpinnings were readily
        available and a common vision was shared between Government and Bank.

    73. The Bank recognized the high strategic relevance of the PMV both to national economic and
        social development and to the Bank’s own priorities. The Bank brought to the preparation and
        appraisal process a large team of experts and conducted a thoroughgoing and participatory
        evaluation of each of the objectives of the operation. Lessons learned from past experience in
        the sector and from previous DPLs in Morocco were incorporated, including the vital necessity
        of strong Government ownership. As the Bank was essentially joining and adding value to a
        Government-conceived and led program which was already starting, the Bank-Government
        relationship was exceptionally fruitful in terms of dialogue, mutual learning and shared
        ownership of the program. A key contribution of the Bank was to ensure there was a platform
        for dialogue amongst sector ministries that had previously held divergent views on sector
        reform, particularly the contrary views of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Commerce
        on domestic market development. Through a combination of objective analysis and
        collaborative dialogue, the Bank was able to help MAPM reach agreement with other ministries
        on the reform agenda that might well otherwise have not been possible.

    74. Through the preparation, appraisal and negotiations process, the Bank achieved an operation
        that was well-structured, with the prior actions well linked to results. Given the longer term
        nature of the overall goal, it was appropriate to set the results framework at the level of the four
        component objectives of the PDO and to measure the results of the specific policy areas
        addressed by the operation (see Sections 1.2 and 2.3). The results and indicators selected at the
        level of these four objectives were relevant and monitorable, with minor exceptions (see para
        26). Implementation arrangements were clear and practical. Risks were well assessed and the
        proposed mitigation measures were appropriate. However, the need to drop or replace several
        results indicators and incomplete actions on irrigation and extension and contract farming,
        extension and irrigation suggest insufficient appreciation of stakeholder resistance to some of
        the key institutional reforms, particularly as concerns deconcentration and private sector
        participation.

                                                    30
    75. In view of the focused and clear strategic relevance of the operation to Government and Bank
        priorities, the quality and relevance of the Bank’s inputs to the reform agenda, the
        comprehensive scope of the program in addressing issues, the well-structured design of the
        operation with strong linkages between actions and results, and the catalytic effect the Bank
        had on inter-agency coordination, Bank performance at the entry of DPL 1 is rated satisfactory.
5. 1 (b) Quality of Bank supervision and performance on quality at entry of DPL 2
Rating: Satisfactory
    76. In the interval between effectiveness of DPL 1 and appraisal of DPL 2, the Bank monitored key
        indicators and issued a single Implementation Supervision Report recording progress against
        targets. Close dialogue was maintained with Government, and coordination meetings were held
        with other donors involved in the PMV, particularly those financing Pillar II investments. Bank
        supervision was rigorous and continued the pattern of partnership and collaboration. Detailed
        reviews of progress and technical inputs assisted in implementation of the program. Issues
        arising were rapidly identified and intensive dialogue was maintained with Government on
        implications for DPL 2. The Bank ensured that the DPLs were complemented by other World
        Bank operations that came on stream, notably the Special Climate Change/GEF grant
        supporting the integration of climate change adaptation measures into selected Pillar II projects
        in five target regions, and the Social and Integrated Agriculture Project (ASIMA) to support
        land and biodiversity conservation in Pillar II projects in marginal areas.

    77. The main problem that arose during the DPO was on the irrigation services objective (D.2),
        where Government had been obliged by changing socio-political circumstances to suspend the
        program of tariff increases and to reconsider the timing of its PPP objectives (see Sections 2.2
        and 3.2). The Bank addressed the issue promptly, supporting commissioning of a study on the
        political economy of irrigation sector reform and an analysis of the possible alternative reform
        options. The study concluded that in the context of the Arab Spring, the proposed tariff
        increases and PPP involvement in the ORMVAs was not opportune. Not only was there
        opposition from farmers but also from ORMVA staff.

    78. Building on this study and previous analysis, the reform process was revised over a very short
        period of time during which Government successively proposed two quite different reforms
        (see 3.2 above), eventually fixing on the proposal to restructure all agricultural services in each
        region into ORDARs and to create separate subsidiary irrigation companies in each ORDAR.
        The Bank and Government agreed to write the creation of ORDARs into DPL 2 in place of the
        previous tariff and PPP objectives. Bank staff and management showed laudable flexibility in
        their willingness to support Government’s ambition for this far-reaching institutional reform,
        which was in line with the objectives of the DPL. However, the change took place after
        appraisal of DPL 2 and was only discussed and formally endorsed by the Government at
        negotiations. Under pressure to meet the deadline for processing the second operation, and
        building on the precedents of fast creation of ONCA and ADA by MAPM, the Bank accepted
        Government’s assurances that the law creating the ORDARs would be promptly passed and
        that the ORDARs could be set up by the target date. In the event, neither of these two
        commitments was met.

    79. With hindsight, the decision to adopt the ORDAR approach would have benefitted from
        additional time which would have allowed MEF and MAPM to complete their assessment of
        the fiscal impact and prepare a more detailed implementation plan and timetable. Some solace
        is given by Government’s subsequent assurances to the Bank that the measure will be
        implemented, and by Government’s request for Bank support to the ORDAR institutional
        reform.

    80. This experience raises a broader issue with respect to DPLs in Morocco – that submission of
        draft legislation to the SGG may be inadequate assurance as a Prior Action. Endorsement of

                                                    31
        the law by the Council of Ministers might provide more solid assurance. Similar issues have
        been faced in other DPLs. In addition, there was scope for supervision to support enhanced
        dialogue with stakeholders outside of Government – namely farmer groups and agribusiness –
        to build technical and political support for the reform measures and particularly to pressure for
        implementation.

    81. Given the good performance of the Bank during the supervision process, the efficient
        preparation of DPL 2, and Bank flexibility and commitment to helping Government respond to
        a changed socio-political environment, but also taking account of the risk knowingly taken by
        the Bank with respect to the ORDAR reform implementation timeline, Bank performance on
        supervision and on quality at entry of DPL 2 is rated as satisfactory.
5. 1 (c) Justification of rating for overall Bank performance
Rating: Satisfactory
    82. Overall, Bank performance on quality at entry was satisfactory, characterized by solid
        analytical underpinning, in-depth dialogue with Government, fostering of inter-ministerial
        commitment to the PMV reforms even where they were unpalatable to some actors, and strong
        and well-documented design. Supervision was active in identifying issues and agreeing on
        measures to support progress towards results, working closely with Government partners.

    83. Bank involvement also helped strengthen donor involvement and cooperation and contributed
        to revival of the donor working group on agriculture. Specifically, Bank involvement in the
        PMV attracted donor financing complementary to the reforms supported under the DPO,
        including from EU, AfDB, IFAD, IsDB, KFW, MCC, USAID, GEF, etc., for an amount
        equivalent to $1.8 billion, of which 47% were on a grant basis. Considerable finance was made
        available to supporting investments complementary to the DPO-supported reforms, including
        financing under Pillar II of the PMV, and financing of the conversion of smallholder agriculture
        to drip irrigation.
5.2 Borrower performance
5. 2 (a) Government performance
Rating: Satisfactory
    84. The DPL series supported a genuinely home-grown reform agenda, developed by Government
        on its own resources. The agenda fitted well with Morocco’s overall priorities and was well-
        designed to develop the considerable further economic potential of agriculture and to include
        smallholders in the process of market-oriented modernization. Government correctly identified
        the opportunity for a win-win synergy that a DPL with the Bank could deliver: the Bank could
        bring the foreign exchange the country needed and also lend its weight and experience to the
        design and implementation of the reform program.

    85. A second synergy was also implicit in Government’s approach: if the country needed foreign
        exchange, MAPM also needed a budget increase to accompany the reforms and to ensure a
        return on the reform program. The linking of the DPLs to the MTEF agreement between MEF
        and MAPM was a strong factor in providing incentives for all partners, and the extra financing
        helped materialize the reforms and increase their impact – this was particularly true for the
        domestic market efficiency objective which needed investment in wholesale markets and
        abattoirs; for the Pillar 2 investment program; for the competitive research fund; and for the
        catch-up and joint planning on irrigation infrastructure. Without the extra budget, the related
        reforms would have had reduced impact.

    86. Government agencies worked well together, sometimes in areas where cooperation had been
        scant in the past. Indeed, a remarkable achievement of Government-Bank cooperation on the
        DPO was indeed to cement commitment and inter-agency cooperation which had not previously
        existed. The successful implementation of the objective to improve the efficiency of domestic

                                                  32
        markets was due in large part to the willingness of three ministries (MAPM, Interior,
        Commerce) to set aside previous disagreements and to work together. Inevitably with such a
        complex reform, it has taken time to implement agreed actions which required concerted action
        amongst four ministries, local authorities and the private sector. However, it is only the pace of
        implementation which was affected and not the direction of the reform or the commitment of
        actors to it. Government also set up a Steering Committee under the chairmanship of MAGG
        and involving all Government stakeholders. The Committee proved an effective sounding
        board and created a forum for the resolution of issues. Government also held regular quarterly
        coordination meetings with development partners.

    87. The notable exception to the quality of inter-agency coordination was the issue of the ORDARs,
        where MEF had indicated its agreement at the time of negotiation of DPL 2, but subsequently
        held up passage of the legislation to allow time for further review of the fiscal implications.
        Overall, however, in view of the very strong commitment and cooperation across all
        departments to the program, Government performance is rated satisfactory.
5. 2 (b) Implementing agency performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
    88. MEF and MAPM were jointly responsible for implementation. MEF supported DPL
        preparation, appraisal and implementation, and – as mentioned above – ensured a considerable
        increase in resources for MAPM under the MTEF. MAPM designed and implemented the
        program, and acted as the principal partner of the Bank. The Strategy and Statistics Department
        (DSS) was responsible for day to day follow up, monitoring and reporting and did an effective
        job. Commitment amongst MAPM departments was strong, with high levels of awareness and
        an informed appreciation of the measures and how they fitted within the overall reform
        program. The main constraint was the change in approach on institutional change within
        MAPM itself and between MAPM and MEF on the ORMVA reform. Although the original
        restructuring into DRAs and autonomous agencies was clear, successive restructuring proposals
        (ONCA, ORI, ORDAR…) created ambiguity, and MEF’s reopening of the review of the
        financial implications of the ORDAR institutional change led to delays in implementing the
        already agreed restructuring. Overall, implementing agency performance is therefore rated
        moderately satisfactory.


5. 2 (c) Justification of rating for overall Borrower performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
    89. Overall, the DPLs supported a well-designed program, almost all of which has been
        implemented. There is substantiated progress towards all four of the program objectives and
        towards the targeted results on the subsidiary objectives. Government is following up with
        further measures and investments along all of the four reform tracks. Collaboration within
        Government and performance by the implementing agencies was sound. Again with the caveat
        about the institutional reform of MAPM services, overall Borrower performance is rated
        moderately satisfactory.
6. Lessons learned
    90. A DPL works best when it stems from a home-grown reform program with strong ownership
        within Government. In the case where incentives for the finance ministry and for the line
        ministry are aligned, the synergy is powerful. In these circumstances, the Bank can still add
        considerable value beyond just resource transfer by further analytic work to help finalize and
        operationalize the program and to prepare for its implementation. In fact, the experience with
        this DPL series demonstrates the value of having up-front strong analytical underpinnings (see
        Annex 4).




                                                   33
   91. A further strong value of Bank support under a DPL is to help create a platform for agencies
       that otherwise may have divergent agendas. The Bank can also contribute to transparent,
       evidence–based and objective dialogue around thorny issues, including political economy
       constraints to reform implementation.

   92. The DPL supported a paradigm shift from a highly protected sector towards a market-oriented
       agriculture, towards integrated value addition all along the agri-food chain, and towards
       integration of smallholders into the commercial agricultural economy, accompanied by a major
       public and private investment program, the strengthening of core public services and
       development of public/private partnerships (PPP). Although it is too soon to measure the
       impact of the shift, it is expected that it will turn out to have been the comprehensive and
       integrated nature of this reform and investment program which has the impact on growth and
       poverty reduction.

   93. The linking of a DPL to a sectoral MTEF aligns incentives for both the finance ministry and
       the line ministry, and provides investment resources to accompany and help implement reforms
       that otherwise might not take place or might not yield their intended returns.

   94. In the case of Morocco, submission of draft legislation to the SGG may be inadequate assurance
       that a reform will be promptly executed. Endorsement of the law by the Council of Ministers
       might provide more solid assurance, or some other specific and verifiable action might be
       sought.

   95. Evaluation of a DPO is constrained by the short time scale, particularly for a two loan series,
       where the final evaluation occurs only twelve months after the second set of Prior Actions.
       Post-evaluation of a series after several years linked to some impact monitoring could resolve
       this problem and provide useful information for the design of future DPOs.

   96. There is a need – and an opportunity – to accompany some reforms with project-style guidance
       and investment. In this case, investment project support has been requested by Government to
       follow up on implementation of reforms under all four objectives of the DPL series (see 2.4
       above).


7. Comments on issues raised by the Borrower
   97. At completion of the operations, the Borrower furnished a comprehensive report (June 2014,
       attached as Annex 3), which has provided information for the preparation of this ICRR. In
       addition to a summary of the rationale for the reforms and detailing of the policies, actions and
       results, there is a frank risk analysis which is consistent with that of this ICRR (see Section 4
       above). The report evaluates the Government/Bank partnership and Bank contributions
       positively, as having contributed materially to the establishment of a ‘virtuous circle’ of
       implementation of challenging reforms that will be continued and which will bring beneficial
       results for Moroccan agriculture. The Borrower provided some textual comments on the draft
       ICRR (Annex 3) which have been largely reflected in the final version.

                  NOTE CONJOINTE AU SUJET DU PROJET PILOTE
           DE MARCHE DE GROS DE FRUITS ET LEGUMES A BERKANE


Dans le cadre de la mise à niveau des marchés de gros des fruits et légumes et
conformément aux orientations des stratégies sectorielles notamment le Plan Rawaj et
le Plan Maroc Vert, les Départements de l’Intérieur, du Commerce et de l’Agriculture
ont adopté conjointement le Schéma National d’Orientation des marchés de gros des
fruits et légumes, comme stratégie Gouvernementale de restructuration et de
redéploiement de ces équipements.

A cet effet, et afin de réussir l’implémentation de ce schéma, les Départements concernés ont
opté pour une approche progressive et participative consistant à réaliser le premier projet
pilote à Berkane (MGB) en concertation avec les collectivités territoriales concernées.


A ce sujet, une convention cadre a été signée, en février 2013, entre les Ministères de
l’Intérieur, des Finances, de l’Agriculture, de l’Industrie et du Commerce, la Région
de l’Oriental, les communes de Berkane et de Madagh, l’Agence de l’Oriental d’une
part et CDG et MEDZ d’autre part pour la mise en place de ce projet.


Le projet sera réalisé au niveau de la commune rurale de Madagh sur un foncier domanial,
d’une superficie de 15 ha (1ère tranche), limitrophe à l’Agropole de Berkane.

Le coût du projet s’élève à 243 MDH (horizon 2021) dont la 1ère tranche (horizon 2016) est
estimée à 192 MDH dont une subvention de de 129 MDhs répartie comme suit : MAPM : 40
MDH, MI (DGCL) : 15 MDH; MICIEN : 15 MDH; APDO : 19 MDH et Région de l’Oriental :
40 MDH. Cette subvention permettra de contribuer au financement des apports des
communes concernées au capital de la SDL, des droits de première occupation (DPO) des
magasins par les commerçants actuels du MDG de Berkane, et de l’équilibre financier de la
SDL, avant le démarrage des activités du marché (2 ans environ).

Quant au montage institutionnel retenu pour ce projet, la convention prévoit la création d’une
Société de Développement Local entre les communes de Berkane et de Madagh, la CDG et sa
filiale MEDZ. Cette société sera chargée de la mise en œuvre du projet dans ses différentes
phases, à savoir l’aménagement et la construction du MGB, son équipement, sa
commercialisation, sa gestion et sa promotion. La répartition des participations des
actionnaires de la SDL se décline comme suit : Communes (49% des parts), CDG (2% des parts)
et MEDZ (49% des parts).

Il y a lieu de signaler que pour la concrétisation des actions arrêtées dans la convention cadre,
des délais nécessaires pour permettre d’une part, aux communes et à MEDZ de constituer la
SDL et d’autre part à affiner les conditions de faisabilité du projet, par MEDZ, notamment les
études techniques, le montage financier, l’offre et la demande et l’élaboration d’une stratégie
de conduite de changement impliquant toutes les parties prenantes afin d’assurer une
transition fluide et réussie vers le nouveau MGB.




                                               54
Les communes concernées ont déjà pris la décision de constituer la SDL à côté de MEDZ et
CDG. Des documents juridiques afférents à la SDL sont déjà élaborés, et ce après plusieurs
réunions tenues par le comité interministériel de pilotage ;

De même, plusieurs réunions et rencontres ont été tenues avec les commerçants en gros et la
fédération des fruits et légumes en vue de lever tous les écueils entravant la concrétisation du
projet, ce qui aboutit à l’adhésion totale des commerçants en acceptant leur transfert vers le
nouveau projet.

Certains partenaires du projet ont déjà mobilisé leurs quoteparts financières et sont disposés
au versement dans le compte spécial crée à cet effet, une fois la SDL constituée. Il est à signaler
que l’Agence de l’Oriental a déjà versé 7.5Mdh au titre de 2013.

La réalisation des études d’affinement est un engagement pris par MEDZ. Cette dernière est
appelée à accélérer la réalisation de ces études dans les meilleurs délais, en vue de permettre
la signature de la convention de valorisation du projet entre l’Etat et la SDL et entamer les
travaux de construction du projet.

        Annexe 4: Borrower’s comments on draft ICR and team responses
•   There is no need to quote the name of the Firm who is doing the PMV review.
    World Bank response: the phrase has been removed from the text.
•   The ONCA is already operational at both central and regional levels.
    World Bank response: the text has been amended to say ‘only now becoming operational’.
•   The legal amendment reducing (to zero) small farmer contributions to off-farm irrigation
    modernization (PA 20), is being considered by the MEF and cannot decide on the matter at this
    stage.
    World Bank response: the phrase ‘which has concerns about the rationale for the change’
    has been removed.
•   ‘The commitment of MAPM to this program was very strong and, throughout, MAPM acted as
    the motor for implementation of the reforms.’ If this is the case why the performance of the
    Borrower is Moderately satisfactory?
    World Bank response: After careful consideration, the rating for the implementing agencies
    (MEF and MAPM) has been maintained as the implementing agencies have responsibility for
    ‘timely resolution of implementation issues’ and hence for the delays in the implementation
    of the private advisory services, contract farming and ORDAR reforms which are the
    reason why the operation overall can only be rated Moderately Satisfactory. It would
    not be reasonable to rate Implementing Agency performance Satisfactory if the
    operation overall is rated Moderately Satisfactory. According to ICRR Guidelines, the
    combination of a Satisfactory rating for the Government and a Moderately Satisfactory
    rating for the Implementing Agencies results in an overall rating for the Borrower of
    Moderately Satisfactory.
•   The strategy of the agricultural advisory services took into account that the advisory services
    should be differentiated, depending on the beneficiaries, e.g. small and big farmers. In addition,
    responsibilities between ONCA and ORDAR are well defined.
    World Bank response: The sentence has been abridged to say: ‘The challenge of
    operationalizing these changes may have some effect on service delivery.’
•   Any institutional change within the MAPM is well thought and done in close
    collaboration with the MEF.
    World Bank response: the assessment has been changed to read: ‘The main constraint
    was the change in approach on institutional change within MAPM itself and between MAPM
    and MEF on the ORMVA reform.’
•   If almost all the reforms were implemented, why the performance of the borrower is considered
    Moderately satisfactory?
    World Bank response: see above.
