         are to: 1) improve the efficiency of domestic markets; 2)\n            improve the socio-economic impacts of investments directed\n            to small farmers; 3) improve agricultural services; and 4)\n            improve the use and the management of irrigation water and\n            the planning of irrigation infrastructures. This program\n            document a first Development Policy Loan (DPL) in support of\n            the Plan Maroc Vert to the Kingdom of Morocco. The operation\n            is the first of a programmatic series of two single tranche\n            DPLs. The program supports an ambitious government\n            initiative in the agriculture sector and builds on extensive\n            dialogue between the World Bank and the Government of\n            Morocco (GoM) and is underpinned by a large body of\n            analytical work and sector operations. The program has\n            benefited from a broad range of analytical work recently\n            completed by the World Bank and others. The program also\n            builds on the outcomes and experience from past and ongoing\n            bank operations in water and irrigation, integrated rural\n            development, human development, and public sector\n            administration reform. Additional value added of the World\n            Bank includes bringing global best practice lessons to the\n            implementation of the PMV as well as encouraging\n            inter-ministerial dialogue. With the involvement of the\n            private sector Morocco designed and is implementing specific\n            sector strategies to increase investment and employment in\n            sectors of the economy with high growth potential. Thus,\n            investment in these sectors has increased, strengthening the\n            fundamentals of the economy."}, "docdt": "2011-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
