Loan Project\n            for the Republic of India had satisfactory outcomes with low\n            or negligible risk to development outcome performance by\n            both the Bank and the borrower. The objective of the loan\n            was to provide capital support to banks under support of the\n            Government of India to enable them to maintain economic\n            stimulus programs to contain the effects of the global\n            crisis that began in 2008. The project was designed as a set\n            of two development policy lending operations. The first was\n            to provide budgetary support to the Government of India for\n            capital injection before June 2010. The second loan in this\n            program was expected to calibrate and reflect specific\n            financing needs and include a program of policy and\n            regulatory. The second loan did not materialize. However,\n            despite the overall success of the design and the outcome,\n            this assessment identified a number of issues, resulting in\n            important lessons learned by the Bank in responding to its\n            clients during periods of major crises. (1) Greater clarity\n            in the project document was needed to underpin the second\n            operation and loan. (2) The processing of the operation\n            could have been more rapid; actual disbursement of funds\n            happened a considerable time after the global crisis broke.\n            (3) While arguments against the use of a deferred drawdown\n            option are strong in retrospect, there should have been\n            greater prior dialogue with the Government of India on\n            crisis response."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
