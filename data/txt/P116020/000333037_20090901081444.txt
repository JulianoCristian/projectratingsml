                          THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA
                       BANKING SECTOR SUPPORT L O A N


Borrower:        GOVERNMENT OF INDIA

Implementing     Ministry o f Finance (MOF), Government o f India
Agency:
Financing Data   IBRD Loan
                 Front end fee: 0.25% o f the loan amount
                 Loan terms : IBRD Flexible Loan with Variable Spread option and a
                 total maturity o f 30 years including a five year grace period and level
                 repayments
                 Amount          : US$2.0 billion

Operation Type   First o f a programmatic set o f two single tranche operations

Main Policy      Despite stable policies, increasing efficiency, strong factor endowments
Areas            and a dynamic financial market, India's economic growth slowed from 9.7
                 percent in 2006-07 to 5-6 percent in the second half o f 2008-09 and i s
                 projected to remain in the 5.5-6.5 percent range in 2009-10. The decline
                 reflects the external shock brought about by the global financial and
                 economic crisis. Since late 2008, the Government has implemented a
                 series o f measures to stimulate the economy with monetary, fiscal, trade
                 and financial sector instruments that safeguard economic activity levels and
                 assist vulnerable sectors. The Government has requested financial support
                 for this program, which i s being provided through the proposed set o f two
                 programmatic loans from the World Bank.

                 One component o f the Government's overall program i s the provision o f
                 capital to sound public sector banks to help them maintain credit growth to
                 contain the adverse effects o f the slowdown on employment and poverty,
                 broaden financial inclusion, and to enable India's production and trade
                 sectors to continue to sharpen their competitiveness and prepare for
                 recovery. Capital buffers for the banks at this stage-taking them beyond
                 the 9 percent ratio recommended under Base1 2 (no bank i s currently below
                 this level) to around 12 percent-will also serve as a precautionary shield
                 against possible adverse developments in financial markets. Capital for the
                 banks will come from the Government's budget, the banks' own resources
                 and, if financial market conditions improve, from public issues.




                                            1
1 Key Outcome     The operation will help Government contain the slowdown in the economy
Indicators        by maintaining credit growth, maintain the confidence o f the public in the
                  banking system, and provide a buffer to public sector banks against adverse
                  developments in the economy and financial markets. Besides overall
                  macroeconomic stability and growth, the outcome indicators o f the
                  operations are: (a) credit growth by public banks without a major increase
                  in non-performing assets (NPA); (b) continued strength and stability o f the
                  banking sector and improved supervision; (c) implementation and adoption
                  o f strengthened prudential norms; (d) adoption o f improved corporate
                  governance practices in public banks; (e) adoption o f action plans for
                  improved productivity o f public banks. Progress towards outcomes will be
                  assessed through trends in indicators related to these areas.


Program           Support to Indian economic growth and employment during a period o f
Development       global slowdown and financial crisis by helping maintaining credit
Objectives and    expansion at a reasonable rate. The CAS supports the achievement o f
Contribution to   rapid, inclusive growth in India through studies and lending operations that
                  address both cyclical and structural factors. Buttressing macroeconomic,
                  fiscal and financial stability at both the central and state levels i s a key
                  focus o f the CAS. The CAS recognizes that recent global developments
                  pose important challenges to the achievement o f the Eleventh Plan goals. I t
                  also envisages the World Bank and other development partners to coming
                  up with creative solutions in a timely manner and scaling up funding
                  support. The CAS flagged the expansion o f development policy lending
                  beyond the identified projects and their extension to the national level (that
                  is, beyond the state-level D P L that have characterized the India program).

Risk and Risk     Key risks are continued deterioration o f the global economy with a more
Mitigation:       significant spill over impact on the Indian economy, and the inability o f the
                  banks to maintain high quality credit growth and a buffer to absorb the
                  likely increase in NPA. The Government's multi-pronged stimulus
                  program may help contain the effects o f a prolonged crisis. The
                  supervisory authorities monitor the quality o f bank portfolios closely and
                  have a record o f accomplishment on helping maintain banking system
                  stability. In addition, there i s increased emphasis on risk management and
                  improved capacity by banks in credit appraisal, and the regulator has
                  implemented stronger prudential norms in recent years. Thus, healthy
                  credit growth i s likely to be maintained'through this operation.

                                     PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR

                    A PROPOSED BANKING SECTOR SUPPORT LOAN TO
                               THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA


                                            I. INTRODUCTION

1. This Program Document presents the first Banking Sector Support Loan (BSSL) in a~
proposed set of two programmatic development policy loans (DPL) to the Republic o f
India. The amount o f this loan i s US$2.0 billion equivalent. I t responds to a request from the
Government to provide financial support to enable the authorities to continue implementing their
economic stimulus program, which i s intended to contain the effects o f the global economic
crisis on the Indian economy. An important part o f the overall stimulus program i s the provision
o f capital support to public sector banks (PSB). This will help maintain the confidence o f the
public in the banking sector, prevent shortages o f capital from leading to a slowdown in credit


            '
growth, and provide a capital buffer to public sector banks to absorb the possible increase in non-
performin assets (NPA) resulting from the global financial crisis and i t s impact on India's
economy. India's GDP growth slowed from a peak 9.7 percent in 2006-07 to about 5-6 percent
in the third and fourth quarters o f 2008-09, and is projected to remain in the 5.5-6.5 percent
range in 2009-10, a sharp drop with adverse implications for employment and poverty reduction,
and on investment for long-term growth. The first BSSL will address needs arising from the
current economic slowdown.          Continued credit expansion by the banking system will
complement the comprehensive stimulus measures that the Government has put in place since
mid-2008, which include monetary, trade, fiscal, and financial sector actions, and will limit the
slowdown before i t becomes too deep.

2. Following the economic reforms first introduced during the 1980s and accelerated in
subsequent years, India has raced to the top of the world league tables in terms of
aggregate economic performance. There i s little doubt that, until the global economic
downturn, the Indian economy had settled into a new, more rapid growth trajectory. Stable
macroeconomic management, outward orientation, high savings and investment rates and, since
199 1, rapid increases in productivity that accompanied economic liberalization account for the
good economic performance and more efficient use o f i t s endowments. Comprehensive reforms
o f India's financial systems and institutions and, until recently, i t s access to the international
financial market, have supported this performance. The outcome o f India's well-managed
financial sector reforms, and the rapid growth and diversification o f the economy i s a stable
banking sector, with high profitability and adequate capital, combined with an ability to expand
credit at an average annual rate o f above 20 percent over the past three years, while reducing
N P A sharply to below 2 percent. Thus, unlike the currently distressed banking systems o f
several developed and emerging market countries, India's banking system i s starting from a
strong position.

'Non-performing assets means those assets o f banks and financial institutions that are considered non-performing
under applicable guidelines o f the Reserve Bank o f India.

3. However, going forward, the Government estimates that India's public sector banks
will require an injection of at least $4.8 billion during 2009-2011 to maintain credit expansion
and help contain the effects o f the global slowdown, while preserving financial soundness and
confidence in the stability o f the banking system. The proposed program o f two DPL, totaling
about US$3 billion, will provide budgetary support to the Government equivalent to over half o f
this requirement before June 2010. The second loan in this set will be calibrated to reflect the
specific financing needs, as real and financial market conditions evolve during 2009-10. In
addition, it will include a program o f policy and regulatory measures designed to further
strengthen the effectiveness o f the banks in achieving the objectives o f the Government's
economic program.

4. Bank credit growth in the Indian economy was 17.3 percent in 2008-09 and banks were
sound and profitable, reflecting the Government's efforts to make banking competitive and
put the PSB on a sound footing.2 The 27 PSB reported capital adequacy ratios averaging 12.3
percent, a net non-performing assets (NPA) ratio o f just 0.9 percent, and return on assets o f 0.9
percent as o f March 2009. The equivalent ratios for private banks were 15.1 percent, 1.4
percent, and 1.1 percent.

5. Nonetheless, the availability o f funding slowed in 2008-09, and credit growth was
largely due to the PSB. India's large equity market fell sharply during the year, along with
equity markets throughout the world. Private and foreign banks found their external funding
drying up as the international crisis deepened in the second half o f 2008. However, the PSB,
who have a large and relatively stable deposit base upon which to leverage lending, managed to
maintain their credit growth at 20.4 percent for 2008-2009 (compared to 4 percent for foreign
banks and 10.9 percent for domestic private banks).

6.   The PSB have indicated that, if they had the necessary capital in place, they would be
able to maintain credit growth at appropriate levels. This would occur mainly through loans
to (a) infrastructure, which i s widely seen b y Indian banks as a good countercyclical asset class
in an economic downturn; (b) under-served segments o f the rural economy; (c) firms,
particularly small and medium enterprises, to meet working capital needs; and (d) some large
creditworthy corporate borrowers-previously        clients o f the private and foreign banks-who
have found it increasingly difficult to obtain funds from those sources because o f supply side
constraints.

7 . However, current and prospective capital market and international liquidity
conditions make it difficult for banks to obtain new funding to expand credit. Some private
banks are also constrained by the retreat o f foreign investors from emerging markets, partly by a
switch o f deposits to the PSB after problems appeared for the foreign banks in their home

* There are 27 public sector banks today, including 19 nationalized banks (following one merger), the flagship State
Bank o f India and i t s six associated banks, and the IDBI Bank. In addition, there are 15 old private sector banks, 8
new private sector banks (that is, post-1994), and 28 foreign banks. Together, these banks are called scheduled
commercial banks. There are also a large number o f regional rural banks and cooperative banks, and some
developmental and non-bank financial institutions, such as housing banks and state financial development
institutions. Urban cooperative banks play a vital role in financing the consumption o f durable goods.



                                                          4
countries and partly by their own decision to limit new deposits. However, in general, and
especially because o f the drop in credit from such banks, their capital positions are strong and
will not be a constraint in undertaking future credit expansion. For PSB, although capital i s also
not a problem at present, their ability to obtain capital for future credit expansion from the equity
and bond markets i s limited by the decline in these markets, and in some PSB on account o f the
Government's requirement to maintain majority government ownership. Given their size, credit
market dominance, extensive branch network and market momentum, the PSB are likely to have
pressing needs for capital. The main objective o f the proposed BSSL i s to ensure that, together
with other critical stimulus and recovery spending needs, the Government i s able to meet such
requirements and that capital does not emerge as the constraint on their credit growth during the
current economic downturn, or during the early stage o f India's economic recovery.

8. Voting in the general elections ended in May. The incumbent Congress Party returned to
power within a reconfigured coalition. I t moved swiftly to name the prime minister and new
national cabinet, to reaffirm key national policies i t had initiated and implemented earlier, and to
begin preparations for the national budget for the remainder o f 2009- 10, which it subsequently
presented in July. The budget for 2009-10 reinforces the inclusive growth orientation o f the
Government, while addressing the need to restore economic growth to the pre-2008 level. Since
taking office, the Government has also made several high level pronouncements about i t s
intentions to provide other forms o f stimulus to contain the effects o f the global crisis on the
Indian economy, including through the provision o f capital to PSB to enable them to maintain
credit growth.

                                 Box 1: Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-2012)

 The Government o f India's Plan contains 27 interlinked national targets to address the challenge o f inclusive
 growth. They cover the most important constraints affecting education, health, women and children,
 infrastructure, and the environment, besides the overarching issues related to income expansion and the reduction
 o f poverty and unemployment. I t provides a stable framework within which policy adjustments w i l l occur during
 the period o f implementation o f the proposed loan. The focus o f the Plan i s to maintain an average economic
 growth rate o f 9 percent for the five-year period, shared broadly across income groups, especially poor
 households. An average agriculture growth rate o f 4 percent i s considered vital to achieving the Government's
 poverty reduction objective o f a decline in the head-count ratio o f consumption poverty o f 10 percentage points.

 Increasing the reach o f formal financial institutions for crop finance and for micro-, small- and medium
 enterprise funding w i l l support the rising monetization o f India's rural economy, increased market-orientation o f
 farm output by both intensifying and expanding production-trading chains, and greater opportunities for off-farm
 employment to support agricultural income.

 Another key plank o f the Plan i s to fill the large gaps in infrastructure that hold back achievement o f India's
 economic growth potential. Expanded and better-quality infrastructure services w i l l permit Indian firms to
 continue sharpening their competitiveness.

 The Plan has set targets for employment creation (58 million new jobs), reduction o f unemployment among the
 educated (by 5 percent), and an increase (by 20 percent) in the real wage o f unskilled workers. Credit expansion
 plays a central role in the Government's policies for the Plan period. The current situation o f the global and
 domestic financial markets has placed all the Plan targets in jeopardy. The Government intends through i t s
 stimulus program and related policy measures to ensure that, as far as feasible, the economy remains on track to
 reach the Plan outcomes and deviations from the desired path are small.
9. The outcome o f the recent elections assures the continuity o f basic economic policies.
The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-20 12)-with i t s emphasis on inclusive, sustainable growth
and delivery o f public services-provides the overall strategic thrust for economic policy for the
duration o f this programmatic series o f D P L (Box 1). Adjustments in macroeconomic
management policies and targets to address the effects o f the current global crisis are unlikely to
make a fundamental change in this framework. The Government and RBI intend to stay the
course they embarked upon several years ago to further strengthen the financial sector-the
important role o f capital markets, the emphasis on competition, prudential supervision o f the
banking sector, and the governing framework for the PSB-all           o f which have contributed
favorably to India's growth, stability and financial sector development.

                                      B. ECONOMIC
                                                DEVELOPMENTS

10. I n the past few years, India has emerged as one o f the world's fastest growing
economies. Since 1990, i t s economic growth rate has more than doubled, rising from 1.9
percent per capita during 1961-1990 to 4.6 percent in 1991-2008. Growth accelerated to 7.4
percent over the five years preceding the 2008 global slowdown. As a result, India has gone
from the world's 50th ranked economy in nominal U S Dollar terms in 1980 to the loth largest
economy today (and the 4th largest in PPP terms). The real growth rate reached 9 percent in
2007/08 after peaking at 9.7 percent in the revious year, and real per capita income stood at
US$950, more than double the 1993/94 level.          t3
 11. Increasing investment, savings and a falling fiscal deficit characterized India's growth
until 2008. The investment rate increased to 38 percent in 2007/08, up from 24 percent in
2001/02, while domestic savings rose to 36 percent o f GDP, from 23 percent. The surge in
investment had a positive effect on India's corporate profits. Profitability has recorded growth in
the 25 to 60 percent range on a year-to-year basis since 2001/02. An important factor in both the
increase in investment and savings was the buoyancy o f private corporate sector savings (which
rose from 3.4 percent o f GDP in 2001/02 to 8.8 percent in 2007/08). O n the government side,
fiscal consolidation, enhancement in revenues and restructuring o f selected expenditures at both
federal and state levels increased India's public savings from -2 percent o f GDP to 4.5 percent.
I t helped reduce the general government fiscal deficit from 10.1 percent to 6.2 percent o f GDP
between 2001/02 and 2007/08 (central government deficit from 6.7 percent to 3.5 percent).

 12. The m a j o r engines o f India's recent r a p i d growth have been manufacturing and
services-contributing roughly 29 and 54 percent o f the national output, respectively (Figures 1
and 2)-supported by stable macroeconomic management, a young and increasingly well-
educated workforce, and a dynamic entrepreneurial class. A sharp reduction in licensing after
 199 1 and the establishment o f increasingly contestable domestic markets has permitted Indian
f i r m s and farms to sharpen their competitive edge, while taking better advantage o f the
opportunities created by the new dynamism o f the economy. The rapid growth reflects increased
productivity growth, not just greater use o f inputs. A simple growth accounting analysis showed
that half the growth o f output per worker in India during 1993 and 2004 resulted from gains in
total factor productivity (TFP).4 This feature, together with the structural transformation o f
India's economy towards manufacturing and services, has been important in raising India's
underlying trend growth rate. Growth in India has been less capital intensive than in other
countries, partially because it has relied more on the services sector, which put heavy emphasis

  The study attributed the rest o f the gains to physical capital expansion (40 percent) and higher education levels (10
percent). Barry Bosworth, Susan Collins and Arvind Virmani, Sources o Growth in the Indian Economy, NBER

on labor inputs and, in most cases, less on capital. The productivity o f capital use, as measured
by the incremental capital output ratio, has been high by Asian standards.

13. India's rapid growth also reflects i t s increased integration with the world economy.
The emergence o f export-oriented sectors, increasing access to financing from international
financial markets by Indian firms, who also invested globally, the growing presence o f foreign
institutional investor (FII) investments in India, and growing remittances and income from
services exports are some examples o f stronger linkages with the international economy. The
share o f goods trade increased from 17 percent o f GDP in 1993/94 to 34 percent in 2007/08. In
addition to i t s widely recognized success in services exports, India has been able to show
considerable prowess in manufactured exports (for example, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, light
engineering goods, and textiles) in addition to i t s traditional strengths in areas such as handicrafts
and jewelry. Capital flows also benefited from robust FDI and increased portfolio investment in
real estate, banking and equities in the financial sector.

14. As the economy grew, the demand for credit increased, and was met both from
internal and external sources. The ratio o f domestic bank credit to GDP has been growing
steadily, from 29 percent in 2000 to 54.5 percent in 2008, although it i s still l o w by comparison
to middle-income countries and East Asia.' This growth was inevitable with a growing middle
class with high disposable income, wider choice o f consumer durables, increased acceptance o f
credit cards, and increased demand for housing loans. India's corporate sector seized the
opportunities provided by rapid growth and expanded rapidly, with some o f i t s financing coming
from external borrowing. Even as other segments o f the domestic financial market develop, the
potential long-term demand prospects for credit are high. Net external commercial borrowings
have averaged US$8.6 billion over the past five years, or 0.8 percent o f GDP, rising to US$22.2
billion (1.9 percent o f GDP) in 2007/08. Strong capital inflows, besides demonstrating the
attractiveness o f the Indian economy as an investment destination, resulted in an increase in
foreign reserves to US$315 billion by M a y 2008 (one o f the highest levels in the world and
equivalent to 12 months o f imports). In 2007/08, the reserve cover o f short-term debt was a
comfortable 3.1 times. The total stock o f external debt reached US$221 billion, or 18.8 percent
o f GDP, significantly below the middle-income country average o f 24.8 percent.

 15. Despite r a p i d growth, a recent survey showed that bank credit to the private sector i s
low in comparison to other large countries.6 Private credit growth in India reflects the process
o f financial deepening against the backdrop o f initially shallow financial markets and a large
amount o f government debt. Experience in many countries demonstrates that, although financial
development i s a determinant o f aggregate economic growth, it can easily coincide with the
cyclical growth o f lending. Management o f this process i s crucial to avoiding adverse effects on
credit quality and the formation o f asset bubbles. In India, RBI took several steps to ensure high
credit quality (as seen, for example, in the l o w level o f NPA noted earlier in paragraphs 2 and 4),
and aggressive monetary policy mitigated the development o f asset price imbalances o f the kind
seen elsewhere. In fact, as shown in Figure 3, together with rapid economic growth, India has
seen a declining rate o f inflation. Headline inflation, measured by the wholesale price index
(WPI), fell from,an average o f 9.6 percent (y-y) in the 1990s, to 5 percent in the past five years.
This decline in W P I inflation resulted from a fall in the prices o f primary commodities, some
manufactured goods and, more recently, in hydrocarbons. The consumer price index for
industrial workers (CPI-IW), a good measure o f the urban cost o f living, has generally tracked
W P I inflation rates with a lag (with the seeming divergence in 1995-96 and 1998 explained by
technical measurement changes). Careful monetary management by the RBI, with broad money
(M3) growing at an average rate o f 20 percent, has succeeded in supporting the growth of
nominal GDP at a high level (14 percent per year) while providing price and exchange rate
stability.

                                              OF         CRISIS


16. India, like most other emerging market economies, has been affected by the global
financial crisis. The decoupling theory, which was being put forward in the initial days o f the
crisis, has been proved wrong. The impact o f the financial crisis arose from three main channels.

    0   Credit: Financial markets tightened following the collapse o f Lehman Brothers, and
        there was a sharp increase in the call money rate (to 20 percent). W h i l e some domestic
        factors, such as the advance payment o f taxes and a withdrawal o f bank deposits for
        festival period shopping, tightened liquidity conditions, the inter-bank market reacted
        adversely to uncertainty about the exposure o f Indian banks to toxic assets, and bank
        credit growth f e l l sharply. In particular, sectors hit hard by the global meltdown-such
        as SME, textiles, and real estate-faced a serious credit crunch.

        Capital flows: While India seems relatively less integrated with the global economy on
        the external trade account (share o f exports to GDP o f 18 percent), the picture changes
        considerably if the extent o f financial integration i s measured. The share o f external
        current account transactions more than doubled from 47 percent o f GDP in 1997-98 to
         117 percent in 2007-8. Consequently, the sharp reversal o f capital flows that occurred
        after the collapse o f Lehman Brothers in September 2008 (Figure 4) had a profound

  As a share o f GDP, bank credit rose from 32.1 percent in 2003 to 50.9 percent in 2008. B y contrast, the 2008
shares for emerging markets such as Brazil (58.4 percent), China (125.3 percent), and Korea (118.3) and for
developed countries such as Germany (108 percent), Japan (149.9 percent), the UK (210.8 percent) and the U S
(189.6 percent) were higher, and in most cases significantly different. Fitch Ratings, Bank Systemic Risk Report,

        impact on the Indian financial market, including private banks and large corporate
        borrowers.

        Trade:     The largest impact o f the crisis was through the decline in exports, specifically
        manufactured goods exports. During October 2008-February 2009 exports f e l l from an
        average annual growth rate o f 35 percent to 12 percent (Figure 4). OECD countries,
        which received approximately 40 percent o f India's merchandise exports, also accounted
        for the major part o f the fall in exports. Worst affected among the manufacturing sectors
        were labor-intensive gems and jewelry, textiles, leather and products, cotton and yam,
        tea, marine products and handicrafts, leading to unemployment in many urban centers

17. India's growth rate has fallen sharply. Growth was slowing by early 2008 because o f a
cyclical downturn in investment, terms o f trade losses from higher commodity prices o f about
4.5 percent o f GDP, and monetary tightening to combat inflationary pressure. The global crisis
triggered a chain o f adverse events, starting with a slowdown in India's exports, which spread to
production and investment when capital flows started retreating from emerging markets and
stock market valuations began a rapid decline, consistent with the global trends. Growth fell
from a peak o f 9.7 percent in 2006/07 to 6.7 percent in 2008-09. In quarterly terms, the year-on-
year (y-y) growth rate f e l l to 4.5 percent in the last quarter o f 2008-09, from 10.6 percent in last
quarter o f 2005-06. World Bank estimates project it to fall further to the 5.5-6.5 percent range
during 2009-10. The Government's latest projections are for growth to slow to 6.5 percent.

 18. The decline accelerated in the third quarter o f 2008-09, as the international crisis
worsened and investors withdrew funding massively to cope with liquidity shortages in
their home countries. Despite relief on the external current account from falling commodity
prices, there was a significant correction o f the earlier appreciation o f the Rupee (15 percent by
mid-November over the 2007 average). This helped in moderating some o f the loss o f
international reserves from the capital outflows, Domestic credit conditions tightened and the
money markets showed greater volatility, with spikes and wide swings in call rates and overnight
index spreads (Figures 5 and 6). There was a general deterioration in confidence, evidenced for
example by the decline in the consumer sentiment index (BACSI) in September and October.
Investment activity, which had been the engine of growth, shrank due to tight international credit
conditions, heightened uncertainty, and massive capital market declines.



                                                                            11
19. The slowdown in investment inevitably affected profitability, foreign borrowing and
liquidity. Corporate profitability, which had peaked in 2006Q4 and had been a major contributor
to India's growth, started to fall. At the same time, higher interest rates burdened the corporate
sector with rising debts. By 2007-08, India's corporate sector was funding a quarter o f i t s needs
from external sources, and another 10 percent from the issue o f domestic equity. Their
refinancing needs on foreign currency bonds and loans coming due in 2009 are the highest
among emerging market countries (about US$14 billion). Because o f this and other risks
associated normally with economic .downturns, corporate ratings have been d ~ w n g r a d e d .High
                                                                                                ~
profit growth and declining interest rates that had been providing ample liquidity to Indian f i r m s
have started declining. In effect, the interest coverage ratio (ICR)--defined as earnings before
interest and taxes over interest expenses, which measures the debt servicing capacity o f a firm-
went down sharply. Firms that cannot find additional sources o f funds are likely to delay interest
payments; if such delays persist, the loans to those companies will show up as non-performing
assets in the balance sheets o f banks.

foreign borrowing experienced a decline o f 34 percent. Funds from public issues, the issue o f
commercial paper, and accommodation by Indian financial institutions witnessed a sharp drop
compared to earlier years (Table 1). The decline in foreign funds was mitigated by a near-
tripling o f FDI flows, but other sources such as external commercial borrowing (ECB),
American and Global Depositary Receipts (ADWGDR), and short term credit dropped by 60
percent or more. Against this backdrop, the need to sustain domestic credit growth i s essential to
ensure long-term economic growth in India.

19. The macro-policy response of the authorities has been timely and broad-based,
including increases in Rupee and foreign exchange liquidity, a fiscal stimulus, and actions
in the trade and financial sector^.^ RBI changed i t s monetary policy stance once i t became
apparent that spillovers from the global crisis were likely to be worse than expected (Figure 7).
Subsequently, the Government introduced three policy packages in December 2008, and in
January and February 2009, including fiscal measures (see below). These packages aimed
specifically to increase liquidity in the financial market, encourage investment (particularly in
infrastructure), support consumer spending, and facilitate trade financing. RBI estimates that i t s
actions since mid-September 2008 have resulted in an increase in actual/potential liquidity o f Rs.
4.4 trillion (US$88 billion).

20. There was a deterioration in the central government fiscal balance for FY2008-09.'0
The general government fiscal deficit in FY2008-09 was 9.6 percent o f GDP compared to the
budget estimates o f 5.1 percent for the same year.'' Several factors are responsible for the
marked deterioration: (a) public salary increases awarded by the Sixth Pay Commission, and loan
waivers for farmers; (b) an increase in the subsidy bill because o f the surge in world commodity

   Annex 1 presents the details o f the financial sector measures, including regulatory forbearance.

    India's public debt i s estimated to have reached 76.0 percent o f GDP in 2008-09, o f which three-quarters was
 issued by the Central Government. The consolidated government budget deficit has averaged 6.9 percent of GDP
over the past five fiscal years, although along a declining path; in 2008-09 it rose sharply. The high deficit arose
from both Central and State Government operations, o f which two-thirds was due to the former. Together, the high
 debt and deficits reduce the room for fiscal maneuver. However, India's private savings rates has risen to 36 percent
o f GDP, and both its external balances and the terms, tenor and currency composition o f i t s debt suggest that the
   ublic debt i s more manageable than in other countries.
I Fiscal deficit numbers reflect the World Bank's definition. The Government treats divestment proceeds as
'
revenue, whereas the Bank definition excludes divestment from revenues.

prices in the early part o f 2008; and (c) a slowdown in revenue in line with the slowdown in
growth. As a result, central government revenue for FY2008-09 was about one percentage point
o f GDP lower than foreseen in the budget, while current expenditures expanded by 2.2 percent o f
GDP. However, capital spending declined from 2.3 percent in FY2007-08 to 1.5 percent in
FY2008-09. The widest measure o f fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficit-comprising the general
government, and off-budget o i l and fertilizer bonds issued to finance below-cost consumer prices
and public company losses-shows a pronounced deterioration in FY2008-09 to 12.9 percent o f
GDP, from 7.8 percent in the previous year.

21. Recognizing the slowdown, the government acted swiftly by announcing fiscal stimulus
measures. Three packages were launched in December 2008, January 2009, and end-February
2009. The fiscal stimulus packages contained revenue and expenditure measures with a net
expansionary impact o f about 3.5 percent o f GDP at the central level, and an additional one
percent o f GDP at the state level. The measures included additional public spending, particularly
capital expenditure, government guaranteed funds for infrastructure spending, cuts in indirect
taxes, expanded guarantee coverage for credit to micro and small enterprises, and additional
support to exporters. In addition, some o f the fiscal policy measures undertaken prior to the
onset o f the crisis will have a significant impact in FY2009- 10 and help boost aggregate demand.
These include the increase in public sector salaries, a countrywide extension o f coverage o f the
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), and higher minimum support prices
for farmers. Despite the stimulus packages, the fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficit in FY2009-10 i s
unlikely to reach the same level as in the previous year. With international commodity prices
projected to be substantially lower in FY2009-10, savings .on subsidies will likely allow the
deficit to remain below last year's level (see below).

22. The budget for 2009-10, announced in July, aims to minimize the impact o f the global
recession and achieve 8-9 percent economic growth in the medium term. I t expands
allocations for infrastructure, social sectors and agriculture, while containing minor changes on
the revenue side. The central government deficit i s projected to reach 6.8 percent o f GDP,
compared to 6.1 percent in 2008-09. The deficit limit for state governments was raised to 4
percent o f GDP, which follows the increase from 2.5 to 3.5 percent o f GDP that was permitted in
December 2008 (under the fiscal responsibility legislation). The overall deficit implied by the
budget i s therefore close to 11 percent o f GDP. The 2009-10 budget provides an additional
fiscal stimulus o f 1-1.5 percent o f GDP.

23. I n the near term, the global slowdown i s likely to continue, therefore, the ability of the
Government to deploy its macroeconomic instruments in a balanced and sustainable
manner i s critical. Maintaining liquidity, financial stability and credit growth during the
slowdown are essential elements for ensuring that Indian f i r m s continue to sharpen their
competitiveness and take advantage o f the global economic recovery, when it occurs. The
sectoral pattern o f growth since the third quarter o f 2008 shows that while exports and services
bore the brunt o f the adjustment to the external shock, the stimulus measures seem to have
contained the damage in areas to which they were directed and helped maintain a healthy, albeit
lower, growth in disposable incomes. Looking forward, barring a global slowdown that i s longer
than expected and a sharp decline in the growth rate o f agriculture (because o f the poor weather
seen across India recently), the World Bank's baseline scenario describes a path o f strong

recovery to the 8 percent growth rate achieved in recent years (Table 2 and Annex lo).`' This
would be led by domestic consumption, which has been stimulated partly by the Government's
counter-cyclical policies, and the maintenance and possible expansion o f domestic investment
growth, should credit conditions permit and capital flows return.13 With i t s l o w levels o f
external debt, ample reserves and limits o n the amount and end use o f foreign debt financing,
India's external position i s sustainable. However, uncertainties regarding both the global and
domestic economic and financial situations make it difficult to predict the path that other
macroeconomic variables are likely to take in the year ahead. While both World Bank and IMF
assessments conclude that the macroeconomic framework i s appropriate, Government i s keeping
a close watch on macroeconomic developments in view o f the uncertainties involved.

24. The main downside risk, although low, i s the sustainability o f the current fiscal stance.
World Bank simulations illustrate the importance o f high growth and lower interest rates for the
outlook for fiscal deficits and fiscal sustainability. Four simulations are presented in Table 3.
They include two growth scenarios: "high", with the GDP growth rate reverting to the mean o f
the past five years; and "low", with growth at 6.5 percent, the government projection for 2009-
10. They also present two policy scenarios. The first "good" scenarios i s one in which the
primary fiscal deficit i s reduced from the current 3.5 percent o f GDP to 1.5 percent and the
macroeconomic credibility and stability associated with this policy i s assumed to allow for a real
interest rate o f 2.5 percent. The "weak" policies scenario i s one where the primary deficit does
not adjust, and the real interest rate rises to 4.5 percent).




l2 Recent indicators of below average rainfall imply a more difficult environment for growth. With agriculture
growing at 4 percent, it contributes a l i t t l e less than one percentage point to the overall growth rate. However, a
severe drought like the one in 2003 could turn this into a drag on growth of an equivalent magnitude.
l3India's growth prospects and a strong economic recovery are likely to attract a higher volume o f capital inflows
from abroad than in other developing countries. This i s evidenced by the continued strength o f FDI inflows over the
past year, despite an overall global contraction o f such flows.

25. The scenarios demonstrate the importance o f growth and good policies with fiscal
adjustment as safeguards against unsustainable positions. India's recent economic history
demonstrates a strong capacity for adroit and effective macroeconomic management, with the
authorities moderating their policies to changing contexts. At the same time, the Government
has demonstrated an ability to push through steadily on key areas o f rolling reforms to address
the most binding constraints on growth. While the Government i s able to afford slightly slower
policy responses if the recovery accelerates for autonomous or external reasons, prudent
macroeconomic management dictates that it i s necessary to create adequate fiscal space for
further stimulus if it does not.

26. The determinants o f fiscal space go beyond those o f borrowing capacity. Gains from
improved expenditure efficiency and composition may dwarf those from increasing public sector
borrowing to finance government spending at the margin. Over the years, the committed
expenditure in the form o f pensions, wages and salaries and interest payments has been falling,
from an average o f 9.6 percent o f GDP to 9 percent. The Government has voiced the need for an
expansionary fiscal stance to combat the effects of the global crisis and restore economic growth,
so it i s unlikely that these categories o f spending will decline, especially at the State level.
However, the thrust o f the recent budget, with i t s emphasis on addressing some o f the key
constraints on economic growth-such            as weak physical infrastructure and availability o f
credit-provides grounds for optimism about the trajectory o f fiscal balances. Equally, the
Government's commitment to a credible path o f medium-term fiscal adjustment i s vital. As
indicated during the 2009-10 budget discussions, it intends to r e i n in the central government
budget to 5.5 percent in 2010-1 1 and to no more than 4 percent by 2011-12. In addition, it has
indicated i t s intention to overhaul the tax system with the introduction o f the Goods and Services
Tax, expected in 2010, and the adoption o f the medium-term fiscal responsibility targets for both
central and state governments by the Thirteenth Finance Commission.

27. India has a long history of financial sector development. After independence in 1947,
the Government's most significant objective for finance was to increase the spread and outreach
of the banking system. As in many countries, the desire to speed up the process, address market
failures and market dominance by a handful o f institutions, and increase the sector's contribution
to growth and poverty reduction led to an increased State role in the period 1960- 1990. Fourteen
banks were nationalized in 1969, and another six in 1980. Outreach did increase over this
period-the number o f bank branches rose dramatically from about 9000 in 1969 to 60,000 in
 1990. However, until the end o f the 1980s, India's banking sector remained closed and
controlled. The growth o f deposits and amount o f loans to the private sector were limited
because o f interest rate controls and regulations. Instead, banks channeled a large proportion o f
formal financial savings to agriculture and the public sector, at l o w cost. Nevertheless, the PSB
achieved their social objectives through targeted lending to designated priority sectors, such as
agriculture, micro-, small- and medium-enterprises, self-help groups, and targeted groups in
government-sponsored programs.
28. Since 1991, the Government has reformed India's banking and non-banking sector
significantly, as part of its new, market-based approach to development. Interest rates were
liberalized progressively and banks' required holdings o f public debt reduced, thereby lowering
the implicit taxation o f bank operations. Capital markets were deregulated and opened to
international flows, Private entry into banking and insurance increased the contestability o f the
domestic financial market, Important public sector financial institutions, such as I C I C I and
HDFC, were made private. All this put competitive pressure on the PSB. At the same time, RBI
carried out a phased introduction o f prudential norms o n capital adequacy, income recognition,
asset classification and provisioning to bring Indian banks in line with international practices,
and strengthened the corporate governance o f banks. A credit bureau was also established and
significant changes were made to improve the execution o f collateral. The RBI was strengthened
substantially, in both i t s monetary policy functions and i t s regulation o f the banking system, and
i s widely regarded as a credible, reputable and expert institution.

29. These reforms have proved to be very successful. India's banking sector today i s more
open and consists o f several profitable and growing domestic private sector and foreign banks, in
addition to the improved public sector banks that s t i l l account for about 70 percent o f the system
(Table 4). l4 Financial depth has increased substantially, and regulatory oversight and risk
management have been strengthened over the past decade. Outcomes on non-performing assets
and capital to risk weighted assets have improved significantly, and are good compared to
international benchmarks. Banks have experienced strong balance sheet growth, improved
financial health, increased competitiveness and productivity gains through adoption o f
technology, wider outreach, and larger allocations o f credit to important productive sectors.
Although the stock market (BSE Sensex) reacted negatively to the recent developments in the
global financial market and may give the appearance o f thinness, India's capital markets have in
fact deepened and matured over time, to become the largest market in developing countries,
relative to GDP (Table 5).15 This i s true in terms o f issues too-liquidity in the largest issues i s
on a par with developed countries (and with turnover ratios exceeding 100 percent).16 The size
o f the government bond market, at about 42 percent o f GDP, i s comparable to many other
emerging market economies. India's share o f financial assets to GDP, at around 170 percent, i s
higher than in middle-income countries such as Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil.

30. While some weaknesses remain, the Government has recognized them and i s moving to
address them. For example, the Government i s seeking ways to increase the ratio o f bank credit
to the private sector to GDP o f around 55 percent (December 2008), which i s l o w compared to
East Asian e c o n ~ m i e s . ' The RBI and the Government recognize the need to improve levels o f
                                 ~
access to finance by underserved segments. l8Based on major policy documents underpinning
recent reforms, the Government is implementing policies that aim to provide stability, effective
tools for managing liquidity, savings and investment, and promote financial inclusion. These are
described in greater detail in Annex 2: Medium Term Banking Policv Framework. Overall, i t i s


l4The 27 PSB constitute a declining but still dominant, share of the banking sector. As o f March 3 1, 2008, they
accounted for 70 percent of total assets, 74 percent o f aggregate deposits, and 85 percent o f the total bank branches
in India, spread across urban and rural India.
   Significantly higher than in emerging markets such as China or Mexico
16
   This i s comparable to mature markets, such as the U S (with a turnover ratio of 122%) and Germany (130%).
l7In China, Korea & Malaysia the ratio i s over 100%.
   These include small and medium enterprises, agricultural and rural households, urban poor and small account
holders, and the infrastructure sector.

                    B. REGULATORY      AND


31. A strong enabling framework has underpinned the development of India's banking
sector. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lies at the center o f the regulatory architecture.
For the small non-bank financial institutions in specific sectors, the RBI has delegated oversight
 power^.'^ Banking legislation i s extensive. The Banking Regulation A c t (1 949) governs overall
regulation o f the banking sector. Other key pieces o f legislation include the Banking Companies
(Acquisition and Transfer o f Undertakings) Act (1980), Legal Services Authority Act (1 987),
Securitization and Reconstruction o f Financial Assets and Enforcement o f Security Interest Act
(2002), Enforcement o f Security Interest and Recovery o f Debts Laws (Amendment) Act (2004),
and Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act (2005).

32. Accounting and auditing standards for commercial banks have been improved, and the
RBI and Government are systematically addressing weaknesses that remain. The recent
Financial Sector Assessment (see paragraphs 35-36 and Box 2), which drew extensively on the
report o f the Advisory Panel on Institutions and Market Structure and the Accounting and
Auditing ROSC report prepared by the World Bank in 2004, concluded that accounting and
disclosures and internal control and audit in commercial banks were largely compliant with
Base1 2 norms. The Assessment suggested the need for early adoption o f accounting standards
AS30 (recognition and measurement o f financial instruments) and AS3 1 (disclosures and
presentation o f financial instruments).20 The ROSC report stated that a significant proportion o f
the banks and other financial institutions sampled in 2003-2004 were unable to comply fully with
the requirements o f the Indian Accounting Standards on "related party transactions" and
"segment reporting". Further, disclosure with respect to "credit exposure for borrowings" was
found to be inadequate. Since then, and in line with developments in financial markets, RBI has
been updating and enforcing guidelines related to disclosures o f financial statements, prudential
norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning o f advances, and prudential
guidelines for the restructuring o f advances.21 Also, in line with the autonomy granted by the
Government to PSB in December 2005, RBI has rolled out a road map to encourage the PSB to
exercise this autonomy with respect to the appointment o f auditors. RBI intends to reduce i t s
role from directly appointing auditors to limiting i t s e l f to prior approval o f the auditors selected
by the PSB at the central levels. Moreover, from 2010-1 1, instead o f RBI providing an approved
l i s t o f f i r m s to the PSB, these banks will select the audit f i r m s for statutory audit purposes from
the panel o f all eligible firms prepared by the Office o f the Comptroller and Auditor General.


l 9 The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has oversight o f cooperative and rural
banks, the Small Industries Development Bank o f India (SIDBI, which also reports to the Ministry o f Small Scale
Industries), oversees state finance corporations. The National Housing Bank (NHB, which i s owned by the RBI), i s
responsible for housing finance companies.
2o The Institute o f Chartered Accountants o f India (ICAI) has decided that the implementation o f these standards
these will be recommendatory with respect to listed entities and other public interest entities from April 1, 2009 and
mandatory from April 1,20 11.

33. The standards o f banking sector corporate governance in India have improved over
the years. The RBI has issued comprehensive guidelines, related especially to the consistent
application o f prudential guidelines for all commercial banks-public, private and foreign. This
i s important to note, as there i s no actual conflict o f interest in Government's role as owner o f
banks and i t s relationship with the regulator. The RBI i s an independent regulator, applying the
same set o f regulations to all banks, irrespective o f their ownership, across the board.
Government ownership does not decrease i t s powers to regulate PSB, nor i s there any regulatory
forbearance exhibited by RBI towards these banks because o f government ownership. All banks
are subject to annual financial inspections, and findings are placed before the Board for Financial
Supervision. However, there are some government sponsored financial programs implemented
by the PSB, for which a part o f the cost, if any, i s borne by the Government. The Government,
as the owner o f the PSB, also conducts quarterly reviews o f their performance against the
Statement o f Intent (performance contracts) submitted by these banks.

34. Following a trend established since 1991, RBI set up three committees that have come
up with recommendations on improving corporate governance for both public and private
sector banks. The first, the Advisory Group on Corporate Governance (2001), was part o f an
effort undertaken by RBI to benchmark India's financial sector standards and codes to
international best practice. The second, the Advisory Group on Banking Supervision (2001),
conducted stress tests o f banks and provided recommendations on prudential thresholds,
management information systems and internal control mechanisms. The third, the Consultative
Group o f Directors o f BankdFinancial Institutions (2002), reviewed the supervisory role o f the
boards o f banks and financial institutions. The recommendations o f these groups were
particularly relevant to overall risk management and the treatment o f N P A by commercial banks
in India. More recently, the Planning Commission established the Committee on Financial
Sector Reforms (2008), which issued a report called the Raghuram Rajan report after i t s
Chairman, which provided recommendations in several areas, including improving the
governance o f the PSB. It observed that, if suitably compensated, all banks would be willing to
assume the social obligations currently managed by the PSB, hence the rationale for continued
government ownership o f banks i s weaker today. If privatization i s not an option, and the report
recognizes that under present conditions it i s not (e.g. selling large PSB to large private banks
raise issues o f concentration), several measures could be taken to improve governance. It
emphasized the need for stronger PSB boards, combined with reduced government oversight and
the exercise o f (a lower) government ownership share through the establishment o f bank holding
companies.

                                          Box 2: Financial Sector Assessments

     India was among the earliest participants in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) pilots that were
     initiated together with the World Bank and IMF in 2000-2001. The assessment identified developmental as well as
     stability issues. Progress has since been made on several of these: bank financing of the fiscal deficit,
     establishment o f credit bureaus and improved debt recovery procedures, strengthening regulation and supervision by
     clarifying and strengthening laws, rules and responsibilities, merging weak banks, implementing automated
     payments systems, speeding capital markets settlements procedures and reforming margins procedures and the Unit
     Trust, and improvingthe framework for development of pension programs and contractual savings.

     In 2002, India undertook a self-assessment of international financial standards and codes, and in 2005, following the
     publication of the World Bank-IMF Handbook on Financial Sector Assessment, the Government and RBI
     established a Committee on Financial Sector Assessment in September 2006. This self-assessment was released to
     the public on March 30,2009.

     The Self-Assessment i s comprehensive, candid, and insighthl. I t i s based on three, mutually reinforcing pillars-
     financial stability assessment and stress testing, institutional and legal infrastructure, and financial standards and
     codes. It a f f i s India's long-term potential for maintaining yearly economic growth at above 8 percent, but
     recognizes that some of the financial sector reforms to achieve this may have to be put on hold during the current
     global crisis. Using evaluations o f stability and stress tests, the Self-Assessment has found the banking system to be
     sound, although it identifies some liquidity risks in bank balance sheets and a need for capacity building, especially
     to strengthen risk management. Among other areas of the financial market that need to be reinforced, the report
     emphasizes better infrastructure for the payments and settlements, foreign exchange, money and corporate bond
     markets. I t recommends greater efficiency in the existing, sometimes overlapping, regulatory structure and the
     importance of filling gaps (e.g., the regulation of fmancial conglomerates). And it calls for an intensification of
     efforts underway to improve corporate governance, the insolvency regime, and transparency in the areas of fiscal,
     financial and monetary operations.



35. The regulatory oversight o f the markets has continued to improve in concrete ways,
with a focus on improving market integrity. India was among the first countries to undertake
a pilot FSAP in 2000-0 1 (Box 2). In addition, i t also undertook a comprehensive self-assessment
o f International Financial Standards and Codes during 2002, and a review in 2004. As a result o f
actions taken to follow up on such reviews, the financial infrastructure i s robust and can
adequately address a range o f issues including liquidity, accounting and auditing, payment and
settlements, and credit information. There has also been progress on other fronts, such as
depositor protection. The prudential supervisory framework functions well, and compliance by
the banking sector is high, including in core areas such as capital adequacy, income recognition,
asset classification, exposure limits, internal controls, accounting and audit standards,
provisioning for bad and doubtful debts, and credithnvestment concentration norms. In
particular, the countercyclical prudential norms put into place have helped smooth the
adjustment o f the financial sector to shocks.

36. The Government established a Committee on Financial Sector Assessment in
September 2006, which assessed progress in these areas, while pointing out weaknesses that
need addressing as part o f its long-term financial sector strategy. Its report, which was
released to the public, suggests that Indian banks are broadly compliant with Basel I1 Principles,
except in risk management areas, for which it recommends improvements.22 The S e l f

Assessment carried out an evaluation against OECD Principles for Co orate Governance, and
reported that banks fully or broadly implemented most o f the principles.          2
37. However, areas for improvement remain in the corporate governance o f the PSB.
Undoubtedly, there are variations among individual banks in terms o f financial transparency and
disclosure, management capabilities, and the composition and effectiveness o f their boards. A
common issue highlighted i s the effectiveness o f the boards o f the PSB. The Financial Sector
Assessment recommends that, as the Government controls the nomination o f directors, i t needs
to ensure their quality by adhering to the "fit and proper" criteria, not just in letter but in spirit
too. It recommends further flexibility in decision- making power, and it proposes introducing a
Corporate Governance Code for unlisted banks, which are outside the corporate governance
framework for listed companies. In the light o f recent global banking experience and the need to
contain liquidity and contagion risks, the Self Assessment gives special emphasis to integrated
risk management by all commercial banks operating in India, combined with cross-border
regulatory cooperation and information sharing. More broadly for the financial sector as a
whole, but with direct consequences for the operation o f banks, it points out the slowness o f
procedures for completing corporate bankruptcies, and recommends that they be addressed to
make the enforcement o f creditor rights and insolvency system effective, while strengthening
market efficiency, market integration, and confidence in contract enforcement.

                                        C. CONDITION INDIAN
                                                   OF    BANKS


38. India's banks are well capitalized, asset quality i s good, and they have recorded
impressive levels o f profitability (Table 6, and the sections below). The recently concluded
Financial Sector S e l f Assessment declares that the banking system i s robust and, over the last
decade or so, there has been a significant improvement in the financial performance and
condition o f banks in India. G r o w t h - e v e n in the financial year ended March 31, 2009-while
slower than last year, has been relatively strong, with credit expanding by over 17 percent and
deposits by around 20 percent.

39. Without exception, all banks are above the R B I ' s minimum capital adequacy level o f 9
percent. As o f March 31, 2009, the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR or capital

23
     See Table V.5, pp. 8 1, India's Financial Sector: A n Assessment, Volume I.

adequacy ratio) for the banking sector stood at 13.2 percent, and no banks had a CRAR o f less
than 10 percent. In general, banks took advantage o f good capital market conditions and
declining interest rates to make huge gains, using them to reduce the NPA overhang. The PSB
are somewhat restricted in their ability to raise capital from the markets, given the need to
maintain majority government ownership. However, they too have increased their capital over
the years through injections o f government funds, the reinvestment of profits, and, in some cases,
the sales o f shares in the equity markets while retaining the Government's majority ownership.
The Government, RBI and the World Bank, as well as analysts such as McKinsey, have carried
out stress tests and assessments o f bank capital under alternative scenarios (see Section V (B) for
a summary o f various simulation exercises). They reveal that current levels o f capitalization are
adequate, but that the banks will need capital support to sustain credit growth at reasonable levels
and/or as a precautionary shield. Indian banks have also brought down their non-performing
assets (NPA) substantially over the last decade. As o f March 31, 2009, gross NPA for the
banking sector stood at 2.33 percent, while net (of provisioning) NPA were 1.05 percent. While
NPA have shown only a marginal increase since September 2008, they may increase further due
to the economic crisis.

40. The Indian banking sector i s well Figure 8: Net Profitability o f Indian Banks, by
managed and efficient, and the cost                                      Bank GrouD
income ratio has fallen by 15.8
percentage points between 2000 and
2009. This improvement in performance
i s a reflection o f the quality o f
management prevalent in the banking
sector. The Government has set clear
objectives and targets for the PSB, as
illustrated in the annual Statements o f
Intent, and holds their top management
accountable for results. These efficiency
measures and good management practices
have resulted in credible profitability               Source: RBI "Report o f Trend and Progress o f Banking

increasingly profitable, as shown in Figure
8. Indeed, several balance sheet and profitability indicators suggest that it compares well with
global benchmarks. However, there are indications that the slowing economy i s likely to affect
profitability adversely in the wake o f deteriorating asset quality. Financial margins are under
increasing strain, and while banks are s t i l l profitable, the coming year i s likely to be challenging.

41. I n d i a n banks have largely stable sources o f funds, with deposits accounting for 78
percent o f total resources. The Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) o f 24 percent and the Cash
Reserve Ratio (CRR) o f 5 percent (as o f March 3 1, 2009) provide an additional cushion o f safety
for the banking system. While no immediate liquidity constraint i s envisaged, during the recent
turmoil, inter-bank money markets have experienced periods o f illiquidity. To assess the
banking sector's funding strategy and the consequent liquidity risk, a set o f liquidity ratios were
developed and analyzed in the Financial Sector Assessment (Table 7). The analysis shows that
there i s growing dependence on purchased liquidity (from 1.4 to 1.8 times core deposits between
March 2005 and September 2008), accompanied by an increase in the illiquid component o f
bank balance sheets (from 75 percent o f total assets to 86.5 percent), with greater reliance on
more volatile liabilities, such as bulk deposits, to fund asset growth. There i s a need to
strengthen liquidity management in this context, as also to shore up the core deposit base and
keep an adequate cushion o f liquid assets to meet unforeseen contingencies.

42. I t i s noteworthy that the PSB have comparable performance ratios to the private and
banks even while they maintain a focus on underserved segments-agriculture,      rural and
S M E finance, and infrastructure, and to smaller account holders. Indian banks have been


                                                           24
relatively insulated from the direct impacts o f the global financial crisis, given the proactive
measures taken by the RBI (Annex 4) and their minimal exposure to structured credit products in
      S
the U and other developed markets and to troubled international institutions. As o f March
2009, the PSB reported C U R averaging 12.34 percent, a net N P A ratio averaging 0.9 percent,
and return on assets (ROA) averaging 0.9 percent. The private sector banks reported a CRAR o f
15.1 percent, net N P A ratio o f 1.4 percent and R O A o f 1.1 percent (Table S).24

43. However, I n d i a n banks now face some important constraints. These arise, in part, from
any need to roll over foreign and domestic market funding, and in part from banks' exposure to
domestic sectors that are likely to face stresses as the economy slows. Credit-to-deposit ratios
are high (74 percent on average). Some new private sector banks have high credit to deposit
ratios but do not have the same level o f access to stable deposits as have the PSB. Although the
average Tier 1 capital ratio for Indian banks i s 8 percent, high by the standards currently found in
most other financial markets, there i s a higher proportion o f Tier 2 capital (containing mandatory
charges against future income) than 2-3 years ago, reflecting increases in hybrid debt instruments
and reserves from the revaluation o f fixed assets. As Tier 1 capital provides the main buffer for
asset side risks (common stock and retained earnings providing discretionary power to banks as
to the amount o f payouts), going forward banks will need to manage their capital market
borrowings more carefully to avoid higher borrowing costs and adequate capital.

44. Credit has tightened since October 2008. Spreads on foreign borrowing have widened
sharply in recent months (at one point up to 500-600 basis points for one year credit compared to
100-150 prior to the crisis) and short-term capital inflows have weakened considerably,
especially hurting the foreign and domestic private banks that had relied on these inflows more
than the public sector banks. Although there i s no firm evidence, bankers, analysts and the
media have reported that private banks have also seen some part o f their deposits shift to the
public sector banks (see Table 7 for aggregate changes in deposit growth). This i s likely to have
occurred late last year, during the initial panic in global financial markets about liquidity and the
safety o f financial savings. If so, it does not seem to be occurring now.

45. NPA are likely to increase as growth slows. Domestic and foreign private banks were
aggressive in lending to the best corporate customers (which included exporters) and real estate,
and to households for the purchase o f durables. These fast growth areas have come under
varying degrees o f pressure, and are likely to come under greater pressure if current conditions in
the real economy persist into the next year. One estimate o f the likely growth o f N P A in retail
sectors, where such banks have been active, suggests they could rise between 0.5 point and 4
percentage points during 2009.25 Despite these stresses, the fact that virtuallv no sizeable bank

24  The RBI requires a l l banks t o maintain a minimum CRAR o f 9 percent. Under the guidelines to comply with
Base1 2, a minimum Tier 1 CRAR o f 6 percent will be required. Banks were permitted t o raise Tier 2 capital, some
o f whose elements can rise t o a level equal to total Tier 1 capital. As raising Tier 1 capital i s more difficult, banks
have increased their Tier 2 capital, sometimes t o 40-50 percent o f their total capital. This exposes them to greater
refinancing risks o n bonds used for Tier 2 capital, and the likelihood o f an increase in the costs if interest rates are
unfavorable.

    Crisil estimates that gross NPA o n mortgage loans could rise from 2.2 percent in 2007 t o 2.7 percent in 2009.
For car loans, they estimate an increase from 2.3 percent t o 3 percent, for commercial vehicles from 4 t o 5.5 percent,
and for personal loans from 8 to 12 percent. Crisil, "Rising Interest Rates Expose Banks t o Credit Slowdown",

banking system.

46. But, assessments by the authorities suggest that demand for credit will remain strong
in crop finance, general agriculture and rural diversification, and infrastructure.
Moreover, due to changes in market conditions, demand for credit from the PSB has grown and
i s likely over the medium term to continue to increase for large corporate borrowers and in some
classes o f consumer loans (offsetting part o f the decline in real estate loans in the wake o f
weakness in that market). This will add to the need to provide working capital to creditworthy
enterprises experiencing a slowdown in foreign or domestic demand. Due to a combination o f
factors (sources o f funding, class o f customer, outreach, extent o f branches, etc.), the pattern o f
credit growth has varied substantially among the different types o f banks. However, credit
demand i s likely to be strongest for the PSB, who have, s6 far, filled the gap created by the sharp
drop o f f in private bank lending. A concern is that PSB will not have access to the capital to
support the loans needed to underpin even a lower growth rate, and to absorb future losses.


          IV. BANK GROUP SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                                      A. LINKS THE CAS
                                             TO


47. The proposed operation i s closely linked and essential to the achievement of the
objectives of the first pillar of the Country Strategy for India (FY2009-2012). The World
Bank supports the achievement o f rapid, inclusive growth in India through a cooperative
program o f diagnostic and advisory studies, and policy-based, investment and TA operations that
address both cyclical and structural factors. Buttressing macroeconomic, fiscal and financial
stability at both the central and state levels i s a key focus o f the CAS. Moreover, the CAS
recognizes that recent global developments pose important challenges to the achievement o f the
Eleventh Plan goals, but also opportunities for the World Bank and other development partners
to come up with creative solutions in a timely manner and to scale up funding support (paragraph
73 o f the CAS). The CAS flagged the opportunities to expand development policy lending
beyond the identified projects and their extension to the national level (that is, beyond the state-
level D P L that have characterized the India program).

48. IBRD exposure to India i s approaching the Single Borrower Limit (SBL), which i s
currently set at US$15.5 billion. At the end o f 2008 exposure was US$7.4 billion. At the
December 2008 discussion o f the Country Strategy for India (covering FY09-12), Directors
supported the financial envelope proposed in the CAS, which foresaw US$9.6 billion in IBRD
commitments for FY09-11, including US$3 billion o f the US$5.4 billion in crisis-related lending
requested by the Government o f India. Responding to the full request o f the Government,
coupled with planned IBRD lending in the CAS, would carry projected exposure over the current
SBL by FY13. An operation that would bring projected exposure above the prevailing SBL
cannot be presented to the Board for approval. To bring IBRD exposure in line with the SBL
and, at the same time, implement lending as planned in the CAS beyond FYlO would require
exposure management through a possible increase in the SBL or prepayments or the purchase o f

special private placement IBRD bonds by India. The latter two options are under active
discussion between GO1 and the World Bank.

                        B. RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS

49. The CAS lending program has supported the development o f the financial sector with
an emphasis o n access to finance. The CAS did not directly address the unexpected crisis or
the impact on India, but indirectly covers such events. As India moves to take precautionary
steps to combat the effects o f the global financial crisis, a number o f operations anticipated
within the CAS have been approved or are underway which will support the response o f the
authorities and complement this proposed First Banking Sector Support Loan o f US$2 billion
equivalent. Among the operations in this envelope are:

       Additional financing to the Small Industries Development Bank o f India (SIDBI) o f
       US$400 million (higher than the initially proposed amount o f US$200 million) to
       facilitate an increased flow o f working capital and t e r m lending to India's SME sector
       and thereby complement the Government's and SIDBI's efforts to buffer bank capital to
       maintain credit growth. This loan was approved by the Board in April 2009.
       A financial intermediary loan o f US$1.2 billion to the India Infrastructure Finance
       Company Limited (IIFCL), a flagship initiative o f the Government which supplements
       bank credit going into funding PPP in infrastructure, which i s widely recognized as the
       major bottleneck to the acceleration o f growth in India. The objective o f the proposed
       World Bank loan i s to increase the availability o f long-term financing for infrastructure
       PPP projects in India. This will be achieved through supporting the I I F C L in i t s role to
       catalyze private financing for infrastructure PPPs and stimulate the development o f a
       long-term local currency debt financing market for infrastructure in India. This loan i s
       scheduled to go to the Board in September 2009.
       A proposed financial intermediary loan o f US$300 million to support the Government's
       and SIDBI's efforts to provide liquidity to microfinance institutions and improve access
       to finance for the underserved through scaling-up sustainable models o f microfinance.
       This would help contribute to household asset creation and sustainable income
       generation, poverty reduction, and growth. This loan i s currently scheduled to go to
       Board in FY 2010.
       A proposed US$18 million operation for capital markets and pensions to broaden and
       deepen the markets. This loan i s currently scheduled to go to Board in FY 2010.

       In addition, prior to current events, an investment loan o f US$600 million through the
       Government to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)
       for strengthening India's rural credit cooperatives was approved. The loan supported the
       Government's assistance package designed to assist in providing members o f Primary
       Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies, including small and marginal farmers, with
       significantly enhanced access to formal finance (credit, savings, etc.), by ensuring that
       potentially viable entities are transformed into efficient and commercially sustainable
       institutions. This loan was approved by the Board in June 2007.

50. The programs of IBRD-IDA and the IFC are complementary. As o f June 30, 2009,
IFC's outstanding balance in i t s India portfolio consisted o f US$468.6 million in equity
investment and U S 1 . 5 billion in loans. The financial sector i s an important component o f IFC's
portfolio. Investments in the financial sector account for 26 percent o f the total committed
portfolio. The financial sector committed portfolio o f $8 19 million (including IFC investments
in funds) i s split 53:47 percent between debt (including Upper Tier Capital) and equity. IFC's
financial sector strategy in India aims to encourage growth in the market share o f private sector
banks and contribute to financial policies which foster inclusive growth, increased banking
penetration, development o f local financial markets, and stability at the national and regional
levels (including in the aftermath o f the global financial crisis).

5 1. IFC has responded to the impact of global crisis on India's financial sector by:

       Organizing Risk Management workshops to foster dialogue and encourage financial
       institutions to adopt best practices
       Working closely with client companies to adapt and respond to the new economic
       environment
       Providing advisory services in key areas such as corporate governance, loan portfolio
       workout, and risk management
       Continuing to commit new financial market investments (an estimated 5 projects by end
       FY09)
       Continuing to disburse o n existing financial market commitments in a difficult market
       environment.
       Leveraging i t s unique position to bring additional financing while remaining within
       existing country exposure limits. This will include making effective use o f IFC's global
       crisis response facilities (especially the Microfinance Enhancement Facility), working
       with other DFIs, and mobilizing as much funding as possible.


                              V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                          A. RATIONALE

52. The objective of the proposed operation i s to provide support to the Government to
enable it to maintain its economic stimulus program to contain the effects of the global
crisis. An important component o f the broader stimulus and recovery program i s the provision
o f capital support to public sector banks. This will help to maintain confidence in the banking
sector, prevent a slowdown in credit growth that could result from shortages o f capital, and will
provide a capital buffer to absorb the possible increase in N P A resulting from the global
financial crisis. In turn, this will help all banks (both public and private) maintain their portfolio
quality. Such funding support would complement the Government's macroeconomic policy
stimulus and other measures taken to minimize the impact o f the global crisis on the Indian
economy. The additional capital buffers will serve as a precautionary shield to absorb losses,
which could become crucial in the context o f the ongoing global economic slowdown. The
Government's provision o f more capital to banks cannot guarantee they will increase lending, as
seen in the United States and United Kingdom. However, recent credit growth trends, financial


                                                 28
deepening, and the continued lack o f access to external borrowing by the large corporate
borrowers make it likely that this i s not the situation faced by Indian public sector banks. In
addition, the annual targets set for the PSB in performance contracts ("Statements o f Intent on
Annual Goals") with the MOF, and the governance and supervision frameworks in use today
make i t more likely that these banks will maintain the growth o f lending. It i s worth noting that
India's reaction to the crisis so far shows two major differences compared, for example, to the
United States. These are (a) a lack o f central bank involvement in direct lending to the private
sector (the RBI has l e f t credit decisions to public and private banks), and (b) the PSB
maintaining credit growth at levels that, so far, are supporting economic activity.

53. While India's banking sector had little exposure to the sub-prime mortgage assets o r
the large troubled financial institutions o f the developed financial markets, it has felt the
impact. Table 9 shows early and continuing indications o f strains. I t shows the pattern o f
liquidity stresses in the economy, falling yields on government securities, widening differences
between the price o f AAA corporate bonds and equivalent maturity government securities (from
130 basis points in July 2008 to nearly 300 basis points in December 2008), reduced market
transaction levels, and a collapse in equity valuations. Lately, some o f the effects have been
muted by RBI's actions and its ability to maintain confidence in the financial market.
Nevertheless, it i s evident that financial market conditions are s t i l l unsettled and likely to remain
so in the period ahead.



                                                                29
54. India's corporate sector, which had relied heavily on foreign financing that suddenly
was n o longer available, was the first to feel the liquidity stresses in the financial markets.
This resulted in a shift to the domestic banking sector to fill funding needs. This substitution in
their sources of funding put pressure on the domestic money and credit markets. At the same
time, the foreign exchange market also came under pressure, just as corporate entities needed
foreign currency to meet their external obligations. Financing and substitute financing needs o f
corporate borrowers will remain high over the near term. The entry into the domestic borrowing
market o f the larger corporate enterprises, who had been borrowing abroad, has put pressure on
local small and medium businesses and made borrowing domestically more difficult for them. In
addition, banks have become more risk averse at the same time as demands on their limited
resources for lending have risen, in an environment characterized by a worldwide increase in
demand for liquidity.

55. Notwithstanding the strong performance o f the Indian economy over the past few
years, the global financial crisis has resulted in a slowdown in the real sectors. There i s a
risk that, despite the banks' strong capital positions and recent performance, credit could also
slow sharply. There are visible signs o f adverse impacts on real sectors, acting chiefly through
the reduction o f available credit and lower demand. These factors could spill over to the banking
sector through an increase in NPA, thus potentially affecting the financial sector's strength.
However, the effect on the real sector now goes beyond credit, as pointed out in a recent
McKinsey analysis. I t suggests that 10 sectors, contributing 33 percent o f GDP and receiving 41
percent o f total bank credit, are facing falling demand and pressure on prices and urgently need
working capital to fund projects that have already started.

56. Despite proactive measures, there has been a slowdown in overall bank credit growth
since the last quarter o f 2008, even though it remained positive as the PSB increased credit,
offsetting the fall in credit growth at the private banks (Table 10). The private banks' credit
pullback reflects the decline in their resources, global risk management by banks such as HSBC,
and their generally higher risk aversion. The increased risk aversion stems from uncertainty,
expectations o f falling demand in the economy and, consequently, lower profitability o f
enterprises which, in turn, could potentially result in increases in non-performing loans for the
banking sector. Borrower difficulties may increase, especially as related to real estate loans and
retail loans to households to finance durables, but also to some extent with loans extended to


                                                   30
SME. Had the PSB not expanded and exhibited the same lending behavior as the private banks,
it i s estimated that the stock o f credit outstanding would have been lower by about 40 percent
(that is, about US$47 billion equivalent, rather than US$79 billion). Credit growth would have
fallen even more sharply in the economy, but for the PSB, which increased loan growth.
Nonetheless, as noted above, many important sectors o f the economy suffer from a shortage o f
credit funding-SME, real estate, the textile industry and exporters, to name a few. The stimulus
expected from the easing o f monetary policy has not yet materialized, as i s the case in industrial
countries too.

57. The sectoral distribution o f non-food credit also reflects the ability o f the PSB to
continue supporting economic activity, which draws upon strong deposit growth, extensive
branch banking network, past profitability, and adequate capital. As seen in Table 11, the
reduction in private and foreign bank lending was sharpest in industry, housing, and other retail
loans, which together account for close to 60 percent o f the total credit outstanding. When all
credit i s considered-food crop finance as well as non-food-it i s evident that the PSB offset the
withdrawal o f private and foreign banks from these critical sectors, at the same time as
expanding the amount o f credit going to agriculture by 21.5 percent (compared to a growth rate
o f 16.4 percent in the previous year). This has been the main factor preventing a credit crunch in
the wake o f the global financial crisis.

58. SME represent a particularly vulnerable group. Sustaining economic growth while
making it more inclusive will require a sharp step up in industrial and services growth, spurred
by small and medium industries, which have the greatest potential to provide employment for the
two-thirds o f the labor force still working in agriculture. India has 13 million SME in the
manufacturing and services sector, which are facing tight credit conditions today. Including the
SME retail sector brings the count to around 30 million firms. The latest RBI statistics show that
the year-on-year growth rate o f bank credit to SME fell sharply, even as the overall y-y growth
rate o f bank credit to industry (including large corporations) increased from 24.9 percent to 30.2
percent. The SME are feeling the effects o f the credit crunch in two ways. First, until recently,
large f i r m s have had access to financing through both the capital markets and the banks. Since



                                                          31
the decline in the capital market and the related reduction in liquidity, large f i r m s have resorted
relatively more to bank lending. Essentially, this offers banks a new l i n e o f business that i s
sometimes more lucrative than lending to SME. Second, S M E in India are typically o f three
types: (i)r m s supplying larger f i r m s as part o f the supply chain (business to business, or B2B),
            fi
(ii)i r m s producing goods and services for final consumption (business to consumer, or B2C),
    f
and (iii)  start-up entrepreneurs. Although the second group has not, as yet, seen a significant
slowdown, as India's growth has slowed but i s s t i l l respectable and consumption growth remains
robust, the first group i s facing problems o f reduced orders, increased inventories and, thus,
higher working capital requirements as a result o f the global downturn. These SME have not yet
experienced big decreases in profits (since input prices have gone down). Nevertheless, their
access to funding has been constrained, which i s affecting their ability to invest in capital goods,
environmentally friendly technologies, and job creation. The capital support being provided by
the Government as a result o f this loan, in combination with the financing to the Small Industries
Development Bank o f India, should help to alleviate some o f the financing difficulties o f SMEs.

59. Current levels o f bank capitalization and asset quality can protect against a more
severe economic slowdown, but cannot fully offset the effects of the global crisis. The strong
capital position o f Indian banks indicates that, initially, they will be able to absorb significant
losses on their loan portfolios. The banks are solvent, and without exception above the R B I ' s
minimum capital adequacy level o f 9 percent. As o f March 31, 2009, no bank had a C U R o f
less than 10 percent. However, corporate distress and declining economic activity levels will
raise banking sector NPA. Indian banks will need to maintain high capital ratios to avoid any
concerns on the part o f the public regarding the strength o f the banks, and to underpin loan
growth. With stock prices depressed, banks face difficulties in raising funds from the capital
market. With the finances o f the Government stretched, the absence o f this capital i s likely to be
a very important constraint on credit growth and on India's ability to weather the economic
slowdown.

60. India's medium-term vision for the development of its banking sector i s evolving. The
Government has provided a strategy note (Annex 2) that details recent policy developments and
the direction o f future banking development. It emphasizes the strong relationship that exists
between banking services and real economic growth, especially in the current context o f an
economic slowdown. The Government recognizes the vital role played by India's PSB in
supporting growth and financial inclusion, and does not foresee disinvestment in them in the
immediate future beyond the legally mandated thresholds o f 51 percent o f government
ownership. However, the Government views consolidation o f the PSB to be a timely response
for raising efficiency through the better management o f risks, leveraging economies o f scale, and
an improved ability to face competition. It expects, however, that the initiative for consolidation
should come from the management o f the individual PSB, with the Government playing a
supportive role as a common shareholder. Further, while supporting merger proposals, the
Government intends to keep in view the interest o f the shareholders and employees o f the
merging banks.
61. I n addition to maintaining credi,t growth, the Government identifies financial stability
and a reduction in lending interest rates as two important challenges during this period. It
has emphasized that, despite the need to adjust to the effects o f the global financial crisis, the
medium-term banking sector development program remains on track. The Government has
noted, however, that the current policy and procedures governing the presence o f foreign banks


                                                 32
in India will remain unchanged, given their general withdrawal from lending in most emerging
markets, including India, and the absence o f an agreed regulatory and supervisory architecture
for such banks around the world. Other priorities identified in the Government's strategy are the
containment o f operating expenses, better risk management by banks, introducing technology,
improved governance and removing bottlenecks in the credit delivery mechanism for
agriculture/rural/SME sectors. With the exception o f the last o f these, this and the next D P L
include actions that address these priorities through prior actions and triggers. However, several
o f the other operations identified in paragraph 49, which complement the two proposed DPL,
address issues o f service delivery to specific market groups.

                               B. PRIOR

62. The institutional and policy development o f the Indian banking system remains on a
steady path. As described in the Government's strategy document in Annex 2, this has resulted
in steadily broadening financial inclusion and the diversity o f banking instruments, and
strengthening banks while helping establish more competitive markets and maintaining financial
stability. A number o f additional measures have been completed by the authorities recently,
following up on the recommendations o f several task forces (see paragraphs 34-36) and policy
initiatives to cope with the external shock. Additional details on the responses to the recent crisis
are contained in Annex 4: Recent Financial Sector Policv Initiatives. Together they represent a
comprehensive response to recent developments embedded within the Government's stated
medium-termbanking and financial sector strategy.

63. The Government has maintained an adequate macroeconomic policy framework. The
key element i s fiscal sustainability, with control o f the government budget deficit to ensure
medium-term alignment with the Government's fiscal responsibility framework. The central
government budget deficit for 2009-10 i s projected to reach 6.8 percent o f GDP, up from 6.1
percent in 2008-09. For general government, the comparable numbers are 11 percent and 9.6
percent, respectively. During the July 2009 presentation o f i t s budget for 2009-10, the
Government stated i t s intention to reduce the central government deficit to 5.5 percent o f GDP
during 2010-1 1, and further to 4 percent during 201 1-12. RBI has announced that monetary
policy i s likely to remain accommodative until there are robust signs o f recovery, and that i t
would reverse expansionary measures in time to anchor inflationary expectations. The wholesale
price index shows a decline in inflation from 5.4 to 2 percent. However, due to adverse rainfall
concerns there i s uncertainty about food prices, which have started rising, which i s likely to put
upward pressure on the consumer price index. The current account deficit for 2009-2010 i s
projected to decline to below one percent o f GDP, from 2.6 percent last year, mainly from a
sharp fall in imports. Foreign exchange reserves have increased slightly, and the Rupee i s stable.

       The Government o India has executed Statements o Intent with each o its PSB. The
                       f                               f                    f

       (SOI-Statements o f Intent on Annual Goals). SO1 are agreed between the Government
       and each PSB. They contain a number o f quantitative criteria, including an appropriate
       increase in gross credit that each bank i s expected to achieve during a fiscal year and an
       indicative level o f NPA for each such bank. The process for 2009- 10 was completed in
       July, 2009. The SO1 for 2009-10 indicate that credit growth for the PSB as a whole
       would be around 20 percent. SO1 are reviewed every quarter and may be revised as
       required. The quality o f credit i s also supervised by RBI, which regulates PSB on an
       equal footing with private banks. The gross NPA levels have been brought down to
       around 2 percent.

Overall financial sector actions

       The Government o India and the Reserve Bank o India have prepared a comprehensive
                          f                              f
       Financial Sector Assessment and publicly released this document. The six-volume
       Assessment, conducted jointly by the Government o f India and the Reserve Bank o f
       India, consists o f a financial stability and stress testing component, and components
       related to the institutional and legal infrastructure and an assessment o f financial
       standards and codes. It was released to the public on March 30,2009.

        The Reserve Bank o India has taken necessary measures to improve the supervision o
                             f                                                                  f
        all Scheduled Commercial Banks, including (i) improving arrangements and procedures
       for on-site supervision; (ii) requiring Public Sector Banks to ensure that certain
        important returns are filed on-line; and implementing the use o early warning systems
                                                                         f
       for banking distress. RBI employs a supervisory approach that i s a combination o f an on-
        site-inspection system with an off-site surveillance system. In August 2008, RBI moved
        to an Online Returns Filing System (ORFS) for submission o f certain important returns
        by banks. The returns to be filed under Base1 IIrelated guidelines would also be
        implemented on ORFS. RBI also initiated an exercise for the rationalization o f returns,
        with the number o f returns to be submitted by banks reduced from 291 to 223.

       The Reserve Bank o India has taken necessary actions to proactively manage liquidity as
                            f
       a response to the financial crisis by reducing policy rates and reserve ratios and creating
       temporary, special purpose refinance facilities. Actions since mid-September 2008 are
       estimated to have resulted in an increase in actual/potential liquidity o f approximately
       US$%?   billion. The cash reserve ratio requirement was reduced by 400 basis points, and
       the statutory liquidity ratio was reduced from 25 percent to 24 percent. Between October
       2008 and April 2009, the rep0 rate was reduced from 9.0 percent to 4.75 percent, and the
       reverse rep0 rate was reduced by 275 basis points to 3.25 percent.          Several special
       purpose vehicles and liquidity facilities were established after September 2008-for
       banks to access additional liquidity support, foreign exchange requirements o f oil
       marketing companies, export credit finance, small industry and housing finance, foreign
       exchange swap facilities for banks with overseas branches, and other areas.

Banking sector actions

Strengthen prudential norms:

                            f
       The Reserve Bank o India has taken necessary actions to strengthen prudential norms
      for the banking sector, including, among others: (i) issuing prudential guidelines
       regarding capital adequacy pursuant to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's
        "International Convergence o Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised
                                       f
       Framework"; (ii) adopting prudential norms on off-balance sheet exposures for
       Scheduled Commercial Banks; and (iii) strengthening prudential norms for valuation,
       classification, and operation o commercial banks ' investment portfolios. Updated
                                         f
       guidelines were issued in July 2008 requiring all banks to migrate to the Revised
       Framework o n March 3 1, 2009, with the requirement to maintain a minimum C R A R o f 9
       percent. New guidelines on prudential norms for off-balance sheet items were issued in
       August 2008, These included directives o n provisioning norms for derivative exposures
       and on computation o f credit exposure on account o f derivatives. The norms for
       valuation, classification and investment portfolios were updated and issued in July 2008,
       and covered issues such as internal controls and accounting.

Improve risk management:

       The Reserve Bank o India has issued revised guidelines to govern credit made available
                           f
       by Scheduled Commercial Banks to individual and group borrowers and for capital
       market transactions. In July 2008, RBI issued an updated circular related to exposure
       norms. The circular focused on promoting better risk management and avoiding the
       concentration o f credit risk. It provides limits on exposures to individual and group
       borrowers and capital markets. Some relaxation in risk weights to exposures in selected
       sectors, such as real estate, was allowed in November 2008 as a counter-cyclical measure.

Improve governance:

                                                                           f
       The Government o India, in coordination with the Reserve Bank o India, has ensured
                           f
                       f
       that elections o directors to Public Sector Banks were in compliance with the Reserve
       Bank o India's `Pt and proper" criteria for such elections. The Financial Sector
              f
       Assessment re-emphasized in March 2009 the need for implementing "fit and proper"
       guidelines issued in 2008, in both letter and spirit, and increasing professional
       representation o n Boards. Banks have initiated measures as the terms o f directors expired
       and, in the few cases where gaps were evident, ensured increasingly professional boards.

                                   c.   SCENARIOS AND INSTRUMENTS


66. Increased capital will be needed by several PSB for a variety o f reasons. Foremost
among these i s to enable PSB to continue to meet the expected demand for credit. All PSB have
now migrated to Basel 2 norms, and the Government program aims to ensure that all PSB have a
C R A R o f at least 12 percent (which i s 3 percentage points above the mandatory Basel 2
guidelines adopted by the authorities) by March 3 1, 20 11. Moreover, within this aggregate, the
program targets Tier 1 CRAR at a healthy level o f at least 8 percent. In addition, banks are
concerned about rising delinquencies in some market segments-arising, for example, from
higher receivables and inventories in SME and mid-sized corporate, the reluctance or inability o f
some farmers to pay o f f their balances under the agricultural loan waiver scheme, and weak cash
flows o f over-leveraged large corporate borrowers. Some additional capital will also be required
for agreed salary revisions and pensions, branch expansion and the adoption o f new technology.

67. The Government ha,s requested a program o f about US$3 billion o f budgetary support
from the World Bank for i t s stimulus program, which i s equivalent to more than half o f the
estimated requirements for a banking support program that would facilitate continued credit
growth, high capital, and no loss o f confidence during the crisis, while the PSB continue to be
well provisioned. The Government has provided an indicative l i s t o f PSB which are in line for



                                                 36
Tier 1 capital support under i t s program. The specific capital arrangements (amounts and timing)
required for each PSB will vary, based on the budgetary situation, the share o f Government
ownership, retained earnings, relative strength in the equity markets, growth plans and overall
headroom with regard to other capital sources-innovative perpetual debt instruments, perpetual
non-cumulative preference shares, hybrid debt capital instruments, preference shares,
subordinated bonds, etc. The Government program will provide Tier 1 capital to the PSB out o f
i t s budget via cash, which would increase the lending limits `of the banks, making additional
funds available immediately for on-lending.         This i s aimed at meeting all or part o f the
requirements for Tier 1 capital, while at the same time encouraging the PSB to raise capital, if
possible, through other means if and when market conditions permit.

68. Based on March 2009 baseline data, the Government estimates the total capital
shortfall for the PSB to be R 22,489 crore (US$4.8 billion) by 2011, and the Tier 1 capital
                               s
shortfall to be R 18,483 crore (US$3.9 billion), The Government has requested Rs 14,100
                   s
crore (US$3.0 billion) o f budgetary support from the World Bank. It i s proposed that this
amount be split across two loans o f US$2 billion and US$1 billion respectively. The
Government intends to provide budgetary funds to the PSB as Tier 1 capital. . In addition, it
proposes to infuse approximately Rs 2,000 crore (US$425 million) into the PSB as Tier 1 capital.
The Government estimates that the remainder o f the Tier 1 capital shortfall o f US$0.5 billion, as
well as the Tier 2 capital shortfall o f US$0.9 billion, could come from the market and other
innovative funding sources in the outer years. This i s likely to take place through the PSB using
headroom in Tier Iand Tier I1 capital to raise the balance, while complying with the 51 percent
government ownership requirement. The l i s t o f PSB eligible for capital support, as well as the
amounts and timing o f capital infusion into each PSB, might change over time depending on
dynamic internal and external factors. The Government will modify i t s program accordingly, but
changes in capital requirements are likely to be small, given that there i s greater certainty about
the near t e r m needs, which constitute the bulk o f the capital injection. This form o f capital
buffering would be a significantly stronger support for commercial bank lending than if the
Government provided additional capital in the form o f non-tradable bonds.

69. World Bank support to the Government's budget, while only a small sum in relation to
total development and stimulus needs and the size o f the financial market, has the added
advantage o f not displacing other borrowers in the capital market, which could occur if        the
Government floated bonds to provide capital to the banks. In addition, the World Bank's loan
would be a strong signal o f support to the economy and, specifically, to the banking sector.
Although the operation i s being delivered in the context o f a growing economy and a sound
banking sector-it i s not a financial crisis loan-it i s dealing with some o f the fallout from the
global financial crisis, therefore the proposed operation i s being fast-trackedi Maintaining credit
growth against the backdrop o f a slowing economy could mean that N P A rise. This risk will
need to be mitigated through appropriate allocation o f credit to sectors that are viable (as the
banking sector has ably done since the early 1990s) as well as through continued close
supervision by the RBI to ensure that the gains from high credit growth are not annulled by an
excessive concomitant increase in NPA.

70. Government and RBI forecasts regarding the capital requirements o f the PSB are
broadly in line with World Bank estimates. As mentioned earlier, while the level o f



                                                37
capitalization o f Indian banks i s high and the current C R A R levels are adequate for the near
future, they will need additional capital support to sustain credit growth and have capital buffers
as a precautionary shield against adverse financial and real sector contingencies. Two sets o f
simulation and scenario exercises, with baseline data as o f March 3 1, 2009 to estimate the capital
requirement o f Indian banks, have been carried out by the Government and RBI and developed
further by the World Bank team. These are summarized below, with details in Annex 5 .

71. Simulation Exercise 1: Building upon the estimates o f capital requirements by the
Department o f Financial Services o f the Ministry o f Finance (MOF), World Bank staff undertook
multiple simulation exercises for the future under slightly varying assumptions.26 Table 12
summarizes the results for the PSB that are likely to participate in the program because o f Tier 1
capital needs. While these scenarios are indicative, the key finding i s that the Government's
estimates o f the shortfall in capital for PSB, in order to reach a C R A R level o f 12 percent and a
Tier 1 CRAR o f 8 percent, are o f a similar order o f magnitude as the team's simulation exercises,
as shown in Scenario 2 (base case). The results reflect the fact that a significant proportion o f
the capital needs are on account o f the problems in raising capital to sustain credit growth. This
i s in the context o f a financial environment affected by the global crisis, where capital valuations
are unattractive and capital markets difficult to access.27

72. Simulation Exercise 2: T o evaluate the impact o f likely growth in NPA, the Financial
Sector Assessment o f the authorities stress tested for credit risk in M a r c h and September

26
   Key government assumptions include: Profits o f PSB in 2010 and 201 1 remain at 2009 levels, provisions on
standard assets remain at 2009 levels, risk weighted assets grow at 20 percent each year, and until 2010 some banks
would not be able to access capital markets for raising equity capital by diluting government equity. Key World
Bank simulation assumptions include: Risk weighted assets (proxy for growth in advances) increase yearly by 12, 17
or 25 percent, Gross NPA rise by varying amounts (from 30 percent to 150 percent) in different scenarios, and a
provisioning rate of 50 percent has been applied to the overall NPA amount to estimate the provisioning amount.
27
   An analysis o f five large private sector banks under Simulation Exercise 2 shows that, cumulatively, they require
no additional capital to meet the 12 percent CRAR and the 8 percent Tier 1 CRAR levels. The overall CRAR o f the
five banks in 201 1 would be a very healthy 13.53 percent.

2008. The Financial Sector Assessment undertook a single factor-stress test o f all classes o f
banks in the Indian banking system. I t focused on an estimation o f capital requirements in a
situation where N P A levels rise. It assumed that, instead o f the actual N P A ratio at end-March
and end-September 2008, it would be higher by 100 percent and 150 percent on those dates. The
World Bank team built o n this, and undertook an identical estimation for March 2009, that is, b y
assuming that the N P A ratio at end-March 2009 was 100 percent and 150 percent higher than the
actual level on that date. Annex 5 presents the details o f the methodology and assumptions.
Table 13 summarizes the results o f this static, stock model calculation for various groups o f
banks. They show that, even under significant stress (150 percent increase in NPA), private
banks do not experience a reduction in their C R A R below 12 percent. This i s in contrast to
public sector banks, which are likely to face an immediate reduction in their C R A R to below 12
percent even in a situation where N P A increase by a lower level o f 100 percent. Since the
baseline data are for March 2009, they incorporate to some extent the effect o f RBI forbearance
on N P A and provisioning, and the effects o f other restructuring measures resulting from the
various forbearance measures initiated since August 2008.

                                 A.   POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT


73. The proposed operation-by helping maintain a stable macroeconomic framework and
enabling commercial banks to maintain credit growth in support o f economic activity,
employment and poverty reduction [Prior Actions 1,2]-will mute the effect o f the current
economic slowdown on vulnerable groups, as well as permit the PSB to continue deepening
programs for greater financial inclusion. The recent experience o f several countries such as
the United States and United Kingdom, the lessons o f Japan in the "lost decade", and the Asian
Crisis o f 1996-98 show both banking system imprudence and instability as well as a credit
crunch can have seriously deleterious and long-lasting effects on glJ economic activity and
investment. It can magnify greatly the effects o f economic slowdowns that emanate from the
real side, mainly by transmitting financial distress throughout the economy and undermining
confidence in the payments system. The effects o f credit cutbacks can be even more adverse in
India than in other countries because India's banks play a direct role in the achievement o f a
wide range o f national objectives directed at l o w income and vulnerable groups. Targeted
lending has proven to be very effective in alleviating poverty in India. The Government intends
to provide funds out o f i t s budget to the banks so that a lack o f capital does not cause them to cut
back on existing priority and general lending programs or on new lending to viable
proj ects/proposals, while exercising the degree o f prudence required to retain public confidence


                                                  39
in banking and the viability o f banks [Prior Action 2, 31. Unlike financial intermediary
operations with lines o f credit targeted at specific vulnerable groups, this operation enables the
Government to sustain i t s efforts to support India's economy-wide inclusive growth programs, in
which bank credit plays a central role, especially the mandate for greater financial inclusion. To
the extent that the PSB are able to expand lending across sectors at the rate agreed with the
Government, there i s likely to be continued progress on overall growth, employment, and
poverty alleviation.28

74. Trends in Indian poverty make it imperative that general credit growth and, within the
totals, priority sector lending i s maintained. In 1983, 47 percent o f the people in rural areas
and 42 percent in urban areas lived below the official poverty line. By 2004-2005, these
proportions had fallen to 28 percent and 25.8 percent, respectively. The draft 2009 World Bank
poverty assessment for India shows that the depth and severity o f poverty declined even faster.29
With population growth, however, it has proven difficult to reduce the number o f poor at a
comparably rapid pace. Therefore, despite India's success in bringing down the poverty rate,
over 300 million people were living in poverty at the time o f the last comprehensive survey in
2004/05. However, the dynamics o f growth and poverty reduction have changed dramatically,
increasing the importance o f the relatively credit-dependent non-agricultural sectors. Urban and
rural poverty rates have been converging and urban poverty i s deeper and more severe than rural
poverty. As urban and peri-urban areas produce most o f India's output, the health o f the
manufacturing and services sectors, based largely in towns and cities, i s key to maintaining
India's aggregate growth rate and employment as well as in assisting the Government with i t s
poverty reduction effort. Despite this, given the slow pace o f urbanization in India, poverty i s
likely to remain a predominantly rural problem, with nearly three o f every four poor persons
living in India's villages. But the link between urban economic growth and rural poverty
reduction i s much stronger than before the 1990s. The spillover effects work through rural-to-
urban migration (and the reverse financial transfers) as well as trade in goods.

75. The proposed project, together with the operations identified in paragraph 47, will
help mitigate the impact o f the economic slowdown on employment and the pace o f job-
creation, mainly in the urban and peri-urban areas most affected by the global economic
crisis. As many o f the sectors that are vulnerable employ a higher proportion o f workers
clustered around the poverty line, there i s a high risk they will fall into poverty if the slowdown
i s severe or prolonged. Unskilled service sector workers, a number o f whom are migrants from
the poorer rural areas and form a large part o f the urban poor, would be an example. Even semi-
skilled and some skilled workers in urban areas who have been laid o f f or face the prospect o f
unemployment are vulnerable. An estimate from the first quarter o f 2009 showed that the

28
   In addition t o the program o f support for the PSB that i s expected t o increase general credit by at least 20 percent
this year, allocations for programs that directly support employment, business creation and economic growth have
been expanded. These include, for example, R B I ' s enhancements o f the M S M E (Refinance) Fund and Rural
Housing Fund, by Rs. 20 b i l l i o n and Rs. 10 billion, respectively. Other examples are the 2009/10 interim budget
allocations o f Rs. 140 b i l l i o n for the rural infrastructure development f h d (RIDF), a separate window under the
same RIDF for Rs. 40 billion for rural roads, and interest rate subsidies for short term crop loans. The recently re-
elected Government's budget for 2009- 10, presented in July 2009 expands allocations for infrastructure, agriculture,
and social safety nets, including an increase in allocations t o the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and
rural infrastructure and rural roads schemes.

number of urban jobs lost since October 2008, mainly from the export slowdown but also
because o f a downturn in the construction sector, was 5.9 million; the number i s likely to be
higher          Rural areas have been largely protected from the immediate effect o f the global
slowdown, reflecting recent government policies to energize the rural agricultural and non-farm
sectors, but even they are increasingly dependent on financial services in the economy, which
makes vital economic sectors vulnerable to shortages in credit.31

76. Social banking i s a core function o f the PSB in India, therefore safeguarding priority
sector credit growth, which i s a key objective o f the government's program for providing
capital to the PSB, i s vital. According to government guidelines, priority sector lending-for
example loans to SME, artisans and village and cottage industries, self-help groups, and direct
and indirect finance to agriculture-is   targeted at 40 percent o f the total lending o f the
commercial banks. In addition, major banking programs exist for: (a) facilitating payments by
farmers (for example, the Kisan Credit Card scheme mentioned above); (b) supporting banking
outreach (for example, the S e l f Help Group-Bank linkage program); (c) promoting general
employment and economic diversification activities among women, disabled and vulnerable
groups (for example, the Prime Minister's Rozgar Yojana, the Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar
Yojana (a rural livelihoods scheme), and the Scheme for the Liberation and Rehabilitation o f
Scavengers programs), in addition to the agricultural debt waiver and other debt and interest
payment measures that took place in 2008.32 Among other factors, the expansion o f such
programs to address poverty concerns depends on the ability o f the PSB to grow their portfolios.
For example, about 60 percent o f the Self Help Promoting Institutions in India receive their
funding from banks and NABARD.33

77. The proposed operation will also help in deepening government `programs for the
financial inclusion o f the poor and vulnerable groups in the formal financial system. RBI

30  Surveys by the Ministry of Labor and Employment and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry
show that several urban-based sectors-gems and jewelry, metals, textiles, business process outsourcing units,
software, transport and construction-have so far borne the brunt o f the adjustment. In addition, there has also been
a severe impact on mining and associatedbusinesses.
31
     The evidence from India i s strong that finance enables business expansion and employment. A recent study
based on randomized trials in Hyderabad found that credit helps expand business and household expenditure,
although in the short run there did not seem to be discernible effects on other social indicators, such as education or
health (Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Rachel Glennerster and Cynthia Kinna, The Miracle o Microfinance?
                                                                                                      f
Evidencefrom a Randomized Evaluation, MIT Poverty Action Lab, May 30, 2009. The recent investment climate
assessment for India showed that households and micro enterprises consider access to finance to be the single
biggest obstacle to their growth and that firms able to borrow in formal markets had 38 percent higher labor
productivity than other firms. Aurora Ferrari and Inderbir Singh Dhingra, India's Investment Climate: Voices o        f
Indian Business, World Bank, 2009.
32 There i s a vast body o f evidence that social banking has been beneficial in India on various fronts. Studies show
that increased access to financial services in India's rural areas has reduced poverty by both increasing the
sensitivity o f poverty to economic growth and by directly encouraging economic growth (Timothy Besley, Robin
Burgess and Berta Esteve-Volart, Operationalising Pro-Poor Growth: India Case Study, London School o f
Economics, January 2005). Another study showed that the expansion o f PSB branches into rural unbanked locations
reduced poverty across Indian states. In addition, the enforcement o f priority lending requirements was associated
with increased bank borrowing among the poor, in particular low caste and tribal groups (Robin Burgess, Rohini
Pande and Grace Wong, "Banking for the Poor: Evidence from India", Journal o the European Economic
                                                                                           f

estimates that only 59 percent of the adult urban population and 39 percent o f the adult rural
population have access to bank accounts, with the North Eastern and Eastern regions o f India
with even lower access.34 The PSB typically undertake the bulk o f lending to underserved
segments so capital support to the PSB ensures that such segments stand a better chance o f
sustaining access to credit in the coming years.35 The forward plans for the PSB include
ambitious goals for the expansion o f branches and non-branch access points, such as ATMs, for
FY2009-10, based on their agreements with the M O F on targeted levels o f overall and priority
credit-growth. In addition, 344 districts are included in the plans o f the State Level Bankers'
Committees, convened by the PSB, to reach 100 percent financial inclusion. O f these, 175
districts, across 21 States and 7 Union Territories have achieved their targets.36 The PSB intend
to maintain, but not complete, this program during the period o f implementation o f the proposed
operation, provided neither household incomes nor credit growth decline sharply. The PSB
focus on financial inclusion not merely for social development, but also from a business
perspective, as the "bottom o f the pyramid" market i s very large in India.37 The proposed
operation would support action on the part o f the PSB to continue to increase financial services
to the poor through relatively recent initiatives, such as "no frills" accounts-that is, accounts
without minimum balance requirements, which have proved a powerful vehicle for spreading the
banking habit among lower income and vulnerable populations subject to income volatility.

78. The Reserve Bank o f India (RBI) manages the foreign exchange reserves o f India.
Based on the RBI audit report and the outcomes o f other World Bank operations that have been
disbursed through RBI, the World Bank has reasonable assurance that the control environment
for foreign exchange i s satisfactory for the purposes o f this operation.. The IMF does not carry
out a Safeguard Assessment o f the Reserve Bank o f India (RBI). As part o f the appraisal for the
D P L operation, World Bank staff reviewed the RBI audit report and i t s published annual
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2008. The audit report by joint auditors
appointed by the Government has an unqualified opinion. The financial statements are prepared
in accordance with the Reserve Bank o f India Act 1934, the notifications issued under the Act,
and in the form prescribed by the RBI General Regulations 1949. The audit follows the
standards generally accepted in India.

    Usha Thorat, Financial Inclusion - The Indian Experience, Presentation by the RBI Deputy Governor to the
HMT-DflD Financial Inclusion Conference, London, June 19, 2007. The Invest India Market Solution Survey of
2007 showed that just 14 percent of agricultural wage laborers had a bank account, compared to 95 percent o f
people in business. Although indebtedness to formal financial institutions i s low, there were five times as many
  eople with bank loans in the top quartile (by income) compared to the bottom quartile o f those surveyed.
'  For example, under the Kisan Credit Card scheme PSB have extended more than 35 million credit cards (with a
total debit amount o f Rs. 1.8 trillion) to farmers to enable them to purchase agricultural inputs and draw working
capital.

37 India's National Council o f Applied Economic Research estimated that this market covers 15.6 percent o f the 222
million households in the country with annual incomes below Rs. 45,000 (US$ 900) per year. There are another 80
million households, with annual incomes in the Rs. 45,000-90,000 range, which banks and f i r m s are trying to reach
whose consumption patterns are likely to overlap on some products with the bottom-of-the-pyramid households.

79. While there has not been any formal diagnostic assessment (such as the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment o r the Public Financial Management Report) of
public financial management (PFM) at the Union level in India, focused studies o f public
accountability issues on selected areas, such as the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), have
been carried out. The Bank has also carried out FM assessments in ten States3* as well as in
ULB and PRI,39 and one State has carried out a self-asse~sment.~~ have provided a basis
                                                                    These
for enhanced knowledge and understanding o f the strengths and weaknesses o f the P F M systems
at the union level. The Government has initiated various actions in the area o f PFM, including
(a) enactment o f the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act; (b) passage o f the Right
to Information Act; (c) recognizing the need to improve the quality o f financial disclosure and
moving progressively to align disclosures with international public sector accounting standards;
and (d) recognizing the need for better financial monitoring o f Centrally Funded Schemes by
initiating the Central Plan Monitoring Scheme.

80.   The Government has recognized that there are significant opportunities for
strengthening FM at the union level. It has accepted a recommendation o f the 12th Finance
Commission to move gradually from a cash basis to an accrual basis o f accounting. It has also
shown interest in benchmarking an array o f FM practices to international standards and good
practices, including cash management, debt management, accounting for contingent liabilities,
and internal and external audit.     The Government seems interested in designing and
implementing integrated financial management information systems (IFMIS)--or at least in
modernizing existing Treasury systems-at State and possibly union levels.

81. A Loan Agreement between India (as the borrower) and the Bank reflects the
financing terms and conditions for the IBRD loan that will support this operation. The loan
proceeds will be available for disbursement in a single tranche o f US$2.0 billion after
effectiveness. As part o f the program supported by this operation, the Government o f India has
taken a number o f policy and institutional actions (see paragraphs 63-64). The Loan Agreement
between the Bank and India lists these "prior actions" and these actions constitute the legal basis
for the Bank to disburse the loan after effectiveness. The preparation o f the second loan and i t s
amount will be determined by: (a) the estimated funding needs, and (b) a set o f policy and
institutional measures to continue implementation o f the banking strategy o f the Government to
achieve the objectives o f this programmatic set.

38 "FM assessments" i s a term used here to include State Financial Accountability Assessments, State Public

82. Upon effectiveness of the loan, the borrower i s expected to submit to the Bank a
withdrawal application to draw down the loan proceeds. The Bank will disburse the loan
               S
proceeds in U Dollars to the RBI, and the RBI will credit on the same day the rupee equivalent
to the Consolidated Fund o f the Government with the RBI. The Government o f India will
confirm receipt o f the funds into this account. The funds provided by the Bank are not linked to
capital injections into any specific PSB, consequently the transfer o f funds to the Consolidated
Fund will be considered "end use" and there will be no fiduciary requirement to trace the transfer
o f funds to specific banks.

83. Pursuant to the Loan Agreements for this operation, India (in i t s capacity as the
borrower o f the IBRD loan) will undertake not to use the loans proceeds to finance any
excluded expenditures. If the borrower uses any amount o f the loan proceeds to finance
excluded expenditures, the Loan Agreement authorizes the World Bank to seek a refund o f that
amount.

                                   D. ENVIRONMENTAL

84. The proposed lending operation i s to provide PSB with the necessary Tier 1 capital
such that credit growth i s not impeded by a lack o f capital. According to our analysis, the
policy measures supported by this operation are not likely to have a significant effect on India's
environment, forests and other natural resources. Nonetheless, banking involves lending to
various sectors, including some which may not be environmentally benign and which, in turn,
could pose credit risks. Recognizing this, on December 20, 2007, RBI issued guidelines to all
scheduled commercial banks on "Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Development and
Non-Financial Reporting" [RBI/2007-08/216, DBOD.No.Dir. BC.58/13.27.00/2007-081. The
intent o f the guidelines i s to sensitize banks to the need for and the potential risks that could arise
out o f insufficient attention to environmental and social issues (such as increased loan defaults,
decreased asset value, liability for damages, and loss o f reputation). The PSB have indicated
during discussions with the World Bank team that their internal guidelines prohibit lending to
sectors determined to have adverse environmental effects (for example, production o f ozone
depleting substances). For medium and large projects, their internal guidelines provide for credit
approvals only upon submission o f the formal environmental clearances required o f project
promoters by the appropriate authorities, such as the Ministry o f Environment and Forests and
State Pollution Control Boards. With respect to post-environmental clearance compliance,
which i s the responsibility o f project developers, the clearing agency i s mandated to monitor
compliance. The team has engaged with the authorities on this topic, including institutional
practices and procedures on post-loan approval environmental compliance reporting by
borrowers from the PSB. The Government has indicated i t s intention to study the practices o f
the PSB in these areas before the next loan in this programmatic set o f two D P L to support
India's banking sector.

                                          E.   CONSUL TATION


85. The Government has conducted public consultations on its plans to inject budgetary
resources to buffer the capital of the PSB. Since January 2009, such consultations have
occurred at several levels. The Government has publicized i t s intentions and objectives for
injecting capital into the PSB in official notifications to the public issued through the Press
Information Bureau. Moreover, it made allocations for a first round o f capital infusions into the
PSB in the Interim Budget presented to parliament on February 16, 2009, held discussions with
industry associations, and made official statements regarding its intentions at the level o f the
President and Finance Minister. For the purposes of this Program Document, the Government
has also provided a strategy paper that elucidates the principles and objectives o f banking reform
in India, including the place o f the capital injections for PSB within the framework o f India's
multi-pronged response to the global economic crisis (see Annex 2 : Medium Term Banking
Strategy). This document draws on the Financial Sector Assessment and the RBI Annual Policy
Statement, both o f which are public documents. World Bank teams have also discussed on more
than one occasion the objectives and scope o f the programmatic D P L with a number o f India's
external development partners (outside o f the World Bank Group) that are active in the financial
sector. These included the IMF, ADB, DfID, KfW and JICA.

                     F.   IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION


86. Monitoring and evaluation i s critical to measure outcomes and benchmark progress on
achieving the objectives of the operation. The existing governance framework for banks
consists o f two parts: (i)
                          lending policy guidance, performance contracts, and majority ownership
o f PSB, implemented through the Department o f Financial Services o f MOF, and (ii)   prudential
supervision by the RBI.

87. The Ministry of Finance will carry out the implementation,monitoring, and evaluation
of the proposed program. The Department o f Financial Services in M O F will be the key nodal
and coordinating agency for this operation. The outcome indicators identified in Table 14 will
be monitored quarterly, with the Department o f Financial Services responsible for data analysis
and reporting formats.

88. As the global financial downturn continues to unfold, the greatest risk to India i s to do
nothing until it feels the full impact. India i s fortunate to be able to learn from the unfolding
events in other countries and assess the ways in which countries have responded. In addition, the
link between finance, confidence, and real sector impacts has become apparent, as well as the
need for speedy action o n all fronts. Through a series o f measures, one o f which i s this program,
the Government o f India seeks to be proactive rather than reactive. Preemptively addressing the
needs o f the economy and the financial sector should at the very least help to contain harm
resulting from the downturn. That said, the project does face a number o f real and potential
risks. A risk and risk mitigation matrix can be found at Annex 6.

89. Thus far, India has escaped much o f the slowdown felt in other countries, but
continued weakness in the global environment could have a more adverse effect in the
months ahead. India i s not immune. The risk o f further deterioration i s one the Government i s
attempting to address through measures designed to keep the economy growing. However, there
i s limited room for fiscal maneuver. Therefore, it i s important that budgetary resources to
contain the slowdown in the economy adequately support the Government's vigilance regarding
economic and financial sector developments. I t s recent Financial Sector Assessment, based upon


                                                                   46
the FSAP program o f the IMF and World Bank, addresses areas requiring greater attention. The
results o f the assessment also demonstrate the strength o f the banking sector and the bank
supervisor to operate and monitor PSB in a commercially based manner. However, the risks
identified are, for the most part, ones for which the Government i s adequately prepared. The
current situation presents more than usual risks because o f higher levels o f uncertainty and global
linkages. I t i s risks that rollover from this environment that are hardest for the country to address
preemptively.

90. The specific macroeconomic and financial r i s k s relate to the effects o f the global
slowdown and its domestic transmission. In addition to specific risks, external ratings
agencies could downgrade India if concerns about the external payments or fiscal/domestic debt
sustainability situations rise, especially in the context o f a prolonged global downturn. So far,
the direct effect on the external accounts has been small on the real side, and likely to remain so,
as a sharp drop in imports, resulting partly from the decline in price o f hydro-carbons, has offset
the slowdown in goods and services exports. FDI inflows have picked up over the past few
months, and there has been a return o f foreign institutional investor interest over the past few
weeks, although s t i l l tentative and unreliable. The three uncertainties in the external payments
situation pertain to (a) the effect o f a prolonged global slowdown on workers' remittances; (b)
adverse price movements in the markets for energy and food; and (c) the rollover risk in external
financial markets faced by large corporate borrowers. However, despite a decline in
international reserves since late last year, their level i s s t i l l among the highest in the world. The
domesticfiscal deficit, on the other hand, has widened, and the ability o f the Government to use
fiscal policy tools to combat the slowdown i s more limited than before. M u c h before 2008, the
Government had embarked on a program o f fiscal consolidation, revenue reform, and greater
selectivity in expenditures (including subsidies). Parts o f this program have been affected by the
need for macroeconomic stimulus and, as the Government has stated in i t s budget for 2009/10,
some o f the earlier plans for fiscal consolidation are unlikely to be resumed as long as there i s a
need for containing the effects o f the global crisis on India's economy.

91. There i s a risk that the quality o f lending will deteriorate faster than projected. This
risk i s associated closely with the depth and duration o f the broader economic slowdown.
However, it also depends on the ability o f the PSB not only to maintain lending to support
economic activity, but also to do this without a sharp deterioration in the quality o f their
portfolios. Often, the incentives to push lending are greater than those for managing credit
quality. Government owned banks in many economies, while capable o f quickly supporting
national plans for economic growth and macroeconomic stimulus, often find themselves
suffering from financial distress a few years later due to poor underwriting and risk management
standards applied to loan portfolios. The Government o f India has shown over the past years the
ability to include social policy lending in i t s PSB, while at the same time pushing for high quality
loans. The incentives are much the same today. However, there i s likely to be an increase in
NPA as a result o f corporate and consumer distress. The Government has conducted stress tests,
confirmed by the World Bank and others, based upon assumptions regarding different levels o f
NPA appearing during 2009-201 1 in PSB balance sheets. These stress tests have been used to
estimate the capital needs o f the PSB. Annex 6 identifies the specific risks associated with
lending and portfolio quality, and the measures in place or to be put in place to address them.

Sir

        On behalf of the Government of India. 1 am writing to request you far the Worid Bank's
support for our economic stimulus program in the face 3f the currenl global economic crisis.
Over the past several months, the Government and the World Rank have been collaborating in
an effort to process a Development Policy Loan, the Firs1 Banking Sector Support Loan (BSSL).
Wilh extraordinary collaborative efforts on both sdes, the Program Document for the proposed
BSSL has been completed. The BSSL wll play an intqral and Irne'y part in the Government's
cveratl r e s p s e L the current global crisis and Its impact On India.
                    o

       Over the past several years India has experlenced strong economic growth leading to R
now being among the top 10 largest economies. This cbccmxnic growth has been suppofted by
increasing investment and savngs. Corporate profitability has grown very strongly since early
2001. The growth also reflects India's increased integration witti the world economy. This
integration helped to prowde the exlernal resources needed to supplement the internal financral
resources far supporting rapid economic growth.

       The financial crisis, which began in the developed world, has had en impact on India
Although lndi has continued to experience economic growth. the speed of growth has slowed
Access to international financing by many of aur corporate entities, who employ a sizeable
number of people and contribute in many other ways to the economy, has become diffrarlt to
obtatn. Domestically. private banks have sigrnficantly reduced their lending, which has resuited
in many busrnesses and people fmdtng it difficult to access credit

         She Government has responded rapidly and aggressively lo the external shocks
through a series of monetary, fiscal trade and financial sedar measures !hat safeguard
econanic activity levels and assist vulnerable 8ectors. The policy initlarives of the Government
and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have been directed at providing adequate rupee liquidity
ensurmg a comfortable level of dollar liquid&. safeguarding public expenditures in core souat
and economic sub-sectors and maintaining a market environment amenable to the continued
R o w of credit to pmductiveSW~OK

       Following the onset of the current global crisis. lndra experienced a slowdown in credit
growlh The slawdown wes most apparent among our foreign and doiyiestic private sector
banks thst for several reasons, have experienced a reduction in the growth of lending and




                                                48
deposit taking. The risk to scmomic grawth became readily apparent in the tast half of 2008-
09 One component of the Government's overall stimulus program seeks to address this
weakness through the provision o i capital to sound pubk sector banks to he@ maintain credit
growth. This, we believe, will contain the possible adverse effects on employment and poverty
and enable India's businesses to contrnue to enhance their competitiveness and prepare for
recovery.

        The proposed BSSL is an integral component of the Government's overall response, It
will provide budgetary support la fufiher implement our economic stimufus prqram and will
enable us to wntinue our program of providing deeper capital buffers for the public banks to
maintain the high confidence of the public in the banking sector, prevent shortages of capital
ftom leading to a further slowdown in credii growth, and provide a buffer to absorb non-
performing assets (NPA) that may result from the slowdown.

       With regard to the progressive development d !he banklng sector m d fmancial service
delivery. which are a key poky focus of the Government we have made significant progress
over the past decade This is strongly evidenced by the current strength and diversfition of
Uie banking sector, and the increase in finanaal inclusion.         India's banking sector has
undertaken comprehensive refonns under the leaderahip of the RBI. The result has been a
stable banking sector, with high proftabrfity and adequate capital, combined with the ability to
expand credit in line with the needs of the growing economy. Measiires were intraduGed to
commercialire the pubfic sector banks, resulting in much stronger balance sheets, stronget
lending practices and a significant reducm in their NPA.

        In addition to helping maintein an appropriate macroeconomic stance, the BSSL win
facw an implementing measures in several areas that will bolster the effectiveness of capital
injections to the banks. These we: I)ensuring quality credit growth: it) strengthenin0 prudentfal
norms for the banking W o r ; iti) improving govemmm; and tu) improving fisk management a       t
banks.

        The BSSL will play an important role by providing budgetary support to the
Government's p m g m to contain the impact of the current global crisis. Th8 year will likely
bring ditkultbs but, despite the circumstances, the Government of India remains committed to
restoring high economic growth and continuing further devefopment of the bankrng sector. We
have recently taken steps which will help to guide future banking development, including a
review 61 the needs of the banking sector and a self assessment based upon the prlnciples of
the formal FSAP of the IMF and World Bank. In addition, Included in the program document is
OUT strategy note, which furlher points io our continued suppor: for reform and strengthening of
the banking sector.
      Therefore, I slncere'ly hope the Government of India's request for a collaborative
approach through a Development Policy Loan will be considered fawrabty and promptly by the
World Bank.
       Yuur kind cooperakin is, a8 always, very mwh appreciated.

       A.    K e y Banking Sector Reforms o f the Past

The main objective o f the financial sector reforms in India initiated in the early 1990s was to
create an efficient, competitive and stable financial sector that could then contribute in greater
measure to stimulate growth while not losing sight o f the need for financial inclusion o f the
under-privileged. Concomitantly, the monetary policy framework made a phased shift from
direct instruments o f monetary management to an increasing reliance o n indirect instruments.
However, as appropriate monetary transmission cannot take place without efficient price
discovery o f interest rates and exchange rates in the overall functioning o f financial markets, the
corresponding development o f the money market, Government securities market and the foreign
exchange market became necessary. Reforms in the various segments, therefore, had to be
coordinated. In this process, growing integration o f the Indian economy with the rest o f the
world also had to be recognized and provided for.

The reforms process also initiated measures for improving the productivity, efficiency and
profitability o f the banking system. The operational rigidities in credit delivery system were
addressed to ensure allocational efficiency and achievement o f social objectives.

Banking sector reforms in India have been based o n five fundamentals: strengthening o f
prudential norms and market discipline, appropriate adoption o f international benchmarks,
management o f organisational change and consolidation, technological upgradation, and human
resource development. A hallmark o f the entire financial sector reform process has been the
element o f "considered calibration", with due consideration o f timing, pacing and sequencing,
following extensive consultations with the stakeholders at each stage. Deregulation,
technological upgradation and increased market integration have been the key factors driving
change in the financial sector.

The sustained reform measures over a period o f last fifteen years have resulted in the
transformation o f the Indian banking sector into a reasonably strong, diverse and resilient
system. The major initiatives undertaken may be categorised under deregulation, prudential
measures and approach to supervision, competition and enabling measures.

Government o f India and the Reserve Bank o f India have initiated a number o f steps to bring
wide-spread reforms in the banking sector to enable the Indian banking system to grow and
become more competitive.         RBI has prescribed measures for strengthening prudential
supervision coupled with wide ranging steps undertaken by the Government to improve the
health o f the banking sector. After initiation o f reforms in early 1990s, financial performance of
the banking sector in general and public sector banks in particular has improved significantly.
Balance sheet and profitability indicators viz. funding volatility ratio, return on assets, net
interest margin, post income ratio, N P A ratio, provisioning and classification norms for NPAs,


41
     This framework has been prepared by the Ministry o f Finance, Government o f India.


                                                          50
capital adequacy ratio etc. suggest that the Indian banking sector now compares well with the
global benchmarks. To facilitate quick and efficient decision-making and to provide flexibility
needed for them to compete internationally, the Government announced an Autonomy Package
on 22.02.2005 for the public sector banks (PSB). Further, the Government has put in place a
mechanism to monitor the performance o f all PSB on the basis o f the `Statement o f Intent on
Annual Goals' submitted by them.

A number of steps have been taken to make banking more customer friendly viz. introduction o f
Core Banking Solutions (CBS), installation o f ATMs, enhanced working hours, simplification o f
procedure and forms, IBA guidelines on Fair Practices Code, RBI guidelines on credit card
operations etc. The Recovery o f Debts Due to Banks & Financial Institutions (DRT) Act, 1993,
and the Securitisation and Reconstruction o f Financial Assets and Enforcement o f Security
Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 has been enacted to facilitate quick and effective recovery o f
non-performing assets. The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 has been
enacted to facilitate setting up o f credit information companies for collection, sharing and
dissemination o f credit information, which will help in arresting the fresh accretion o f N P A and
to significantly improve the quality o f credit appraisals and decisions.

For the orderly presence and growth o f foreign and private sector banks in India, RBI issued
guidelines titled "Road Map for Presence o f Foreign Banks in India" and "Ownership and
Governance o f Private Sector Banks" on 28..02.2005. RBI has also issued guidelines for
consolidation in the banking sector to facilitate voluntary merger among private sector banks,
and between NBFCs and the private sector banks. To further accelerate the process o f reforms in
the banking sector, the Government has amended the RBI Act, 1934 and the Banking Companies
(Acquisition & Transfer o f Undertakings) Act, 1970/80. Amendments have also been proposed
in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

    B.   Broader Financial Sector Development

The most notable impact o f financial sector reforms i s clearly discernible in the development o f
various segments o f financial markets in India. The reforms since the early 1990s have led to a
regime characterised by market-determined interest and exchange rates, price-based instruments
o f monetary policy, current account convertibility, substantial capital account liberalisation and
vibrant government securities and capital markets. Derivative instruments have been cautiously
introduced in a phased manner, both for product diversity and, more importantly, as a risk
management tool. All these developments have facilitated the process o f price discovery in
various financial market segments.

It i s widely recognised that the Indian financial sector over the last decade has been transformed
into a reasonably sophisticated, diverse and resilient system. I t delivers a wide variety o f
financial services efficiently and profitably, with a spectrum o f financial market segments in
which financial institutions are able to participate with operational and functional autonomy in
an environment o f increasing deregulation and international competition. The acceleration o f
growth in the real economy suggests that the financial system has served well the overall needs
o f the economy. During this period, the global financial environment has become more risky
because o f new instruments and participants, and there have been rapid advances in



                                                51
communication technology that integrate markets worldwide. A unique feature o f the Indian
reform process i s that it has been instituted and carried forward with the objective o f sustaining     '


and accelerating the growth momentum while containing risk and entrenching financial stability.

    C.    C u r r e n t Structure of the Banking Sector

In the post-reform period, banks have experienced strong growth o f business in an environment
o f operational flexibility. Concomitantly, the financial health o f banks has improved
significantly, both in terms o f capital adequacy and asset quality. Moreover, this progress has
been achieved while setting the groundwork for the adoption o f international best practices in
prudential and accounting norms. Increased competitiveness and productivity gains have also
been enabled by proactive technological deepening and flexible human resource management.
These significant gains have been achieved even while renewing our commitment to social
banking viz., maintaining the wide reach o f the banking system and directing credit towards
important but disadvantaged sectors o f society. The banking system's wide reach, judged in
terms o f expansion o f branches and the growth o f credit and deposits indicates continued
financial deepening.

Restoration o f the health o f the banking system has involved:

    0    Restoration o f public sector banks' net worth achieved through recapitalization where
         needed (total cost less than one per cent o f GDP).
    0    Competition increased through entry o f new private sector banks and foreign banks.
    0    Higher levels and standards o f disclosure achieved to enhance market transparency.
    0    Bank regulation and supervision strengthened towards international best practice.
    0    Micro prudential measures instituted.
    e    Supervision process streamlined with combination o f on-site and off-site surveillance
         along with external auditing.
    0    Risk based supervision introduced.
    e    Process o f structured and discretionary intervention introduced for problem banks
         through a prompt corrective action mechanism.
    0    Ownership o f public sector banks has been broadened through disinvestment up to 49 per
         cent, and banks have been listed.
    0    Mechanism for greater regulatory coordination instituted for regulation and supervision

   ..    o f financial conglomerates.
         Measures taken to strengthen creditor rights.

In consonance with the objective o f enhancing efficiency and productivity o f banks through
greater competition, there has been a consistent decline in the share o f public sector banks in
total assets o f commercial banks. Nevertheless, public sector banks appear to have responded to
the new challenges o f competition, as reflected in their increased share in the overall profit of the
banking sector. This suggests that, with operational flexibility, public sector banks are competing
relatively effectively with private sector and foreign banks. Shares o f Indian private sector banks,
especially new private sector banks established in the 1990s, in the total income and assets o f the
banking system have considerably increased over time.



                                                 52
Significant improvement in the performance o f public sector banks has been witnessed over the
past decade or so, facilitated by the phased introduction o f wide-ranging financial sector reforms
since the early 1990s. Gradual introduction o f best international practices and norms, refinements
in the supervisory practices, tightening o f risk weights/provisioning norms in regard to sectors
witnessing high credit growth, greater market discipline brought about by raising o f capital from
the capital markets and listing on the stock exchanges, interest rate deregulation, and scaling
down o f statutory pre-emptions are amongst the key factors that have led to better performance.
Concomitantly, greater competition has been induced in the domestic banking sector by
successful introduction o f new generation private sector banks. Despite strong growth in balance
sheets o f the new banks, the banking system has exhibited remarkable stability.

      D.   Current Performance of the Banking Sector

O n the liability side, deposits continue to account for about 80 per cent o f the total while on the
asset side, the shares o f loans and advances and investments have seen marked cycles, reflecting
banks' portfolio preferences as well as growth cycles in the economy. In this regard, while the
share o f loans and advances declined in the second half o f 1990s on account o f the industrial
slowdown as well as tightening o f prudential norms, banks' credit portfolio has witnessed sharp
growth in the period 2003-07. The overall capital position o f commercial banks has witnessed a
marked improvement during the reform period (Table 1). Illustratively, as at end-March 2009, all
81 scheduled commercial banks operating in India maintained C R A R at or above 9 per cent
relative to the Basel Inorm o f 8 per cent. For the Indian banking system, the ratio o f capital to
risk weighted assets works out to 13 per cent currently. While improved capitalization o f public
sector banks was initially brought through infusion o f funds by government to recapitalize these
banks, subsequently, public sector banks were allowed to raise funds from the market through
equity issuance subject to the maintenance o f 51 per cent public ownership. As a result,

 - As per Basel 2 norms.


Despite tightening prudential norms in terms o f classification o f non-performing assets, the
resulting measured asset quality o f banks has improved considerably as the share o f non-
performing loans (NPLs) (as ratios o f both total advances and assets) have declined substantially
and consistently since the mid-1990s. In fact, the ratio o f net NPLs to net advances at 1.O per
cent in India i s now comparable to that o f several advanced economies. Improvement in the
credit appraisal process, upturn o f the business cycle, new initiatives for resolution o f NPLs



                                                 53
(including promulgation o f the Securitization and Reconstruction o f Financial Assets and
Enforcement o f Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act), and greater provisioning and write o f f o f
NPLs enabled by greater profitability, have contributed to the reduction in incremental NPLs.

Among the banks groups, the balance sheets o f foreign and new private sector banks expanded at
a higher rate as compared with other bank groups. As a result, the combined share o f foreign and
new private sector bank groups in total assets o f SCBs increased further to 25.6 per cent at end-
March 2008 from 24.8 per cent at end-March 2007. The growth rates in the assets o f public
sector banks and old private sector banks during 2007-08 at 23.9 per cent and 21.2 per cent,
respectively, were higher than those during the previous year. However, their assets grew at a
lower rate than those o f SCBs as a whole. The impact o f differential growth rate across different
banks groups was broadly reflected in their market shares in terms o f major indicators o f balance
sheets.

    E. Strategy During the Recent and On-Going Global Financial Crisis

The genesis o f the present global financial crisis lies in the housing sector meltdown in the U   S
since mid-2005. Against the backdrop o f the U sub-prime crisis and i t s spillover in global
                                                     S
financial markets and, eventually, the global trading system, the Reserve Bank o f India (RBI)
initiated a series o f meetings with fifteen major banks in the month o f September 2007, to assess
i t s impact on banks in India and take necessary remedial measures. Further, to ensure
uninterrupted and adequate credit to the productive sectors o f economy, RBI and the
Government have taken some pro-active measures to provide rupee and foreign exchange
liquidity as well as credit to the production and trade sectors, and three fiscal stimulus packages.

The detailed notifications/press releases issued by Government and RBI that describe these
measures, are available at websites www.pib.nic.in and www.rbi.ora.in respectively.

In the context o f a slowdown o f the economic growth in 2008-09 due to global financial crisis, a
major challenge i s to support the drivers o f aggregate demand to enable the economy to return to
i t s high growth path.

The second challenge i s to ensure that the credit needs o f the non-food sector are adequately met.
Although, for the year 2008-09 as a whole, credit by the banking sector expanded, the pace o f
credit flow decelerated rapidly from i t s peak in October 2008. This deceleration has occurred
alongside a significant decline in the flow o f resources from non-bank domestic and external
sources. The deceleration in total resource flow partly reflects slowdown in demand, drawdown
o f inventories by the corporates and decline in commodity prices. There i s an urgent need to
increase the flow o f credit to all productive sectors o f the economy, particularly to MSMEs, to
support the process o f economic recovery. The Reserve Bank o f India continues to maintain and
will maintain ample liquidity in the system. I t should be the endeavor o f commercial banks to
ensure that every creditworthy borrower i s financed at a reasonable cost while, at the same time,
ensuring that credit quality i s maintained.

We will have to address the key challenge o f ensuring an interest rate environment that supports
revival o f investment demand. Since October 2008, as the inflation rate has decelerated and the



                                                54
policy rates have been reduced, market interest rates have also come down. However, the
reduction in interest rates across the t e r m structure and across markets has not been uniform.
Given the cost plus pricing structure, banks have been slow in reducing their lending rates citing
high cost o f deposits. There i s scope for the overall interest rate structure to move down within
the policy rate easing already effected by the Reserve Bank o f India. Further action on policy
rates i s now being taken to reinforce this process. Recently several commercial banks have
announced cuts in the lending rates.

A continued challenge i s to preserve financial stability. A sound banking sector, well-
functioning financial markets and robust payment and settlement infrastructure are the pre-
requisites for financial stability. The banking sector in India i s sound, adequately capitalised
and well-regulated. By all counts, Indian financial and economic conditions are much better than
in many other countries o f the world. The single factor stress tests carried out as part o f the
report o f the Committee on Financial Sector Assessment (CFSA) have revealed that the banking
system in India can withstand significant shocks arising from large potential changes in credit
quality, interest rate and liquidity conditions. These stress tests for credit, market and liquidity
risk show that Indian banks are generally resilient.

Keeping in view both international and domestic initiatives in the financial sector, RBI has
proposed the following in the Annual Policy Statement for 2009-10:

       To constitute a Task Force to look into all the issues that have arisen with regard to the
       G-20 Working Groups and the report o f the CFSA and suggest follow-up actions
       relevant for the Reserve Bank in the domestic context on an on-going basis, for every
       quarter;
       In consultation with all regulators and the Government to consider the setting up of a
       Working Group to implement the recommendations o f the CFSA;
       To set up a Financial Stability Unit in the Reserve Bank drawing upon inter-disciplinary
       expertise from supervisory, regulatory, statistics, economics and financial markets
       departments for carrying out periodic stress testing and for preparing financial stability
       reports.

In February 2005, the Government o f India and the Reserve Bank released the `Roadmap for
Presence o f Foreign Banks in India' laying out a two-track and gradualist approach aimed at
increasing the efficiency and stability o f the banking sector in India. One track was the
consolidation o f the domestic banking system, both in private and public sectors, and the second
track was the gradual enhancement o f the presence o f foreign banks in a synchronized manner.
The roadmap was divided into two phases, the first phase spanning the period March 2005 -
March 2009, and the second phase beginning April 2009 after a review o f the experience gained
in the first phase.

In view o f the current global financial market turmoil, there are uncertainties surrounding the
financial strength o f banks around the world. Further, the regulatory and supervisory policies at
national and international levels are under review. In view o f this, it i s considered advisable, for
the time being, to continue with the current policy and procedures governing the presence o f
foreign banks in India. The proposed review will be taken up after due consultation with the
stakeholders once there i s greater clarity regarding stability, recovery o f the global financial


                                                 55
system, and a shared understanding on the regulatory and supervisory architecture around the
world.

The G-20 Working Group on Enhancing Sound Regulation and Strengthening Transparency has
recommended, as a part o f measures to mitigate procyclicality that capital buffers above
minimum requirements and loan loss provisions should be built up in good times in order to
enhance the ability o f the regulated financial institutions to withstand large shocks. This would
require modification in the Reserve Bank's circular o f June 22, 2006. The Reserve Bank has
been encouraging banks to build floating provisions as a buffer for the possible stress on asset
quality later. The following i s proposed in the Annual Policy Statement for 2009-10:

         To issue further detailed guidelines on mitigating procyclicality later this year after FSB,
         BCBS and Committee on Global Financial System (CGFS) finalize their
         recommendations in this regard.

In the Mid-Term Review o f October 2008 by RBI, it was indicated that the Reserve Bank o f
India would be upgrading the stress testing guidelines. Subsequently, the BCBS has issued a
paper o n `Principles for Sound Stress Testing Practices and Supervision' in January 2009 for
comments. The paper draws lessons for banks and supervisors emerging from the financial crisis
and addresses weaknesses in stress testing, including the specific areas o f risk mitigation and risk
transfer. In this context, the CFSA has recommended that there i s a need for the banks
themselves to carry out such periodic stress testing. It i s proposed to upgrade the stress testing
guidelines once BCBS finalizes the paper based o n comments received.

    F.    Long T e r m Strategy f o r the Banking Sector

Banking sector reforms initiated by the Government have been directed towards enhancing
efficiency and productivity o f banks, providing additional options for augmentation o f capital o f
banks for smooth transition to Basel I1 norms, ensuring smooth and risk free functioning o f
payment and settlements system, encouraging use o f advance technology in banking operations
with minimum risks and according priority to financial inclusion. The operational rigidities in
credit, delivery system were addressed to ensure allocational efficiency and achievement o f social
objectives.

The long term strategy for the banking sector includes further strengthening o f prudential
guidelines, supervision for growth o f healthier banking system in India. For orderly growth, a
calibrated approach has been adopted by Government and RBI to diversify ownership, improve
corporate governance, minimize fragmentation and increase accountability. The strategy will
broadly proceed on the already carved growth trajectory.




                                                 56
    G. Priorities

Some o f the priorities and challenges for banking sector could be given as follows:
Containment o f operating expenses
Cost containment i s a key to sustainability o f bank profits as well as their long-term viability. In
2005, operating costs o f banks as a proportion o f total average assets was less than 2 per cent in
major European economies like Sweden, Austria, Germany and France. In India, however, in
2006, operating costs as proportion o f total assets o f scheduled commercial banks stood at 2.1
per cent. The tasks ahead are thus clear and within reach. The operating cost o f banks would
further come down with the increased use o f technology, branch and office network
rationalization as also by increasing productivity by way o f rationalization o f manpower and
tasks.

Pricing o f credit
While there i s intense competition among banks to lend to large top-rated borrowers, other
borrowers with long standing relationship with banks and good credit record do not get the
benefit o f lower rates. I t i s desirable that banks should align the pricing o f credit to assessment
of credit risk so that credit delivery and credit culture i s improved. As such, risk profiling o f
borrowers i s also required for allocation o f capital under Base1 I1 apart from being desirable from
the point o f view o f risk management and efficient use o f capital. Hence, banks were asked to
take steps for putting in place comprehensive and rigorous risk assessment o f borrowers using
the database available with them, as also other internal and external factors so that the pricing o f
credit i s related to risk more appropriately. The rating models o f the banks are being
strengthened, based on experience and data mining. Further, external ratings are being
increasingly used in appraising the risk o f borrowers.

Credit delivery
I t has been the endeavor o f RBI to improve the agricultural/rural/SSI sector credit delivery
mechanism by bridging the gap between banking institutions and the demand for timely credit.
RBI had initiated several measures to create a conducive environment for banks to provide
adequate and timely finance at reasonable rates to different sectors o f the economy, and to
remove bottlenecks in credit delivery mechanism. The measures include, inter alia, simplifying
procedures, encouraging decentralized decision-making and enhancing competition. RBI has
been acting as a catalytic agent in initiating appropriate changes in institutional and procedural
arrangements for the smooth flow o f credit to agriculture and S S I sector. The Government has
embarked upon a very ambitious programme o f strengthening the rural credit structure through
amalgamation and mergers o f RFU3s and strengthening o f the co-operative credit structure
through recapitalization and governance and institutional reforms. Further, credit to the
agricultural sector i s being ensured through credit targets and finance and refinance support.

NPA management
This i s a key to the stability o f the banking sector. Indian banks have done a remarkable job in
containment o f non-performing loans (NPL) considering the overhang issues and overall difficult



                                                 57
environment. The low net NPL ratio for the Indian scheduled commercial banks at 1.2 per cent i s
ample testimony to the impressive efforts made b y our banking system. NPAs have two
components: the overhang component and the incremental component.                     The overhang
component arises due to infirmities in structural and institutional environments while
incremental component arises from factors internal to banks' management and credit culture.
Appropriate legal, institutional and judicial framework i s essential for resolution o f the overhang
component o f the NPAs and this holds the key to health and competitiveness o f the Indian banks.
The recent legal initiatives to put in place effective Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and ARCS
and credit information companies are expected to bear fruits over the next few years as they will
adequately strengthen creditors' rights and enthuse the lenders to meet the credit needs o f the
productive sectors based purely on merit o f credit proposals.

In order that there is no dilution in credit discipline and international best practices in income
recognition, asset classification and provisioning are followed by banks in India, RBI and
Government o f India have been consistently advocating market-based solutions for resolution
o f overhang o f impaired assets. Market participants are being encouraged to seek resolution
through creation o f privately held asset reconstructiodsecuritization companies.

Technology in banking
Issues relating to technology in banking are o f paramount importance in view o f their
relationship with productivity, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Technology has brought
about manifold changes in a number o f major areas o f bank functioning, such as management
o f risks, reduction in trysaction costs, diversification o f portfolio, improvements in credit
delivery, efficient MIS and providing value added service to customers. The Reserve Bank o f
India has been playing a pivotal role in the upgradation o f technology in the banking sector with
the objective o f putting in place a safe, robust, efficient and integrated payment and settlement
system. Notwithstanding the rapid strides made over the last few years, the percentage o f
customers using online banking i s less in India compared with 6-30 per cent range in developed
economies. I t is wise for Indian banks to exploit the global state-of-art expertise, domestically
available, to their fullest advantage.

Risk management
Banking in modern economies i s all about risk management. The successful implementation o f
Basel I1 i s likely to lead to an even sharper focus on risk management at the institutional level.
The Basel Committee has, through i t s various publications, provided useful guidelines on
managing the various facets o f risk. The institution o f sound risk management practices would be
an essential pre-requisite for staying ahead o f the competition. Banks are encouraged to focus on
capacity building and undertake analyses o f their risk exposures and their risk management
systems. O n the basis o f the outcome o f the analyses, banks may redefine their business strategy
and risk management strategy with a view to altering their profile o f risk exposures or adopt a
combination o f both.




                                                58
Governance

New private banks and foreign banks have been granted licenses in order to allow the financial
system to benefit from greater competition through better technology, specialized skills, better
risk management practices, greater portfolio diversification relating to treasury operations and
deepening of the financial markets. The concentrated shareholding in banks controlling
substantial amount of public funds poses the risk o f concentration o f ownership given the moral
hazard problem and linkages o f owners with businesses. Corporate governance in banks has
therefore become a major issue. Diversified ownership becomes necessary to provide balancing
stakes. I t has been our experience that broad-based ownership o f banks leads to increased
representation o f institutional and individual shareholders and encourages better corporate
governance. The quality o f corporate governance in the banks becomes critical as competition
intensifies, banks strive to retain their client base, and regulators move out o f micro-regulation.
Banks are special as they not only accept and deploy large amount o f uncollateralized public
funds in fiduciary capacity, but they also leverage such funds through credit creation. The RBI
has, on i t s part, made significant efforts to improve governance practices in banks, drawing upon
international best practices. RBI had based on the feedback received from the public on draft
guidelines and in consultation with the Government issued final guidelines on the policy
framework for ownership and governance in private sector banks. These guidelines focus on
ensuring 'fit and proper' criteria for directors and shareholders, on a continuous basis,
restructuring and consolidation in the banking sector and provide for observance o f sound
corporate governance principles. Corporate governance presently finds explicit mention in the
annual reports o f several banks. The improved corporate governance practice would also
provide an opportunity to accord greater freedom to the banks' boards and move away from
micro regulation to macro management.

Ownership

The current statutory and other provisions require that the Government shall not hold, at any
time, less than 51% o f the equity capital o f nationalized banks and IDBI Ltd, and 55% o f the
equity capital o f SBI. Further, the provisions contained in Section 3(2D) o f the Banking
Companies (Acquisition and Transfer o f Undertaking) Act, 1970/80 provide that the shares o f
the Central Government in nationalized banks are not transferable. There i s presently no proposal
to disinvest Government shareholding in public sector banks beyond the legally mandated
permissible minimum thresholds, and this situation i s not foreseen to change in the near future.
In the medium term, a calibrated approach has been adopted by Government and RBI to
diversify ownership, primarily with a view to allow these banks to raise capital from the capital
markets.

Consolidation

The Narasimhan Committee on Financial Sector Reforms, in i t s report in 1991, had suggested
consolidation in the banking sector and had, inter alia, suggested that India should have 4-5 large
banks, 6-8 medium size banks and 10-12 regional banks. The Government views consolidation
as a timely response to augment efficiency through better management o f risks, leveraging
economies o f scale in terms o f manpower and footprint, and improved ability to face


                                                59
competition. Raising o f funds i s not the major criteria for consolidation o f banks, rather the
major considerations are generally o f the nature o f systemic benefits and advantages accruing to
the residual entity, business considerations such as synergies and need for increasing market
share. However, the Government i s o f the view that the initiatives for consolidation emanate
from the management o f the individual banks with the Government playing a supportive role as a
common shareholder. While supporting any merger proposal, the Government will keep in view
the interests o f the shareholders and employees o f the merging banks.

    H. Uncertainties, Risks and Mitigation Plans

In the Report on Trend and Progress o Banking in India 2007-08 released on 17.12.2008, the
                                           f
Reserve Bank o f India (RBI) indicated that while the financial system as a whole i s quite robust,
there i s a need to be aware o f certain downside risks in certain areas, which could have a bearing
on the stability o f the financial system in the near future, such as adverse international
developments, moderation in growth and asset prices. The adverse global developments have led
to moderation o f growth in industrial and services sectors in the f i r s t h a l f o f 2008-09. O n the
growth front, it i s important to ensure that credit requirements for productive purposes are
adequately met so as to support the growth momentum. The Report indicated that the RBI has
kept a close vigil on the entire financial system to prevent pressures from building up in the
financial markets. This included liquidity enhancing measures to ease liquidity pressures.

Developments in the global financial system have heightened the uncertainty in the global
economy. The banking sector in India does not have any direct exposure to the U sub-prime S
market. Some banks have an indirect albeit not very significant exposure to the distressed assets
and financial institutions. However, there are indications o f some impact o f the global
developments on the Indian economy. There are indications that current crisis could raise
funding costs and difficulties in raising external finance particularly for l o w rated firms. Further,
there has been an impact o f the crisis on the capital account o f the Indian economy. During April
to October 2008, there were net outflows o f portfolio investments by Foreign Institutional
Investors. The slowdown in capital flows could affect the economy through several ways, such
as (1) decline in equity markets and resultant difficulty in raising capital from the market; (2)
sharp realignment o f exchange rates; (3) tightening o f liquidity conditions; (4) hard lending o f
credit cycle.

The recent global financial turmoil caused by the crisis in the mortgage market in the U S has
once again brought into focus the linkages among real estate cycles, bank crisis and the ultimate
threat to financial stability. The major portion o f real estate exposure consists o f mortgage
related assets, which are long-term in nature having dynamic cash flow characteristics, which
render them as risky ventures. The Report indicated that it i s therefore imperative that banks
manage the balance sheet risks associated with real estate exposure, particularly in the current
scenario o f slowdown in the economy with i t s expected ramifications on real estate prices. In
India, asset prices both, real estate and equity, rose sharply since the beginning o f 2005. Over the
years, banks in India have enlarged their exposure to real estate market. The rapid increase in
real estate loans raises concerns about asset quality and potential systemic risks. The Reserve
Bank alerted banks about early signs o f overheating o f the Indian economy during 2006-07 on
the back o f some evidence o f firming up o f demand pressures, in particular, the combination o f


                                                  60
higher growth and consumer inflation coupled with escalating asset prices and tightening
infrastructural bottlenecks,

In view o f the risks posed by accelerated exposure to real estate sector, the Reserve Bank
initiated several regulatory measures including prescribing higher risk weights, disclosure and
reporting o f real estate exposure in balance sheets and even revising the definition o f real estate
exposure. Several measures were taken to prevent/contain the frauds in the area o f housing loans.

    I. Overall Assessment o f Banking Sector in India

The assessment o f the Indian financial system during 2007-08 indicates that the banking sector in
India continues to be healthy, sound and resilient. The profitability o f the banking sector, which
has shown remarkable resilience in the last few years, improved further during the year. Their
capital position i s also strong and they are less leveraged than they were a few years ago. The
performance indicators such as operational efficiency, asset quality and soundness indicators o f
the Indian banking system currently compare well with the global standards. Although non-
performing loans in absolute terms increased during the year, showing a reversal o f the trend
observed during the last few years, the gross N P A ratio (gross NPAs as percentage o f gross
advances) continued to decline. Even though the credit risk environment i s becoming somewhat
uncertain, highlighting the significance o f NPA management, banks with comfortable capital
buffers appear to be in a better position to withstand any shock on their balance sheets arising out
o f evolving macro-economic environment.

Financial Stability in India
As per assessment o f RBI in i t s Report, Financial stability in India has been achieved through
perseverance o f prudential policies which prevent institutions from excessive risk taking, and
financial markets from becoming extremely volatile and turbulent. The policy stance o f the
Reserve Bank i s aimed at assuring financial stability, while maintaining the growth momentum
at reasonable levels and giving a high priority to price stability. The relative stability in domestic
financial markets, despite extreme turmoil in the global financial markets, i s reflective o f prudent
practices, strengthened reserves and the strong growth performance in recent years in an
environment o f flexibility in the conduct o f policies. Active liquidity management i s a key
element o f the current monetary policy stance. Liquidity modulation through a flexible use o f a
combination o f instruments has, to a significant extent, cushioned the impact o f the international
financial turbulence on domestic financial markets by absorbing excessive market pressures and
ensuring orderly conditions. India, with i t s strong drivers o f growth, may escape the worst
consequences o f the global financial crisis. Once the global situation i s stabilized, and calm and
confidence are restored, India would return to the high growth trajectory. The Government o f
India and Reserve Bank o f India are well poised to adequately address any uncertainty arising
out o f the current global financial crisis and associated risks.

Outlook

The Reserve Bank would continue with various regulatory and supervisory initiatives to
strengthen the domestic financial sector in order to maintain financial stability. In consonance
with the aim o f benchmarking the Indian financial sector with the international best practices,


                                                 61
commercial banks in India have begun implementing Basel I 1 from March 2008 onwards. In
order to strengthen the risk management in banks, the credit derivatives are being introduced in a
calibrated manner, taking into account the risk management systems in banks and their state o f
preparedness for Basel 11. The principles for accounting o f derivatives are also being finalized.
In view o f the fast pace o f deregulation, liberalization and the emergence o f financial
conglomerates, the supervisory process i s being constantly fine-tuned to ensure that adequate
cognizance i s given to the complexities o f organizational structures, business processes and risk
positions o f the banks. The focus i s on risk based supervisory framework and smooth migration
to Basel I1 that will require appropriate capacity building in the Reserve Bank as well as in the
banks. While strengthening the regulatory and the supervisory framework, the Reserve Bank will
continue to persevere with i t s efforts towards greater financial inclusion and improvement in
customer services provided by the banking sector.

 1. India has exhibited clear signs o f stress as a result o f the crisis. The Interim Budget for
2009-10 has revised the revenue deficit estimate for 2008-09 to 4.4 per cent o f GDP as against
the budget estimate o f 1.0 per cent, and the fiscal deficit to 6.0 per cent o f GDP as against the
budget estimate o f 2.5 per cent. Further, the revenue deficit and the fiscal deficit are projected to
decline only moderately to 4.0 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively during 2009-10. The year-

on-year growth in reserve money, as well as annual M growth, was much lower in 2008-09 than
in 2007-08. The combined market borrowings o f the Central and State Governments in 2008-09
were nearly two and half times their net borrowings in 2007-08.

2. As a result, since the onset o f the crisis, India has changed i t s stance from supporting
expansion to moderating inflation and preserving financial stability while arresting the economic
slowdown. The Government and RBI have undertaken a series o f measured monetary and fiscal
policy responses since September 2008 which were designed largely to mitigate the adverse
impact o f the global financial crisis and slowdown.in OECD demand on the Indian economy.
Consequently, the thrust o f the various policy initiatives by the Government and RBI has been on
providing adequate rupee liquidity, ensuring comfortable dollar liquidity and maintaining a
market environment amenable to the continued flow o f credit to productive sectors.43 The key
policy initiatives are as follows:

Monetary policy measures

3.   Policy Rate cuts
rn   The rep0 rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) was reduced by 400 basis points
     in five steps - from 9.0 per cent in October 2008 to 5.0 per cent in March 2009.
rn   The reverse rep0 rate under the LAF was reduced by 250 basis points in three steps - from
     6.0 per cent in December 2008 to 3.5 per cent in March 2009.

4.   Rupee Liquidity

     The cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement was reduced by 400 basis points in three steps -
     from 9.0 per cent o f net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) o f banks in October 2008 to 5.0
     per cent in January 2009.
rn   The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirement was reduced from 25.0 per cent o f NDTL to
     24.0 per cent in November 2008.
     The export credit refinance limit for commercial banks was enhanced to 50.0 per cent from
     15.0 per cent o f outstanding export credit.


42 M u c h o f the material in this Annex i s based o n the RBI Annual Policy Statement 2009-10.
43 RBI has multiple instruments at its command such as rep0 and reverse rep0 rates, cash reserve ratio (CRR),
statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), open market operations, including the market stabilization scheme (MSS) and the
LAF, special market operations, and sector-specific liquidity facilities. In addition, RBI also uses prudential tools to
modulate f l o w o f credit t o certain sectors consistent with financial stability. The availability o f multiple instruments
and flexible use o f these instruments in the implementation o f monetary policy has enabled RBI t o modulate the
liquidity and interest rate conditions amidst uncertain global macroeconomic conditions.

    A special 14-day term rep0 facility was instituted for commercial banks up to 1.5 per cent o f
    NDTL for addressing the liquidity concerns o f mutual funds, non banking finance companies
    and housing finance companies.
    A special refinance facility was instituted for scheduled commercial banks up to 1.O per cent
    o f each bank's NDTL as on October 24,2008.
    Special refinance facilities were instituted for financial institutions involved in small industry
    finance, housing, and external trade (SIDBI, NHB and Exim Bank).

     Forex Liquidity

    RBI sold foreign exchange (primarily U dollars) and made available a forex swap facility to
                                               S
    banks.
    The interest rate ceiling on Non-Resident Indian (NRI) deposits was raised by 75 basis
    points.
    The all-in (total) cost ceiling for external commercial borrowings (ECBs) o f average maturity
    period o f three years and up to five years was raised to 300 basis points, and over five years
    to 500 basis points, above 6-month LIBOR.
    The facility o f providing liquidity support for eligible nonbanking non-deposit taking
    systematically important financial companies, which was initially available for any paper
    issued up to March 31, 2009 was extended for any paper issued up to June 30, 2009. This
    would help them meet any temporary liquidity mismatches.

     Liquidity Impact
    The actions o f RBI since mid-September 2008 have resulted in increase o f liquidity by Rs
    4,228 billion (7.8% o f GDP). In addition, the permanent reduction in the SLR by 1.0 per
    cent o f NDTL gave an extra liquidity o f Rs. 400 billion (0.74% o f GDP) available for credit
    expansion (Table A. 1).

    The much needed liquidity significantly improved the overnight call market rates and other
    money market rates. Overnight call market rates fell from a high o f 19.5 percent on October'
    31,2008 to a low 3.25 percent on April 25,2009 (Figure A.l).

.   The softening o f overnight money market rates causes commercial banks to turn into the
    LAF window since mid-November 2008. In effect, liquidity constraints that mutual funds
    faced have since eased considerably, commercial banks have reduced their benchmark prime
    lending rates,the total utilization under the recent refinance/liquidity facilities introduced by
    RBI has been low, and the overall liquidity conditions remain comfortable. However, their
    availability has provided comfort to the banks/FIs, which can fall back on them in case o f
    need.

Regulatory forbearance measures

7. There have been several changes on regulatory forbearance since August 2008, including on
restructuring o f advances and o f f balance sheet exposures. Prudential norms on off-balance
sheet exposures for commercial banks were amended in October 2008. Prudential norms for
valuation, classification and operation o f investment portfolio o f commercial banks were
strengthened in July 2008. The most significant change has been on restructuring o f stressed
loans, identified as a one-time activity with a cutoff date o f March 31, 2009. It is noteworthy
that, despite this restructuring, provisioning by banks on the loans will continue, so the P&L
account of the banks will continue to reflect these expenses as was the case before. Further,
income recognition on the restructured portfolio will continue to be on cash basis and not on
accrual basis, as was the case before. Therefore, this forbearance measure i s relatively prudent
and will not reduce the transparency o f PSB portfolios.

Adoption of Basel I1 framework

8. An important recent development has been the adoption o f the Basel I1 framework by
foreign banks operating in India and Indian banks having an operational presence outside India.
Guidelines on the Revised Framework were issued on April 27, 2007. Foreign banks operating
in India and Indian banks having an operational presence outside India migrated to the Revised
Framework with effect from March 3 1, 2008, while all other banks migrated on March 3 1, 2009.


                                                 68
Banks are required to maintain a minimum CRAR o f 9 percent on an ongoing basis. Detailed
guidelines relating to Pillar 2 were also issued. In 2007/08 RBI reviewed the exposure norms
and risk weights for a few classes o f loans extended by banks.

Risk management

9. Several initiatives were taken by RBI during the year to further strengthen risk management
systems in banks, such as modifications in the asset-liability management (ALM) guidelines,
adoption o f guidelines on managing risks in outsourced financial services, and strengthening o f
the guidelines for exposure norms for commercial bank credit to individuals/groups, industry and
capital markets. Banks were also advised to avoid equity funding o f projects. Comprehensive
guidelines were issued to banks to do a proper risk assessment and accounting for the letters o f
credit issued by them. Guidelines on stress testing for commercial banks, K n o w Your Customer
and Anti-Money Laundering were also issued.

Deepening Financial Inclusion

10. Operative guidelines for mobile payments were issued on October 8, 2008. With the
objective o f achieving greater financial inclusion and increasing the outreach o f the banking
sector, banks were permitted to use the services o f NGOs/MFIs set up as societies, trusts, Section
25 companies, post offices, co-operative societies and more recently retired bank employees, ex-
servicemen and retired government employees as banking correspondents; a working group has
been constituted to examine h o w to scale up this model.

Capital Injections in PSB

 11. A part o f the Government's comprehensive stimulus program has included financial sector
and, specifically, banking sector measures. One component o f the program adopted by the
Government i s to provide budgetary resources to meet PSB capital requirements and to attain
their CRAR at 12 percent. Other components included actions with respect to SME finance,
housing finance, and steps to ensure the continued provision o f finance in other priority sectors.
To fill the need for budgetary resources, in December 2008 the Government o f India requested
the World Bank for financing o f Rs. 170 billion (US$ 3.4 billion), initially to help inject capital
into 19 PSB and NHB. The current market condition, limited market availability for Innovative
Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI)/ perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS), and
limited scope for dilution o f equity by banks, had led to the Government request. By providing
capital buffers, the Government aims to ensure adequate capital for PSB to continue to support
the credit requirements o f the economy to achieve higher levels o f economic growth.

12. Since December 2008, Government has announced a series o f capital infusions to the PSB.
The following are such infusions:
.     In February 2009, the Government announced a capital injection o f Rs. 38 billion (US$760
    million) for three PSB (UCO Bank, Central Bank o f India and Vijaya Bank), o f which the
    first tranche worth Rs. 19 billion (US$380 million) was released in March 2009. This action
    i s broadly in line with the Government request to the World Bank dated December 3 1, 2008,



                                                69
    where these three PSB had been listed as cumulatively qualifying for Rs. 30 billion (US$600
    million) capital support in 2008-09.

.   In. March 2009, the Government announced a capital infusion o f Rs. 8 billion (US$160
    million) for the United Bank o f India, a part o f which has already been released. This action
    i s broadly in line with the Government request letter dated December 3 1 , 2008, where this
    PSB had been listed as qualifying for Rs. 5 billion (US$lOO million) capital support in 2009-
    10.



Complementary fiscal and financial measures

 13. Three fiscal stimulus packages announced between December 2008 and February 2009
complemented the measures described above. The first package, at Rs. 320 billion, or 0.65
percent o f India's GDP, included (i) Rs. 200 billion (US$4 billion) o f extra spending primarily
                                        a
aimed at galvanizing rural infrastructure; (ii)      Central VAT rate cuts on all non-petroleum
products by 4 percent, which would reduce tax revenues by Rs. 87 billion; (iii)      specific measures
worth Rs. 18 billion for exporters in textiles, leather and jewelry sectors; and (iv) authorization
for I I F C L to raise Rs. 100 billion through tax-free bonds by end-March 2009 to facilitate the
availability o f long-term financing for infrastructure PPPs in India. The second fiscal stimulus
package included measures such as (i)     permitting states to raise additional borrowing to the tune
o f Rs. 300 billion (US$6 billion) for capital expenditure, (ii)        relaxing external commercial
borrowing norms, (iii)    providing capital to PSB to the tune o f Rs. 200 billion (US$4 billion) over
2 years, (iv) increasing foreign institutional investment limits in corporate debt from US$6
billion to US$15 billion in February 2009, and (v) sector specific measures focusing on reviving
the markets for automobiles, real estate, exports, NBFC and infrastructure. These measures have
eased the problems o f liquidity, as reflected in money market rates and the easing o f liquidity
positions o f mutual funds, banks and NBFC. It i s noteworthy that India's reaction to the crisis so
far shows two major differences compared, for example, to the US: lack o f central bank
involvement in direct lending to the private sector (RBI has left credit decisions to private and
public banks), and PSB maintaining credit growth at near to earlier levels.

                 Annex 5: Bank Lending and Capital-Scenario              Analysis

Two sets o f simulation exercises to estimate the capital requirements o f Indian banks have been
carried out by the Government and developed further by the World Bank team:

1. The simulation exercises by the Government for projecting the future capital needs o f 16
   PSB which are likely to receive Tier 1 capital support.
2. The stress test exercise for all banks (using the methodology o f the Financial Sector
   Assessment),

The assumptions and methodology underpinning these two sets o f simulation exercises are
described in this Annex.

Simulation Exercise 1: DFS Methodology

Assumptions and Methodology

The Department o f Financial Services (DFS) o f M O F undertook an estimation o f capital
requirements o f PSB that were identified by them as requiring Tier 1 capital support. The
estimates are based on actual data as o f March 2009 for each PSB. Capital requirements are
forecast until 201 1 under the following DFS assumptions:

a   Profits o f PSB in 2010 and 201 1 remain at 2009 levels in terms o f absolute amounts.
a   Provisions on standard assets in 2010 and 2011 remain at 2009 levels in terms o f absolute
    amounts.
    Risk weighted assets grow at 20 percent each year.
    80 percent o f net profit i s plowed back as incremental Tier 1 capital.
    Incremental Tier 2 capital equals incremental provisioning on standard assets.
    Tier 1 headroom i s not considered.
    Tier 2 headroom i s not considered.
    Even PSB with government shareholding well above 51 percent (the minimum government
    share requirement) will not access capital markets for raising Tier 1 equity capital by diluting
    government equity, as this option i s unattractive in the short-to-medium t e r m on account of
    likely l o w valuations.

The World Bank team undertook an independent simulation exercise based on the following
assumptions:

    Risk weighted assets grow at 17 percent each year in the base case (in line with the growth in
    overall banking sector credit o f 17.3 percent in 2008-09), at 12 percent in the "low" case and

.   at 25 percent in the "high" case.
    The growth rate o f assets and advances i s equal to growth rate o f risk weighted assets.




                                                71
.   Gross N P A amounts rise by 40 percent in 2010 and 80 percent in 201 1 in the base case; by
    30 percent in 2010 and 60 percent in 201 1 in the "low" case; and by 80 percent in 2010 and

.   150 percent in 201 1 in the "high" case.44
    Asset provisioning ratios are in line with the stipulated RBI provisioning norms based on
    ageing, and are assumed to be 0.40 percent for standard assets, 10 percent for sub-standard
    assets, 50 percent for doubtful assets, and 100 percent for the loss category. Where the N P A
    amounts for an N P A category are not available, a provisioning rate o f 50 percent has been

.
.
    applied to the overall N P A amount to estimate the total provisioning.
    80 percent o f net profit i s plowed back as incremental Tier 1 capital.

.
.
    Incremental Tier 2 capital equals incremental provisioning on standard assets.
    Tier 1 headroom i s not considered.

.   Tier-2 headroom i s not considered.
    Even PSB with a government shareholding level well above 51 percent (the minimum
    government share requirement) will not access the capital markets for raising Tier 1 equity
    capital by diluting government equity, as this option i s unattractive in the short to medium
    term on account o f likely low valuations.

Scenarios and Results

In the methodology described above, two parameters which could affect the final capital
requirements are allowed to change and their effects simulated-the yearly increase in Gross
NPA, and the yearly growth rate o f risk-weighted assets (a proxy for credit growth). While the
N P A growth levels are not strictly calibrated to different levels o f non-financial sector corporate
distress, they draw on similar scenarios used by other research f i r m s in their modeling exercises.
Varying these two parameters-Gross N P A and risk-weighted assets-provides a range o f
possible capital adequacy simulations for the period until 201 1. The results o f four o f these
simulations (ranging from optimistic to adverse, and including the simulation by DFS) have been
presented, using the following assumptions:

.   Scenario 1: Gross N P A amounts increase by 30-60 percent in 2010-1 1 over 2009; risk
    weighted assets grow by 12 percent (Low NPA-Low Credit Growth case).

44 A basis for these growth rates i s provided by an analysis o f the impact o f the restructuring measures

undertaken by the Government since August 2008. The analysis reveals that if h a l f o f all the restructured
loans are considered to be NPA, it would increase the N P A o f public sector banks by 38 percent (various
scenarios are summarized in the Table below).

             YO f restructured loans considered as NPA

                                 50                                         38
                                 75                                         57

The Government provided a time-bound window for restructuring standard loans (assets) as a key
forbearance measure. Between September 2008 and March 2009, public sector banks restructured
approximately Rs. 250 billion (US$5.3 billion) in standard assets. Since these were standard and not non-
performing assets, the calculations assume conservatively that, without restructuring, about half o f them
would have been classified as NPA.

    assets growth i s 17 percent (Mid N P A - M i d Credit Growth case).
    Scenario 3: Gross N P A amounts rise by 80-150 percent in 2010-1 1 over 2009; risk weighted
    assets growth i s 25 percent (High NPA-High Credit Growth case).

The results o f the W o r l d Bank team's simulations are o f the same order o f magnitude as the DFS
estimates. The results reflect the fact that a significant proportion o f the capital needs stem from the
problems in raising capital t o sustain credit side growth, This i s in the context o f a financial environment
affected by the global crisis, where capital valuations are unattractive and capital markets difficult to
access

In addition to the above, separate estimates were made o f the possible effects o n the need for capital when
credit growth rates (with an unchanged base NPA amount) were varied, and also when the growth rates of
NPA amounts changed over time (with an unchanged base credit growth rate). The objective was to
determine the need for capital for sustaining credit growth versus that arising out o f growing NPA. The
results are summarized below.

  Simulation Exercise 2: Financial Sector Assessment Methodology

  Assumptions

  The Self Assessment undertook a single factor-stress test o f the Indian banking system. It focused on an
  estimation o f capital requirements o f all banks when N P A levels were increased. I t assumed that, instead
  o f the actual N P A ratio as at end-March and end-September 2008, NPA would be higher by 100 percent
  and 150 percent o n those dates. The World Bank team built on this and undertook an identical estimation
  for March 2009, that is, by assuming that the N P A ratio at end-March 2009 was 100 percent and 150
  percent higher than the actual as o f that date.

  Methodology

  The methodology applied was as follows:

  .
  9
      The following groups o f banks were studied: all PSB, all private banks and all banks.
      For each group o f banks, the following actual balance sheet data as o f end March 2009 was collected:
      Assets, Risk Weighted Assets, Advances, Deposits, Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, CRAR, Net Profit,

  .   Return on Assets, Gross NPA, N e t N P A and Interest Income.
      For an X percent increase in Gross N P A (where X was 100 or 150 percent), the incremental

  .   provisioning amount was determined by using a 60 percent ratio o f Gross N P A .
      To reflect the reduced yield on the loan portfolio, Interest Income was reduced by an amount equal to
      the Gross NPA amount.
      The new equity capital was estimated by reducing the original equity capital by the incremental

  .   provisioning amount and the reduction in Interest Income.
      The CRAR was re-computed based on the new equity capital and the original risk-weighted assets.

  Results

  The results o f this static stock model calculation on various groups o f banks are as follows:




             CRAR                                                     12.3 1      15.05         13.20

             CRAR under 150 percent increase in NPA                   10.49       12.71         11.27




                                                        74
The results show the overall financial robustness o f the Indian banking sector. Given the larger capital
ratios o f the private sector banks (mainly on account o f their relatively slower credit growth last year), it
i s not surprising that, even under significant stress (150 percent increase in NPA), private banks do not
experience a reduction in their CRAR below 12 percent. In contrast, public sector banks, which also have
a healthy 12.3 percent C R A R currently, witness an immediate reduction in their CRAR to below 12
percent even under a lower 100 percent increase in NPA.

          Annex 7: Application o f Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

The design o f this Development Policy Loan has drawn on the lessons learned by the World
Bank on the application o f conditionality. The following are the good practice principles and
lessons applied to this DPL.

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership

The D P L supports a set o f measures that i s in line with the government's priorities. The
Government's financial sector reform program has focused on broadening financial access,
promoting efficiency through competition, and ensuring the stable and diversified domestic and
global growth o f Indian financial institutions. The programmatic set o f two DPL, o f which this
operation i s the first, i s fully aligned with reforms that have been developed by the Government
and implemented over the course o f several years. Most recently, the policy actions taken in the
area o f monetary, fiscal, trade and financial sector were in direct response to the global financial
crisis in an effort to stem the impact o f the crisis in India. These policy actions are consistent
with the laws and institutional arrangements already put in place by the Government and further
support the economy and the strength o f the banking sector. Policy actions proposed were also
presented by the Government and discussed with the World Bank team.

 Principle 2: Agree up front with government and partners on a coordinated accountability
framework

The policy matrix represents an agreed framework with Government, based on i t s own on-going
program. Moreover, the Government has publicized i t s intentions and objectives with regard to
injecting capital into the PSB through official notifications from the Press Information Bureau,
allocations in the Interim Budget, and official statements at the level o f the President and Finance
Minister. For the purposes o f this Program Document, the Government has also provided a
strategy paper that elucidates the principles and objectives o f banking reform in India, including
the place o f the capital injections for PSB within the framework o f India's multi-pronged
response to the global economic crisis (Annex 2: Medium Term Banking Strategy). This DPL
has been discussed with a number o f India's external development partners (outside o f the World
Bank Group) that are active in the financial sector. These include the IMF, ADB, DfID, KfW
and JICA. The policy matrix also sets out the outcome indicators with targets to be achieved by
the Government's program. The short and medium term program may need to be adjusted based
upon changing global events and domestic financial market conditions in the on-going economic
downturn.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities o Bank support to
                                                                    f
country circumstances

The policy matrix includes a subset o f reform measures that are part o f the Government's
broader development program. It does not pretend to capture the totality o f reforms or other
measures being implemented. The aim o f the program i s to support the Government's efforts to
ensure continued economic growth through adequate credit flows to contain the effects o f the
global economic slowdown on employment and poverty. Although the World Bank i s engaged in


                                                 80
a dialogue across a number o f policy areas, many policy actions are l e f t outside the scope o f the
DPL to allow for specificcountry circumstances and the political economy.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement

The actions supported by the operation are based on joint analytical work and technical
discussions with the authorities, the banks, and the private sector, and focus on issues that are
central to achieving the goal o f the Government to minimize the social and economic impact o f
the global economic downturn.

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent reviews conducive to predictable and performance based
financial support

The preparation o f this operation i s based on the Governments' request and need for budgetary
support, and based on reviews o f very detailed data provided by the Government. It i s further
based upon Government, third party and independent Bank analyses and stress testing directed at
meeting the goals set by the authorities.

IFC's Financial Sector & Banking Strategy (FY09-11)

I F C supports the World Bank Group India Country Assistance Strategy for FY09-12, especially
the Achieving Rapid, Inclusive Growth pillar. During the last few years, private sector banks
have grown significantly and have played a major role in the growth o f Indian economy, which
has resulted in a decline o f the public sector banks' market share, to 70% o f total assets and 74%
o f deposits as o n March 31, 2008. IFC's financial sector strategy in India aims to encourage
growth in the market share o f private sector banks and contribute to financial policies which
foster inclusive growth, increased banking penetration, development o f local financial markets,
and stability at the national and regional levels (including in the aftermath o f the global financial
crisis). I F C makes investments and provides advisory services to build capacity in private
financial institutions which contribute to financial deepening and the expansion o f financial
services to underserved segments. IFC's strategic objectives for the financial sector are:

     Increase access to finance for the under-served
     Improve infrastructure and housing finance
0    Enhance financial sector deepening
     Improve financing for social safety nets, including insurance, pension, education and health
0    Improve financing for environmental and social sustainability

Given regulatory constraint^^^, I F C will focus i t s financial sector strategy through the following
cluster o f activities:

     Promoting financial inclusion by:

        strengthening private commercial banks (especially those serving SMEs, energy
        efficiency products, health & education, infrastructure) through investment (equity, tier
        11, trade finance) and advisory services (microfinance downscaling, strategic planning,
        risk management)
        increasing the availability o f microfinance by investing in, and providing advisory
        services to, microfinance institutions and fimds
        investment and advisory support to help the development o f l o w income housing pilot
        projects and supporting financial institutions to set-up low-income housing finance
        business lines
        increasing the availability o f finance in rural areas and l o w income states by supporting
        NBFCs

45 The type, size and pricing of foreign investments in Indian banks and financial institutions are regulated by the
Reserve Bank o f India. In general, IFC and other Multilaterals cannot lend to financial intermediaries due to the
external commercial borrowing (ECB) guidelines instituted since 2002. IFC involvement in the sector i s therefore
limited (with few exceptions) to making equity investments in financial institutions. Foreign financial institutions
(including IFC) are limited to 5% equity stakes in private sector banks.




                                                        91
    Increasing the availability o f financing for activities which mitigate or adapt to climate
    change, especially renewable/clean energy, energy efficiency, and carbon reduction.
    Supporting regional integration and south-south cooperation, particularly the expansion o f
    Indian companies overseas and mobilization o f financial resources for off-shore Indian
    financial institutions.
    Capital Market Development to improve the mobilization o f long-term finance for
    infrastructure and increase the range o f instruments to enhance liquidity - through the
    development o f the long t e r m debt market, and support for specialized financial institutions.

IFC Role in Banking Sector in India: IFC's support through investments in Indian banks:

    Helps adequately capitalize private banks so as to achieve the credit growth needed to sustain
    India's economic growth.
    Enhances, via IFC's trade finance program, the credit profile o f India's private banks in
    international markets, especially in the context o f the global crisis which has raised
    counterparty risks.
    Facilitates the flow o f information on best practice techniques for bank operations, provided
    through I F C supported advisory services, with a particular emphasis on SME, rural finance,
    microfinance and housing finance. In addition I F C provides advisory services support and
    best practice for operational areas o f the bank such as risk and treasury management, ALM
    credit processes, and monitoring o f rapidly growing loan portfolios.
0   Creates visibility for the institutions to access international funding and play a catalytic role
    in attracting other private sector international investors to India's leading regional banks,
    thereby supporting increased competitiveness across the banking sector.
0   Assists investee banks develop strategies to expand operations in the rest o f India and help
    them become pan-India players.

IFC Response to the Global Financial Crisis: I F C has responded to the impact o f the global
financial crisis in India by:

0   Organizing Risk Management workshops to foster dialogue and encourage financial
    institutions to adopt best practices
0   Working closely with client companies to adapt and respond to the new economic
    environment
0   Providing advisory services in key areas such as corporate governance, loan portfolio
    workout, and risk management
0   Continuing to commit new financial market investments (an estimated 5 projects by end
    FY09)
0   Continuing to disburse on existing financial market commitments in a difficult market
    environment.
0   Leveraging i t s unique position to bring additional financing while remaining within existing
    country exposure limits. This will include making effective use o f IFC's global crisis
    response facilities (especially the Microfinance Enhancement Facility), working with other
    DFIs, and mobilizing as much as possible.

This note provides the IMF staffs assessment o f India's macroeconomic conditions, prospects,
and policies for the Banking Sector Support Loan that will be considered by the World Bank in
September 2009.

India's macroeconomic conditions have improved since end-2008, but the global crisis has
taken a toll on near-term economic prospects.

     Growth and Inflation. Real GDP growth slowed to 5.8 percent (y/y) in the second half o f
     2008/09, a significant deceleration from the pace recorded in recent years. From the supply
     side, service sector growth has been robust on the back o f resilient domestic demand, partly
     offsetting the sharp slowdown in m a n ~ f a c t u r i n gReal GDP growth for 2009110 i s projected
                                                               .~~
     at about 5% percent (from 6.7 percent in 2008/09), as the stimulus supports domestic
     demand. Weak global growth will continue to weigh on exports. Inflation has been on a
     declining trend this year, but the momentum has turned. W P I inflation, which turned negative
     in y/y terms in June, is expected to average 1% percent in 2009/10 and reach about 5%
     percent y/y by March 20 10 as base effects wane and the economy regains i t s footing.
.    Financial Markets and Credit. Financial market conditions have improved on the back o f
     global trends and the M a y elections results, which have boosted sentiment. The stock market
     i s up about 60 percent so far this year and normalcy has returned to the domestic money
     market. CDS spreads have receded significantly and stresses in nonbank financial institutions
     and mutual funds have abated. Private sector credit growth (nonfood) has picked up modestly
     in sequential terms and stood at 15.8 percent y/y in mid- July. Despite ample liquidity,
     lending rates have been sticky. The yield curve has steepened considerably, mainly on
     account o f fiscal concerns and S&P has downgraded the outlook on the sovereign rating to
     negative, citing concerns about the fiscal deficit.

     External Position. The current account deficit rose to 2.6 percent o f GDP in 2008/09 (from
     1.5 percent o f GDP in 2007/08) as goods exports plunged in the wake o f the global crisis and
     oil prices surged. The current account deficit i s projected to decline (in relation to GDP) in
     2009/10 helped b y lower o i l imports. Capital inflows have resumed on the back o f rising
     global risk appetite and improved domestic prospects, but remain well-below pre-crisis
     levels. The rupee was very volatile earlier this year but has since stabilized somewhat. Gross
     international reserves (US$268 billion as o f July 24) are sufficient to cover nearly 9 months
     o f goods and services imports and are more than 2% times short-term debt by residual
     maturity.




46 From the demand side growth was 4.1 percent y/y, driven by government consumption
reflecting the effect o f the stimulus measures.



                                                  95
.   Banking System. Banks, which dominate the financial system, appear well-capitalized,
    relatively liquid, and have l o w nonperforming asset ratios. However, over the last few years,
    a sharp increase in foreign liabilities, combined with rapid domestic credit expansion, has
    increased banks' vulnerability to global deleveraging and slowing economic activity.

Policy actions to cushion the blow from the global crisis have been broadly appropriate.

a   Monetary Policy. The Reserve Bank o f India (RBI) has cut the policy (repo) rate by 425
    basis points since October to 4% percent. In addition, the RBI has taken various measures to
    inject rupee and FX liquidity to ensure the availability o f credit, contributing to a
    normalization o f the money market. But bank credit has picked up only modestly.

    Fiscal Policy. The 2008/09 fiscal deficit reached 11 percent o f GDP (including subsidy-
    related bonds) owing to the sharp increase in o i l and fertilizer subsidies, a hike in wages, and
    pre-election spending, as well fiscal stimulus measures to counter the effects o f the global
    crisis The 2009/10 budget, unveiled on July 6, largely extends the expansionary fiscal stance
    in place. The central government deficit is targeted at 6% percent o f GDP, up % percentage
    point from 2008/09 mostly because o f higher pro-poor spending and tax relief measures. The
    consolidated general government deficit should, however, remain broadly unchanged, largely
    as a result o f savings on off-budget o i l subsidies. While continued fiscal stimulus was
    appropriate given the significant slowdown in growth, the budgeted deficit was somewhat
    larger than anticipated.

Looking ahead, India's medium-term prospects are favorable, but challenges remain.

    As the global economy regains i t s footing, real GDP growth i s projected to return to 7-8
    percent over the medium term, driven by private domestic demand.

    Fiscal consolidation remains a key challenge. The deterioration in fiscal conditions since FY
    2007/08 has made it more difficult to reduce general government debt (about 80 percent o f
    GDP), while creating room for social and infrastructure spending. Revenue and expenditure
    reform, notably reforming the subsidy system, remain pivotal to delivering long-lasting fiscal
    consolidation.

    Greater progress on the structural reform agenda i s also needed to spur growth, create jobs,
    and accelerate poverty reduction. Priorities include improving infrastructure and stepping up
    financial sector reform.

IMF Relations. The 2009 Article I V Consultation was concluded by the IMF's Executive Board
on February 6, 2009. The next Article I V Consultation i s expected to take place in the regular
12-month cycle.
