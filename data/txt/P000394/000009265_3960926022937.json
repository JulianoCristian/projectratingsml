          supports the Government policy of increasing agricultural\n            exports and rural incomes, and assisting the country to\n            respond to declining oil revenues.  Its main objective is to\n            help modernize the Cameroonian cocoa industry through\n            reforms in the incentive and institutional systems.\n            Specifically, the project seeks to (a) maintain cocoa\n            producer incentives at appropriate levels; (b) increase the\n            efficiency and effectiveness of the public enterprise\n            Societe de Developpement du Cacao (SODECAO) and increase\n            planting, pest control, research and road programs.\n            Additionally, it plans to (c) review and improve the\n            operations of cocoa marketing cooperatives and supporting\n            agencies; (d) launch a private medium-size plantation\n            development program; and (e) strengthen the Ministry of\n            Agriculture's capability for implementing the cocoa\n            development strategy incorporated into this project and\n            monitoring its execution."}, "docdt": "1988-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
