For BDC, the project would help finance a\n            proposed investment program of US$30 million for FY84-86.\n            Sixty percent of those investments will be directly in\n            productive sub-projects in industry and agriculture,\n            including commercial mixed farming, dairy farming,\n            agro-processing, and metal fabrication. A significant\n            proportion will be for the development of industrial estates\n            and factory shells. The project would also provide technical\n            assistance of US$800,000 to strengthen NDB's capability\n            for playing a leading role in the development of small- and\n            medium-scale enterprises; and US$200,000 for studies on the\n            future of the declining mining community of Selebi-Phikwe.\n            NDB sub-projects will include textile production,\n            construction, metal-work, woodworks, general wholesale,\n            retail and distribution operations, and four comparatively\n            large operations in commercial agriculture."}, "docdt": "1984-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
