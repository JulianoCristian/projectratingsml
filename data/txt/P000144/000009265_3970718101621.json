For BDC, the project would help finance a\n            proposed investment program of US$30 million for FY84-86.\n            Sixty percent of those investments will be directly in\n            productive sub-projects in industry and agriculture,\n            including commercial mixed farming, dairy farming,\n            agro-processing, and metal fabrication.  A significant\n            proportion will be for the development of industrial estates\n            and factory shells.  The project would also provide\n            technical assistance of US$800,000 to strengthen NDB's\n            capability for playing a leading role in the development of\n            small- and medium-scale enterprises; and US$200,000 for\n            studies on the future of the declining mining community of\n            Selebi-Phikwe.  NDB sub-projects will include textile\n            production, construction, metal-work, woodworks, general\n            wholesale, retail and distribution operations, and four\n            comparatively large operations in commercial agriculture."}, "docdt": "1984-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
