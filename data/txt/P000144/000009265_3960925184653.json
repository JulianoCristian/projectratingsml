In general, the\n            relationship between the Bank and the involved parties in\n            Botswana was satisfactory during most of the project. The\n            relationship with the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC)\n            was good throughout. The BDC management was quite positive\n            about the support and advice it received from Bank missions.\n            The Bank's relations with the National Development Bank\n            (NDB) were more volatile. The Bank was mildly criticized for\n            not having been more supportive, especially by the\n            Government, during NDB's 1985 collections drive, which\n            was derailed by politics. In view of the major problems,\n            supervision should have been better documented; during\n            discussions for the project completion report, discussions\n            with task managers and staff involved during implementation\n            indicated that many discussions went on that were not fully\n            captured in the existing documentation. Disbursements were\n            not always recorded by subprojects, particularly the smaller\n            ones, which has impeded the analysis of the use of funds for subprojects."}, "docdt": "1993-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
