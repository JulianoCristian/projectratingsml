Proiect   :         The objectives of the proposed project are to strengthen
and expand the Ministry of Public HealthVs (MOPE)
continued efforts to improve rural health care, to
improve the efficiency, coverage and quality of the
national immunization program for children, to initiate
improved drug quality control and to develop new
coumuoicable and chronic disease preventive strategies
and health care financing systems in rural areas. The
project consists of four main components:  (a) Pural
UaiLk - expansion and qualitative improvement (through
construction, equipment, technical assistance. personnel
recruitment and training) of preventive and curative
health services in the poorer rural counties of five
provinces (Gansu, Hubei, Jilin, Sichuan and Ningzia Rui)
and strengthening of the disease monitoring and control
activities and immnization delivery and management of
the epidemic prevention stations in these and three
additional provinces (Heilongjiang, Jiangxi and
Shandong);  (b) Vaccine Production - iwprovement in the
coverage and cost effectiveness of the national
iinwnization program against the main childhood diseases
through construction and rehabilitation of three
national centers for the production of essential
vaccines meeting international quality standards; (c)
Dma Oualitv Control - improvement of the quality
control of drugs used in China through construction,
equipment, training, fellowships sud technical
assistance; (d) Ouerational Research - undertaking
research (i) to strengthen the capacity of the National
Center for Preventive Medicine (NCPM) for disease
surveillance and disease prevention strategies and (ii)
to test new approaches to rural health insurance.

Bzperience with the Rural Health and Nedical Education
project, and with preparation of the proposed project,
indicates that NMPI has the management capacity and
coumituent needed for successful implemeta tion of the
rural health component and, with the assistance of
ezperienced international vaccine firos, the vaccine
production component. Consequently no *ajor
implementation risks are anticipated. Implementation of
the operational research component, bowever, does carry
inherent risk in that it may take time for NCPN, a newly
created amalgmation of previously independent research
institutes, to shift from laboratory to policy-focused
research. To miniize this risk NCP's program will be
monitored closely by NOPE and the Bank Group. In the
drug quality control component, there is a risk that the
expected impact may be compromised by difficulties in
coordinating tbe activities of MOPE and the State
Pharmaceutical Administration. To min-imie the risk
that investments in quality control would not be
effectively utilized because industrial capabilities
could not keep pace with rapidly improving quality
measurement standards, the project will finance only the
first phase of the MOPE program to raise drug quality
testing capacity.

CHINA
RURAL HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PROJECT
I. THE HEALTH SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.01      Since the early 1950s, China has made remarkable progress in
improving health and nutrition. Many factors have contributed to this
achievement, including greater and more equitable food distribution,
improved water supply and sanitation, a higher literacy rate and advances in
education. The health system's strong emphasis on prevention, community
mobilization and financing, and paramedical field workers (barefoot doctors)
have also contributed greatly to progress. However, China's health care
system is entering a period of transition. The changing epidemiological
profile and emerging health problems of the 1980s and beyond will
increasingly mean that curative as well as preventive health care needs must
be adequately and economically addressed. A detailed assessment of China's
achievement and prospects in the health sector was undertaken by a Bank
mission in October 1982. The mission's report is entitled The Health Sector
in China, A World Bank Country Study, 1984.
B.  Realth and Population Status
1.02      Health conditions in China have improved dramatically since the
1950s and are now far better than in other lov-income countries. Infant
mortality has fallen from close to 200 per 1,000 live births in the early
1950s to below 40 per thousand today. At the same time, life expectancy at
birth rose by 70Z from about 40 years in the early 1950s to 67 years in
1983. The extent and rapidity of these mortality declines are remarkable
and probably unprecedented for a country of China's relatively low income
level. Current mortality rates in China compare very favorably to the
average infant mortality rate of more than 100 per thousand and average life
expectancy of about 50 years in other low-income countries. However, these
national averages conceal vide variations within the country. Life
expectancy appears to be higher in the more heavily populated and advanced
northeastern provinces and coastal areas than in inland and border regions
and is also higher in urban than in rural areas.



1.03      Significant declines have been achieved in fertility.  The total
fertility rate remained high at about 6.5 from the mid-1950s through the
late 1960s, despite a temporary reduction associated with the 1959-62
famine. Following the introduction of strong fertility limitation policies
in th early 1970s. the total fertility rate fell sharply to only 2.3 in
1979. Fertility has since turned upwards slightly, probably as a short-
lived result of the relaxation in policy regarding age at first marriage and
the consequently increased rate of family formation (marriage followed by
first births). Overall, according to Bank estimates, the average annual
population grovth rate has decreased from 2.7% i.- the period 1965-73 to 1.5Z
between 1973 and 1983 and is projected to fall further to 1.2% between 1980
and 2000.
1.04      Many once important communicable diseases such as smallpox,
cholera, plague and Kalaazar have been virtually eradizated. Diphtheria and
poliomyelitis have been almost eliiminated and the incidence of other
infectious and parasitic diseases nas been reduced. However, continuing
deficiencies in hygiene and human waste treatment cause the persistence of
diseases such as hepatitis and dysentery. Malaria and schistosomiasis
remain problems and their control is a public health priority.
Tuberculosis, the main cause of death in 1949, still affects nearly one
percent of the pcpulation and remains a major health haza-4. Chronic
bronchitis, associated with smoking and severe air pollution, is reported in
3.5% of the population. In China, as in the industrialized countries,
cancer, cardiovascular diseases and accidents now account for most deaths
(see Annex 2). Due to inevitable aging of the population, morbidity and
mortality associated with chronic diseases are likely to become even more
prevalent. For example, the number of cases of hypertension can be expected
to more than double between 1980 and 2010.
C. Health Sector Services
1.05      At the apex of China's rural health system are approximately 2,100
counties, each of which has a county hospital, an epidemic prevention
station (EPS), a Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinic, and a health
personnel training center. County facilities are funded by the Government
through the province and county health bureaus which are responsible for
overall direction, technical support and supervision c. all county service
delivery. Belov the county facilities are health centers at the township
level. In 1981, some 55,000 or 90 percent of all townships had such
centers, averaging about 14 beds, which are responsible for routine curative
and preventive services. The operation of these centers is financed by
county subsidies (either full or partial subsidy of salaries) plus user
charges (for drugs and services). At the village level, more than 90% of
the villages have a health station with one or more barefoot doctors. Many
village-level services have, in the past, been financed by cooperative
health insurance, vhich was funded jointly by annual prepavments of
individual members and appropriations from village welfare funds. However
health insurance coverage bas declined dramatically, from 85% of villages in
1975 to 58% in 1981 and to only a negligible proportion today. This has



- 3 -
resulted from the introduction of the rural production responsibility system
which removed the institutional and fiscal basis of cooperative insurance at
village level.
1.06      Although the urban population comprises only 21Z of the total,
urban health services are quantitatively very important. They account for
about half of total hospital beds and salaried health anpower available in
the entire health sector, and recent trends show a more rapid increase in
resources for urban than for rural health care in China. The size of the
urban sector reflects the high effective demand for services resulting from
the extensive insurance coverage provided to urban' residents under the
Government and labor health insurance schemes. State enterprises play a key
role both in financing and in directly providing urban health services.
Approximately half of urban health resources are owned by enterprises.
1.07      At the national level, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPE)
supervises activities of the provincial health bureaus. MOPH has broad
responsibility for health policy, for preparation of an annual plan, for
supervision of medical and paramedical education and for coordination with
related ministries and agencies. MOPH is directly responsible for thirteen
core medical universities, for medical research, for the vaccine production
institutes and for the National Center for Preventive Medicine.
1.08      The licensing of new drugs and the supervision and control of
production, '-rketing and utilization are part of the mandate assigned to
NOPH by the new Pharmaceutical Administration Law which became effective
July 1, 1985. The drug manufacturers (about 1,800 in China), under the
general plan of production marketing of the State Pharmaceutical
Adminirtration, are responsible for the quality and quantity of the drugs
approved by NOPH. Tests of pharmaceuticals are carried out by the 29
provincial and municipal institutes. Biological products and vaccines are
produced in seven institutes under the control of MOPH. Each institute
produces vaccines, blood derivatives and biological reagents, except for the
Kunming Institute which specializes in poliomyelitis. None of these
vaccines meet the international standards for safety and potency established
by the World Health Organization (WHO).
1.09      The National Center for Preventive Medicine (NCPM) was created in
1983 to coordinate seven research institutes. NCPN has begun to pursue its
principal objectives of conducting research on preventive medicine and
coordinating similar research programs throughout the country, assisting
provincial health institutions and training public health professionals for
service in the provinces, monitoring epidemic prevention and quarantine
programs, and developing the scientific basis for establishing regulations,
standards and appropriate public health priorities and policies.
D.  Healt1 Sector Policies
1.10      China's progress in improving the health of its people is due in
part to effective health delivery and to the policies on whi.h such delivery



-4-
is based. During the last two decades China has emphasized preventive over
curative services more strongly than most low-income countries. China's
policies have always reached beyond the health system itself, stressing the
importance of nutrition, water supply and sanitation, education and reduced
fertility.  China has also pioneered the concept of community-financed
auxiliary health workers, known as barefoot doctors. Consistent with
China's priorities for poverty reduction through rural development and
provision of basic social services, a substantial volume of financial
resources (over 3Z of GDP at present) has been mobilized for health from
central and local governments, insurance systems and community and private
expenditures. As a result the resources available for health care,
particularly in poor areas, are significantly higher than in comparable
areas of most low-income countries.
1.11      The Government's current medium-term health policy objectives
include the following:
(a)   to promote prevention by strengthening anti-
epidemic activities, improving the management
of immunization campaigns, and identifying
preventive measures against chronic diseases;
(b)   to strengthen and consolidate rural health
services by upgrading county-level health
institutions and major township health centers
and promoting barefoot doctors to rural
doctors after they have received sufficient
training; and
(c)   to intensify medical research and training of
health professionals and improve the technical
and administrative management of health
delivery, and to improve the quality,
production and distribution of pharmaceuticals
and to ensure that they are properly used.
1.12      Rural Health Poliy.  The national program, designed to strengthen
rural health services, is called the One-Third County Upgrading Program.
The program is to be implemented in three phases, each covering about one-
third of the counties and lasting five years. The program's major focus is
to strengthen the four county-level health institutions - the general
hospital, the epidemic prevention center, the maternal and child health
center and the training center - together with the major township health
centers. An important policy innovation is the development of selected
centers as major township health centers designed to serve an intermediate
referral function between ordinary centers and county hospitals. Investment
in the program during 1980-1982 totaled Y 443 million, and was allocated
mainly to construction and purchase of equipment. Provincial budgets
financed the largest share (48X), followed by county budgets (29Z), and
self-financing by beneficiary institutions (18%). In general,
implementation performance has been uneven. Investment per county ranged



- 5 -
from as little as Y 0.5 million in Shanxi Province up to Y 4.4 million in
Shanghai. There has been no detailed evaluation of the impact of the
program to date but a preliminary HOPH assessment judged implementation to
be satisfactory in about two-thirds of the participating counties. Poor
performance was attributed principally to insufficient financing and
ineffective management.
E. Bealth Sector Finance
1.13      Estimates for 1981 indicate that China spent 3.3Z of GDP on health
services, a relatively high proportion compared with other low-income coun-
tries. Total expenditures were US$7.50 per capita, of which 95Z was
recurrent expenditure. The major sources of finance for recurrent
expenditure were individual payment for drugs and services, labor insurance
schemes and go-rernment subsidies. Expenditures were mainly for drugs (58Z,
of which the bulk were Western medicines), salaries (20x) and hospital care
(132). Urban expenditure in 1981 was estimated at about US$16.50 per capita,
more than double the national average and almost four times greater than the
rural average of US$4.50 per capita. The major cause of this disparity is
the uneven distribution of state subsidies, especially for insurance schemes
covering urban residents.
1.14      Important features of healtb financing in China are the emphasis on
cost recovery, the consequent importance of health insurance and, until
recently, the extensive degree of insurance coverage. Estimates for 1981
indicated that 43% of total expenditure was mediated through healtb insurance
schemes. About 70% of the population benefited from some type of insurance
coverage. Hovever, since the early 1980s the virtual collapse of the rural
cooperative insurance schemes associated with the dissolution of the commtnes
and production brigades has essentially limited insurance coverage to the
urban minority and enterprises employees. This important new development in
the health sector presents policy issue for MOPE, particularly because
Government also wants to encourage hospitals to become financially self-
supporting by increasing cost recovery and reducing reliance on state
subsidies. Development of affordable and efficient rural insurance coverage
is high on HOPE's medium-term policy agenda so that rurallurban inequities in
access to health care do not threaten many of the past gains.
F. Sectoral Issues
1.15      Consolidation of Past Gains.  Although China's progress in reducing
morbidity and mortality has been considerable, this achievement remains
incomplete 2_ several important respects. First, improvements in health
conditions have not been uniform. Hajor differences in health status and in
the availability of health resources continue to exist between rural and
urban areas, and these are reflected in wide disparities between provinces.
While effective systems of health delivery have been established in urban
areas, similar improvements have not been extended to many poor rural areas.



- 6 -
These improvements will inevitably require mobilization of increased central
and provincial finance for provision of rural health services in order to
offset the limitations of local fiscal self-reliance introduced by fiscal
decentralization.
1.16      Communicable Diseases.  Hepatitis, dysentery and tuberculosis are
not yet under control and there are still problems with the vaccine-
preventable diseases which typically account for the bulk of infant and child
mortality in developing courtries. Although the national immunization
program has made considerable progress, its success is still constrained by
the poor quality of domestically produced vaccines, lack of refrigeration to
preserve vaccine potency during transport to the field, and the infrequent
scheduling of immunization sessions, which leaves unprotected children who
are either too young or too old to receive immunization when it is offered.
Evidence of under-reporting of disease incidence and over-reporting of
immunization coverage rates also points to a need to strengthen program
management. (See Annex 3, Table 3).
1.17      New ChallennKes.  China's transition to a predominantly chronic
disease profile has been induced in part by Cbina's past success in disease
control and is being reinforced by the shift to an older age-structure as a
result of the one-child family planning policy. Prevention is a much harder
task for now-communicable diseases but the development of effective yet low
cost strategies for chronic disease prevention and treatment is the major
priority in the health sector. This will require reconsideration of the role
of the epidemic prevention stations which have been narrowly focused on
infectious disease control. It will be increasingly important for urban
hospitals to provide specialized curative services as part of a hospital
referral system serving both rural and urban populations. With the groving
cost pressures that accompany a rise in demand for specialized hospital
services, there will also be a need to contain costs by eliminating
inefficiencies in service provision throughout the health sector. This will
require improved hospital management, revision of incentives that encourage
excessive service provision and avoidance of wasteful duplication of services
such as the development of curative facilities in maternal and child health
stations. Additional important issues in the sector include cost recovery
and financing policies for both capital and recurrent costs; development of
affordable and efficient insurance coverage particularly in the rural areas;
and organizational and regulatory reforms to improve pharmaceutical quality.
G. Bank Role and Assistance Stratefv
1.18      Bank Group lending operations in China's health sector so far
comprise one IDA credit (Cr. 1472-CH&) of US$85 million equivalent for the
Rural Health and Medical Education (R ME) Project approved by the Executive
Directors on May 3, 1984. The project-s two major objectives are to develop
new approacbes to upgrading health service in rural areas and to improve the
quality of medical eduication. The REME project is now in its second full
year of implementation, and performance to date has been fully satisfactory.
In the rural health component, participating provinces have endorsed the



-7-
methodology developed by Bank Group staff and consultants for preparing
county plans. and other counties and provinces have begun to use the
methodology. Programs aimed at improving the reporting system for disease
monitoring and establishing standard procedures in hospital care management
have been extended to non-participating counties. Construction under the
project has been implemented ahead of schedule and the output of training
programs has exceeded the target set during project appraisal. In the
medical education component, the experience of project preparation and
implementation in the 13 medical universities serves as a basis to design the
reform of curricula and medical education policies currently under
preparation. This reform will later be introduced in provincial and other
non-project medical colleges.
1.19      The Bank Group's strategy for the proposed project and future
lending in the health sector is to focus on policy and institutional changes
needed to address inequities in health conditions in poor rural areas,
lingering problems of communicable disease and the emerging problems of
chronic disease. It will also assist China to gain access to new medical
tecbnologieis that will lead to more efficient use of resources as well as
support the Government's agenda for reform in systems for supplying and
financing bealth services.  Bank Group sector and project work in health is
aimed to build the basis for a sound dialogue on key policies, meet high
priority needs and have a clear demonstration effect consistent with these
strategies.  The proposed project contributes to this objective, particularly
through rural health investments, the upgrading of vaccines, and monitoring
cf pharmaceutical production, and support for operational research into new
preventive strategies and alternative rural insurance systems.
II. THE PROJECT
2.01      The project was first presented to the Bank Group in July 1984 and
subsequently prepared by MOPH with the assistance of WHO consultants. A Bank
Group mission appraised the project in July 1985. Negotiations were held in
Washington in April 1986 with a delegation led by Mr. Luo Qing of the
Ministry of Finance and included representatives of the State Planning
Commission and Ministry of Public Health. A map (IBRD No. 19288) of the
country showing the project locations is attached.
A. Project Objectives and Scope
2.02      The objectives of the proposed project are to strengthen and expand
MOPH's continued efforts to improve rural health care, to improve the
efficiency, coverage and quality of the national immmnization program for
children, to initiate improved drug quality control and to develop new
communicable and chronic disease preventive strategies and health care
financing systems in rural areas.



- 8 -
2.03      The project consists of four main components:  (a) Rural Health -
expansion and qualitative improvement (througb construction, equipment,
technical assistance, personnel recruitment and training) of preventive and
curative health services in the poorer rural counties of five provinces
(Gansu, Hubei, Jilin, Sichuan and Ningxia Hui) and strengthening of the
disease monitoring and control activities and immunization delivery and
management of the epidemic prevention stations in these and three additional
provinces (Heilongjiang, Jiangxi and Shandong); (b) Vaccine Production -
improvement in the coverage and cost effectiveness of the national
immunization program against the main childhood diseases through construction
and rehabilitation of three national centers for the production of essential
vaccines meeting international quality standards; (c) Drug Quality Control -
improvement of the quality control of drugs used in China through
construction, equipment, training, fellowships and technical assistance; (d)
Operational Research - undertaking research (i) to strengthen the capacity
of the National Center for Preventive Medicine for disease surveillance and
disease prevention strategies and (ii) to test new approaches to rural health
insurance.
B. Proiect Components
Rural Health
2.04      The purpose of this component is to upgrade the coverage and
quality of preventive and curative health services in about 50 poor rural
counties in five provinces (Gansu, Sichuan, Hubei, Jilin and Ningxia Hui) and
it will strengthen and reorient disease monitoring and prevention efforts in
these and three additional provinces (Heilongjiang, Jiangxi and Shandone.)
(see Annex 4, Table A for summary statistics by province). Each of the eight
participating provinces prepared an investment program based on overall
project objectives and consistent with the national One-Third County Program.
The provincial investment programs and implementation plan were the basis of
project design and project cost estimates.
2.05      To improve health care at the county level in the five provinces
the project will upgrade or construct hospitals, maternal and child health
centers, epidemic prevention stations and training centers. Below county
level the project will support the establishment of a network of major
township health centers and in some cases will rehabilitate existing health
centers. Major health centers are designed to provide basic inpatient care
that serves an intermediate referral function between ordinary healtb centers
and the county hospital. Total construction is estimated at about 471,100
m2, of which about 113,103 m2 is for facilities below county level (sep Annex
4, Table B for details).
2.06      Equipment and vehicles, including teaching aids in the training
centers, will be provided to strengthen laboratories, clinical diagnosis,
cold chain, X-ray facilities, operating rooms, outpatient clinics, and
training facilities.



- 9 -
2.07      Selected ccunties are generally much poorer than those supported in
the REME project. In Gansu, one of the poorest provinces in China, the
participating counties come from the lover two-thirds of the per capita rural
income distribution. Participating counties in the other provinces have been
selected from the lowest one-third of the income distribution. Also
considered in the selection of counties were implementation and management
capability, geographic distribution, relative severity of health problems,
and strength of local government commitment. (See Annex 5).
2.08      In all eight provinces the component will strengthen disease
monitoring and control activities and immunization delivery and management
functions of the provincial epidemic prevention stations through expansion of
the provincial stations, equipment and vehicles, staff training, fellowships
and technical assistance. Cold storage facilities will be constructed at
prefecture level wherever needed to ensure an effective cold chain for
expanded, effective vaccine distribution. In Heilongjiang, Jiangxi and
Shandong provinces the component focuses on improving the management of
preventive health programs, with special emphasis on priority diseases.
These include programs to strengthen child immunization in Heilongjiang,
screening for hemorrhagic fever in Jiangxi, and screening for leprosy and
tuberculosis in Shandong. Project activities in these provinces will also
include improved disease surveillance of a wide range of both communicable
and non-communicable diseases.
2.09      For the component as a whole, improved outreach, patient care and
management will be supported by training in the following areas: (a)
pre-service training of primary health workers at the county level, and of
middle level workers at the province level; (b) upgrading of professional
skills in specific disciplines and subjects, such as improved clinical
practice for doctors and equipment maintenance for general service staff; and
(c) specialized training for doctors and supervisors in technical fields
such as epidemiology, statistics and management. An extensive program has
been organized by MOPH and the health bureaus in participating provinces.
County training schools will be eetablished or upgraded in all participating
counties. Provincial training centers will be upgraded to in-service schools
for medical cadres. Local trainers and consultants from universities,
medical schools, NCPM, provincial hospitals and other high level institutions
inm China will organize a series of training workshops, assist in design of
curricula for in-service training and provide on-the-job training in medical
procedures and nise of equipment. An estimated 72,000 health staff will
benefit from some kind of retraining during project implementation (see Annex
4, Table C for summaries of provincial training requirements). Additional
personnel (doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, administrators and
trainers) will be recruited after the expansion in the scope and quality of
health services.
Vaccine Production _or Im_Lroved Imunization
2.10      China tlis produced essential vaccines for cbildhood diseases for
some years in seven institutes under the MOPH. However, problems of vaccine
quality and potency, use of liquid, rather than freeze-dried vaccine, and



- 10 -
weaknesses in the cold chain have made Cbina's immunization p:.ogram less
effective and more expensive than it should be. The vaccine component of the
project will strengthen the national immunization program by enabling China
to produce improved-quality essential vaccines that meet quality standards
for potency and safety established by the World Pealth Organization. The
component will also provide for packaging of vaccines in small numbers of
doses appropriate for frequent immunization programs in villages. Improved
packaging , and freeze drying, will also allow transport with less vulnerabi-
lity to temperature variation and provide a longer shelf life. These quality
improvements, combined with revision of the national immunization schedule,
are expected to yield a significant improvement in the coverage and cost-
effectiveness of the national childhood immunization program.
2.11      Specifically, the component will:
(a) establish a new production center for oral poliomyelitis
vaccine (OPV) in Kunming, Yunnan Province, with an annual
production capacity of 100 million doses of liquid trivalent
vaccine. The rest of the annual requirement (about 40 million
doses) will continue to be produced in the Beijing institute;
Cb) establish two new production centers for essential vaccines,
including DPT, tetanus toxoid, and freeze-dried measles
vaccine, in Sbanghai and Lanzbou (Gansu Province), each with
an annual production capacity of 100 million doses of DPT, 40
million doses of tetanus toxoid, and 20 million doses of
measles vaccine; and
Cc) rehabilitate the quality control laboratories in each of the
three sites, using existing buildings.
2.12      During negotiations, understanding was reached on (i) a timetable
for transitional and final implementation of the revised immunization
schedule as recommended by the WHO preparation team and used to estimate the
annual production requirements of vaccine; and (ii) a monitoring system and
procedures by which MOPH will evaluate effectiveness of the new vaccines.
Assurance vas obtained that all domestic production of DPT and measles
vaccines, tetanus toxoid and OPV will, after one year from the start of
operation of vaccine production centers under the project, meet the
international guidelines established by WHO on the quality of biological
products, including vaccines,
Drug Qualitv Control
2.13      This component will assist MOPH to routinely monitor the quality
and safety of pharmaceuticals, both domestic and imported, and to evaluate
the properties and adverse effects of new drugs to be introduced on the
market.



- 11 -
2.14      The program developed by the MOPH will be implemented in stages,
enabling the manufacturers to progressively raise the quality of the products
and to adjust to higher production standards. To provide the basis for a
further dialogue with Government on the issues of manufacturing, teeting,
evaluation and control, the project will support the first phase of such a
rehabilitation program and will consist of:
(a) upgrading three municipal institutes in Beijing, Tianjin and
Shanghai for drug quality control. Each of them will become
the national referral center for a given category of
pharmaceuticals. Each will assist NOPH to develop quality
standards and training for staff working in the 26 provincial
institutes for drug quality control;
(b) training pharmaceutical administrators and drug quality
inspectors in the Western China Medical University and
Zhejiang Medical University. Enrollment of small groups of
20-30 students for successive specialized sessions will result
in the training of 140 to 280 persons/year in each college;
and
Cc) developing clinic pharmacology and laboratory facilities in
the clinical pharmacology units of the Medical University of
Beijing and the Medical University of Shanghai. Each unit
will undertake tasks assigned by the Bureau of Drug Policy and
Administration for evaluating the pharmarco- dyna-.ics.
toxicity, and clinical effects of about eight new compounds
every year.
Operational Research
2.15      Building upon the assistance provided under the RHME project, this
component will strengthen research programs of the NCPM which are designed to
improve disease monitoring, identify new preventive health strategies,
support epidemic prevention stations, and develop the analysis and exchange
of information. The support would include construction, equipment, foreign
technical assistance and overseas fellowships.
2.16      The component will also support an experiment aimed at implementing
and evaluating several new health insurance schemes to contribute to the
formulation of a new national policy on rural health insuraace. The
experiment would test the feasibility of introducing new rural insurance
arrangements that would: (a) provide more extensive risk-pooling; (b) be
financially independent of state subsidies yet affordable for the majority of
rural inhabitants, and (c) minimize incentives for unnecessary use of
curative services while retaining incentives for preventive care. The three-
year experiment would be implemented in two counties in Sichuan province
under the overall direction and management of MOPH. Assurancea were obtained
that MOPH would carry out the experiment with the assistance of conbultants
and in accordance with terms of reference and time schedule acceptable to the
Bank Group. MOPH confirmed that appropriately qualified staff would be



- 12 -
assigned from both central and provincial levels to direct and manage this
experiment. Detailed background and description of the rural health
insurance experiment is contained in Annex 6.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
3.01      Total Droiect costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated
to be US$177.4 million or Y 567.5 million equivalent, net of duties and
taxes from which the project will be exempt. The foreign exchange cost
would be US$78.7 million (44Z of the total). Project costs by objective and
by expenditure category are summarized in Tables III.1  nd II1.2, and
details are given in Annex 7. Equipment lists for rural health, drug
quality control and operational research have been prepared and unir prices
are based on January 1986 world market prices for imported equipment. The
cost of equipment and materials to be procured locall, and not to be
financed by the Bank Group was estimated on the basis of current domestic
prices. Costs for the vaccine production component are estimated on the
basis of bid prices received by MOPH in April 1986.
3.02      Contingencies.  Physical contingencies of 1OZ of base costs are
provided for construction, vehicles, equipment and technical assistance
except for vaccine production which includes an allowance of 25 Z to reflect
a margin of uncertainty attached to the base cost estimate pending award and
negotiation of contracts. Price contingencies are based on the following
expected rates of increase for both domestic and international prices: 7.2%
for 1986; 6.8% for 1987 and 1988; 7.0% for 1989; 7.1% for 1990; and 4.0% for
1991. Physical contingencies total 13X of base costs and price
contingencies are 14% of base costs plus physical contingencies.
3.03      Recurrent Costs.  Project investment in rural health will increase
recurrent outlays in the 50 participating counties by about Y 8.2 million
commencing in 1988, or about Y 164,000 per county. In 1984, total recurrent
health expenditures in the provinces of Jilin, Sichuan, Hubei and Gansu
averaged about Y 1.8 million per county, which is projected to increase to
about Y 2.7 million per county in 1988. The incremental recurrent expendi-
tures generated by the project represent about 9.5% of total recurrent
health expenditures of the aeove four provinces in 1984, and about 6% of
projected total recurrent health expenditures for the same provinces in
1988. Project investments in drug quality control and operational research
are expected to generate only minimal incremental recurrent expenditure
requirements for operation and maintenance of new equipment.

B. Financine Plan
3.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million equivalent and IDA Credit
of SDR 57.2 million (US$65 million equivalent) will finance 45Z of total
project costs, including all foreign exchange costs (US$78.7 million) and
US$1.3 million or 1.3% of local costs. The local counterpart contribution
for the Rural Health component will be provided by province and county-level
budgets. Local financing for other project components will be provided by
the Central Government.
C. Procurement
3.05      Vaccine Production Comnonent.  Under ICB prccedures according to
the Bank Procurement Guidelines, eligible firms were prequalified to bid for
this component in July 1985. Criteria for prequalification included (a)
experience a,. a major international producer with production capacity
comparable to that required under the proposed project; (b) commitment to
continued future production so as to ensure continuity in transfer of
technology; and (c) proven experience of technology transfer to other
countries. Of ten bidders expressing potential interest, two were
prequalified for the OPV production center and two for the DPTIMeasles
production centers. Technical terms of reference and detailed bidding
documents were reviewed by Bank Group financed consultants and bids were
received in April 1986 and are currently under evaluation. Contracts are
expected to be awarded on a turn-key basis with the process suppliers
responsible for project management, transfer of technology, plant design,
supervision of civil engineering, supply and inspection of goods,
installation and testing of plant equipment, training of plant personnel and
plant start-up and trial operation.
3.06      Procurement for 0tber Project Comuonents.  All procurement of
equipment to be financed by the Bank Group (about 70% of total) would be
procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) folloving Bank
Procurement Guidelines, except as describeJ bel'w. Items vould be grouped
into bid packages to encourage competition and bulk procurement. Local
manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference of 15% or the
prevailing customs duties, vhichever is lower, in the evaluation of bids.
Items and groups of items estimated to cost less than US$200,000 and in
aggregate not exceeding US$5.0 million equivalent may be procured through:
(a) contracts awarded on the basis of comparison of quotations invited from
at least three suppliers eligible under the Guidelines; or (b) direct
purchase for proprietary items or vhere justified by the need for
standardization. The US$5.0 million limit is reasonable in light of
experience under the REME project. Prior Bank Group review of contract
awards would include all contracts of US$500,000 equivalent or more. Sample
post reviews of smaller contracts would be carried out during regular
supervision missions. Remaining equipment comprises basic laboratory
equipment, pharmaceutical and laboratory materials and standard teaching
supplies all of which are available locally and will be procured by



- 15 -
Provincial Health Bureaus for widely scattered local distribution. This
equipment would be procured in accordance with local procedures and financed
by the provincial governments. Selection of technical assistance
consultants would be carried out in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines on
the use of consultants. Local training and fellowships will be organized by
MOPH.
3.07      Draft equipment lists have been finalized by project institutions
and reviewed by MOPE and the Bank Group. An expert procurement committee
has been appointed by HOPH to review quantities and to prepare detailed
specifications. Agreement was reached with MOPE during appraisal that this
committee would be appropriately staffed to undertake this task with due
regard to the following criteria: appropriateness of equipmpnt proposed to
institutional functions; cost-effectiveness, taking into account expected
utilization and impact; and ease of operation and maintenance. For items
procured througb ICB, HOPH would be responsible for preparation of bidding
documents, bid evaluation and recommendations for award; the International
Tendering Company of CNTIC has been designated to be responsible for
advertising and receiving bids, and for undertaking contract awards on
behalf of HOPH. MOPH would be responsible for taking delivery of equipment
and for its distribution to project institutions. During negotiations
understandirg was reached that procurement of equipment would be
appropriately synchronized with the construction of physical facilities and
the training of personnel needed to operate and D,aintain it.
3.08      Civil Works.  Civil vorks for rural health facilities, for the
expansion of epidemic prevention stations and for extensions to buildings
imder the Drug Quality Control and NCPM components would be procured mainly
through local bidding amongst local companies and would be financed by the
Government. Architectural plans have been prepared by provincial, municipal
and county design bureaus which would also be responsible for supervision of
construction. Sites for facilities have been selected and have been made
available by the respective levels of government. To make improvements in
civil works design for rural health MOPH is establishing a central unit for
health facilities research and design. Its role would be to study and
synthesize alternative designs and technologies suitable to improve the
design of buildings for health care. It would investigate construction
techniques and layouts to incorporate modern ideas for patient flow,
supervision, management and the delivery of technical services. It would
bave the capacity to produce educational materials and sample designs for
provincial health and design authorities.
D. Disbursements
3.09      The proposed credit of SDR 57.2 million (US$65.0 million equiva-
lent) would be disbursed as follows:



- 16 -
(a)  100Z of the CIF cost of imported equipment (including
vehicles), 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured equipment and 75% of the :ost of local
expenditures for other items procured locally;
(b)  100% of the cost of consultants;
(c)  100% of expenditures for local training (tuition,
transportation, room and board) for the Rural Eealth
component;
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for overseas fellowships; and
(e)  100% of foreign expenditures for the vaccine production
centers.
The proceeds of the proposed loan (US$15 million equivalent) would be
disbursed against item (e) above.
3.10      Reimbursement of training and contracts for goods ard services,
each valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent, would be made on the basis
of statements of expenditure, the supporting documentation for which would
be retained in the World Bank Loan Office (WBLO) for review by the Bank
Group during project supervision missions. In order to reduce the
administrative burden of disbursing against a large number of applications
NOPE would open a Special Account in a bank acceptable to the Bank Group,
with an authorized allocation of up to the US dollar equivalent of SDR 5
million. Applications for replenishment would be submitted, with
appropriate supporting documentation, at quarterly intervals or when amounts
withdrawn equal half the amount of the initial deposit, whichever comes
sooner. All disbursements for expenditures for training and consulting
services, and contracts for goods and services for amounts of less than
US$200,000 equivalent, will be made from the Special Account. Disbursements
will be completed by the Closing Date of June 30, 1992, one year after the
estimated date of project completion (Annex 8).
E. Accounts and Audits
3.11      Accounts of expenditures for the rural health component will be
maintained by the provincial WBLOs under the supervision of the WBLO in the
NOPE. The finance division of the WBLO will maintain accounts for all other
project components. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
project accounts would be maintained according to accounting principles and
practices satisfactory to the Bank Group; that annual audits of project
expenditures would be carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank Group; and that the Government would provide the Bank Group with
certified copies of such audited financial statements and the auditors'
reports thereon within six months after the close of each Chinese fiscal
year.

IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Organizton
4.01      Two of the project components - Vaccine Production and Drug
Quality Control - fall under the administrative and technical jurisdiction
of the Bureau of Drug Administration and Policy of NOPH. Within the Bureau,
the Biological Products Division will be responsible for implementing the
Vaccine Production component, and the Pharmaceutical Standard and Quality
Control Division for implementing the Drug Quality Control component. The
Rural Health component will be the responsibility of the Rural Health
Division of the Bureau of Medical Administration. The Operational Research
component will be under the technical responsibility of two units reporting



- 18 -
directly to the Minister of Public Health, namely the National Center for
Preventive Medicine, and a leading group for Health lusurance Reform chaired
by the first Vice Minister. The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, an
institution which is also direc:;y under the Minister of Public Health, vill
assist the Bureau of Drug Administration and Policy in developing the
production of OPV in the Kunming Poliomyelitis Institute which reports to
the Academy. The Bureau of Health and Epidemic Prevention will provide
technical guidance in the upgrading of provincial epidemic prevention
stations. A chart depicting the current organizational structure of the
MOPH is attached.
4.02      Responsibility for project management and coordination as a whole
would rest witb the WBLO which has already been established in MOPH to
coordinate the implementation of the Rural Health and Medical Education
Project. The WBLO is headed by a director with a day-to-day responsibility
for all aspects of project execution. He is supported by 25 full-time staff
organized into three divisions responsible for project execution,
procurement, and finance and accounts, respectively. The WBLO will
coordinate the implementation of all project components, procurement of
equipment, administration of technical assistance and training, project
finances (including counterpart funding and loan/credit disbursements) and
overall project progress reports. To this end, it will have a strong
liaison function with the technical departments responsible for individual
project components. Finally, the WBLO will be responsible for the
preparation of the project completion report.
B. Project Manaeiement
4.03      Tne project will be directed by a steering group within MOPH,
consisting of the heads of the divisions and bureaus concerned, and
co-chaired by the director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau and the director of
the Planning and Finance Bureau. This group will meet periodically and have
responsibility for setting overall policy guidelines, approving plans and
budgets for individual project components, monitoring the project's overall
progress and effectiveness, and resolving any issues affecting project goals
and implementation. The WBLO is the staff secretariat for this group.
4.04      The pattern of national organization and management arrangements
has been replicated in the provincial health bureaus responsible for the
Rural Health component. Specifically, leading groups chaired by the provin-
cial Vice Governors would oversee project implementation, backed up by
provincial NBLO0 or project managemeat units in the provincial and county
health bureaus, each comprising five to ten full-time staff headed by a
Bureau Deputy Director. The provincial WBLOs have appraised and approved
the plans and programs developed by the county-level institutions. They
will supervise all aspects of project implementation including those
executed by the provincial epidemic prevention stations. Assurances were
obtained that the MOPH and the provinces concerned would maintain the WBLOs
through the project implementation period with appropriate functions and
staffing.



- 19 -
4.05      The implementation of the Vaccine Production component vill be
managed by the directors of the three institutes concerned, in close
collaboration with the Biological ProductB Division of the NOPH which will
be responsible for the reassignment of technical staff. During
negotiations, understanding was reached that MOPH would reassign to the
three institutes supported by the project the technical staff they vill need
to operate the new facilities.
4.06      Drug Quality Control will be executed by the following agencies:
the Municipal Health Bureaus of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin for the Drug
Quality Control Institute; the Zhejiang Medical University and Western China
Medical University for the training subcomponent; and the Medical
University of Shanghai and the Medical University of Beijing for the
clinical pharmacology subcomponent. Each implementing agency has set up a
project office headed by the director of the institute/department concerned,
under the leadership of the presidents of the universities and the directors
of the Municipal Health Bureaus. Assurances were obtained that the Borrower
would ensure through a Project Implementation Agreement that the
municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai and Zhejiang Province will
maintain the project offices within the respective local Health Bureaus
throughout the project implementation period and implement project
activities under the supervision of the Drug Administration and Policy
Bureau of MOPH. Execution of a Project Implementation Agreement
satisfactory to the Bank Group would be a condition of effectiveness.
4.07      The Operational Research component will be implemented by the
relevant institutes of the NCPM. The Director of the NCPM will be
responsible for overall program implementation and will report directly to
the Minister of Public Health. The rural health insurance experiment will
be implemented by the Health Bureau of Sichuan Province under the leadership
of the steering group established in MOPH.
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits
5.01      The project is expected to improve the health status of about 30
million beneficiaries in rural areas of 50 counties. NEtionwide there will
be better coverage, quality and cost-effectiveness of child immunization.
National capability for epidemiological surveillance and research will be
stronger. The Rural Health component will strengtben the capacity of the
county health care delivery system to deliver an extensive range of curative
and preventive services. The effect will be improved efficiency of communi-
cable disease control and chronic disease management, and greater accessibi-
lity to and quality of curative services both in the counties and at
intermediate referral locations in rural areas.



- 20 -
5.02      The Vaccine Production component vill substantially increase the
coverage and cost effectiveness of the national imnunization program by
raising the proportion of eligible children covered by a full series of
immnnizations, reducing the cost per fully imminized child and improving the
efficacy of the imunization given. It will make possible increased
frequency of iuznization sessions at the ultimate delivery site.
Anticipated increases in unit production cost per vaccine dose are expected
to be more than offset by decreases in wastage in the distribution chain,
resulting both from better packaging and from longer shelf-life associated
in part vith the substitution of freeze-dried for liquid vaccines.
Substantial improvement in vaccination effectiveness will also result from
the reduction of losses in vaccine potency.
5.03      The Druz Oualitv Control component is expected to improve the
capability of the drug quality control institutes to test the quality of
drugs available on the market. It will also improve the training of
pharmaceutical administrators and quality control inspectors. The result is
expected to be a more effective and extensive system of drug quality control
which would help to ensure that all drugs meet acceptable safety standards.
5.04      The Operational Research component will support and improve the
formulation of national policies on disease prevention and on rural health
insurance.
B. Proiect Risks
5.05      Experience with the RMR project, and with preparation of the
proposed project, indicates that HOPE has the management capacity and
commitment needed for successful implementation of the rural health
component and, with the assistance of experienced international vaccine
firms, the vaccine production component. Consequently no major
inplementation risks are anticipated. Implementation of the operational
research component, hovever, does carry inherent risk in that it may take
time for NCPM, a newly created amalgamation of previously independent
research institutes, to shift from laboratory to policy-focused research.
To minimize this risk NCPM's program vill be monitored closely by NOPH and
the Bank Group.
5.06      In the Drug Quality Control component, interagency coordination
could pose difficulties. The responsibility for drug quality lies with
NOPE, whose capacity for pharmaceutical administration would be strengthened
by the project. However, the responsibility for drug manufacture rests with
the State Pharmaceutical Administration which controls the pharmaceutical
enterprises but is administratively independent from MOPH. Due to
constraints in terss of equipment and technology of manufacturers, the State
Pharmaceutical Administration might be unable to comply with the standards
established by NOPE in the short term. To minimize the risk that
investments in quality control would not be effectively utilized because
industrial capabilities could not keep pace with rapidly improving quality



- 21 -
measurement standards, the project will finance only the first phase of the
HOPE program to raise drug quality testing capacity.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECUNNENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, understandings were reached on the folloving:
(a) a timetable for the implementation of the revised immunization
schedule and a monitoring system and procedures by which NOPE will
evaluate effectiveness of the new vaccines (para 2.12);
(b) that procurement of equipment would be appropriately synchronized
with the construction of physical facilities and the training of
personnel needed to operate and maintain it (para 3.07); and
(c) that NOPE would reassign to the Shanghai, Lanzhou and Kunming
vaccine production institutes the technical staff needed to
operate the new facilities (para 4.05).
6.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) all domestic production of DPT and measles vaccines, tetanus
tozoids, and OPV would, one year from the start of operation of
vaccine production centers under pi ject, meet the international
guidelines established by WHO on the quality of biological
products, including vaccines (para 2.12);
(b) MOPH would carry out the rural health insurance experiment with
the assistance of consultants and in accordance with terms of
reference and time schedule acceptable to the Bank Group
(para. 2.16); and
(c) project accounts will be maintained according to accounting prin-
ciples and practices satisfactory to the Bank Group; annual
audits of project expenditures will be carried out by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank Group and certified copies of such
audited financial statements and the auditor's reports thereon
will be forwarded to the Bank Group within six months after the
close of each Chinese fiscal year (pars 3.11);
(d) the NOPE and the provinces concerned would maintain the World Bank
Loan Offices through the project implementation period with
appropriate functions and staffing (para 4.04);
(e) through a Project Implementation Agreement the Borrower will
ensure that the municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai
and Zhejiang Province will maintain the project offices in their



- 22 -
respective local health bureaus through the project implementation
period and will implement project activities under the supervision
of the Drug Ad-inistration and Policy Bureau of MOPE (para. 4.06).
6.03      The following would be conditions of loan and credit
effectiveness:
(a) Execution of a Project Implementation Agreement satisfactory to
the Bank Group; and
(b) State Council approval of the Loan, Credit and Project Agreements.
6.04      Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the project herein
proposed vill constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$15 million
equivalent and a credit of SDR 57.2 (US$65.0 million equivalent). The Bank
loan would be for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at
the standard variable rate, and the IDA credit would be on standard IDA
terms.

RURAL HRALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PROJECT
DescriRtion Prepared by MOPH for Rural Realth Insurance ExDeriment
1.        Backaround
1.1       The numbers of villages and peasants participating in rural
cooperative insurance plans have, in recent years, decreased gradually from
80 Z of the total to 5 Z at present. Several factors have contributed to
this decrease such as lack of local level knowledge of insurance principles
and plans, management weaknesses and actuarial unsoundness. However, the
primary cause of problem has arisen with the introduction of the production
responsibility system which has eroded the financial base for the
cooperative insurance plans. As the rural economy develops, peasants are
demanding increasingly better medical care and that the health syste1. be
utrengthened in a sound way so that the financial burden due to serious
illness can be relieved.
1.2       Therefore, a major task for China', health policysakers is to
study and establish a new health insurance system accommodated to rural
circumstances. The new system should satisfy the following criteria:
a)   require no additional subsidies from Government;
b)  protect the peasant from finaucial ruin due to serious
illness;
c)   strengthen prevention services to raise the health status of
the people;
d)   discourage unnecessary utilization of health services;
e)   strengthen the primary care role of the village health
station and permit serious cases to be referred to higher
levels; and
f)   be affordable and acceptable to the peasant.
1.3       Although, at present, there is an urgent need to reform the rural
health insurance system, it is technically infeasible to implement a broad
scale reform because of lack of experience with sound alternative insurance
schemes. Most importantly, there is inadequate information about the
relationship of insurance coverage to utilization. Without suchinformation,
premiums cannot be set to cover expected reimbursements by the plans.



- 36 -
ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 6
Reforms in the village level delivery system further complicate predictions
of how insurance will affect the utilization and the coat of care. Rural
insurance reform will be ineffective unless plans are well managed, but
there is at present no experience in managing a village-level insurance
system of the type that is needed.
1.4       If ineffective reform  are instituted now, adverse effects may
arise. Peasants already distrust health insurance schemes because of the
past failures in village cooperative plans. A aecond failure would further
undermine their faith in insurance and probably make future reforms more
difficult.
1.5       For these reasons, it is only prudent to gather more information
about the effects of alternative insurance plans before proceeding to
implement reforms on a broad scale. The most efficient way to collect
reliable information is by means of an experiment. This component of the
Rural Health and Preventive Medicine Project is for the conduct of such an
experiment in two counties in Sichuan Province.
2.        Goals of the frx eriment
2.1       This health insurance experinent has both immediate and long term
pu.p-ses. First, it should demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment to
offset and correct the deficiencies from the cooperative medical plans.
Second: it should provide experience that will be helpful in a broader
implementation of rural health insurance reforms.
2.2       The experiment will provide:
a)   estimates of the coBt and utilization effects of alternative
insurance plans;
b)   an opportunity to develop, test and refine a system to manage
a village-level insurance system;
c)   a reinsurance mechanism to be formed to pool risks;
d)   a test of the interaction between insurance reform and other
reforms in the village delivery system.
2.3       In sum, the experiment will provide an example of implementation
for the health insurance system and a sound analytic base which other
provinces can use to evaluate and implement health insurance options.
2.4       The experiment will also have a training component. Work on the
experiment, carried out cooperatively by Chinese and foreign experts, will



- 37 -
ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 6
provide a core group of Chinese analysts with theoretical knowledge and
practical experience in advanced health policy-oriented research.
3.        Current Status of the Ezxeriment
3.1       Considerable progress has been made toward design of the
experiment in the preparation of the Rural Health and Preventive Medicine
Project. Administrative groups have been established at several levels in
China, and a pilot study has been completed.
3.2       A pilot survey of 880 households in the two counties was carried
out in July, 1985. The pilot survey confirmed the ability of a consultant
group, the Ministry of Public Health and the Provincial Health Bureau staff
to cooperatively design and execute the kind of data collection efforts that
sill be required in the larger experiment. Using the survey data, the
consultant group developed preliminary models to predict inpatient and
outpatient utilization and expenditures for different kinds of insurance
plans.
3.3       A working group of national and provincial official visite'  .he
U.S. in October 85 to work with the consultant group to refine these models
and draft working documents for the health insurance experiment. During the
next three months, Sichuan provincial and county officials used the
preliminary models to develop proposals for experimental plans. In late
January and early February, 1986, the consultant group visited China again.
The models vere further developed and used to estimate utilization and costs
for plans proposed by the counties. In joint discussion, new options were
proposed and analyzed.
3.4       On the administrative side, the Government has already created or
designed much of the organizational system required for the experiment. A
Leading Group has been set up at national level, and there have been
discussions between the Ministry of Public Health and the State Planning
Commission. A group of technical advisors has been created, consisting of
able, interested health statisticians, health economists and scholars. In
Sichuan Province, parallel leading and working groups have been established,
as well as provincial county-level organizations for managing the
experiment. Township and village-level organizations have also been
designed, and 56 villages have been enlisted for the experiment.
4.        Design and Conduct of The ExReriment
4.1       The experiment will be designed and conducted in four phases:  a)
a planning phase in which the design of the experiment will be completed in
detail; b) a testing phase in which the experimental plans will be pilot
tested in a few villages before full scale implementation; c) an



- 38-
ANNEX 6
Page 4 of 6
implementation phase during which the experimental insurance plans vill be
operational in all test villages and data will be collected; and d) an
evaluation phase in which the experimental data will be analyzed and the
results presented to policy makers in briefings and written reports. The
tasks in each phase are given below in outline form.
A.   Planning phase (9 to 12 months duration)
1.  Decision will be made regarding the extent to which
health status and quality of care will be monitored, in
addition to the primary focus of the study, utilization
and costs.
2.   Data collection instruments vill be developed and
tested.
3.   Baseline data will be collected at all sites.
4.   Baseline data will be analyzed in order to refine plan
options.
5.  Final decisions will be made on which plans to
demonstrate.
6.  Individual villages will be assigned to experimental
plans.
7.  Protocols will be developed for village-level
implementation of plans.
8. A claims management system will be designed and
appropriate personnel trained.
9.   A reinsurance system will be studied and created to
protect individual villages from extraordinary claims.
B.   Testing phase (approximately 6 months)
1.   The insurance system will be started in pilot villages.
2. Neceasary adjustments in insurance plans, management
apperatus and data collection procedures will be made on
the basis of early experience.
3.  Revised plans will be started in the remainder of the
villages.

ANNEX 6
Page 5 of 6
4.   Reliability checks will be performed on data from the
collection system.
5.  The final experiment design and procedures vill be
documented.
C.   Implementation phase (approximately 24 months)
1. The claims processing system vill be monitored on an
ongoing basis.
2.   Periodic checks will be made on the data.
3.  At the end of the first year of operation, the claims
and utilization data vill be analyzed to determine if
premiums need to be adjusted upward or downward.
4.   Individual premiums or plans subsidies will be adjusted
to cover the expected cost of each plan in each village.
5.  The reirsurance system will be evaluated in terms of its
reserves and payouts, and changes in the reinsurance
premiums for villages will be calculated.
6.   Demographic and other data will be collected on all
participants at end of the experiment.
D.   Evaluation phase (9 to 12 months)
1.  All data will be cleaned and edited.
2.  Nodels to estimate the effects of plan characteristics
on utilization and costs will be developed and tested.
3.  These models will be used to estimate the effects of
plan characteristics on utilization and costs.
4.  Depending on decisions made in the planning phase,
analyses will be conducted to estimate the effects of
insurance on health status and quality of care.
5.  The management system used in the experiment will be
evaluated to determine what changes would be required
for full scale implementation.
