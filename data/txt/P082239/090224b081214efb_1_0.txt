O Implementation Status Overview
-g The project continues to demonstrate good implementation progress on all project components. The project development indicators have been met or exceeded in several instances.
0.   The overall implementation progress is rated satisfactory. Key PDO outcome indicators (e.g. increased lead time for national and regional forecasts) are achieved, and as a result
Roshydromet forecasting capacity is close to that of leading world forecasting centers such as the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the US National
Center for Environmental Protection. It is expected that most of the 80 planned activities will be completed and 94.3% of the loan funds (US$75.3 million) will be utilized before
