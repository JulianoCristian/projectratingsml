                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main development objective of the project is to increase the accuracy of forecasts provided to the Russian people and economy by modernizing key elements of
                         RosHydromet's technical base and strengthening its institutional arrangements. This would enable enterprise and household adjustments to protect lives and support
                         economic growth.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to perform satisfactorily. Key Project Development Objective (PDO) and outcome indicators have been met or exceeded. For instance indicators such as
                         accuracy and increased lead time for national and regional forecasts were achieved, and as a result Russia’s Hydrometeorological Service (RHM) forecasting capacity is getting
                         closer to that of leading world forecasting centers such as the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and the US National Center for Environmental Prediction

                         (NCEP). The cumulative effect of project investments resulted in an improved lead time for warnings of dangerous weather events delivered to local authorities, the Ministry of
                         Emergencies and media. For example, the average timeliness increased from the baseline of 0.5 hour to 1 hour for flash floods, and from 1 hour to 1.7 hours for severe storms. All
                         originally planned project activities are completed. Activities completed during the review period include institutional strengthening; information dissemination and emergency
                         preparedness including development and implementation of automated management system in the RHM Headquarters (HQ), its regional branches and centers, and research

                         centers, training and retraining of employees. Services of the system integrator were completed and the objective to ensure functional compatibility of the modernization with the rest
                         of RHM systems has been achieved. The project significantly contributed for enhancing emergency planning and preparedness by supporting the establishment of situational centers
                         in RHM HQ and the regions, and for effective coordination and cooperation among respective authorities during emergency situations. A 2011 survey of client satisfaction was
                         completed as part of the project monitoring of client's evaluation of RHM’s services. The implementation of additional activities related to the preparation of Roshydromet-2 Project
                         continues. Until May 2012, 98.4 per cent of the loan proceeds (US$79.9 million) were disbursed. Overall 87 contracts were fully implemented. All of this represents good progress in
                         implementation and disbursements. In June 2012 the Ministry of Finance and RHM submitted a request for extension of the closing date of Roshydromet- 1 project to ensure the
                         implementation of the remaining activities and timely completion of the preparation of Roshydromet-2 Project.
