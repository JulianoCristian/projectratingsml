                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main development objective of the project is to increase the accuracy of forecasts provided to the Russian people and economy by modernizing key
                         elements of RosHydromet's technical base and strengthening its institutional arrangements. This would enable enterprise and household adjustments to
                         protect lives and support economic growth.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project implementation performance remains satisfactory. Good progress is maintained for all project components. The overall progress towards achievement of
                         development objectives remains satisfactory with targets and outputs agreed during the previous mission, in November 2010, substantively being met. It is expected that all originally
                         planned project activities will be completed and 98% of the project funds (total US$174.5 million) will be utilized by the current loan closing date October 30, 2011. Currently only few
                         contracts and payments are pending. The Government of the Russian Federation requested the Bank to finance the preparation of a second RosHydromet Modernization Project.
