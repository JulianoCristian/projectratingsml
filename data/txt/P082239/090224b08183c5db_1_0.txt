                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main development objective of the project is to increase the accuracy of forecasts provided to the Russian people and economy by modernizing key elements of
                         RosHydromet's technical base and strengthening its institutional arrangements. This would enable enterprise and household adjustments to protect lives and support
                         economic growth.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation continues to perform satisfactorily. Overall the project development objective has been met and development targets have been achieved or exceeded.
                         Project investments in maintaining Roshydromet's key functions, restoring and strengthening its human and technical capacity to provide timely forecasts of hydrometeorological
                         events and meet its commitments to World Meteorological Organization were central for arresting the deterioration of the national hydrometeorological service and set the foundations
