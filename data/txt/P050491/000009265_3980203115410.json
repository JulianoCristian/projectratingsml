foundation for renewed economic growth, maintain\n            macroeconomic stabilization over the medium-term, and\n            provide an adequate level of public services during the\n            fiscal transition. The project consists of five components.\n            First, the \"natural\" monopolies reform component\n            will focus on improving pricing; reducing arrears and\n            strengthening payment discipline; strengthening regulation;\n            and demonopolizing sectors. Second, the private sector\n            development component will revitalize the enterprise\n            privatization program; establish institutions and policies\n            that promote competition; create functioning markets for\n            urban land and real estate; and further develop capital\n            markets. Third, the fiscal management component will improve\n            the tax structure and tax administration; strengthen budget\n            management; rationalize government spending; and restructure\n            intergovernmental fiscal relations. Fourth, the banking\n            reform component will focus on problem banks and deposit\n            protection; strengthen prudential regulations and\n            supervision; and improve the money markets and payment\n            systems. Fifth, the trade policy reform component will\n            maintain a liberalized trade regime; harmonize standards\n            with international practice; expand production sharing\n            agreements; implement a market-based system for oil\n            transport; and phase out the oil export of state need program."}, "docdt": "1997-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
