Bank and\n            Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory overall.\n            Several lessons were learned: The possibiliy of external\n            shocks, and their likely impact on project implementation,\n            should be incorporated specifically in the risk analysis of\n            future projects. The decentralized approach used in this\n            project has proven superior to centralized management and\n            should be fostered and maintained wherever adequate human\n            resources are available. The Government of Indonesia and the\n            provincial government should try to identify the main\n            reasons for the generally disappointing project\n            implementation performance of Malang City, and draw\n            conclusions. Both levels of government and the Bank should\n            cooperate in defining a strategy for future financial\n            assistance to East Java, to fit with the Government of\n            Indonesia's and provincial priorities, and with the\n            Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The\n            Government and the Bank should try to identify a more\n            promising approach in the sanitation sector, because many\n            investments made under this project do not seem to show the\n            desired sustainability. The two parties should continue to\n            cooperate in designing a viable water supply policy,\n            including the careful monitoring of the institutional\n            development of the water enterprises owned by the local\n            government (PDAMs), and should jointly decide on the\n            appropriate criteria for defining further financial assistance."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
