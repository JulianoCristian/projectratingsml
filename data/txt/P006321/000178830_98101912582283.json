urban population.\n            The project would help: (a) raise the income and living\n            standard of some 9,500 families operating farms of up to 100\n            ha; (b) promote a sustainable and rational development of\n            agricultural production in suitable areas; (c) improve\n            production support and social infrastructure and services,\n            and (d) expand the state's capability to plan and\n            execute similar projects in other parts of the state. The\n            project would focus on a limited area representative of the\n            settled parts of the state. It would promote food production\n            and the rational cultivation of tree crops, including an\n            initial 1,800 ha slice of an oil palm development program."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
