F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Loan Agreement)

Improve the living conditions of rural poor communities of the Borrower through the building of
institutional capacity and the strengthening of the Borrower’s environmental and land
administration systems, while securing a sustainable and safe environment.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)

Increase the incomes derived from productive activities by beneficiary rural producers, while
contributing to improving environmental management and land administration in the Borrower’s
territory.

(a) PDO Indicator(s)

The Level One Restructuring approved by the Board on June 24, 2013 extensively revised the
Results Framework. For greater clarity, and consistent with the need to prepare separate
assessments of outcome/efficacy under the ICR Guidelines Appendix B, the original and
restructured RFs are shown consecutively below.

                Borrower had also reported 95 public registries with digitalized records despite
                the cancellation of the Agreement for Public Registries Digitalization/ITERPA

                count these titles against the target as the intent of these improvements was to
                strengthen title processing. It is not known how many of these titles were granted
                pre-Restructuring vs post. In addition, 23 quilombola territories were titled,

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 The Pará Integrated Rural Development Project was the first Bank loan to the State of Pará,
a vast area occupying 1.25 million km2, traversed by the Amazon River which is fed by a massive
network of rivers and holds 40% of Brazil’s and eight percent of the world’s fresh water . At the
time of appraisal, Pará was considered the most developed of the nine states comprising the “Legal
Amazon” with a diversified economy based on services, mining, forestry and cattle ranching. The
Federal Government of Brazil has major interests in the Amazon region due to its high visibility,
global significance and economic potential. While the Federal Government was facing significant
pressure from internal and external constituencies with divergent and shifting priorities in the areas
of environmental protection and land rights for marginalized groups, the State Government’s focus
was at that time, predominantly on the economy and improving social indicators.

1.1.2 Land administration: While urbanizing rapidly, Pará remained a “frontier state” with
development expanding that frontier through penetration roads, timber/minerals extraction and
deforestation, colonization and illegal land appropriation/use, the latter due to ineffective state
controls over the ownership and transfer of land. Public lands and those not yet incorporated into
formal registries were especially vulnerable. This situation was having a high social cost and was
problematic for the National Institute for Colonization and Land Reform (INCRA) and the Land
Institute of Pará (ITERPA). Land competition and conflict and the diverse players involved had
created political mistrust, hostility and at times, violence. State and Federal Governments were
hard-pressed to regularize public land due to inadequate resources, corruption, land-holding size
and antiquated land registries.

1.1.3 Natural resources management: Deforestation remained the most salient issue in the
Amazon region. Both legitimate rural producers and land usurpers were cutting forest not just to
plant crops or pasture but also to signal ownership/control over lands, causing habitat loss, erosion,
soil degradation and other environmental consequences, and costing time and resources verifying
titles and ownership claims. The Federal Government’s command and control enforcement of
forestry laws had not been particularly effective in changing the basic pattern of land use in the
region. In the State of Pará, a modern zoning framework was favored to facilitate application of the
new Federal Forestry Code by protecting additional forested areas to compensate for forest cover
already lost.

1.1.4 Poverty concerns: The State was fast becoming an export power-house but little of the
benefits were reaching the poor. The project sought to address two issues which had received less
attention: rural poverty and land use/administration. At appraisal, some 2.7 million people or 44%
of the total state population were living in extreme poverty, rising to 58% of the rural population.
Insecure and inequitable access to land and high incidence of land conflicts were key causative
factors fueling the cycle of poverty through the depletion of resources. Indigenous people were the
poorest group with 61% of heads of household below the poverty line. Similarly, 51% of Afro-
Brazilians and 47% of mixed-race heads of household were poor compared to 33% of whites.
Families working primarily in agriculture were poorer than those in services or industry, with
inequality driven by a relatively high degree of income and asset concentration.2

Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3357, July 2004.

                                                        1
1.1.5 State Government strategy and actions: Acknowledging the seriousness of this situation,
the State Government had started to: form and consolidate economically viable productive
arrangements to change the State’s productive base; consolidate the open agricultural frontier and
discourage the conversion of primary forest; improve the management of public policies and social
services while encouraging private expansion of productive activities; and, focus attention on
historically marginalized groups. The project was conceived to support these strategic directions.
The State had largely stabilized its fiscal situation and recovered its capacity for investment. Its
goal – and the project’s basic logic - was to close the open frontier through the strategic use of
zoning and protected areas, move away from an extractive model towards a development model
using the State’s comparative advantage in commodities, and add value to local products.

1.1.6 Rationale for Bank assistance: The Brazil Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the
period (2003-2007) defined three pillars: equity, competitiveness and sustainability. The State’s
Multi-Year Development Plan (2004-2007) stressed economic and social development with
sustainable natural resource management, goals compatible with the CAS. The PAD notes that
while national economic growth based on macroeconomic stability was increasing, the Amazon
region was lagging on poverty reduction, an important focus of the Bank’s then-recent analytical
work and interest in engaging with the Amazon states beyond deforestation and biodiversity which
had seen substantial Bank investment in operations under the Pilot Program to Conserve the
Brazilian Rain Forest (PPG-7). These operations had informed the Bank’s knowledge of the
Amazon Region and its main stakeholders, while demonstrating the main economic, political and
operational challenges.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
1.2.1 As stated in the Loan Agreement, the PDO sought “to improve the living conditions of
rural poor communities of the Borrower through the building of institutional capacity and the
strengthening of the Borrower’s environmental and land administration systems, while securing a
sustainable and safe environment”.

1.2.2 The lending instrument was a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of US$60.0 m in an
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) format, with US$40.0 m equivalent of counterpart funding. This
was the first of two six-year phases with the same financing amounts and cost sharing ratio. The
loan would support investments in targeted income generation and territorial development within
three sub-sectors: rural development, social development and environment, and expand those
activities under a second phase. The APL was intended to benefit the Borrower through
“incremental exposure to credit” thereby reducing risk and establishing benchmarks as triggers for
Phase II. Key project indicators and triggers for the second phase were as follows:

1.2.3    Key indicators for Phase I (from PAD Results Framework):3
        36,000 families whose incomes are raised on average at least 30% above the poverty line
        Increased security of land tenure for rural producers
        ZEE (Economic and Ecological Zoning) and related policies adopted and in effect

         Triggers for moving to Phase II:
        Disbursement of at least 60% of the loan plus commitments for an additional 20%



3  Inconsistencies are noted between the PDO indicators in the Loan Agreement, the PAD Main Text (p. 4) and the RF.
The ICR uses the RF version of indicators throughout, consistent with the supervision ISRs.

                                                        2
        Subprojects (SP) approved and under implementation, benefiting at least 20,000 persons
         below the poverty line as verified by field surveys
        Detailed zoning at a scale of at least 1:250,000 concluded and in effect for at least 35
         million hectares, consistent with federal guidelines
        The State has a legal framework in place to enforce the zoning plan and is implementing it
        Official creation and gazetting of at least 80% (by area) of the protected areas (PA)
         predicted under the Pará State Macro-zoning Plan (M-ZEE), excluding Environmental
         Protection Areas (APA); and,
        Rural Cadaster completed for at least 40,000 rural parcels.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
1.3.1 A Level One, Board-approved Restructuring in June 2013, revised the PDO and Key
Indicators for clarity and measurability, as follows: “Increase the incomes derived from
productive activities by beneficiary rural producers, while contributing to improving
environmental management and land administration in the Borrower’s territory”. See 1.6, 1.7.

1.3.2    The Restructuring revised two PDO Indicators and a third continued as originally designed:
        Number of beneficiary families whose real incomes from productive activities are raised
         by at least 30%:
        Number of families with land title (a) initiated and (b) finalized; and,
        Ecological-Economic Zoning (ZEE) completed and related policies in effect.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 The primary target group was 36,000 rural poor families with annual household incomes
of up to R$4,700 (poverty line, about US$2,076/year/family) who would benefit from productive
investments under Component A, Income Generation. Complementary infrastructure investments
were seen benefiting about 100,000 rural families indirectly. Some 50,000 rural producers would
improve their land tenure security under Component B2 Land Administration through
regularization and titling (50,000 properties surveyed and 30,000 titled). Titling was intended to
align with the needs of Component A beneficiaries. Quilombola and Indigenous Peoples would
benefit from productive/related subprojects (SP) and Ecological-Economic Zoning designed to
control expansion into forested areas. The 2013 Restructuring revised the number of Component A
beneficiaries from 36,000 to 4,000, and reduced targeted beneficiaries of land regularization and
titling to 39,000 properties/families with the process initiated and 1,243 properties/families with
titles finalized.4

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 The project comprised/financed the following:

Component A: Productive Investments (total cost US$63.05 m of which Loan US$31.54 m or
50%), implemented by the Pará Rural Management Unit (NGPR), financed loans and matching
grants for small and medium-scale investments to eligible producer associations, increasing their
market access for agricultural and non-agricultural goods. Associations, with information and
technical support, would identify and propose Productive Investment Plans (PIP) consisting of one
or more SP, contributing a minimum 10% in cash or kind. The PIPs could include income
generation investments, environmental rehabilitation, and/or complementary basic infrastructure.


4   New targets were estimates of what was achievable based on processing of titles and subprojects already underway.

                                                         3
Sub-component A1 financed preparation of the PIPs and A2 their implementation. Complementary
infrastructure SPs implemented as part of a PIP would be financed via non-reimbursable matching
grants. For income generation SPs, the project would pilot a scheme under which beneficiary
entities (associations, cooperatives/other) would repay the project’s financial agent BANPARÁ and
these funds would support the financing of future PIPs. Terms and conditions for repayment would
be detailed in PIP Agreements signed between BANPARÁ and the beneficiary entity/association.

Component B: Territorial Development (total cost US$27.5 m of which Loan US$21.61 m or
79%) financed the sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity conservation, as well as
improved land administration. Subcomponent B1: Environmental Management, implemented by
the State Secretariat for Environment (SEMA), financed the legal analysis and development of
regulatory frameworks for Ecological-Economic Zoning and for Land Management; and, proposals
for economic and other instruments for implementing the state’s Macro-zoning Plan based on State
Law 6.745 IMR enacted in 2006 to close the open frontier and assign specific land use to major
blocks of territory. Subcomponent B2: Land Administration, implemented by the State Land
Institute (ITERPA), financed capacity-building for land administration, land registration focusing
on cadastral surveys and titling of small farmers (free to small farmers, fee basis for larger), social
mobilization, surveying, and strengthening of ITERPA and the state land registries (cartorios).

Component C: Policy Development (total cost US$2.05 m of which Loan 100%) financed studies
on income and asset levels to support the development of State poverty reduction plans; and, a
strategic environmental assessment (SEA), complementing the parallel zoning exercise and
focused on policies and programs within State growth and development scenarios as well as the
legal framework for executing the Zoning Plan in Phase II.

Component D: Project Management (total cost US$7.25 m of which Loan US$4.80 m or 65%)
financed Sub-component D1: Coordination supporting the Para Rural Management Unit (NGPR)
within the State Secretariat of Production (SEPE) to coordinate SP selection, feasibility studies,
technical assistance, environmental screening, procurement, financial management, and monitoring
and evaluation (M&E). Sub-component D2: Communications financed a communications unit to
both “sell” the project in rural areas and stimulate full participation in it. Sub-component D3:
Project Monitoring financed monitoring and learning, reporting by implementing agencies and
associations, and specialized staff in the NGPR to identify/disseminate lessons.

1.6 Revised Components
1.6.1 The Restructuring – combining a corrective approach to resolve design flaws, capacity and
commitment issues, with adaptive elements to retain and improve design and implementation
relevance – was approved in June 2013 (see 1.7.1) and changed the components as follows:
     Component A: (i) Loan Agreement amended to clarify that the PIPs supported three types
        of SPs (income, environment and infrastructure); (ii) scope was reduced with only the 49
        PIPs (benefiting 4,000 families) already approved, likely to be completed by closing, with
        market prospects and a genuine producer association, continuing to receive financing.
     Component B: Scope was reduced and activities re-aligned with more recent State
        priorities stemming from the new National Forest Code. Sub-component B1 was scaled
        back to: (i) legal and regulatory framework for the ZEE and land management; (ii) detailing
        of the ZEE at a scale of 1:250,000 for land area designated for consolidation and
        recuperation, based on the Macro-zoning Law and national regulations; and, (iii)
        strengthening of SEMA. Sub-component B2 continued supporting institutional
        development of ITERPA and the new State land administration model. The proposed new
        ITERPA headquarters building was cancelled, as was some cadastral field work, surveys,


                                                  4
        geo-referencing, cartography and titling, and technical consultancies. Modernization of
        land registries was transferred to INCRA and cancelled from the project.
       Component C: Sub-component C1 was re-focused on studies to monitor income and
        analyze selected value chains to support State poverty alleviation planning. Sub-
        component C2 was re-focused on strategic policy studies to improve state territorial
        development. The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), not yet initiated, was
        cancelled. Certain strategic studies were re-oriented in light of then-recent policy changes.
       Component D: Regular communications activities would continue but the planned
        communications unit was cancelled.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 The Restructuring also improved design and implementation relevance by:
     Revising the PDO for clarity and to reflect the project’s reduced scope (see 1.3);
     Adjusting the Results Framework including the Project Outcome Indicators to capture the
       simplified PDO and to reduce/adjust unachievable and unclear targets;
     Re-defining the types of SPs/PIPs (Component A) screening out the poorly designed/non-
       viable, reduced the scope/scale of Components A and B, and adjusted Component C;
     Strengthening the NGPR to address skills gaps (recruited two agricultural economists, an
       agri-business specialist, social scientist and engineer) and established a partnership with
       EMATER to improve technical assistance and rural extension services for PIPs;
     Updating the Indigenous Peoples and Quilombola Policy Framework (IPPF) and
       Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) - the project remained Category A;
     Cancelling the six triggers for the second phase of the APL as any follow-on operation
       would not be an APL, based on OP 10.00 on Investment Project Financing;
     Adjusting project costs to reflect reduced scope/scale, cancelled US$22.28 million of Loan
       funds reducing the Loan to US$37.725 m, and adjusted the Borrower counterpart
       contribution from US$40.0 m to US$25.12 m. (Disbursements were about 47% at the time,
       having increased sharply in 2012 and early 2013, prompted by more aggressive Bank
       supervision and support to the NGPR post-Mid-term Review (MTR)).
     Reallocating loan funds among components with the largest adjustment being to
       Component A (income generation subprojects), reduced about 55%; and,
     Extending the Closing Date by 18 months to December 31, 2014. See also Section 2.2.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Quality of the background analysis: The project was prepared at a time when the Bank’s
experience in the Amazon region was primarily in innovative, experimental operations using trust
funds and grants. As the Bank’s first and only operation in Pará, Bank management assigned it
high visibility and strategic importance for the Bank’s framework for engagement in th at region.
Project design referred to then-recent Bank studies on the region and adequately diagnosed the
State’s rural development imperatives. The preparation team comprised Bank specialists with long
experience in the Amazon and in land administration, environment and rural development.
Analyses were contracted covering institutions, environmental evaluation, involuntary resettlement,
land management, communications, legal aspects of the planned project, and the public
consultation process. The Concept Review stage suggests that the project was conceived as a multi-
sector operation intended primarily to reduce poverty and inequality and to avoid certain difficulties
encountered with previous projects in the Amazon region. The project needed full Safeguards
frameworks and an “A” rating. Due to the state’s vast area and complex problems, the project was
to be considered as a “process” with “clear but relatively modest goals”. However, an awareness

                                                 5
of the State’s development needs given severe rural poverty, the troubled land sector, vulnerable
ethnic groups and NRM issues of global significance resulted in an ambitious project which was
difficult to launch and execute, especially in the prevailing political climate at the State level
following elections in late 2006.

2.1.2 Lessons of earlier operations: The PAD list of lessons is long and broad-based and their
linkages to specific design features/decisions not well-articulated. There was a conscious turning
away from the large-scale Northeast Brazil CDD program. While replication is not at issue, its
lessons – especially regarding farmer organization, social capital formation, governance and
especially important for Pará Rural, the “rules of the game” for productive, income generating
investments by small farmers - were highly relevant. They were cited in several ICRs and
independent studies of the period and already being incorporated in Bank-supported rural
productivity operations in Central and South America, South Asia and elsewhere. They included
direct experiences in the States of Bahia, Ceará and Piauí with organized small producers selling
fruits, honey and other products to national and European supermarket chains. Hindsight shows
that bypassing this source of home-grown lessons as somehow outmoded was a mistake.5
.
Design features and operational implications:

2.1.3 Project scope and scale: Coverage was state-wide, under-estimating the immense
geographic and logistical complications of distance, physical terrain, poor transportation
infrastructure, dispersion of the rural population (even within individual associations) affecting
potential operational synergies on the ground between components, and creating a challenging
environment for technical assistance (TA), the project’s production and marketing goals under the
PIPs, communications and project oversight/supervision. It was essential that project activities be
concentrated in well-defined, accessible, priority areas. Further, the project sought to address all
three critical subsectors simultaneously, instead of exploring a more coherent sequencing of
activities. Targets for beneficiary families, land titling and other activities were over-estimated
despite analysis. While the APL may have boosted confidence that challenges could be overcome
through the anticipated longer-term relationship, the initial stage was over-loaded instead of setting
reasonable targets and selectively piloting difficult elements such as the PIPs in the first instance.6

2.1.4 Operational planning: There was no implementation plan for key project elements:
geography and logistics, marketing (value chain approach and market linkages), poverty targeting,
TA, communications, community organization and crucially, financial aspects (i.e., a plan and
arrangements to ensure cash flow/working capital for productive enterprises). There was also
insufficient attention to the demand side – how and with whom, producers would establish alliances
- and how this would be supported institutionally/systematically. These deficiencies had negative
impacts on project execution as described in Section 2.2 and contributed to drift and delays,
compounded over time because they were not addressed. There was also no actionable plan for



5       Examples: (i) productive SPs should reflect a community’s prior experience with an activity. Imposed designs
divorced from experience tend to fail. NGPR technical staff estimated that some 90% of Pará Rural’s productive
investments were in new activities largely imposed by TA providers; (ii) SP design needs to plan for ex-post commercial
and financial sustainability; and, (iii) the direct transfer of project funds for approved SPs to the beneficiary associations
to manage, avoids potential fiduciary risks associated with an intermediation framework and creates social capital
6   A first stage project might have given more priority to improving basic services in designated areas targeted for
productive activity. Despite intensified funding from large-scale Federal and State programs (Luz para Todos, Agua para
Todos) starting around 2007, piped water was only 35% at appraisal and 46% by 2009; and electricity access in rural
Pará just 64% (IPEA, 2012). The former NGPR Coordinator (2012-2014) explained that while hunger is not a major
issue in rural Pará, living conditions – part of the original PDO – including basic socio-economic services, are very poor.

                                                              6
consolidating the PIPs after their conclusion/project closing. Also, the PAD assumed that the three
streams of project financing would be implemented in a “mutually reinforcing fashion” but no
specifics/mechanisms were outlined.

2.1.5 Standard subproject designs: A major, early lesson of CDD and related projects was the
need for standardized technical designs and cost parameters for the types of subprojects likely to
be demanded. This should have been an essential output of good technical analysis and consultation
with potential beneficiaries during preparation. Such designs have been proven to increase cost-
effectiveness, help prevent over- and under-dimensioning of investments and reduce search and
information costs. The idea was mentioned briefly in a PAD Annex but pushed downstream to the
implementation phase, getting lost in the confusion and incapacity governing the project’s initial
years. The project paid a high price in the myriad technical and engineering issues affecting many
PIPs, including over-dimensioned investments.

2.1.6 Beneficiary cost-sharing: The project sought a 10% in-kind contribution from
beneficiaries towards the cost of their productive investments and the introduction of a
reimbursement scheme under which beneficiary associations would fully repay that cost to the
project’s designated financial agent, BANPARÁ. The latter was based on concerns about the
subsidy element for private goods financed with public money, which best practice was tending to
scale back. It was also an attempt to move beyond the NE CDD and related models, which viewed
grants for productive investments as a one-time injection of seed capital to jump-start productive
activity, not burdening beneficiaries with a loan during their initial growth and maturation period,
or leaving them to cope with traditionally risk-averse credit markets. The appropriateness of this
scheme is questionable in this case, especially for a new borrower, for investments with a majority
of beneficiaries under the poverty line and with little/no organized commercial experience, and,
culturally challenging for the expected quilombola participants.

2.1.7 BANPARÁ: The archive shows that the project team sought to establish an arrangement
using BANPARÁ as financial “agent” for a reimbursement scheme and to both avoid characterizing
the funds as a loan in the legal documents and avoid the terms/conditions of OP/BP 8.30 (now
OP/BP 10.00), designating BANPARÁ as a “financial intermediary” (FI). The project team
discussed a framework where beneficiary associations would reimburse into a revolving fund for
additional investments and thus the reimbursed funds would not just go into general state coffers. 7
The final outcome of this discussion in practice was inconsistent and ambiguous. The Loan
Agreement refers to “Loan and/or Grant” in Schedule II, yet the OP was not triggered. The
Operational Manual states (3.4.3, Vol. I) that amortization payments would be re-utilized to finance
new subprojects throughout the disbursement phase of the Loan Agreement (a revolving fund idea),
which did not occur. The Operational Manual/PIP Agreements permitted BANPARÁ to charge a
0.15% “tax concession fee” on the total value of each instalment/tranche disbursed to beneficiary
associations (Vol. II, Clause 7.4) and a 1% p.a. fee for delinquent accounts. The ICR mission was
also informed that until stopped by the NGPR, BANPARÁ was charging associations a 4% “annual
account maintenance fee”. In practice, BANPARÁ saw itself as a financial intermediary and acted
accordingly. The institution did not receive a full-scale fiduciary or technical analysis during
preparation, i.e., of its structure, performance record, internal procedures and suitability. Further,
regardless of the correctness of requiring PIP repayment, the concept that associations might repay
into a revolving fund for future investments, keeping the funds at the local level and multiplying
the benefits, should have been explored seriously during preparation and at minimum, piloted.

                                                        7
2.1.8 Risk analysis: The PAD analysis of potential risks was appropriate and prescient and
mitigation measures rational and persuasive. But, risk ratings were too optimistic given that the
new, incoming government represented a complete unknown, and a major omission was any
mention of capacity to implement in a State with no prior experience with the Bank. Also, the
lessons from other states regarding the risks to Bank projects of electoral turnover suggested the
need for specific mitigation measures. The risks associated with geography and logistics were high
but not mentioned. Rational mitigation would have called for defined geographic focus areas but it
was already decided that the project’s coverage would be state-wide. As it turned out, events and
conditions on the ground, at least in regard to Component A productive investments, de-railed the
vision of a smoothly-functioning operation with strong social controls.

2.1.9 Institutional design: As outlined in the PAD, the NGPR (within SEPE - Secretariat for
Special Projects) would both coordinate the overall project and execute Components A and C, while
the State Environmental Program (SECTAM, later SEMA) and ITERPA would manage sub-
components B1 and B2 respectively. BANPARÁ would serve as financial agent for Component A.
Other agencies would help execute the complementary infrastructure investments as required.8
Bank reviewers suggested that a distinct project unit be avoided in lieu of working directly with
local counterparts but the team believed such a unit was essential in Pará. Productive SPs could be
managed by their proponent institutions (beneficiary associations) with TA. With hindsight,
Component A and the NGPR belonged in the Secretariat of Agriculture (which had no role in the
project), although whether this would have shielded it from electoral/internal instability is unknown.
SEPE was known as a “super agency” with the power to convene other agencies, and had a close
working relationship with the Bank team, but it had no specific identification with the
agriculture/rural sector. There was also no practical synergy between the three major sets of
activities/institutions; the productive investments, land and environmental activities were
coordinated by different institutions and implemented in parallel, without organized channels of
communication, planning or collaboration. Physically, on the ground, the project operated in
different parts of the state and any overlap was largely coincidental.

2.2 Implementation
2.2.1 Factors affecting project implementation: The project’s implementation trajectory was
troubled from the beginning. Factors affecting the pace and quality of project implementation were
as follows, with Component A always the most problematic.

2.2.2 Project complexity vs Borrower capacity: Innovative and far-reaching interventions in
three sensitive sectors exceeded the NGPR’s coordination capacity. Sustained institutional
leadership proved critical but elusive. The state team which implemented the project was not the
one which had worked effectively with the Bank to prepare it. The Component A learning curve
was immense and never fully overcome. Delays progressively became chronic. Business plan
formulation, market orientation and the technical analysis and on-site verification of proposals all
suffered, as did targeting. The demand side was neglected: the NGPR team needed a “business
prospector” as most beneficiary associations/cooperatives were market amateurs. Contracting and
retaining skilled professionals was difficult, although SEMA put together a strong team. Neither
the Bank nor Client response was adequate to reverse the decline until 2012.


8   Multiple agencies were seen as a way of covering all contingencies for a multi-sector operation, but misjudged the
incentives driving institutional collaboration. The PAD states: “Procurement activities will be carried out by the NGPR,
SECTAM, ITERPA, SEOP, COSANPA and SETRAN. The particular structure for implementing the project in each
agency has yet to be defined”.

                                                           8
2.2.3 Electoral turnover: Gubernatorial elections in October 2006 (immediately after Board
approval and prior to effectiveness) replaced the state administration, and changed institutional
responsibilities for project activities, as well as the leadership and composition of the NGPR. The
incoming government/NGPR treated the project as an outmoded instrument of its predecessors.
Party political tensions exerted a powerful dampening effect on institutional performance from
2008-2011; the Governor was impeached in 2009. SEMA, due to strong commitment to the
environmental sector and project objectives and supported by the Bank TTL, managed to move
ahead. In ITERPA also, the first year went well under strong leadership but that ended abruptly,
slowing progress under the land activities. In October 2010, elections saw another political
transition, with a newly-reconstituted NGPR team lacking even basic knowledge about the project
or the Bank, partly because it had been neither briefed nor trained. The NGPR team was again
replaced in late 2012 following the Bank’s recommendations to the Governor concerning what
might/could salvage the project, and revelations of malfeasance.

2.2.4 Beneficiary organization: Community organization was essential but poorly-conceived
and executed. Many turned out to be associations on paper only or fronts for other interests.
Combined with weak NGPR oversight and poor governance in locations far from Belêm, the
situation was easily manipulated. Analysis of associations’ eligibility, despite criteria in the
Operational Manual, was inconsistent, not always physically verified and targeting was somewhat
random. A technical audit (Bayle, 2013) found that associations were taken advantage of by the
ADLs/ATER providers, whose inadequate qualifications and experience affected SP quality.
Technical and engineering problems were common, delaying PIP conclusion. Productive activities
in an estimated 90% of cases were unfamiliar to the association and imposed by TA providers who
also inflated the number of association members as well as the dimensions of the investments (since
they earned 4% of the total investment value as a fee). The implications of large, unwieldy
associations were high logistical and TA costs, even within associations as members were often
geographically dispersed with transportation difficulties. The project requirement that proponents
demonstrate a market for their product was inconsistently observed and/or formalized and not
infrequently arrangements had changed by the time of PIP conclusion.

2.2.5 Supervision quality: Component A, fully two-thirds of original project financing,
received only cursory attention from either the Bank or Client teams until end-2011. The
supervisory environment was undoubtedly challenging for the Bank team trying to advance a
project in a politically charged atmosphere lacking Borrower ownership. Restructuring was not
considered necessary because the Bank team perceived the main obstructions to be political, not
technical or operational. The reason the SEMA and ITERPA sub-components received more
attention was because the operating conditions/relationships were less stressful and engagement
easier. While Bank supervision met norms for regularity, missions were short and lacked
specialists aligned to project needs, reporting did not reflect the complex issues hindering progress
and, inaccurate data provided to Bank missions were not questioned. Ratings for DO and IP
remained in the satisfactory range even when the project was failing on many fronts. This project
required a strong Bank corporate ethic and image to the Borrower. Missions needed to show up as
a body of experts with clear diagnostic goals: the team lacked a social safeguards expert in a state
with sensitive ethnicity issues, an agribusiness specialist able to galvanize Component A, or M&E
and land specialists. Progress was glacial except for the environmental elements, and some progress
on the land aspects.




                                                 9
2.2.6 Revised approach: Bank task management changed in late 2011, the project’s constraints
were diagnosed and a technical audit of the PIPs/Component A was conducted.9 Beneficiaries were
found to be discontented and BANPARÁ’s performance was unsatisfactory. The mission found
that the NGPR was unprepared for its arrival, had scant knowledge of the project, of the Bank per
se or reasons for the mission, or of project expenditures and disbursements. Mission findings were
met with skepticism by the Secretary of the Special Secretariat for Economic Development and
Production Incentives (SEDIP) on the grounds that previous Bank missions had not raised such
issues and had consistently rated the project in the Satisfactory range. The Mid-term Review was
scheduled, and an action plan was initiated.

2.2.7 Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR was conducted in May 2012, delayed due to:
impeachment of the previous State Governor, creating uncertainty in many state agencies and a
sense that the MTR needed to wait; negligible achievement on the ground in Component A; and,
indecisiveness in the Bank and distancing of the team from a non-performing operation. The MTR
diagnosed the principal technical and operational issues driving the need for and justification of a
Level One Restructuring (see sections 1.6 and 1.7). The Bank’s post-MTR follow-up mission in
late 2012 however, found that the NGPR had done little, although disbursements had improved.
Importantly, the NGPR had not yet requested the green light from SEAIN to move forward with
the Restructuring, delaying its Board presentation. At this time also, allegations of financial
impropriety surfaced. The Bank team explained the project’s status to the new Governor including
what was needed to salvage the operation. The Governor’s prompt action to reconstitute the entire
NGPR team, and fully reimburse the Bank, had an immediate, galvanizing effect on project
execution and cleared the path for the Restructuring.

2.2.8 The project was strengthened by clarifying its objectives, reducing its scope and scale,
aligning it with revised State priorities and improving its design and implementation relevance. The
NGPR recruited new technical specialists and received additional support from the Extraordinary
State Secretariat for the Green Municipalities Program (Programa Municipios Verdes) under the
direct responsibility of the Governor. Implementation improved through increased dialogue with
SEMA and ITERPA, more rigorous oversight of NGPR, better technical approaches and
establishing a simplified MIS. In regard to why the project was not cancelled given its persistent
poor performance, the Bank project team and management agreed that it was worthwhile salvaging
those investments/PIPs which had potential based on the conclusions of the technical audit,
avoiding harm to beneficiaries with investments already underway, not jeopardizing other
important activities in land titling and environmental management and, minimizing potential
reputational risk to the Bank.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 Design: The PAD called for a well-staffed “monitoring and learning” function: regular
reports based on field inspection of SPs, collection of financial data and interviews; an inclusive,
participatory annual retreat to evaluate progress and feed lessons into the annual operating plan; a
baseline study to launch project evaluation of zoning, land registration and investment subprojects,
based on random sampling, with a final evaluation to measure impact; and, a management
information system (MIS) to monitor project activities and report on financial management and
disbursement, and a Borrower Completion Report (BCR).

2.3.2 Results Framework. The original PDO was expressed differently in the PAD main text,
Results Framework (RF) and the Loan Agreement (the latter used by the ICR). It was directly
relevant to State goals and the Brazil CPS, but not well-articulated. See paras. 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. Three
PDO Indicators are shown in the RF (and were monitored) and eight in the PAD Main Text (only
one of which is also in the RF). The Restructuring simplified and clarified the PDO, honing in on
the production/income nexus directly, with improved environmental management and land
administration as complementary goals. Intermediate outcome indicators were also improved.

2.3.3 Implementation and utilization/dissemination: This agenda exceeded NGPR capacity
without continuous Bank mentoring and a designated, trained M&E unit. Performance was weak.
Basic M&E was not established until 2013/14. Data provided to Bank missions in the initial years
was in key cases inflated but this was not verified until the MTR. Bank missions repeatedly called
for an MIS but did not provide the facilitation support needed until the final years. The planned
independent reports based on field inspection of project activities and focus groups were never
produced. Lack of an MIS affected the production of FMRs for FM monitoring which – along with
important EOP analyses (EFA, Borrower Final Report, and Impact Evaluation Study) – relied on
Excel tables and manual methods. Data-keeping in SEMA and ITERPA was better but not
aggregated by NGPR into a “project” database as originally envisaged.

2.3.4 Evaluation: A baseline study was conducted by a consulting firm in 2013. Control and
treatment groups were established. A supplementary exercise by the ADLs to increase the baseline
pool left little time between the baseline and final surveys/data collection for productive results to
emerge. Impact evaluation was logistically and technically challenging (see details in Annex 5).
Many PIPs were dispersed and physically unreachable within a reasonable time or budget,
generating unavoidable methodological issues for both the treatment and control groups. A second
field survey was conducted a year later before EOP. The recent operational status of many PIPs
made empirical conclusions about household income gains difficult. To improve the information
base on income, complementary case studies were conducted in June 2015. See Section 3.2 and
Annex 5. No organized dissemination of project results/lessons had occurred at the time of ICR
finalization and was unlikely given the NGPR’s skeleton staff and uncertain status after closing.
The Borrower had not yet delivered its BCR at the time of ICR finalization.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Environmental Safeguards: Environmental safeguards performance/compliance was
rated uniformly Satisfactory by the ICR mission for all 41 PIPs, consistent with similar ratings
throughout project execution. The project was classified Category A (Full Assessment) requiring
an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) under OP 4.01.
The project also triggered Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Forests (OP 4.36) Pest Management (OP
4.09), Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). 10 The Bank
safeguards team found that the identification, preparation and implementation of activities on the
ground followed recommended practices consistent with the project’s EMP. During the last two
years of the project, Component A SPs were also monitored by a contracted environmental
specialist. The project included other interventions under Component B which are expected to
improve environmental management over the longer-term: (i) improving the legal and regulatory
framework for ecological and environmental zoning and land management; (ii) detailing the state
ecological-economic zoning (ZEE) plan; (iii) preparation and submission of the Rural

included in the final supervision/ICR Aide Memoire.

Environmental Cadaster (CAR - Cadastro Ambiental Rural) for farms with PIPs. Submission of a
CAR is an obligation under the new Brazilian Forest Code; and (iv) strengthening of SEMA, via
training and equipment, studies (e.g. environmental auditing of the meat production sector and new
information systems), and improved environmental planning and management. The following
summarizes performance under individual safeguards.
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04): All PIPs included preventative activities for managing environmental
resources to ensure that natural habitats were conserved/protected and all but one had identified the
measures needed to recuperate sensitive/other areas altered by project activities. Two thirds had
executed such measures already and the rest were doing so. PIPs had not altered or degraded critical
natural habitats, and all were located in areas where alteration or conversion had already occurred.
In all cases, measures were included/monitored to mitigate possible impacts to natural habitats and
the project was taking into account the rights of local organizations and communities in this regard.
Pest Management (OP 4.09): Evaluation of Pest Management practices showed that in two-thirds
of PIPs (those where OP 4.09 was relevant) the use of biological and environmental methods for
pest control were incorporated.
Forests (OP 4.36): With few exceptions, PIPs were in accordance with development policy calling
for the preservation and adequate management of forest eco-systems.                    All were in
compliance/accord with: requirement to not cause significant conversion/degradation of forest
areas or critical natural habitats; international environmental agreements; requirement to not
convert or degrade critical natural habitat including in adjacent areas; not planting or harvesting in
forest areas or critical habitats. With few exceptions, the PIP Environmental Analyses identified
potential impacts on forest eco-systems and local communities.

2.4.5 Social Safeguards: Bank supervision of Social Safeguards compliance (Indigenous
Peoples OP 4.20 and Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12) was virtually non-existent until late 2012.
The initial rating of compliance with OP 4.20 was Moderately Unsatisfactory and risk was rated
High. Deficiencies included: (i) lack of an effective strategy for disseminating the project among
target groups, and engaging/mobilizing them to present proposals; (ii) lack of compliance with the
IPPF recommendation that indigenous and quilombola leaders receive training for planning and
managing SPs and strengthening their organizations; (iii) procedures and guidelines for promoting
their participation relied on a State program which had been discontinued and the Project lacked
clear operational guidelines for working with such populations; and, (iv) with the project website
discontinued, the policy frameworks for indigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement were not
publicly available, and monitoring systems were flawed. In regard to subcomponent B1
administered by SEMA however, the Bank Social specialist found no evidence of overlap between
the boundaries of new Protected Areas (PA) and indigenous and quilombola lands, nor in regard to
OP 4.12, involuntary dislocation of effected families; and, in respect to subcomponent B2
administered by ITERPA, there was no evidence of land conflicts or involuntary displacement.

2.4.6 To resolve key issues, NGPR worked with SEMA and ITERPA to update all state and
municipal PAs supported by the project emphasizing the potential number of families to be
displaced and any cases of conflict or overlapping boundaries between new PAs and existing ethnic
lands. Involved agencies reviewed the IPPF, quilombolas and related needs, strengthened project
dissemination to those groups, analyzed the cultural appropriateness of the BANPARA
reimbursement requirement/arrangement, and improved operational guidelines for working with
these groups. The Bank team spent more time on field visits to intervention areas for
Subcomponents B1 and B2 to fully address Social Safeguards compliance issues. Based on strong
performance on the action plan recorded by the Bank in December 2014, the Social Safeguards




                                                 12
rating was raised to Moderately Satisfactory with a risk rating of Medium.11

2.4.7 Procurement: The overall procurement risk was rated High at appraisal with a capacity
assessment of the NGPR indicating the need for bi-annual supervision by locally-contracted
consultants to conduct field-based procurement post reviews (PPR), in addition to prior review
supervision by the Bank. For SPs under Component A, the NGPR was to contract independent
procurement reviews/audits (IPRs) by acceptable procurement experts and at intervals determined
by when Bank-financed contracts had reached 150.12 The Bank Procurement Specialist conducted
procurement post reviews (PPR) in August 2009, December 2011 and May 2014, and did regular
procurement supervision with the six-monthly missions.

2.4.8 The NGPR had five procurement staff, sufficient in the Bank’s view to handle project
demands, but performance was uneven. NGPR’s oversight of procurement by SEMA and ITERPA
was inadequate, the consultant contracting and payment process showed poor capacity and the
procurement environment and decision-making were perceived to be politically-influenced. The
2009 PPR recommended that a consultant assist NGPR, SEMA and ITERPA to secure greater
transparency in procurement processes, and that all procurement conducted up to August 2009 be
reviewed in depth. Since none of the 2009 PPR recommendations had been implemented by 2011,
the Compliance Risk Rating of Procurement Processes, and the Performance Risk Rating of
Contract Administration were both rated High, and the overall rating was downgraded to MU. In
October 2013, the Bank and NGPR agreed that community participatory procedures would be
limited to specific contracts; community-based procurement was seen as lacking transparency. The
compliance and performance risk ratings remained Substantial. Governance issues were perceived
by Bank team members. Assertions were compiled into a single note to Bank Management for
further action. Thet PPR of May 2014 PPR, on the basis of the independent subproject audit report
covering eight contracts signed by associations in 2012, upgraded the risk rating to Substantial.

2.4.9 Financial management: FM management performance was generally weak. The FM risk
was assessed at appraisal as Moderate and the NGPR was found to have satisfactory FM
arrangements in place, meeting OP/BP 10.02 “minimum requirements”. Special emphasis was to
be given to monitoring the Productive Project Financing Fund and the Program Executive Account,
at BANPARÁ. NGPR’s FM capacity however, showed little evolution, oversight of BANPARÁ
was inadequate, while financial reporting by beneficiary producer organizations was flawed in the
first years of implementation and needed more continuous/intensive monitoring including by the
Bank. The Restructuring resulted in the recruitment of additional FM staff to build capacity at the
association level and within project institutions. The main issues arising during Bank FM
supervision were: (i) inclusion of credit fees in the PIP Agreements between BANPARÁ and
beneficiary associations, not envisaged at appraisal. The FM specialist required immediate
cancellation of such fees to avoid triggering the Bank’s policy on financial intermediation; (ii) lack
of an automated financial monitoring system capable of generating IFRs, and internal


11  Peer review suggested that broad application of the resettlement policy to all systematic cadastral surveying and land
regularization against the accepted practice of applying footnote 8 when the issues are between private parties, might
have made implementation of the land sub-component more challenging. The Social Specialist responded that the
situation was not a matter of disputes between private parties as envisaged under footnote 8 but relationships between
the State’s exercise of eminent domain and private parties. For all other land regula rization related to small farms,
footnote 8 was followed.
12     LA (Schedule 2, Section I.B.5, and Operational Manual, Vol. I p. 51). This provision arose when the State at
negotiations was unwilling to finance annual audits of contracts. Some 150 contracts was estimated as the average likely
to be concluded annually. Due to the slow progress on implementing the Component A PIPs – which generally comprised
several contracts – the first such audit only occurred in 2013.

                                                           13
controls/processes not in compliance with the Loan Agreement even by 2013. The Bank urged
installation of an automated system and its integration with SIAFEM (System of Administrative
and Financial Information for States and Municipalities); (iii) the FM rating was Unsatisfactory by
late 2014 with a risk rating of Substantial due to negligible progress on Bank FM recommendations
(other than BANPARA). The Action Plan was only partially achieved and FM restructuring was
recommended; and, (iv) expenses under 19 PIPs - totaling up to R$5.5 m - were declared ineligible
due to inactive status. The Bank called for the return of these funds or, that the expenditures be
substituted by finalized SPs which had used counterpart funds. The 41 PIP Agreements
representing completed investments reimbursable to BANPARÁ by beneficiary associations were
forgiven, formally reverting to grants including via the issuance of a “Carta de Quitação”
(Settlement Letter) to each association. The eligibility of certain expenditures associated with
paralyzed PIPs was still under direct, active resolution between the Bank’s FM Specialist and the
NGPR, at ICR finalization.

2.4.10 Audit: Audit performance was weak with most audits delivered to the Bank well beyond
the due date. The first two audit reports showed unqualified opinions with some internal control
issues noted but opinions fell into the qualified/adverse or qualified/exception categories for most
of the remaining project period, with improvement in the final years in opinions but not timeliness.
At the time of ICR finalization, the 2014 audit was pending, due end-June 2015.

2.4.11 Governance: In March 2013, allegations of fraud and corruption were uncovered by the
Bank task team and reported to INT by the Region, the first against NGPR officials and the second
against the NGPR and BANPARÁ, in the latter case for changing the terms of a Bank-approved
contract. INT reviewed the first complaint and determined that some of the allegations pertained to
operational and implementation issues at the PMU (NGPR) level, which lacked material elements
required to qualify under the definition of sanctionable practices established by the Bank. Further,
INT found that some of the irregularities reported were perpetrated under the former Project
Director and the Administrative Coordinator who had already been removed by the Governor as
part of a series of corrective actions agreed with the Bank. In regard to the World Bank/BANPARÁ
contract, the financial risk was mitigated by the Task Team by voiding the previous contract not
approved by the Bank, requesting and obtaining the reimbursement of all extra remunerations
charged by BANPARÁ and, signing a new contract with BANPARÁ satisfactory to the Bank’s
Legal and FM authorities. INT determined that there were no actionable leads to further pursue
these matters and closed the complaint file in April 2014.

2.4.12 A second allegation from the same source received in March 2014 concerned fraud,
corruption and collusion in the same unit (NGPR) involving different companies, contracts and
individuals. After a comprehensive review including witness debriefings and document analysis,
INT closed the complaint based on the following considerations: witnesses ostensibly forced to
approve certain payments for works not done or goods not supplied, did not corroborate these
allegations during interviews with INT; companies hired under the PIP arrangements and NGPR
staff potentially involved in the alleged misconduct were not subject to the Bank’s F/C guidelines;
resources to pursue a full investigation were limited; and, the project’s closure was imminent.

2.4.12 Project costs: Costs by component differed markedly from appraisal estimates, taking into
account the restructured/reduced targets and cancellation of an aggregate US$24.66 m (USD 22.28
m at restructuring and US$2.38 m at closing). Income generation activities were less than 27% of
appraisal, environmental management about 70%, land administration 36% and policy
development activities about 8%. Project management costs however, were 163% of appraisal with



                                                14
the cost of project coordination specifically about 231% of the original estimate and project
monitoring costs barely 6%.

2.4.13 Disbursement: Of the original Loan of US$60.0 m, final disbursements totaled
US$35.341 m. US$22.28 m were cancelled by the Restructuring and another US$2.38 m in unused
loan funds were slated for cancellation at the time of ICR finalization (see Annex 2). In addition:
as at ICR finalization: (i) US$ 377,027 still needed documentation; (ii) US$1.88 m were to be
returned to the Bank for ineligible expenditures or replaced by eligible expenditures; and (iii) it
was still possible that the final audit report would reveal other, ineligible expenditures.

2.4.14 Investment costs: Average cost per family of the 41 concluded PIPs - R$7,359 (US$3,237)
- was comparatively high for demand-driven investments intended for beneficiaries of which 70%
were expected to be below the poverty line and all of whom were expected to repay. Cost per
family ranged from R$4,822 to a high of R$18,013.13 In six PIPs the total investment exceeded
R$1.0 million with one PIP exceeding R$1.6 m benefiting 240 families, an average investment of
R$6,704/family. Another investment of R$1.57 m benefited 157 families, or R$10,031/family.
Aggregate costs per PIP in many cases reflected multiple investments. Costs were influenced by
the following: (i) the tendency for TA providers with a 4% fee incentive to inflate sub-project
design and dimensions; (ii) inadequate analysis, monitoring and/or oversight of SP technical and
economic feasibility, scale and costing - TA providers had a virtually free hand; (iii) multiple
investments in most PIPs; (iv) increased unit costs due to Brazil’s national inflation rate: from
January 2006 to December 2014, the Consumer Price Index increased from 2,500 to around 4,000,
representing average price increases of 60%, or a cumulative rate of 6.1% per year. The cost of
construction materials and equipment soared; (v) lack of qualified contractors in remote regions
willing to bid on small-scale works; and, (vi) technical/contractual and other issues, as well as a
lack of standardized design and cost parameters drove up costs, with repeated adjustments of unit
prices and contract values.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 Transition arrangements for the operational phase of project investments – specifically the
PIPs - are variable, depending on the capacity of an association and its access to inputs. O&M
practices were not analyzed systematically, only as opportunity arose during the ICR mission, but
appeared to be well-managed based on field inspection of facilities and activities financed. At the
time of ICR conclusion, arrangements were underway to support the PIPs by helping associations
launch operations, obtain TA especially in organizational management and marketing of outputs,
and establish links to financing sources. The NGPR was reduced to about four professionals at the
time of the ICR mission but the ICR verified that field supervision of PIPs was still ongoing in June
2015. The ICR mission also confirmed that EMATER has a strong presence in the countryside and
PIP associations are using its TA services as well as those of SEBRAE and related entities.

2.5.2 In regard to the achievements/reforms and institutional capacity of SEMA, the outlook is
promising given the youth, dynamism and commitment of its professional staff and their close
identification with their sector and with project achievements and objectives. In the case of ITERPA,
institutional capacity remains variable but the recruitment of a large cohort of new technical staff
is planned and this should – along with project-financed equipment and systems - boost institutional
capacity to sustain the reforms introduced in their land administration operations.



13  Average cost per family based on four pilot models developed during preparation (PAD, Annex 4) was an estimated
R$4,360 to R$8,005, the PAD noting that the pilots (PIPs) consisted in each case of 6-9 individual subprojects.

                                                       15
2.5.3 The State Government would welcome further engagement with the Bank, and its having
prevailed in the 2014 elections implies at least four years within which to prepare and implement
the initial stages of a new operation. However, at the time of ICR preparation, the Bank was not in
a position to commit to a follow-on operation in the State of Pará. The possibility of a future
operation depended on discussions with the new Federal economic team and the resolution of SBL
(Single Borrower Limit) constraints.14

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:
3.1.1 Relevance of objectives: Significant At the time of Restructuring, the general thrust of
the original PDO remained very relevant to/identified with the State’s development priorities but
its unclear articulation kept the rating at Significant (rather than High). Post-Restructuring, the
clarified PDO which preserved the core ideas, re-expressed in simpler, more direct language,
continued to have High relevance. Increasing the incomes of rural poor households and improving
environmental and land management remain at the core of the State’s development challenges. The
recently re-elected Governor and administration have confirmed that these goals remain top
priorities, and they align closely with the pillars of the current Brazil CPS (2012-15, Report No.
63731-BR).

3.1.2 Relevance of design and implementation: Modest                       Design and implementation
relevance are directly related to the project’s appropriateness as a vehicle for achieving the PDO,
and for State conditions and capacity. The APL was misconceived in over-loading the initial stage
instead of using it to establish and evaluate a set of synergistic activities which could be selectively
scaled up under a second stage. Pre-Restructuring relevance is rated Low. Both design and
implementation relevance improved post-Restructuring and are rated Significant: (i) in design,
unrealistic targets/activities unlikely to progress or not essential to achieving the PDO were reduced
or eliminated; activities were re-aligned with State policy priorities to increase relevance (essential
studies, introduction of the CAR); non-viable PIPs were screened out and basic criteria strictly
applied (genuine association with capacity, identified market); and, non-relevant land and
environmental activities were eliminated. Implementation relevance improved through more
intensive, well-staffed Bank supervision; strengthening the NGPR to address skills gaps
(economists, social scientist, engineer and agri-business specialist), and partnerships with
EMATER and SEBRAE to strengthen technical assistance. See also 1.1.7. Improved relevance is
demonstrated in the project’s overall better performance in its final two years.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 Consistent with the ICR Guidelines, Appendix B, the following assesses project
achievements and disbursement at two time points – Restructuring on June 24, 2013 and at EOP -
and under the original and revised PDO respectively. The PDO in each case is broken down into
its main themes and available evidence is organized accordingly, applying both the results and
selectively, the intermediate outcome indicators.

Efficacy: Pre-Restructuring (June 2013)




14   ISR #16, December 16, 2014.


                                                  16
A. Original PDO: “Improve the living conditions of rural poor communities of the Borrower
through the building of institutional capacity and the strengthening of the Borrower’s
environmental and land administration systems, while securing a sustainable and safe
environment.”

3.2.2 While the PDO captured legitimate, current State development priorities, it was not well-
articulated in not specifying/alluding to the economic activities linked to achieving the main PDO
indicator: “36,000 families with incomes raised 30% on average above the poverty line”. Further,
“living conditions” in development terms usually refer to better housing, access to piped water,
electricity and/or sanitation, i.e., basic infrastructure. Project design acknowledged such needs by
including an “infrastructure” element to be financed by the relevant agency/program, not the Bank
loan, and only if a PIP depended on it. No indicators were included for such investments because
their importance was expected to be minor in the PIP “package”. From the PDO as worded,
building institutional capacity and strengthening land administration and environmental systems
were seen as the primary drivers of improved living conditions, not the productive investments/PIPs
which were two-thirds of project financing. This inconsistency cannot be remedied but it is assumed
that better incomes from investments in commercially viable ventures would also boost living
conditions. The potential meaning of “sustainable and safe environment” is broad but the ICR links
it primarily to achievements under dependent Themes 2 and 3 below. It is taken to mean not just
“environmental” gains but factors such as security of land tenure, land dispute resolution and
stronger institutions in related sub-sectors.

Over-riding Theme 1: Improve the living conditions of rural poor communities of the Borrower
while securing a sustainable and safe environment Unsatisfactory

3.2.3     Results at the time of Restructuring were as follows:
         Two PIPs (1.4% of the original target) were concluded and at an early stage of operations
          with no results, and another 47 were at various stages of processing and implementation,
          representing an aggregate 4,066 families, about 11% of the 36,000 family target.
         Since M&E was non-existent before 2013, it is not possible to determine income gains
          based on such low achievement or to speculate on how living conditions might have
          improved for beneficiaries. From a scale perspective, the impact of two, recently-
          concluded PIPs on living conditions, either direct or indirect, was assumed to be low.
         Important achievements were registered in environmental systems and policies (3.2.5) but
          were negligible in terms of institutional capacity (3.2.4) and land administration (3.2.6)
          and thus achievement of a “sustainable and safe environment” was partial at this stage.

Theme 2: Building institutional capacity15 Unsatisfactory

3.2.4 In the absence of a PDO indicator pre-Restructuring to capture this theme, the intermediate
outcome indicators are applied. An institutional support structure had been built but its
effectiveness was not formally evaluated and subsequent experience showed ongoing capacity gaps.
     The NGPR itself was institutionally ineffective with all secondary indicators covering
        management systems, social communications and M&E showing partial or negligible
        achievement by Restructuring, and weak performance on procurement, FM and on
        ensuring minimum standards of technical analysis and field oversight.



15    This is taken to mean the institutional capacity to support Component A, linked to “improved living conditions”.
Institutional gains in environmental and land management are treated separately as part of their “systems” strengthening.

                                                          17
       13 Local Development Agents (LDA) were trained and field-deployed to inter alia, support
        associations’ organization and formulation of PIP proposals but effectiveness was weak.
       70 associations with PIP proposals had been trained in the pre-Restructuring period.
        Institutional gains by NGPR were modest, shown in poor progress of Component A,
        weak/uneven quality of the associations, and flawed PIPs (Technical Audit, 2013).
       ATER (technical assistance and rural extension) service suppliers, part of the institutional
        framework supporting the PIPs, were of variable quality professionally and technically,
        contributing to the problems hampering the PIPs.

Theme 3: Strengthening the Borrower’s environmental and land administration systems
Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.2.5 Environmental systems: Satisfactory Strengthening of environmental systems, a causative
link to “securing a sustainable and safe environment” was the only major achievement of the pre-
Restructuring period.
     The Economic-Ecological Zoning of around 65% of the State area (875,000 sq. km,
         completing a process started earlier) at a scale of 1:250,000 – a major, multi-stakeholder
         effort – and approval of the ZEE Law by the State Assembly, became the principal
         instruments guiding the organization needed for sustainable territorial development.
     ZEE is also instrumental for reducing the Legal Reserve in Amazônia (reducing the reserve
         per property from 80% to >50%) as envisaged in the new National Forest Code; is the basis
         for the CAR (rural environmental cadaster); helps define the Legal Reserve (a function of
         the area for alternative soil usage); supports the State Program for Environmental
         Regularization (PRA) and environmental licensing.
     Legal framework for environmental systems was revised and adopted pre-Restructuring:
         decrees, normative instructions and state laws were developed for reserve areas, public
         lands, territorial management and organization, and land regularization.
     Staffing and technical capacity was increased in SEMA, and all planned training was
         delivered to relevant staff, directly influencing its successful execution of project activities.

3.2.6 Land administration systems: Unsatisfactory               The quest for improved land tenure
security for rural producers, also a causative link to “securing a sustainable and safe environment”,
showed modest achievement by June 2013.
      ITERPA established and tested two mechanisms/forums for non-judicial land conflict
          resolution; the number of beneficiaries pre-Restructuring is unknown due to M&E issues.
      1,055 properties were surveyed (vs. 50,000 target) and an estimated 985 properties titled
          (vs. 30,000 target).
      Institutional reforms were significant, including: (i) revised legal framework through
          decrees and resolutions from 2007-2011; (ii) redrafting and modernization of its
          institutional regulations; (iii) alignment of its legal foundation with the Federal
          Constitution (1988) and with federal and state environmental and land laws.
      These reforms positioned ITERPA for further modernization but the institution had other
          longstanding issues (see 3.5.5), not helped by the loss of its new and dynamic director a
          year after effectiveness. No public land registries had been digitalized because the activity
          was transferred to INCRA in 2010 and dropped from the project.

B. Revised PDO: “Increase incomes derived from productive activities by beneficiary rural
producers, while contributing to improving environmental management and land administration
in the Borrower’s territory”. Moderately Satisfactory

Theme 1: Increased incomes from productive activities by beneficiary rural producers
Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.2.7 The evaluation exercise and difficulties affecting the efforts to obtain empirical data are
explained in Section 2.3 and Annex 5. Most PIPs were completed in 2013 and 2014 and it is
premature in terms of agricultural cycles and related factors to expect rapid, measurable income
effects in many cases. To strengthen results, the ICR team returned to the field in June 2015 to
prepare non-experimental, complementary case studies demonstrating the impact of the
intervention on a non-random group of PIPs with a substantial productive track record and sales.
     43% of the Treatment Group (TG) of 237 families with at least one year of production
         showed real income growth of 30% or higher, compared to 35% in the Control Group (CG),
         as a result of project-financed agro-livestock activities, while 51% of the TG registered
         positive changes per se in real income as a result of those same activities.
     Applied to the 3,148 beneficiary families, (78.7%), 1,354 families improved their incomes
         by over 30% as a result of the project. Annex 2 shows the full range of activities financed.
     Financial and economic analysis provides good examples of the potential income prospects
         of many families, even under worst case scenarios, if common issues are resolved.
     Complementary case studies (Bayle, 2015) of five PIPs completed over one year ago and
         with results from at least one production cycle show incremental income increases in 2014
         ranging from R$261/family (honey and poultry production) to R$11,072/family
         (vegetables and poultry production). See Annex 5.
     Sustainability risk is significant and the scale of achievement post-Restructuring is below
         the revised target in both numbers of investments and numbers of beneficiary families but
         given the late restructuring and time available, achievements are considered substantial.

Theme 2: Improved environmental management in the Borrower’s territory Satisfactory

3.2.7 Environmental management further improved post-Restructuring, importantly because the
ZEE (3.2.5) provided the legal foundation for other critical achievements:
     4,686 CARs for family agriculture (quilombola, land reform settlements, family farms)
       permitted Tailândia Municipality and 72% of the registered area of Mojú Municipality to
       exit embargo status, while greatly reducing deforestation (the reason for the embargo).
     CAR improved management of the meat value chain in Pará: environmental controls and
       traceability of meat by the cold-storage industry, slaughter-houses and the leather industry.
     An important related policy instrument, the PPCAD (Plan for the Prevention, Control and
       Alternatives to Deforestation) was prepared, evaluated and launched.
     Draft legislation was prepared for the State’s Policy on Coastal Management involving 25
       coastal municipalities and when approved - regarded as likely - will facilitate execution of
       the National Coastal Management Plan.
     Technical capacity to implement State environmental licensing policies was improved by
       training 24 SEMA technicians to collaborate closely with field-based institutions managing
       the storage and transport of hazardous materials/products.
     Training improved state and municipal technician’s management of environmental
       licensing for fish farming - expanding exponentially in the State of Pará – and capacity to
       execute the Coastal ZEE and the State Coastal Management Policy (GERCO).

            Indigenous Environmental Agents (IEA) were trained to strengthen vigilance and territorial
             protection capacity as well as build links to relevant state government entities.
            Ethno-zoning was completed with indigenous leaders’ participation, producing guidelines
             for community and government actions in specific indigenous lands.

Theme 3: Improved land administration in the Borrower’s territory Satisfactory

3.2.8 ITERPA improved State land administration, with titling processing managed more
effectively and efficiently from 2012 onwards:
      39,000 parcels were registered (100%) under the Precursor and Mobilization phases of the
         Varredura Fundiária methodology (see Annex 2).
      2,978 individual property titles (240% of the revised target) were provided to an equal
         number of families, representing some 57,000 ha.
      1,591 quilombola families in 23 Municipalities, received group titles for about 36,000 ha.
      Land conflict resolution mechanisms – the Committee for Mediation of Land Conflicts
         and the system of public hearings (ouvidoria) - already established and tested pre-
         Restructuring, were mainstreamed and have provided a public forum and open, transparent
         proceedings to resolve land disputes for over 8,600 families.

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 A cost-benefit analysis was conducted of 10 illustrative cases out of the seven economic
activities comprising 85% of the 41 productive subprojects (within PIPs) and representing about
84% of the total investment in subprojects.18 The illustrative cases are not representative of those
activities due to the heterogeneous level of maturity of each activity financed and in their size and
characteristics; it is not possible to produce meaningful aggregated results for all PIPs. Instead, the


16 While the ICR Guidelines Appendix B call for the weighted disbursement element to use the date of Restructuring as
the cut-off point – and this has been done – the ICR asserts that end-December 2012 (not June, 2013) would be a more
balanced reflection of the project’s disbursement progress post-MTR when the overall operational approach became more
rigorous and the agreed elements of the Restructuring went into effect rapidly and gained traction.
17    The disbursement ratio is calculated by taking the original Loan of US$60.0 m, less aggregate cancellations of
US$24.659 m (US$22.275 m resulting from the Restructuring and another US$22.276 m at end-grace period), leaving
total loan financing available and disbursed by EOP of US$35.34 m. Applying disbursements as at end-2012 rather than
end-June 2013 (Board date of Restructuring), disbursements are divided as follows: US$19.92 m first stage (56.4%) and
US$15.52 m second stage (43.6%).
18    No ex-post economic analysis was conducted for the land administration sub-component. While relevant, and even
though there are methodologies applicable, there were neither the funds nor the time available to conduct such analysis.

                                                          20
analysis estimates the viability of each type of activity. Three scenarios were developed for each
case: the current situation, the minimum scenario and the best case scenario. The selection of cases
to illustrate each activity was based on data availability. See Annex 3.
       Financial analysis shows that if the currently existing bottlenecks are not solved only four
           of the 10 cases (distributed in two activities – agroforestry and aquaculture) would attain
           an IRR equal to or above 12% and positive net margin. A minimum scenario, in which the
           existing bottlenecks are overcome to attain both positive net margin and NPV, is deemed
           likely to be achieved for seven cases (four activities). But, uncertainty about the resolution
           of existing problems for the remaining cases (cassava processing, fruit pulp and poultry)
           is significant. In a best (but realistic) case scenario, IRRs range from 12 to 32 percent.
      Economic analysis shows more favorable results due to adjustments in the labor cost of
          opportunity considering the low occupation rate in the region and to the subtraction of taxes
          and social benefits from the subproject costs. IRRs range between 14 and 28% under the
          current scenario with NPV ranging from –R$66,764 (fruit pulp) to R$557,069 (agro-
          forestry systems); under a minimum scenario IRRs range between 12 and 2% with NPV
          ranging from zero (honey production) to R$647,223 (ice production); and, under a best-
          case scenario IRRs are between 23 and 40% with NPV ranging from R$74,192 (fruit pulp
          production) to R$875,389 (ice production).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory
3.4.1 The overall rating takes into account the following conclusions:
     Relevance: Significant Relevance of the PDO to the State’s development challenges and
        the pillars of the Bank’s CPS was Significant pre-Restructuring and once
        clarified/simplified by the Restructuring (without changing its basic thrust) was High. The
        relevance of design and implementation increased from Low pre-Restructuring to
        Significant following across the board revisions to project design and the implementation
        methodology and approach which, while not optimal, clearly enabled a struggling project
        to move forward and achieve measurable results. See 1.7.1.
     Efficacy: Unsatisfactory Negligible achievement up to 2013 is balanced against
        Moderately Satisfactory results for the post-Restructuring period taking into account
        achievements under Component A (tempered by sustainability and scale concerns), and
        strong results for environmental and land administration activities. As noted in footnote 15,
        using the date of restructuring as the determinant of the disbursement percentage tends to
        skew the actual improvement underway post-MTR towards the lower range.
     Efficiency: Modest Relative efficiency pre- and post-Restructuring was not assessed as
        the analysis of economic and financial results is an EOP exercise, especially in an
        agriculture project. Both financial and economic IRRs are favorable in most cases, even
        under a minimum scenario. Further, as per 3.2.7, case studies of fully operational SPs show
        significant, actual increases in families’ incremental income (see 3.2 and Annex 5).
        However, when the cancellation of US$24.66 m, INT cases (closed) and managerial
        weaknesses are taken into account, overall efficiency is in the lower range.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1 Poverty impacts: The primary measure of poverty impact is the PDO income indicator
which shows 43% of beneficiary families with income increases exceeding 30%. An important
issue is the scale and dispersion of poverty reduction and the sustainability of the investments. The
ICR concludes that while poverty impact is real for those families who have managed to launch
operations and sell their production, it is modest in global terms.

                                                   21
3.5.2 Gender: Women’s participation was not discussed in the PAD, included in the Results
Framework or reported by supervision. The NGPR appeared not to be overtly aware of its
importance. This did not mean that women were excluded or their participation hindered. The ICR
mission noted that associations/subprojects visited had a variable number of female-headed
households, and that it was not unusual for an association to have a female president and office-
holders in charge of large investments.

3.5.3 Social development: Quilombola leaders from three communities with PIPs in productive
activities and forest management (Menino Jesus, São Manoel and Santa Rita do Barriero) presented
their views on project benefits to the Bank social specialist in 2013. Benefits include: enhanced
community organization of group activities and division of labor; increased understanding of
marketing bottlenecks and requirements for competitively accessing markets; positive changes in
productive practices and productivity; better access to markets; and, behavioral changes related to
planning each stage of their economic activities. Weaknesses included: faulty communication,
precarious TA and heavy/slow bureaucratic processes generating false expectations among
potential participants had led to flawed planning and decision-making and discredited the project.
Conditions began to improve via better TA and clearer guidance but some results were
compromised and challenges were hard to overcome. But, access to institutional markets had
improved, as had families’ productivity and outcomes, attracting greater interest from middlemen
and promoting more competition among buyers. All indicated commitment to pay their debt to
BANPARÁ and were unaware that the PIP Agreements had been formally waived, due to lack of
communication from NGPR. This was resolved and their waivers were formally processed.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4 NGPR: The NGPR was by definition a temporary unit within SEDIP (and transferred in
March 2015 to the Secretariat of Agriculture - SAGRI) so that issues of long-term capacity and
institutional development differ from those of permanent project agencies. The NGPR was
strengthened by recruitment of new staff in 2012/13 and added support from the Extraordinary
State Secretariat for the Green Municipalities Program (Programa Municipios Verdes), under the
State Governor. The latter proved crucial in strengthening NGPR capacity and re-aligning the
project with State Government priorities. The marked improvement in project performance is
evidence of institutional growth. However, the pattern of managerial and staff turnover penalized
performance, project continuity and human capital development over time. The unit was not valued
as a cohort of professionals tasked with coordinating/executing complex activities. NGPR’s
institutional footprint is likely to disappear due to the erosion/dispersion of institutional memory
and technical/operational capacity. This may have turned out differently if the NGPR had been
located in the Secretariat of Agriculture and implemented Component A as a high value learning
experience of benefit to the sector through internalization and mainstreaming.

3.5.5 ITERPA: Project-financed institutional and legal reorganization in the early years helped
ITERPA modernize but had only modest impact on its capacity at that time, which was
compromised by repeated rotation of managers, lack of integration/communication with NGPR and
– as noted in its own report - inadequate support from the Bank including on M&E of relevant
indicators (partly explaining weak data up to 2011). ITERPA launched its project activities with
pilots enabling the development of the five-step varredura methodology (see Annex 2) but to title
more rapidly, close collaboration is needed with a range of institutions under a unified data
platform; the highly-politicized land sector makes this difficult. ITERPA is a small institution
covering a massive territory. Staff working conditions improved from project-financed investments
in modern equipment, vehicles and training. Its improved operational capacity is reflected in its

                                                22
satisfactory performance post-Restructuring. But, even at EOP, there were insufficient staff (about
300) and about 50% will retire in the coming two years; age is affecting its field operations.
ITERPA has begun to outsource certain functions within the titling chain. The project strengthened
ITERPA’s information and titling services, as well as cartographic and geo -referencing capability
and its strengthened management of land conflicts was an important achievement. But, the
institution still lacks a rational internal structure and is overly-centralized in Belém.

3.5.6 SEMA: The institution’s young, dynamic team with strong and diverse specialist
backgrounds learned from the project experience and grew professionally, reflected in the
successful implementation of Component B1 and impressive ability of the SEMA team to discuss
their work/achievements substantively. This was not always the case, but SEMA benefited from
exceptionally able team leadership in recent years, a comparatively stable structure and manpower,
and learned from the Bank team’s recommendations. SEMA described its own evolution as
follows: (i) the learning and maturation of technical staff in monitoring/oversight of project
activities from gestation to execution; (ii) articulation between different sectors within SEMA to
jointly execute important state policy management guidelines for the CAR, Forest Code and coastal
management; (iii) strengthening the state’s environmental policy and hence SEMA institutionally,
giving visibility to the institution as the driver of public policy for environmental management and
organization; and (iv) the project helped to institutionalize “projects” in SEMA. Institutional
restructuring in early 2015 (as a result of the 2014 elections and the project experience) created a
Corporate Projects Unit specifically for project planning and execution.

3.5.7 BANPARÁ: While not technically a project implementing agency, BANPARÁ’s role was
important as discussed earlier. The institution was unsuitable for its project role and its technical
and fiduciary capacity was not rigorously assessed at appraisal nor its performance adequately
scrutinized during supervision. It did not receive training from the project, and its
development/improvement as a result of the project is not known. In retrospect, BANPARÁ was
indeed a financial intermediary and it is partially the Bank’s responsibility for not being sufficiently
decisive/clear at appraisal regarding its role.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.8 Targeting: Project targeting is briefly outlined in the Operational Manual but was not
applied systematically. There was significant variation in the types of beneficiaries including some
whose participation in and need for the project are questionable. The project lacked a systematic
communications plan applied in the field. Existence of the project was spread mostly by word of
mouth or depended on contacts/relationships with local government and other entities – access to
information tended to be largely asymmetric and random. The project needed well-designed
messages disseminated on project objectives, and conditions/eligibility criteria, with NGPR
oversight to maintain consistent standards. The project lacked an orderly process of priority-setting
on data-based, socio-economic grounds.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 The primary results of the beneficiary survey for the baseline and impact evaluation
(Datametrica, 2015) are summarized in the Data Sheet, Section 3.2 and Annex 5. Further, although
NGPR staff intended ex-post to conduct workshops to gauge beneficiary opinions of their
experiences, the insecure staffing/other situation at NGPR and pressure to conclude all pending
issues prior to end-April 2015 (grace period) with a skeleton staff, precluded such efforts.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

                                                  23
Rating: Significant
4.1.1 The overall risk to development outcome is significant reflecting the uncertain
sustainability of Component A productive investments, while accounting for the strong prospects
for sustaining Subcomponent B1 and B2 achievements.

4.1.2 Productive investments: First, field analysis (Puig, 2015) showed that most PIPs are still
consolidating their operations/business model either in regard to production, business management
or product distribution and marketing. The outlook for post-project support is uncertain in some
cases, compounded by lack of experience in the activity financed. Some associations could find
themselves in an untenable financial and operational situation. Second, cash flow/working capital
is a concern for many associations even those with adequate skills, raw materials and substantial
potential. The PAD called for the NGPR to facilitate associations’ access to sources of short -term
capital but this never evolved. Third, all PIPs contemplating production and processing of products
– fruit pulp, poultry, manioc flour, honey, chickens/eggs, fish and vegetables – for the school food
program, envisage selling their product through CONAB which requires ADEPARÁ certification
and at EOP, a majority had applied but many were still waiting. The Bank urged continued support
for concluded PIPs to ensure their sustainability and avoid losses. See Annex 2 for details. NGPR
prepared a sustainability plan and informed the ICR mission that resources had been allocated in
the 2015 budget to support its implementation. See also important factors affecting sustainability
of PIPs in case studies (Bayle 2015) conducted immediately before ICR submission (Annex 5B).

4.1.3 Environmental management: Concrete evidence that Component B1 achievements have
already improved/strengthened public policy and environmental management in key areas lends
credence to a risk rating of moderate for B1. SEMA also agreed with the Bank team that it would
continue to monitor and document the consolidation/institutionalization of these results throughout
2015 to ensure their sustainability. The likelihood that these gains would be rolled back is
considered low, they have broad acceptance in the public and private sectors and their enforcement
is already being handled in a relatively organized, institutionalized manner with adequate funding.
As noted earlier, SEMA staff have a strong corporate commitment to their sector and this counts.

4.1.4 Land administration: Land titles granted either directly or indirectly by the project have
legal certainty and can be sustained if challenged, having been processed under the more organized
and rigorous varredura methodology developed by the project. They in turn, confer greater security
of land tenure and sustainability of the beneficiary families/farm enterprises, linking directly to the
PDO. Conflict resolution instruments are also likely to be sustained having been institutionalized
and garnering a reputation for success among people/groups who may normally lack organized
avenues for addressing land conflicts.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
5.1.1 Bank processes could not guarantee quality at entry which was compromised by a complex
design which tried to do too much in its first stage in a State which had not worked with the Bank,
and by weaknesses in the analyses leading to targets which would have challenged even
experienced institutions in a more conducive setting. The preparation team was led by a specialist
with extensive experience in the Amazon Region but not in agricultural/rural sector activities which
comprised two thirds of the project. The Bank team saw the project as a relatively simple and
straightforward endeavor, yet it took almost four years to prepare at significant cost. The failure to

                                                  24
adequately analyze BANPARÁ and desire to avoid the Bank’s financial intermediation rules,
created ambiguity and had negative consequences. Important and relevant lessons/models of
previous Bank operations/programs in Brazil were not internalized, which further exacerbated
dysfunction under Component A. The project lacked the operational framework and planning,
proper sequencing and organizational rigor essential for a multi-sector operation.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.2 This rating reflects a negative assessment of the initial years balanced by the intense effort
from 2012 to create the conditions for the project’s revival. The main issues of supervision in the
earlier years are already discussed in 2.2.1 and are summarized briefly here: regular but short and
inadequately-staffed missions and a supervision strategy/approach which did not address the
project’s deteriorating situation and stressful operating environment or reflect it in reporting and
ratings. The team should have sought management support much earlier to re-calibrate the working
relationship with the Borrower. Lack of a timely, diagnostic MTR and early restructuring prevented
the project from achieving more sustainable results at greater scale. Economic/financial analysis
and case studies suggest the opportunity lost by this delay. The project needed more frequent and
aggressive supervision by a team of appropriate specialists, and intensive, repeated training to
counter the effects of institutional staff rotation and to reinforce the project’s goals, messages and
standards at all levels. The project turned the corner in 2012, gaining traction from the improved
partnership between the Bank team and the NGPR, stronger Bank supervision, an MTR which
drilled into the project’s core issues, a well-designed restructuring in tune with the State’s adjusted
priorities, close follow-up, and prompt and appropriate management of complaints of fraud and
corruption. Management’s role in the project’s recovery was important : directly supporting the
TTL in explaining to the Governor the range of issues the project was facing which resulted in his
prompt and decisive actions; supporting the restructuring; and, ensuring that allegations of
malfeasance were conveyed immediately to the INT. Supervision of fiduciary aspects was thorough
but should have been much tougher. Safeguards supervision of environmental aspects by an
experienced FAO specialist was excellent but social safeguards supervision was neglected until
2012 when a Bank specialist joined the team, defined the main issues and ensured their resolution.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
5.1.4 This rating balances an unsatisfactory design and inadequate supervision resulting from
factors both within and outside the Bank team’s control, against the improved relevance of design
and implementation following Restructuring and a major improvement in the overall approach to
and rigor of project supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.2.1 The State Government which supported project preparation was clearly committed to the
operation but lacked the experience to gauge or influence its complexity. The Government which
took over in 2007 prior to effectiveness, for party political and other reasons, was insufficiently
supportive, viewing the project as an outmoded instrument of its predecessors and thus not a
priority. This attitude, reflecting in part the immensely complex governance issues facing the State
of Para in the period, suppressed performance and created a climate of lax oversight at the central,
regional and local levels. Marked improvement accompanied the return to power in 2011 of the
Government which had prepared the project. It was the rapid and effective response of the State

                                                  25
Governor to the Bank’s explanation of project issues and what it would take to rectify them and put
the project on a better footing overall, which paved the way for the Restructuring and improved the
level of achievement.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
5.2.2 Agencies are rated separately below based on their performance and characteristics which
are discussed in more detail in Section 3.5. In summary: (i) NGPR’s performance was
unsatisfactory until 2012 due to a combination of factors including turnover in NGPR leadership
and technical staff, lack of capacity and commitment and weak governance. However, inadequately
rigorous supervision by the Bank contributed to the intractable problems compounding over time.
With a new team installed in 2012, and much firmer oversight from the Bank, NGPR’s performance
improved significantly, but was marred by the revelations of corrupt practices even though they
had occurred under the previous government; (ii) SEMA’s performance was superior over time and
its activities the most successful. The institution was always committed to its terms of reference
and despite initial difficulties, its project team settled down and in the final years benefited from
exceptional leadership and the high degree of commitment and technical capacity of its relatively
young team; (iii) ITERPA’s performance was affected by its small size and massive territorial
responsibilities, internal bureaucracy, and the difficulties inherent in the type of work it does in a
state where land issues have high visibility. Despite this, ITERPA was able to achieve and even
exceed its restructured targets for a satisfactory rating by EOP.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
5.2.3 The ICR paints a fairly negative picture of the project experience, at least to 2012 but there
was de facto, a “structural break” in the project’s trajectory even though in the case of Component
A, the salvage efforts were not 100 percent successful and management problems persisted. The
Borrower played an important role in facilitating this effort from 2012 onwards, including its
responsiveness to Bank demands for improvement. The overall rating of Unsatisfactory however,
takes into account the Unsatisfactory rating for overall project outcome.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1    The project generated multiple lessons, many of which are by now well-understood Bank-
wide. The ICR selects lessons which are both fundamental to this project and of wider relevance.

Project preparation/design:

Multi-sector operations: Operations involving a multi-sector approach with different institutions,
components, and areas of concentration need strong analytical justification and should proceed only
in cases of more experienced borrowers with proven implementation capacity. Their budget needs
are also higher with greater requirement for outside specialists and more frequent supervision.
Ground-breaking operations with new borrowers need to be kept simple, use piloting and
evaluation for future scale-up, and receive close supervision so that the learning opportunity is
optimized and the client is capable of entering a follow-on phase with confidence. Such projects
should consider a technical cooperation agency embedded in the PMU for the project duration.

Analysis and design of productive projects: More work is needed during project preparation to
analyze and understand promising productive chains based on regional/local comparative
advantage. While many of the 41 completed PIPs have varying levels of commercial ties, few are
embedded in a value chain as commonly understood. The PAD called for such links to be defined

                                                 26
as part of SP preparation and approval but there was no methodology, plan or professional support
to ensure this. Such analysis needs geographic focus and assessments of infrastructure, logistics
and the availability of specialized TA. Specific professional skills are needed to facilitate and
mentor producers’ relationships with potential commercial partners through face-to-face
encounters to determine market needs and potential. The goal is for beneficiaries to make the
transition – culturally and operationally – from “informal farmer” to “commercial producer”.

Geography and logistics: Projects in geographically and logistically challenging areas can
encounter multiple constraints. Such projects need to define priority areas and concentrations of
potential beneficiaries which fit the project’s eligibility criteria and vision. A strategy/plan is
needed for managing remoteness and access issues to the extent that they affect project oversight
and governance, technical assistance supply and quality, procurement and FM, efficient
communications, and the achievement of project objectives. More attention was needed to the
actual infrastructure available to support production and marketing. Such projects need reliable,
well trained regional “agents” supporting project execution at a decentralized level – which may
involve formal partnerships - and systematic performance reviews of such arrangements to prevent
malfeasance due to distance and/or lax oversight.

Appropriate indicators: The PDO income indicator was not only too ambitious for state
conditions but inappropriate. The indicator for such pilots might have been “replicability” and/or
“sustainability” but not a defined income goal which was premature. Phase I should have designed
productive investments as pilots intended to draw operational and technical lessons and build
successful models for replication. Specific income goals should have been deferred to Phase II.
The pilots could have incorporated TA, marketing, institutional and financial elements to enable
evaluation to judge the efficiency/efficacy of a package of investments to support under Phase II.

Organization for production and marketing: This needs a strategy/plan for continuous training
in the basics of running a business as an organization. Groups need to move forward from being
“farmers” to a more advanced professionalized identity as “business operators” in the collective
sense. Further, experience shows there is a need to federate common interest groups into vertically
integrated organizations to achieve scale for value addition. This pre-supposes good targeting
which can select groups with the skill-set and drive needed to thrive productively and commercially
(while avoiding elite capture). It is unrealistic to define the target population for a project seeking
more sophisticated commercial goals, principally in poverty terms.

Working capital for small producers: For productive investments designed to take small farmers
beyond the informal and local levels, cash flow analysis and instruments are critical. The original
concept of a revolving fund using reimbursed investment resources (or alternatively, include
working capital in the package of financing as a separate facility/mechanism) was sound and could
have positioned many PIPs more securely. Even the best-designed subproject remains of doubtful
sustainability if its proprietors lack the capital to launch operations, pay workers and finance
inputs/raw materials. Well-designed and managed revolving funds need to establish good practices
for the first repayment cycle before (public) resources are re-lent to members, but the longer-term
goal should be an association’s independent O&M of the facility.

Project implementation:

Electoral/institutional turnover and non-performing projects: Political change and shifting
priorities are an inevitable part of most Bank projects given their duration, and can have serious
negative effects. Teams need to anticipate the implications of potential change with an aggressive,
astute mitigation strategy, consistently applied. Project objectives and methodology need

                                                  27
systematic reiteration. New relationships need cultivation stressing the Bank’s knowledge and the
client’s legal commitment/obligation to execute the project based on Bank norms . More intensive
supervision support and specific forms of training may be needed to ensure momentum is
maintained or increased. Restructuring may be needed and this decision should be made early and
collaboratively based on strong, supporting analysis.

Bank supervision: Supervision missions – especially of difficult, multi-sector operations - need a
cohort of appropriate specialists presenting a strong, cohesive Bank identity to the client.
Fragmented efforts with specialists visiting individually, short missions and the standard six-
monthly schedule proved insufficient to galvanize a complex, unwieldy and delayed operation with
multiple technical and operational issues. Further, unrealistic ratings of project performance serve
no useful purpose to the Bank or Borrower. An inexperienced Borrower receiving S ratings for a
troubled project has no benchmark to promote better performance. Unrealistic ratings merely delay
the analytical “reckoning” which can energize a failing project and promote its recovery in time to
achieve measurable results.

Post-completion operation and sustainability: While ideally, the Bank expects that a Borrower
will sustain its commitment to a project, including through budget support well beyond closing and
continuation of the PMU team in some form, this is often not the case. Consultancies expire,
implementing units disappear or are absorbed into their parent agency, and the intensive attention
received from the project/Bank ends along with the financial incentive. Mechanisms are needed,
backed by the Bank and with legal weight, to mandate continued support for certain elements of
the project – most typically productive activities with income-generation potential - for a minimum
of one year to strengthen sustainability. Plans for the future operation of a project need a formalized
commitment and monitorable plan for financial and operational consolidation.

Monitoring and evaluation: It is essential that: (i) a trained M&E unit be established in Year 1
with a clear operational plan. Progress should be monitored during supervision and reported in the
ISR. The Bank has a responsibility as a knowledge institution to monitor this as it would other
project performance; (ii) beneficiary associations be trained to establish and maintain/update
archives on the production, costs and revenues associated with their investments to avoid the
inconsistencies and gaps which impede a thorough analysis of subproject profitability, and the
measurement of important indicators; and (iii) the methodology for verifying indicator achievement
be part of project design and spelled out in the Operational Manual, as well as guidelines on how
its achievement should be supervised.

     Beneficiary contribution as per PAD was 10% of the cost of a productive subproject; no estimate was
made at appraisal. The requirement for full repayment of the cost of productive subprojects under the PIP
Agreements with BANPARA (which would have markedly increased “beneficiary contribution”) was
cancelled in 2014. NGPR did not attempt to quantify beneficiary contributions based on an accurate
assessment of the regional, daily/hourly cost of their labor, maintain registers on time contributed, or estimate
the actual costs of materials contributed. Efforts to have the NGPR analyze these numbers were unsuccessful.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1     The following provides (i) key elements of changes to individual components as a result
of the Restructuring; and (ii) data and background context for project outputs, by component. Each
component/sub-component is rated, based on overall outputs compared to appraisal and taking into
account as mitigation whether they met their restructured targets adequately.

      A. Changes to components’ technical approach resulting from Restructuring:

2.2     Component A Productive Investments: The MTR refocused the support of the Local
Development Agents on the 49 PIPs considered viable and on the quality of service provided by
the Technical Assistants following an assessment of their performance. EMATER was brought in
to provide additional field support. Additional fiduciary, safeguards and technical staff were
contracted for the NGPR. An economist and agri-business specialist were recruited to strengthen
the economic viability and market access elements of PIP design.

2.3     Sub-Component B1 Environmental Management: Several planned studies designed to
support SEMA’s reorganization/strengthening were conducted by the State using own funds. B1
was therefore realigned with new state priorities and policy developments, including
implementation of the Rural Environmental Cadaster (CAR) in priority municipalities to comply
with the new National Forest Code. New studies were added including on water resources
management to help the state implement national policy, and strengthening community forestry
management focused on community planning and capacity development in strategic public forests.

2.4     Sub-Component B2 Land Administration: The slow pace of cadastral, geo-referencing,
mapping and titling processes meant that the target for regularization and titling had to be reduced.
Further, the costs of these project services proved to be significantly under-estimated when
compared with those incurred by the National Institute for Colonization and Reform (INCRA).
After the project was designed, Brazil had developed an approach based on intermediate land tenure
arrangements (e.g., usage rights) and less precise geo-referencing, already being used by the ERC;
this approach was seen as necessary if future regularization activities were to achieve scale in a
reasonable time-frame in a large territory such as Pará. Other developments were influential in the
revised approach to land administration: the State’s creation in 2007 of a Commission for the
Mediation of Land Conflicts under an ombudsman; significant progress through 2009 in scanning
ITERPA’s land records and sharing them with INCRA; and, Land Law # 7289 of 2009 and various
decrees to improve ITERPA’s operations/function.

2.5      Component C Policy Development: The State Government requested that activities be re-
aligned with State priorities to reflect then-recent policy developments to address deforestation
prevention and control including: an environmental compliance audit to address deforestation
caused by illegal cattle ranching in the Amazon forest; assessment of progress under the new, first
State Plan for Prevention, Control and Alternatives to Deforestation and preparation of the second
plan for 2013-2015.

2.6      Component D: Management, Monitoring and Communication: Regular communications
activities were to be continued but no specific communications unit would be established.




                                                 32
      B. Results of individual components:

Component A: Productive Investments (total cost US$63.05 m of which Loan US$31.54 m
or 50%)

2.7      This financed loans and matching grants for small and medium-scale investments to
eligible producer associations in areas zoned for consolidation, increasing their market access for
agricultural and non-agricultural goods. Associations, briefed by information campaigns and with
technical assistance, would identify and propose Productive Investment Plans (PIP) consisting of
one or more SPs and contribute a minimum 10% in cash or kind to their total cost. The PIPs could
include three types of SPs: income generation (e.g., agro-processing), environmental rehabilitation
(e.g., community forest management) and complementary infrastructure (e.g., water supply,
electricity and minor roads). Sub-component A1 supported preparation of the PIPs and A2 their
implementation.23

2.8    For complementary infrastructure SPs implemented as part of a PIP, financing was via non-
reimbursable matching grants. However, for income generation SPs, the project was to pilot a
scheme under which beneficiary entities (associations, cooperatives/other) would repay
BANPARÁ and these funds would support the financing of future PIPs. Terms and conditions for
repayment would be detailed in SP contracts signed between BANPARÁ (financial agent for the
component) and the beneficiary entity and outlined in the Operational Manual

2.9       Outputs and context:

         Component A financed the preparation of 61 productive investment plans (PIP), 41 of were
          actually implemented. Of these, 13 were finalized before the end of 2013 and the
          remainder in the final year (and in some cases well into the grace period). Of the finalized
          PIPs, 50% financed more than one activity.
         41 PIPs were concluded, 83.6% of the restructured target of 49 (and 29% of the original
          appraisal target), representing a total investment of R$ 23.17 m, benefiting a total 3,148
          families (78.7% of the restructured target). See table, Appendix 1 for list of all concluded
          PIPs and status/needs as at end-March 2015 (ICR mission).
         In addition to the R$ 20.6 million (USD 9.7 million) invested in the operating PIPs,
          Component A disbursed R$5.8 million (USD 2.7 million) in PIPs that were not finalized
          and R$ 8.3 million (USD 3.9 million) in associated technical assistance, administration and
          operational costs.
         Three Quilombola communities – Menino Jesus (Municipality of Araca), Santa Rita do
          Barreiro (Municipality of Sao Miguel do Guama) and Sao Manoel (Municipality of Moju)
          developed productive activities in combination with forest management systems (SAF –
          Agro-forestry Systems).

2.10     Common issues affecting the PIPs’ operational status and sustainability were found to be
the following (Puig/World Bank, 2015):




23
  There were four main criteria for a PIP (at appraisal): Strategic (national and state policies); Scenarios and regional
aptitudes (relationship to the ZEE); local socio-economic situation and financial viability; and relevant environmental
factors.


                                                          33
       Lack of consolidation as an economic activity: Most PIPs have had insufficient time to
        launch and consolidate operations either productive or in terms of their management and
        distribution/marketing. In several cases, as at March 2015, facilities were still awaiting
        key equipment and/or training. Similarly, for many of the associations, lack of previous
        experience in the activity financed threatens its sustainability if beneficiaries do not obtain
        further support and/or additional resources to continue and strengthen operations.

       Need for short-term, working capital: The need to obtain short-term working capital to
        finance cash flow is a major constraint with a potentially serious impact on efforts to secure
        a sustainable level of operations – the potential lack of liquidity to maintain operations is
        high.

       Marketing certifications: All PIPs contemplating the transformation/processing of products,
        e.g., fruit pulp/concentrates, poultry, manioc flour, honey, rustic chicken/eggs, farmed fish
        and vegetables for the school food program, in the first instance are likely to sell through
        CONAB. At the same time, it has been envisaged that purchase contracts would be
        established between CONAB and associations/cooperatives with Pará-Rural
        intermediating the negotiation, although this may be doubtful given the status of the NGPR
        in March 2015.

       CONAB: The main constraint affecting contracts between the PIPs and CONAB is the
        need to obtain product certification from ADEPARA in order to supply the school food
        program. As of this ICR, most PIPs have initiated or are in the process of initiating this
        process with ADEPARA but are not yet certified.

       Strategic alliances: The viability of PIPs producing live chickens depends on establishing
        strategic alliances/relationships with slaughter-houses certified for such products so that
        they can market their product in more sophisticated segments of the market.

2.11    Recommendations for the period post-closing: NGPR (or substitute entities) and the
State Government need to focus on and prioritize a set of key actions for PIPs still in an early,
unconsolidated situation, in order to boost their sustainability and in this way prevent the substantial
investments made from being diluted/weakened or disappearing altogether. To facilitate such
intervention and the search for resources, key determining actions for achieving sustainability
should be grouped under three primary themes/pillars common to most PIPs. Such actions should
be possible with State and local resources available in the post-closing period and should include:

       Economic/financial: principally, resolve cash flow needs, contain costs of production, and
        obtain training in accounts/accounting/book-keeping, transparency, and good financial
        governance. These can be fostered via technical assistance/training from SEBRAE, and
        linking beneficiary associations/entities with formal credit markets (e.g., BASA), possibly
        PRONAF (National Program for Support to Family Agriculture);

       Operations management: good manufacturing practices, certification – municipal, state
        and federal – with help from the Brazilian Organization of Cooperatives (OCB) and
        EMATER intermediated by the NGPR;

       Associative and institutional: this involves boosting the level of beneficiary commitment
        to the enterprise, appropriate organizational structure, coordination and inter-institutional
        agreements – with help from OCB and SAGRI, intermediated by the NGPR.

                                                  34
2.12     Informal case studies during implementation designed to provide an overview of issues
affecting the project and the then-current status of PIP investments (and PIP beneficiaries) showed
that a majority of the associations had at the outset, only scant knowledge and/or experience in
associative production. Most were established relatively recently and were still in the process of
constitution or consolidation, or only had experience in defending their interests with public
agencies/sector. With some exceptions, where it is clear that there is high potential for successful
associative activities given a promising early track record of entrepreneurial skills and
resourcefulness, most have only a vague/embryonic idea of organized business/commercial activity.
Most members of beneficiary associations are farmers living in isolated areas with distance and
logistical challenges – commonly living distant even from their fellow association members -
difficulty reaching municipal centers due to limited transportation options in some cases, or the
availability of only river routes/transport and/or impassable roads in the rainy season. Problems
tended to mount up and fester due to poor communication channels to the NGPR in Belem. The
number of ADLs trained and deployed was never adequate, reaching a peak of 13 prior to
Restructuring in expectation of a larger number of PIPs but dropping back to just three afterwards
due to the low actual number of PIPs financed (41). To supplement field support, the project relied
on EMATER under a formal collaboration agreement with the NGPR. While it was unclear what
would happen post-project, field evidence suggests that the more enterprising associations have
independently maintained a relationship with the EMATER office in their region – EMATER
offices are numerous and spatially well-distributed.

2.13     Many investment subprojects were prepared by consultant technicians without consultation
with the beneficiary associations which had no input into the type of investment or its business
justification/rationale and cost. In the opinion of the NGPR technicians assisting the ICR mission,
about 90% of the 41 PIPs financed activities with which the association had little/no prior
experience. This runs directly counter to lessons learned from Bank project investments in small-
scale, market-oriented productive ventures which consistently show that prior experience in the
activity is crucial for success. Associations’ inexperience led to difficulties in their relationships
with the NGPR, BANPARÁ and TA providers and to multiple problems in the design, engineering
and contracting of their subprojects, major delays, misunderstandings and in a significant number
of cases, paralysis and/or failure of the venture. There was insufficient technical and operational
oversight of the PIPs by the NGPR - due to capacity issues, insufficient technical staff, logistics
and distance, and lack of a guiding operational plan until 2012. There was also a lack of specific
forms of guidance from the Bank supervision team to bring this situation under control and instil a
more technical, systematic approach to the PIPs. Procurement problems were especially common
as associations struggled to understand and manage a participatory methodology for the purchase
of goods and services and to present acceptable, timely statements of expenditures (SOE).

Component B: Territorial Development (total cost US$27.5 m of which Loan US$21.61 m or
79%)

2.14   This financed the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity
conservation, and improved land administration. The longer-term goal (through a staged, APL
approach) was to help improve the management and administration of land in Pará to be
economically sound as well as socially and environmentally sustainable.

2.15   Sub-component B1: Environmental Management financed the legal analysis and
development of regulatory frameworks for Ecological-Economic Zoning (ZEE) and for Land
Management. It would also develop proposals for economic and other instruments for developing
and implementing the state’s Macro-zoning Plan based on the law enacted in May 2006 (State Law

                                                 35
6.745 IMR), designed to close the open frontier and assigning specific land use to major blocks of
territory.

2.16    This subcomponent performed very well with most activities 100% achieved by closing.

Outputs and context:

       Implementation of Rural Environmental Surveys (CAR) in priority municipalities
        exceeded the targeted 3,000, achieving 4,686 CARs in quilombola communities, land
        reform settlements and properties of up to four modulos fiscais, including 72% of the
        surveyable area of the Municipality of Tailândia and a major part of the Municipality of
        Mojú. This activity assisted Mojú to achieve the 80% of its area surveyed/registered for
        CAR, required by the Federal Government to lift the environmental embargo on this
        municipality.

       Management of the meat value chain was improved including improved environmental
        controls and traceability of meat by cold storage facilities, slaughter houses and leather
        processors, as well as guidance to cattle producers on how to achieve formal environmental
        regularization.

       Finalization of the ZEE (Economic/Ecological Zoning) for Calha Norte and the Zona Leste
        (covering 65% of the state geographic territory)

2.17    Sub-component B2: Land Administration financed capacity-building for land
administration, land registration focusing on cadastral surveys and land titling of small farmers.
The sub-component covered the cost of social mobilization, surveying, titling (free to small land-
holders, fee basis for larger), and strengthening of the State Land Institute (ITERPA) and the state
land registries (cartorios).

2.18    This sub-component had difficulty advancing throughout the project period but post-
Restructuring and with specific exceptions (land titles issued), ITERPA was able to achieve and in
key cases exceed its revised targets, as follows:

Outputs and context:

Revised legal and administrative structure and capacity:

       Decrees in March 2007 (prior to project effectiveness but linked directly to project
        requirements) and March 2011 organized and regulated the institution, modernizing and
        strengthening its legal basis in terms of consistency with the Federal Constitution and the
        national normative body of environmental and land laws.

       ITERPA’s legal team was strengthened and procedures were established regarding the
        daily working day of ITERPA staff.

       Administrative structure and operational capacity were improved through the acquisition
        of furniture, equipment and vehicles, contracting of specialist consultants - including for
        the production of publications and videos on ITERPA’s role and activities, important for
        its public outreach – and contracting of young professionals to re-energize key institutional



                                                36
        functions (at closing, about 50% of all ITERPA staff were nearing retirement and many
        were no longer able to handle field duties).

       Acquisition of computer and advanced mapping and geo-referencing equipment,
        development of software and databases – designed to improve technical standards and
        approach.

       11 major training seminars were organized by ITERPA for 338 technicians and land
        specialists in subjects including: new land laws; quilombola land regularization;
        outsourcing; environmental licensing; agrarian reform legislation; geo-referencing of the
        Amazon Region; ethnic territories, and land administration documentation.

       A Committee for the Mediation of Land Conflicts was created and institutionalized by
        ITERPA to understand and monitor land conflicts state-wide; establish a direct interlocutor
        role in preventing/mediating conflicts directly with the involved parties and reaching
        conciliation agreements. A strategic database registers complaints and starts a process of
        direct, specialized support.

       A system of public hearings (ouvidoria) was also established and institutionalized by
        ITERPA to support land conflict resolution, representing state residents to receive/evaluate
        land-related complaints, explain rights and find solutions. At EOP, ITERPA had mediated
        conflicts in 48 areas of 24 municipalities involving around 8,660 families using both the
        Committee and the ouvidoria processes.

       The State Rural Land Cadaster (CARF-PA), an independent system for identifying and
        spatially defining rural properties in a digital map base similar to the CAR (Rural
        Environmental Cadaster - see above under Sub-component B1) was also established and
        instituted by ITERPA, aggregating a wide range of land data including social and economic.
        ITERPA issues each property with a “matriculation number” identifying them in the
        system.

       However, ITERPA still lacks a structure based on “nuclei” or dedicated units - planning,
        analysis, projects - specific to its key activities; its structure remains over-centralized in
        Belém with inadequate capillarity in the country-side; and, the institution still has too many
        administrative personnel and insufficient technical for the massive level of demand for land
        regularization state-wide, creating a precarious operating situation. ITERPA expects to
        contract a significant number of technicians in the coming months, including to replace the
        large number of staff who anticipate retiring in the next two years.

Titling/regularization:

       The legal basis for land titling was updated: numerous decrees, resolutions, state laws and
        normative instructions were introduced regarding: state land settlements, urban reserves,
        rules for the Rural Environmental Surveys (Cadastro Ambiental Rural - CAR), for
        territorial organization, land occupation and other.

       ITERPA developed through an early pilot in the Municipality of Sáo Joáo da Ponta a
        methodology for land regularization based on five steps (varredura fundiária): preliminary
        information and analysis (precursora); mobilization; surveys (cadastro); geographic
        referencing/GPS; and titling.

                                                 37
      The target established by the Restructuring was 1,243 titles comprising 634 cases waiting
       for internal processing and 609 cases waiting for geo-referencing, all titles intended for
       small-scale rural producers. ITERPA concluded some 2,978 individual property titles using
       the varredura methodology and benefiting from project-financed investments in training,
       surveys, vehicles, advanced mapping/measurement technology and systems, computer
       equipment, and per diems (diarias) for field technicians, i.e. enhancements intended at
       appraisal to support/improve ITERPA’s titling activities and capacity. A portion of these
       titles were financed using Ford foundation resources but ITERPA agreed with the Bank
       that they would be credited against the target because they were in compliance with Bank
       norms “for the prioritization and selection of beneficiaries and Bank Safeguards policies”.

      Thus, total titles accepted by the Bank against the restructured/revised target of 1,243 titles
       was 2,978 or 239.6%, representing the same number of families and some 57,000 ha. It
       could not be determined how many of these titles were granted pre-Restructuring or post,
       but it is clear that ITERPA’s overall capacity and pace of titling accelerated from 2011.

Quilombola and indigenous titling:

      Land regularization in Quilombola territories 2007-2014 totaled 23 Definitive Titles
       benefiting 1,591 families in 23 municipalities, and representing some 36,000 ha.

      The proposal for regularization of the Quilombola of Bacurí and Caeté (municipality of
       Abaetetuba) presented by ITERPA was dropped due to inadequate resources and time
       before closing to implement the agreed Involuntary Resettlement Plan. However, ITERPA
       stated that both communities were included in the 2015 State budget and that pending
       issues of indemnification would be resolved and titles granted this year (2015).

      Ethno-zoning activities at the field level were completed supporting the Tembé Indigenous
       Peoples. A second activity - training of Indigenous Environmental Agents - was halted
       due to the resurgence of regional conflicts with settlers and encroachers related to logging
       and the potential safety risks to the Tembé Peoples from continuing with this activity. It
       was verified (see Bank archive) that prior, free and informed consultations had been
       conducted with the Tembé groups in compliance with OP 4.10.

      204 areas totaling 2.28 m ha in 20 municipalities were aggregated through formal processes
       for discriminating and incorporating land with indistinct ownership/dominion into state
       public territory, separated from privately-owned lands.

      The main processing obstacles during implementation were internal delays in technical and
       legal stage analysis and approval. The Bank recommended in 2014 that ITERPA strengthen
       its professional workforce for processing titles, but this did not occur since public service
       rules, budget and other considerations intervened and the project was in its final stages. In
       addition, agreed training in geo-processing and remote sensing were not approved by the
       ITERPA Directorate and were cancelled due to lack of time remaining.

Component C: Policy Development (total costUS$2.05 m of which Loan 100%)

2.19   This financed studies to monitor income and asset levels to support the development of
poverty reduction plans for the State, and a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) -

                                                38
complementary to the parallel zoning exercise and focused on policies and programs at a broad
level within State growth and development scenarios - focused on key economic sectors such as
tourism, mining and forestry. The SEA exercise would seek a broad policy consensus over several
years. The component would help develop policies and a legal framework for implementing the
Zoning Plan in Phase II. The 2013 Restructuring revised the deliverables expected from this
component with the following final results:
     Poverty study: “Identificacao e Mapeamento da Pobreza Rural no Estado do Pará”
        (Sobrinho, 2015)
     Plano de Prevenção, Controle e Alternativas ao Desmatamento no Estado do Pará
        (PPCAD)24, (SEMA, 2014)
     Environmental Audit of the Meat Value Chain, Phases I and 2 (NGPR, 2014)
     Audit of the Fruit Value Chain (NGPR, 2014)

The SEA was not conducted since it was believed to exceed the capacity of the project, and was
cancelled by the 2013 Restructuring.

Component D: Project Management (total cost US$7.25 m of which Loan US$4.80 m or 65%)
financed three sub-components.

2.20     Sub-component D1: Coordination financed a Project Management Unit (NGPR) within
the State Secretariat of Production to coordinate project execution, covering: SP selection,
feasibility studies, technical assistance, environmental screening, procurement, financial
management, and monitoring and evaluation. Rated: Unsatisfactory

Outputs and context: NGPR’s level of output over the seven year period was modest compared
to appraisal expectations and while most progress on outputs under Component A (see earler)
occurred after the Restructuring even then, key targets were not met. The history is described in the
Main Text. Various activities remained pending at closing in December 31, 2014:

          Consolidation of project results (basic M&E was not established until 2013) by the NGPR,
           whose status and sustainability were unclear at that time given its transfer to another agency
           with new Coordinator just after closing;
          Some residual activities in process of completion by SEMA and ITERPA (the latter
           undertaking to continue to complete titles agreed with the Bank in 2013;
          Final financial audit due end-June 2015;
          Preparation of the Borrower Completion Report (of which an incomplete draft was
           received in May 2015);
          NGPR undertook to prepare an analysis of paralyzed PIPs to clarify the overall status of
           each one inter alia, to see which might be salvageable with specific forms of assistance. As
           of ICR finalization, this had not been done.

2.21 Sub-component D2: Communications was to finance a communications unit to both “sell”
the project to the public and to stimulate full participation in it.

Outputs: The planned communications unit was not established and information about project
objectives and means of access was passed largely via word of mouth. A communications strategy


24
     “Plan for the Prevention, Control and Alternatives to Deforestation in the State of Pará”.


                                                        39
was prepared in 2009 but there is no evidence of systematic execution. Project dissemination was
negligible, as reflected in the extremely low disbursement of funds allocated to this item. Field
evidence suggests that in most cases, beneficiary associations learned about the project in an ad
hoc manner, or because they happened to know someone in local government or the business
community, or through EMATER technicians who had some knowledge of the project’s existence.
Dissemination improved in the final two years – although it was still not systematic – resulting in
a level of demand exceeding what the project could execute in the limited time remaining.

2.22     Sub-component D3: Project Monitoring was to finance monitoring and learning
activities structured around the project’s performance indicators, reporting from implementing
agencies and associations, and specialized staff in the NGPR to disseminate lessons and identify
opportunities for learning. Rated Unsatisfactory

Outputs:

       Monitoring showed that one of the three PDO results indicators was achieved and 15 of 22
        intermediate outcome indicators (based on the restructured Results Framework).
        Evaluation was still ongoing to determine the level of achievement for PDO Indicator #1:
        “Number of beneficiary families whose real incomes from productive activities are raised
        by at least 30% by eop”. See Annex 5 for basic methodology. The ICR mission
        recommended that the consulting firm contract rapidly the required technical skills
        including an expert in M&E.

       An incomplete, draft Borrower Completion Report (BCR) was sent to the Bank in May
        2015 but still required significant work. Both ITERPA and SEMA delivered brief
        completion reports as inputs but the NGPR draft had yet to incorporate their
        findings/results.

       The NGPR planned to conduct stakeholder workshops to evaluate experiences but these
        had not yet occurred at the time of ICR finalization and given the NGPR’s greatly reduced
        staffing and uncertain status, the likelihood of workshops appeared slim.

       The NGPR did not include specialized project dissemination/learning staff and no
        systematic learning events were conducted.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Financial analysis:


3.1     The investments financed by the Project included: Component A - matching grants to
producer associations (R$3.8 million - 42%), Component B - institutional support and capacity
building for land titling and ecological zoning and land use planning (R$27.7 million - 30%),
Component C - policy development (0.4 million - 0.4%), and Component D - Administration (24.4
million - 27%). As in the PAD, this Annex limits its analysis to the Productive Investments –
Component A – as these make up the largest share of investment and the component producing the
most quantifiable benefits.

3.2      Component A, financed 61 productive investment plans (PIP), 41 of which were finalized.
Of these, only 13 were finalized before the end of 2013. Of the finalized PIPs, 50% financed more
than one activity. Table 1 lists the finalized PIPs, the activities that were financed for each of them
and details the number of months each has been operating. Table 1 shows the PIPs financed by the
project and operational at as at March 31, 2015.

NOTE: In grey: 1st column, the analyzed cases; 2nd column, projects with more than 15 months of
operation; 4th column, PIPs with more than one activity.

3.3      In addition to the R$ 20.6 million (USD 9.7 million) invested in the operating PIPs,
Component A disbursed R$5.8 million (USD 2.7 million) in PIPs that were not finalized and R$
8.3 million (USD 3.9 million) in technical assistance, administration and operational costs.

Methodology

3.4     Each PIP contains a mix of subprojects as programmed in the PAD, but no standard
technical designs (projeto padrão) for the same type of activity were developed as it had been
foreseen at appraisal. In addition, the heterogeneity in the level of maturity of each financed activity
and in the size and characteristics 25 of each investment make it impossible to produce any
meaningful aggregated results for all the PIPs. As such, an ex-post cost-benefit analysis of the
component as a whole is not warranted.

3.5      As in the PAD, this Annex will provide cost-benefit analyses for a number of illustrative
cases so as to provide an estimation of the viability of each activity that was supported by the
project. The illustrative cases were selected to include the seven main activities financed by the
Project (see Figure 1 (below): Total Investment), but are not representative of those activities for
the reasons explained above. Instead they aim at providing a benchmark of financial performance
against which it is possible to make some considerations on the expected performance of the
remaining subprojects with the same activities.

3.6     The illustrative studies comprise models of agroforestry systems, honey processing units,
cassava processing unit, fruit processing unit, ice factory, poultry production, and aquaculture.
These activities are present in 85% of the subprojects and represent around 84% of the total
investment in subprojects. The selection of cases to illustrate each activity was based on data
availability.

Investments per Activity (R$ '000)




25
  For example: agroforestry activities differ largely in the planted, proximity to markets and transport costs;
subprojects investing in honey might or not have invested in processing facilities; honey and fruit processing
facilities and ice factories were in some cases sized to attend exclusively to the production of the association
and in others to serve as aggregation centers for production from other producers; poultry can be raised in
small pens for each household or for poultry farms/other.

3.7       A cost-benefit analysis was undertaken for each of the illustrative cases. As in the PAD,
three scenarios were built for each case, however as the subprojects have not yet achieved their
maturity stage and they face different types of risks and uncertainties, instead of the standard
scenarios adopted in the PAD – expected results, 20% reduction in revenues and 20% increase in
costs – this analysis modeled: (i) the current situation considering current production levels or
projections based on the current operation and organization level; (ii) a minimum scenario, with
the minimum sales levels that need to be attained to achieve a positive NPV, for a 12% discount
rate; (iii) a desired scenario according to the sales targets set by the associations (whenever these
were not deemed realistic they were adjusted to more realistic assumptions given local knowledge,
experience, markets and production potential).

Financial Analysis

3.8     The results of the financial analysis are summarized in the table in Appendix 1. The main
features of each model and scenario are:




                                                                                                               61
Agroforestry (3 of 21 subprojects analyzed) – The three models differed in planted species,
proximity and established ties to the market, and the associations’ experience in fruit production.
A) In one case, the project financed the plantation of individual plots of açaí, cupuaçu and wood
species in an association that despite being close to urban centers had only had experience with
subsistence crops. In the first year of plantation the plant survival rate was around 80%. With
support from local extension services the association managed to replant the totality of the 30 ha
in the subsequent year and is using the plant nursery to prepare plantings to further expand the area
(however, cost and benefits from expansion were not modeled ). The association benefits from
technical support from local institutions and has established links with local institutional markets.
B) Thirty individual 1 hectare rainfed orchards of Açaí, citrus and wood species were installed in
an association with a long tradition of citrus production and sale and with good road connection to
a large urban center in the state. The farmers were inexperienced in Açaí and in the first year only
10% of the plantings survived. In the second year the survival rate was of almost 100% and
production of citrus and Açaí should start within 3 to 4 years. (LP: This is an interesting take on
the idea that assns. should stick to what they know best. If they are smart and organized, new
activities may be successful…) C) A former association of wood loggers is in the p rocess of
changing members’ livelihoods and has invested in the contiguous plantation of 15 ha of Açaí and
wood species. The plants should be transferred from the nursery to the field at the end of the rainy
season and will be irrigated. The land distance is around 6 hours by boat from the town of Porto de
Moz where the association also invested in a pulp processing unit (see below). The success of this
activity will depend on the survival rate of the orchard once it is planted and on the establishment
of favorable ties with the market.

Despite the difficulties in dealing with new species at the onset, all analyzed agroforestry systems
seem to have resulted in sustainable enterprises. The largest uncertainty faced by the subprojects in
remote areas is with access to market. However, in general the species seemed to have been chosen
well according to market demand as there is a clear shortage of supply of Açaí and Cupuaçu in
Brazil. Hence, the current scenario is also the most likely scenario and agroforestry systems are
expected to yield positive results. A minimum scenario would imply revenues would decrease by
between 21 and 40%, depending on the case. This does not seem likely to happen, given the already
conservative estimates for the current situation. In a best case scenario, where potential yields are
achieved, mature enterprises produce high returns on labour per household. This might explain why
some associations are already investing in expansion. A major uncertainty common to the 20
financed cases is the production sales price as it will depend on the links to markets each association
manages to establish and its capacity to organize and transport the production.

Honey Production and Processing (2 of 5 subprojects analyzed) – D) The 20 members of the
association have been producing honey since 2008. The project invested in a small honey
processing unit which incentivized the association’s investment in bee hives, increasing their
number from 80 to 590. The association has 240 populated hives, but is not yet processing the
honey in the new facilities as they are not connected to the electrical grid. The minimum scenario
requires that the processing unit operates with the honey from 290 hives (30 liters per hive). The
expected scenario is one where 70% of the 590 hives are populated each producing an average of
30 liters of honey per year. E) The project invested in 1,570 hives and in the construction of a large-
scale honey processing unit, aiming at aggregating production from different associations. The

                                                  62
association had 400 hives in production before the project. A minimum scenario would imply
processing and selling the honey from around 1,200 hives in 2016. Currently the association is
selling to institutional markets, but, once it reaches their sales ceiling, it will have to search for
alternative markets (it was assumed the price per kg would be 20% lower in private markets). The
expected scenario is that in 2018 the unit will process an amount of honey corresponding to 90%
of the owned hives (which is feasible considering that it already has an agreement to process honey
from another association benefited by the Project in the form of bee hives only). This would result
in an IRR of 29%.

The success of the honey processing units will depend on management and internal organization
capacity, namely with regards to finding rewarding market channels, as there is potential to produce
enough raw material as well as a large intra- and inter-state and international market for honey with
sanitary certification.

Cassava Processing (1 of 8 subprojects analyzed) – F) In the analyzed case, before the project, the
association produced flour in very rudimentary conditions and did not have the capacity to process
the production of more than 7 ha of cassava plantation. The project invested in three mechanized
cassava processing units with an estimated real capacity of 400 kg of cassava flour per day.
Currently, the association’s 14 families plant 22 ha of cassava yielding an estimated production of
77 tons of flour per year. The main benefits are the labor savings obtained from the mechanization
of the flour processing and the increase in production. Considering the family labor savings (valued
at the minimum wage cost) obtained by changing from a situation without project to the situation
with project, the current situation attains a positive NPV. However, this current situation is not
capable of remunerating the total costs and the net margin with project is negative. This is mostly
due to the fact that the processing units work much below their capacity – it is estimated that each
works an average of 65 days per year. A minimum scenario in which all costs would be remunerated
in the situation with project would require aggregating the production of neighboring communities
(buying cassava to process or charge for the service) and processing the cassava from a total planted
area of 55 ha. It is unlikely that the association will be able to source more than this minimum
amount of cassava, hence a best case scenario is one in which the same quantity of cassava is
processed into a mix of products with higher added value. Although the association received
training in products improvement, this scenario is rather unlikely as, when asked, no interest in this
option was demonstrated by the association.

Investments in the cassava value chain largely improve previously dire working conditions in
cassava flour production and have a high social value. LP: But with “labor savings” post-project,
aren’t you decreasing job availability regardless of the poor conditions? However, the financial
sustainability of such units and how they will be able to remunerate labor above minimum wage
level depends on labor and land availability to increase planted areas. Marketing of large quantities
can also be a constraint when sanitary certification is not awarded. The range of investment size in
the cassava value chain is narrower than for other value chains, and the infrastructure investment
described here ought to be fairly representative. This means that for equal management and
organization capacity conditions, the financed units’ financial sustainability will mostly depend on
raw material availability and establishment of market contracts. Of the eight financed activities,
four have been awarded sanitary certification and by the time this analysis was undertaken they

                                                 63
were negotiating contracts with institutional markets. The remaining four were selling small
quantities in local markets. Three associations have fewer than 40 associates, which means that
they might need to enter into partnership with other associations to source enough raw material.

Fruit Processing (1 of 6 subprojects analyzed) – G) A small frozen fruit pulp production unit was
constructed and equipped in a small, remote town where the municipality and local supermarkets
are the only identified market. The unit had just been finished and was having problems sourcing
raw material in the off season, not being able to supply to the existing institutional market. The
major uncertainties for the upcoming six months of harvest season are whether the association will
be able to locally source enough good quality raw material at a favorable price and whether it will
gather the necessary working capital to the purchase inputs. On the output side, the main bottleneck
is the refrigerator capacity of 600 liters, which means that it will probably not be able to satisfy all
the demand for 3,000 liters of pulp per week from the municipality, even in the presence of enough
raw material. The current situation scenario is one in which little raw material is sourced and the
unit does not break even. The minimum scenarios imply either i) the sale of 4,000 liters per month
for 6 months at the price offered by the municipality or ii) maintaining the current levels of
production for four years and increasing it to an average of 1,100 liters per month all year round
from year 4 onwards, which is a possible scenario once the association’s own irrigated orchard
starts producing. How the activity develops will depend on how the association deals with the
existing bottlenecks and this is rather unpredictable. Motivation and organization are high and the
association counts on the support of local institutions.

Investments in fruit processing units vary considerably in size and location, thus it is not possible
to estimate minimum or likely levels of production for all financed units with the available
information. One of the 6 units had not been finished at the time of this evaluation whereas, from
the remaining 5, 3 are still waiting to be awarded sanitary certification. All except one which has
sales contracts with a multinational company, face the bottlenecks and uncertainties described
above.

 Ice Factory (1 of 3 subprojects analyzed) – H) None of the subprojects which invested in ice
production had commenced operations at the time of this evaluation. The financial model was
constructed for a facility financed by the Project with a production capacity of 30 tons per day
based on the unit costs of a similar factory with capacity to produce 40 tons of ice per day. The
factory stops operating during the 3 month closing/idle period. In a minimum scenario, in which
the costs structure of the factory financed by the project is similar to those of the existing factory,
production would have to reach the 16 ton/day (55% of maximum capacity) to break even.
However, in a scenario with this same level of operation, but with more flexible labor arrangements
(i.e. temporary instead of permanent staff paid during the three months of closure and average labor
costs of R$2,000/month instead of R$3600/month), the factory can yield a 20% IRR.

Of the three projects that were financed, two were small scale factories (6 tons per day) serving
fishing communities and a third one a larger facility (30 tons per day) aiming at selling its ice more
widely. There seems to be enough demand for ice for fishing boats in the Amazon region to keep
the factories operating above break-even. Financial sustainability of the ice factories will thus

depend on the organization level of each association and how the payment for the ice is arranged
amongst the associates.

Semi-intensive poultry (1 of 10 subprojects analyzed) – I) The studied case consisted of 23 families
benefited with an investment in individual pens for 200 chickens and inputs for a first cycle of
production. Each pen raised 100 chickens in the first cycle, with sales of those chickens building
up the necessary working capital to buy the inputs for the following cycle. In the three first cycles
chicken production was sold to institutional markets. At the onset of the fourth cycle a regulation
change in Brazil made sanitary certification compulsory in all formal sales of livestock. At the time
of this analysis the producers were selling the chicken from the fourth cycle informally in local
markets with high transaction costs and being forced to keep feeding the chickens beyond the 75th
day until they were able to sell the whole stock. In the current scenario, the enterprise is no longer
viable. A minimum scenario assumes that in 9 months’ time there will be an agreement with a
certified slaughterhouse and production will resume at an average of 155 chickens per producer.
The envisioned scenario by the producers is that, once they close an agreement with a slaughter
house they will sell 175 chickens per producer per cycle to institutional markets. Under this
scenario the enterprise would attain an IRR of 21%. LP: Do they intend to get the sanitary
certification?

Poultry enterprises supported by the Project differ in size, model (group chicken farms or family
pens), proximity to markets, level of organization and technical assistance. All activities face the
challenge of changing production habits from extensive to semi-extensive poultry farming and will
only be successful with an organization level that permits the generation of the necessary working
capital. Unless the sales are made through a certified slaughterhouse which enables bulk sales to a
few buyers, all 10 enterprises are bound to be inefficient in the use of Project resources.

Cage aquaculture (1 of 3 subprojects analyzed) – J) The analyzed subproject financed 180 fish
cages and 90 boats for 90 families. Production potential is assumed to be 500 kg of fish per cage in
an 8 month period. This fish is to be sold during the three months of closure period. The first cycle
was ending at the time of this analysis and the fish had been sold at the market in the nearby city.
The productivity of the first cycle is estimated to have been 250 kg of fish per cage, but with the
fishers’ accumulated experience productivity is expected to increase to at least 320 kg of fish per
cage from the third cycle onwards, yielding an IRR of 19%. A minimum scenario estimates the
break even at 300kg of fish per cage, whereas a more optimistic, but realistic scenario would be
stabilizing productivity and sales at 350 kg of fish per cage, obtaining an IRR of 34%

The traditional diet of Pará places a large importance on fish, thus the existing closure period
creating a shortage of supply of native species during three months of the year and the project’s bet
on the farming of highly locally appreciated native species create a favorable environment for the
success of fish farming enterprises. This is also an activity that demands limited labor, brings quick
returns to the communities and can be managed either in group or within each household. The
conditions for the sustainability of such enterprises are thus guaranteed.

Economic analysis

3.9     Project economic streams of costs and benefits could not be estimated with accuracy as the
conversion factors from market to economic prices existent in the literature for Brazil are not
necessarily applicable to the specific items of productive subprojects in the Pará Region and are
outdated26. This analysis attempted to estimate indicative economic results by deducting revenue
and added value taxes, social benefits and income taxes of the enterprises’ formal employees from
the costs stream of each activity. The results are shown in Appendix 2.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

     A. Results of Evaluation (Datamétrica 2015)

5.1      Project design envisaged the assessment of socio-economic impacts for investments under
Component A which included: (i) study to measure the socio-economic status of beneficiaries
before the project’s interventions (Baseline). This study was to address aspects related to family
income and household living conditions (housing, assets etc) and permit comparison of these
indicators with families in similar conditions not benefiting from the project (Control Group); and
(ii) an ex-post study to measure these indicators several years beyond the execution of the project,
particularly after the implementation of productive subprojects (within the PIPs), always comparing
the data with the Control Group.

5.2      Monitoring and evaluation of the project were affected by challenges faced during
implementation. The Management Information System (MIS) and field data survey for the
Baseline were only developed and carried out after project Restructuring and extension in June
2013 (one year before planned project closure). The contracted data survey firm encountered
difficulties in the field due to large distances between PIPs, generating methodological flaws in
terms of sample size for both the Treatment Group (TG) and Control Group (CG). A year later,
the second field survey was conducted/repeated before closing. With an interval of just one year
between the Baseline and second survey and knowing that many subprojects would not be fully
operational in 2014, expectations regarding empirical conclusions about the evolution of household
income need to take this context into account. The following conclusions are derived from the final
evaluation study (Datamétrica, 2015).

Methodology:

5.3     The research utilized a random sample of 673 families divided into two groups: (i) 412
families interviewed first; and (ii) 261 additional families selected from the project register of
participating families. This latter group contained a large number of reserve families but
maintaining the same proportion per subproject as the initial group. This was an attempt
to avoid scarcity of interviewees based on certain obstacles which could arise to limit the planned
number initially contemplated. Interviewers were 16 experienced research professionals working
in pairs, and the interview process was pre-tested in the field and adjustments made. Families to be
interviewed were mobilized by local extension personnel and the ADLs (Local development
Agents). Transport support was provided by the NGPR.

5.4      While most interviewees were receptive, reaching them and arranging meetings was
difficult – given distance, dispersion of families, physical access problems, logistics and resistance
to participating - with the research team having to dip into the reserve group quite frequently. The
final result was application of 879 questionnaires, 131% of intended; 86% were the same families
interviewed during the first round in 2013, i.e. 356 interviewees of the 412 contemplated. The
following shows questionnaires applied at each stage.

Conclusions from Evaluation Study:

        Information was collected on family composition, education, housing and living conditions,
         and access to water supply and electricity.
        Also studied was the landholding/land access situation of families – some 57% were land
         owners and the remainder renters, settlers and sharecroppers/other.
        Landholdings were small: 80% have less than 2 ha/family while 18% have over 10
         ha/family.
        Families produce a wide range of crops but the dominant ones are açaí (19%), manioc
         (16%), and corn (8%).
        Data shows a relatively high percentage destined for market, with the exception of beans.

        About 41% have livestock. The average herd comprises 352 chickens, 14 ducks, 13 pigs,
         76 reses, 25 carneiros and 4 turkeys.
        A majority of families (56%) still sell through middlemen and in 16% of cases to small
         stores.
        The percentage of sales to cooperatives or associations is insignificant, consistent with the
         fact that 55% of all sales remain individual even though the project vision was of a more
         organized marketing framework and 53% are sold raw in unprocessed form – only 8% of
         families were selling processed items.
        The number of written sales contracts is insignificant and most agreements occur at point
         of sale (spot).
        Only 10% of all interviewees had received bank credit/financing in the 12 month period
         studied – credit usage is described as “timid” – and most is used for investment.
        Some 38% of families had had access to training (mostly SENAR, Pará Rural and
         EMATER), while 35% of families had received one or several TA visits/events in the
         subject year.
        The general trend however, is for increased access to and usage of TA and training due to
         the strong presence in the countryside of extension services, especially EMATER.
        About 58% of families interviewed were receiving Bolsa Familia transfers, with each
         family receiving on average R$204/month.
        All families had a wide range of complementary sources of income with pensions and paid
         work/labor the most important.

         Some 43% of the TG had income growth exceeding 30% compared to 35 of the CG.
         In general terms, the TG had overall growth of 72.95% compared to the CG’s 67.1%.

    B. CASE STUDIES (Bayle, 2015):

5.5     To complement results from the Datamétrica evaluation study, the Team opted to conduct
non-experimental, complementary case studies to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of
interventions on project beneficiaries. The Team used both quantitative and qualitative data in
multiple PIP investments. Five PIPs were randomly selected from the pool of 21 PIPs with
investments fully-executed at least one year before project closing and with at least one full
production cycle and results. The full case study document is inserted below.

Methodology and organization of the mission:

The mission was organized around data gathering workshops (from June 7-12) conducted with five
groups of beneficiaries, as follows:

Two principal criteria were used to select the PIPs for study:
   1) PIPs already finalized for more than one year and which had completed at least one
       productive cycle and with results.
   2) Location permitting field visits in a relatively short period of time.

A meeting of around 3.5 hours was arranged with each beneficiary group. Information was
collected on the situation before the project support was received, levels of production, marketing
and organization in 2014, to serve as a reference point. Starting from these data it was possible to
estimate/calculate income obtained from Project-financed activities

Most of the quantitative information collected was declaratory. Among the groups visited and
questioned, few had documentary evidence of receipts and expenditures. When they did have such
documentation, it was certain specific documents and without a complete sequence. Accounts
which were consulted were those issued by the PAA and PNAE and in some cases issued for the
purchase of inputs.

Following these meetings in each case, the Investment itself was visited mainly to verify production
capacity and consistency with the verbal information provided by beneficiaries.

At the end of the mission and conclusion of field work, a meeting was held at NGPR headquarters
with Sra. Michelle Abrahão Abdon and Sr. Higo Lacerda, component manager. Sr. Yuri Hoshikawa
participated and coordinated the field visits.

Beneficiaries:

The table below shows the evolution of beneficiary numbers. In June 2015, approximately one-
third of beneficiaries mentioned in the agreements, continued to be involved in the project-financed
activities. In one case only, the original number mentioned in the agreement continued unchanged
(fishing community with 1400 members, replacing members who leave with new members). In the
case of ABOVI, 80% of the original members had left. .

Various causes were mentioned by beneficiaries:
   - Excessive period between proposal preparation and finalization of the investment. This
       provoked the drop-out of people who stopped believing that the project was a reality. The
       longest period was 36 months and the shortest observed was 16 months
   - The PIP preparation process conducted by the technical assistance and rural extension
       entities (ATER) was not very participatory. In most cases, beneficiaries stated that
       important decisions were taken by those entities without consulting/involving beneficiaries.
       This resulted in a low level of identification of beneficiaries with their subproject.
   - Such delays promoted a vicious cycle: as time passed, initial prices quoted became
       outdated, or required revision and updating to match the content of the proposal and re-
       estimation and re-configuration of expenditures for items, without being able to change the
       original value of the PIP.

Besides these factors, it is possible to state others which certainly had an impact on the willingness
of beneficiaries to remain with the subproject:
    - Payment for the preparation of proposals corresponded to a global percentage,
        incentivating the definition of over-dimensioned proposals.
    - Lack of adequate monitoring/oversight of ATER entities by the NGPR/Project meant that
        proposals were not consistent with the realities of beneficiaries.

The decreased number of beneficiaries per PIP has at least two principal consequences:
   - The average cost per family almost doubled from R$ 6,953 as originally envisaged, to
       R$11,507.
   - Increase in the idle capacity of investments, mainly in the case of usage rates for processing
       infrastructure.

Disaggregated data is not available on PIP beneficiaries by gender.
Participation in the five meetings suggests the following: 78 persons participated of which 25 were
women (32%). Of the five associations visited, four had female presidents.

PIP preparation:

A comment frequently heard during the visits was that the PIP proposal preparation process was
highly concentrated in the hands of the ATER entities – the process was inadequately participatory.
Also, there is a questionable relationship between the remuneration to these entities based on the
4% of total PIP value, the size of the proposal and number of beneficiaries per PIP. These facts
could explain in part the reduced number of beneficiaries now compared to when the PIP was
identified/prepared.



                                                 75
Implementation of the PIPs:

In all PIPs visited, the negative impacts of the protracted period between preparation and initiation
of implementation were mentioned. Besides demobilizing a portion of the beneficiaries, the
evolution of prices required adjustments to original costing estimates. This was a discouraging
process which significantly delayed overall project implementation and greatly reduced the time
available to execute the subprojects. During this phase also, the availability of technical assistance
(ATER) entities was very limited and there were many complaints from beneficiaries who had to
resolve various complex problems without assistance of the TA previously ensured under the terms
of their subprojects.

The median usage rate in 2014 was 60%.

Looked at case by case, the following is evident:
- Colônia Z-7: 100% of the productive material received is utilized. Various factors explain this
   full utilization of the investment:
        o The material provided is substituting for very old material/equipment.
        o The new material/equipment is evaluated by the beneficiaries as being of better quality
             which has stimulated its constant usage. Beneficiaries were directly involved in the
             selection and purchase of this material/equipment.


                                                  76
        o   The investments were carried out to strengthen and renovate a pre-existing activity,
            already well-understood by beneficiaries, both from a productive and a marketing point
            of view. There was no innovation involved.
        o   The lack of TA did not have a great impact on the beneficiaries who already knew the
            equipment/material provided and how to use it.
        o   The association is very much involved/engaged in the management and organization
            of beneficiaries.

-   APRAFAMTA: This oil processing unit financed in 2013 was not functioning until today
    (June 2015) due to the lack of electricity adapted to the plant’s needs. It was necessary to
    install tri-phasic line and that was only just finalized while the PIP was shut down.

-   In three PIPs, market access has been/is the primary limiting factor:

        o   In the case of fruit processing activities of APRAFAMTA, the main problem is that
            the infrastructure is inadequate. The processing unit functioned through two seasons
            but had difficulties marketing greater volumes/quantities mainly to the PNAE which
            represents an important market opportunity. Also, without the sanitary inspection seal
            of MAPA, it is impossible to sell through this channel. Because of the impossibility of
            marketing, the association decided to make needed adjustments. The property has
            undergone changes since the start of 2015 and was totally inactive at the time of the
            mission’s visit. The equipment was placed in the homes of several members where
            they intended to keep processing fruits. Only the refrigerated storage room was being
            used. The estimated cost of this renovation was R$ 150,000, when the initial PIP value
            was R$ 231 732.

        o   In the case of poultry production by ABOVI, the investments were made to market live
            birds. It so happens that the formal market (Institutional, with firms, with issuance of
            a fiscal receipt) capable of absorbing much larger quantities of product, requires
            animals slaughtered in units with sanitary conditions which are authorized and
            supervised. The application of this law is becoming more rigorous over time and is
            impeding them from accessing the PAA and PNAE, supermarket chains or food
            companies.

        o   In the case of beekeeping/honey production and support to the AMIGA producers, the
            equipment/materials acquired to extract and decant the honey is of very good quality
            but the processing is carried out in locations without sanitary certification. This
            implies that much of their production is processed under artisanal (craft) conditions.
            Isso impões que uma parte da produção seja processada em condições artesanais. They
            mentioned that 2014 was not a favorable year for good production and population of
            the hives.




                                                77
-   Beneficiaries supported to produce vegetables mentioned that their main technical difficulties
    affecting production are the lack of TA and support for the resolution of these difficulties, part
    of which are attributed to pests and diseases occurring during the rainy season.

In a majority of cases, the problems confronted today could have been identified at the time the
technical proposals were prepared, with the actual proposal and its execution also taking such
matters into consideration.

Information on the calculation of annual income:

-   The income obtained from each activity and each group was calculated based on information
    communicated by beneficiaries about their expenses and receipts obtained during 2014.
-   The values mentioned concerning increases in income refer exclusively to activities financed
    by Pará Rural.
-   Valuation of family labor was estimated based on declarations of beneficiaries. The value of
    the daily labor rate is R$ 39.00. This value was calculated based on the minimum salary
    (R$ 788/160 hours monthly) and considering 8 hours worked daily. According to the location
    and type of work done, beneficiaries told the mission that the daily remuneration varied
    between R$ 30.00 and R$ 40.00.
-   Quantities/amounts self-consumed by households/families were accounted based on receipts
    and market prices. This non-monetary income has an impact on families’ food security.

Results by proponent associations/entities:
Beneficiaries presented broad variations and four main types can be distinguished:
   1- In the case of the Association of Sol da Manha, with very significant income results of
        R$ 11,072/ year/family, or on average more than one minimum salary per month of
        incremental income.

                                                 78
    2- In the case of intermediate results, the Fishermen of Maracanã who achieved an increase
       of R$ 5,517/year, around one-half a minimum salary/month.
    3- The cases of ABOVI and APRAFAMTA which achieved low results.
    4- Finally, the case of AMIGA which obtained very low results with R$ 261/year.

Comments on results achieved by type of PIP:

Type 1: Association of Sol da Manha:
The high level of results can be explained by the following factors:
        o The group organized itself so that investments could be apportioned in each family.
            Production is mainly individual and the group unites for certain tasks, which seems to
            be the best form of organization in this settlement. In various families, the vegetable
            garden and chickens have become the main activity. In the case of vegetable production,
            the families have benefited from technical support of an experienced member of the
            association.
        o   The combination of two types of production, compatible and complementary, each one
            contributing in equivalent/equal form to constitute income.
        o   Very favorable market access and direct to the consumer: located in an area of beaches
            with high demand during the holiday season and national holidays. Since Market
            access is mainly directed towards direct sales to the consumer, they avoid the sanitary
            requirements of selling to institutional markets or to food marketing companies.
Since the activity is recent for these producers, over time they can improve the technical content
and the income generation parameters. For poultry production the challenge is to maintain capacity
to reconstitute working capital, since 71% of the costs of production are absorbed by the purchase
of chicks and feed supplies.

Type 2: Colony of Fishermen Z-7:

The income increase of R$ 5,517 is explained as follows:
       o Beneficiaries, by being fishing professionals, had a good knowledge of how to use their
           new equipment. This allowed them to value-add since their first year of operations.
           The original PIP proposal was well-tailored to their specific needs.
        o   Absence of TA was in this case not a limiting factor.
        o   Channels for marketing and supplying a greater quantity of product already existed.
It is worth mentioning that in this case it was possible to calculate income in the without-Project
situation, since all the beneficiaries already practiced the activity. Average annual income went
from R$ 11,925 in 2013 to R$ 17,442 in 2014, a relative increase of 46%.

They can maintain this level of production with the condition that producers are able to renew their
fishing equipment when necessary.

Type 3: ABOVI and APRAFAMTA:

With an increase in income of between R$ 1,700 and 2,500/year (between R$ 140 and R$ 200 per
month), this modest increase in income is explained by the following factors:
        o In both cases, difficulty in accessing the market is the main factor limiting the
            possibility of expanding the level of production and improving sales prices. This
                                                79
           translates into a low level of capacity utilization of the investments (61 days of
           functionality in the case of the fruit processing unit of APRAFAMTA and 28 % in the
           case of the units of ABOVI).
       o   This marketing difficulty is due to the inadequacy or lack of processing infrastructurese
           within the parameters required. The short-term outlook is not good for the beneficiary
           associations to resolve these issues/impediments.
       o   Also, a part of the equipment received by APRAFAMTA has never functioned due to
           lack of a system of/connection to the tri-phasic electricity grid. The transformer was
           not included in the PIP proposal, so the unit has never functioned.

Typo 4 : AMIGA – Beekeeping/Honey:

In 2014, the impact of honey production on beneficiaries’ income was negligible, at around
R$261.00. Analysis shows the following:
       o 2014 was not a good year climatically for the production of honey.
       o   Since the producers are new at this activity, they managed to maintain only 40% of
           hives in production. They therefore have the intention to increase the number of
           productive hives by emphasizing more technical input to production and hopefully a
           year of better climatic conditions.
       o   Processing the honey remains an issue to be resolved and the producers are dependent
           on other infrastructure to do the primary extraction under regular/normal, sanitary
           conditions.

            Processing

In the case of APRAFAMTA, beneficiaries of the fruit processing unit had in 2014, three sources
of remuneration linked to the fruit processing activities:

                          Source of Income             R$ / 2014         %
                    Re-distribution of the cash
                                                         638             25%
                    results/returns of the Unit

                                                  80
                     Sale of fruit by unit               1, 562         62%
                     Work in the unit (daily)             318           13%

                           Total per family:             2, 518        100%

Seeing the results on income achieved and considering the conditions of production and Market
access, and situation described regarding the use of the investments, it is possible to question what
would be the level of income per Family if all beneficiaries originally part of the association had
remained so. Certainly results would have been much lower per Family and this raises again the
questions surrounding the preparation of the PIP proposals.

Beyond the support given to the fishermen who practice this activity permanently and full-time, in
the other cases the activities supported represent a part-time, opportunistic activity which can be
accommodated within the working agenda of families.

In the case of poultry and vegetable production, the activities occur close to/around homes and are
principally assumed by women. They also mentioned that it is an opportunity to access, ensure and
administer directly a chunk of the family income. It is also in a certain sense a way of strengthening
women’s autonomy.

Manual labor:
All tasks associated with the new activities were assumed by beneficiaries’ available family labor.
For certain more labor-intensive tasks, beneficiaries work in jointly in groups (mutirões – cleaning
the sheds etc).

In the case of the Association of Sol da Manha, the production of vegetables and chickens has
become the primary Family activity.

The impact on family labor mobility is associated with the low rate of utilization of the investments.

Loss of other sources of income:
In four of the five cases visited, the activities supported by Pará Rural were not practiced by the
beneficiaries beforehand. In these cases, the PIPs represented a diversification of production
systems, introducing innovations. Due to the reduced scale of production, these activities have not
come to substitute for others and there has not been a diminution of income due to the introduction
of these innovations. The only losses associated with the introduction of new production was a
reduction in the number of days worked outside the family unit, as a day laborer. These losses have
been accounted for in real costs.

Technical assistance and supervision:

In four of the five groups visited, TA was strongly criticized and complaints were very clear,
showing that this was a fragile aspect of the Project design and strategy. An important part of the
explanation for low results reached in terms of income increases in 2014 is directly related to the

                                                 81
availability/provision of TA, remembering that in four cases the PIP involved new, innovative
practices unfamiliar to the beneficiaries.

It was noted that the associations visited had strong leadership. They were seeking to obtain TA
directly from EMATER, UFPA, EMBRAPA and other sources. This is how TA gaps were being
handled. The proximity to Belém and the NGPR also permitted the associations to directly seek
support for resolving pending problems with the principals responsible for executing the Project.
In this context, one can ask how an association far distant from Belém needing TA support can find
it, especially with more fragile, less connected leadership?

Beneficiaries recognized the performance of the ADLs under the Project, but complained about
their high level of rotation and scant availability day to day to respond to beneficiaries’
demands/needs.

Land issues:

In three of the five PIPs visited, beneficiaries mentioned that the question of their land
regularization had never been finalized despite being informed that Pará Rural would be going to
address/resolve this issue. At the start of project execution, the project measurement of land
coordinates and land data had been collected/conducted and this had generated substantial
expectations. It was noted that this issue is very important for families who feel deceived by never
having received this “benefit” from the Project. The lack of land ownership security represents a
major weakness for families of small farmers and their ability/willingness to invest. There is still
hope among these families that this commitment will be assumed by Pará Rural.

Payment of amounts to be reimbursed:

The level of information among beneficiaries is quite variable: one association had already re-paid
BANPARÁ the first installment, while another was preparing to do this. In the three other cases,
beneficiaries did not appear to have a clear understanding of the reimbursement process and its
conditions, values etc.

This shows that the Project was highly deficient in communicating with associations/beneficiaries
on this important issue. (Team note: The obligation to repay BANPARÁ was cancelled/forgiven
in late 2014 but clearly not well-communicated).

The letters cancelling this requirement remain an urgent issue for some so that beneficiaries can
organize themselves taking this new condition into account. The cases where an association has
already paid need specific attention and procedures for recovering those funds.

Sustainability Plan:

In all PIPs visited, additional support is justified, whether to consolidate and maximize the
investment or to put the investments into full operational status. The degree of need and urgency
varies. Two levels of priority are evident:

                                                82
Priority 1: Cases of PIPs with no possibility of operating/functioning without further
investment support

These cases are a priority because project support was insufficient or carried out in a flawed manner
or not adapted to the needs of the PIP in question. This is typified by the case of APRAFAMTA
which received resources to:
        - Construct a fruit processing unit which does not address sanitary norms. The
             association is today mobilizing to obtain the necessary reforms (budget estimated at
             R$ 150,000 of which they have already secured about R$ 50,000). The unit is totally
             de-activated and important works have been activated.
        - Install an oil processing unit which never functioned due to the lack of electricity
             adapted to the PIP’s needs.
Cases with this profile merit special attention because the beneficiary entities are now in a situation
which is worse than before: They were benefited but are unable to use their investments. For these
cases, the NGPR needs to organize associations to mobilize entities directly responsible (Pará
Electricity Company), enforcement agencies for processing infrastructure (MAPA, ADEPARÁ) to
guarantee that the renovation works and finalization of the infrastructure are done and in good
condition rapidly.

The objective in this case is top put into operation what was originally envisaged and within the
prevailing law. It is worth mentioning that in the case of this processing unit, besides the question
of infrastructure, the legal structure is not valid. The association will be able to issue receipts for
marketing once the unit is functioning. For this it is necessary to anticipate and think with the
beneficiaries what would be the best option to work with. In many cases, it is necessary to create
a cooperative and the beneficiaries need guidance and assistance on this also.

Another type of PIP which would enter this category of priority are those where land regularization
has been initiated but needs to be finished. These cases merit particular attention because this
concept was part of the original Pará Rural design and represents a fundamental element for PIP
viability and sustainability. The NGPR should collaborate with ITERPA on prioritizing and
concluding these processes.

Priority 2: PIPS whose viability could improve without additional investment

In this group, a minimum of additional support would compensate for flaws and the lack of TA.
This is an important threat to the viability and non-functioning of the investments already made
and to a desired increase in the utilization rate.

This would basically mean support from EMATER technicians who would visit the PIPs for
specific purposes on a regular basis. In this way, technical solutions could be found to help groups
which do not yet have a sufficient grasp of the new activities introduced under the investments.

Such support could include: (i) support to fight diseases and pests in vegetable crop; and, (ii)
supervising groups such as ABOVI who cannot increase production due to lack of markets. During
meetings with beneficiaries, the case study team raised the possibility of converting part of the
sheds for the production of eggs, which are not governed by sanitary restrictions and have a strong
market. In order to think about and eventually define how to operationalize this transition, they
need specific technical assistance.



                                                  83
In the case of chicken production, the inability to slaughter in authorized, sanitary conditions is
impeding their sales to the PAA, PNAE, supermarket chains or food companies. In these cases, the
Project could also look at those cases where ADEPARA has conditions for not issuing certification
until permanent solutions are found.

In cases involving marketing difficulties, the Project and partner entities (EMATER, SAGRI, etc.)
could help by establishing commercial alliances with actors who are already established and with
the structure for processing and commercialization. This arrangement could be a possibility to
compensate for the lack of infrastructure to process honey under sanitary conditions for the AMIGA
association.

For this assistance to happen at the field level, it is necessary to have agreements at the directorate
level (EMATER and NGPR), so that local offices can receive guidance to insert support for Pará
Rural beneficiary associations into their planning and operational agendas.

Resources needed:

The staff of NGPR has been greatly reduced since Project closure and the professional profile of
those remaining cannot cover the range of needs noted above.

This team is essentially occupied in administrative aspects especially those associated with
finalization of some PIPs (e.g., Cotejuba ice making plant). That is, the NGPR has extremely
deficient operational capacity to address demand (in numbers and specialist diversity). Two
possibilities: (i) increase the team with professionals of adequate profile; (ii) knowing that this
solution is limited, there needs to be a reactivation and mobilization of other State agencies so that
they can contribute and give direction to these efforts. These agencies include: EMATER,
ADEPARÁ, ITERPA, EMBRAPA, SAGRI, UFPA, COELPA, Secretariat of Environment and
others. Without a mobilization of the skills/competencies of these agencies, NGPR’s capacity to
address these priorities will be greatly compromised.

It should be remembered that the capacity of NGPR to ac tis concentrated in an area very close to
Belém. The situation of PIPs located in regions far from the capital is more complex and needs to
consider elements a minimum scenario for ensuring the presence of the Project (NGPR/Pará Rural)
in these areas. Without this decentralized framework, the commitment and capacity to supervise
and support those PIPs will be compromised.

Introduction

7.1     At the time the project started, the State of Pará was facing tremendous challenges in terms
of poverty reduction and natural resources management. More than 62 percent of the State’s
population was, in 2010, under the poverty line (the 4th poorest of all Brazilian States) and this rate
reached 82 percent in rural areas. The State, of quasi continental dimensions, was also characterized
by high rates of deforestation of the Amazon forest and violent conflicts over land tenure. The Pará
Rural Project aimed at addressing those critical development challenges.

Factors that Affected Project Implementation

7.2     The following factors affected significantly project implementation and led to the
conclusion that its design was over-ambitious:
    - The dimensions of the State and difficult conditions of transport and logistics, in the
        absence of geographical targeting, negatively affected the capacity of the executing
        agencies to supervise field activities, and also affected beneficiaries’ ability to function as
        producer associations.
    - The complex design of the project, combining three objectives (poverty reduction, land
        regularization and environmental management), while at the same time being the first
        IBRD project implemented by the State of Pará, created delays and difficulties while the
        project unit became familiar with Bank procedures.
    - Repeated changes in the project management team after each elections and different
        priorities of successive Governments also negatively affected implementation.
    - Project design failed to take into consideration the fact that the three implementing agencies
        (NGPR, ITERPA and SEMA) had no history of working jointly, and credible mechanisms
        for such collaboration were not established under the project.
    - Various project norms, as described in the Project Operational Manual, proved inadequate
        considering the remoteness and dispersion of beneficiary associations under Component A.
    - Under Component A, most producer associations were incipient and had little experience
        as associations and in particular with regards to business management and/or dealing with
        Government programs.


    A. Results
    7.3 Project implementation can be divided into two stages. Until 2012, very little was achieved
    (with the exception of the execution of the ZEE under Component B) and the project had
    virtually come to a stand-still when the Bank requested the preparation of the mid-term review
    (which was initially scheduled for 2011). After 2012, and following a new change in the project
    management team in the NGPR and project restructuring, project implementation accelerated
    and significant results were achieved under each component, including the following (not a
    comprehensive list):
        - The finalization of 41 PIPs under Component A, beneficiating over 3,000 families.
        - 39,000 properties registered and over 2,900 families with land titles.


                                                  86
      -   Strengthening of ITERPA through an updated legal framework, capacity building of
          the Institute’s staff and improved equipment.
      -   ZEE (Ecological and Economic Zoning) of the State at a scale of 1:250,000.
      -   Updating of the environmental legislation of the State of Pará.
      -   6,000 CAR (Environmental Cadasters) executed for small producers and quilombola
          communities.
      -   State Plan for the Prevention, Control and Alternatives to Deforestation prepared.
      -   Environmental audit of the livestock supply-chain carried out.
      -   Updated study on poverty in the State of Pará.


B. Lessons learned
7.4          The main lessons learned are summarized below.

Governance and inter-agency collaboration. Without a joint diagnosis of issues to be addressed,
an agreement on priorities and joint management systems, inter-agency collaboration will not
be effective and this will result in loss of synergies and parallel implementation of various
activities.

Change in Government teams. Changes following elections will always bring periods of
uncertainty and slow down project execution. These should be foreseen and mitigated through
better planning and management of those transitions.

Participation of civil society. Participation of civil society in the design and execution of the
project was limited (including that of beneficiaries and their representatives, NGOs, unions,
etc.). This negatively affected project design and implementation.

Productive investments of producer associations. The project showed that such investments,
when properly executed, bring substantial economic and social benefits.

Technical Assistance. The quality of the Technical Assistance (TA) proved a determining
factor in results from Productive Investments (PIPs). Any project working on similar
investments should pay specific attention to the arrangements for the provision of TA, the
quality of such TA (not bring only technical skills but also social skills such as facilitation,
conflict mediation, planning and management), and TA quality control by implementing
agencies. The presence of the implementing agencies at the local/decentralized level also
proved critical.
Flexibility in the execution of investment subprojects. It is important for the project execution
norms (as described for example in the Project Operational Manual) to avoid inflexible rules
and make room for adjustments to subprojects due to changed circumstances during their
execution. Complex subprojects covering several activities should also be avoided when
producer associations have limited experience and managerial capacity.

Technical and managerial capacity of producer associations. Subprojects should build on the
existing experience and capacity of producer associations (e.g. avoid new products with which
they are not familiar). The experience with “community procurement” was mixed, and the
decision to transfer back to the NGPR the procurement activities to limit the irregularities
observed with associations enabled a more efficient execution of the project, but limited
capacity building for the associations.


                                             87
    Late completion of the subprojects. The late completion of a number of subprojects, due to the
   delays and disruptions in project execution until 2012, did not allow sufficient time for the
   consolidation of commercialization activities and to build enough capacities for the producer
   associations to sustainably manage those activities. Continued support and capacity building
   would be essential. Most associations still need a business plan and a strategy to access new
   markets or consolidate their market position. This will depend on the continuation of the
   support provided by the technical team in NGPR.

   ZEE – Necessary but not sufficient. The preparation of the ZEE was a necessary step but not a
   sufficient one, and it needed to be complemented by further development of policy and
   regulatory instruments.

   Land regularization. The project’s physical targets with regards to land regularization (number
   of families with land titles) were not realistic considering the complexity of the land tenure
   situation in the State of Pará and the implementation capacity of ITERPA. The outsourcing of
   various processes helped to accelerate the execution of land regularization activities but
   requires continued supervision from ITERPA.

   Integration between territorial management agencies. The cooperation of territorial
   management agencies – ITERPA, SEMA, INCRA, judicial organizations – is critical
   considering the overlap between their actions (CAR, geo-referencing, etc) and political support
   will be needed to make it effective.

   Productive chains and environmental management. The project shows that it is possible to
   foster joint actions of various actors in the value-chain (private and public) to reduce the
   environmental footprint of productive chains.

   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The absence of a solid M&E system for the project
   negatively affected its management, by not providing timely information to detect and correct
   errors and problems, and eventually by limiting the possibility to demonstrate results.

   Capacity of the State of Pará. The progress made in the post-restructuring phase of the project
   shows that the State Government has the capacity to implement investment projects of the
   magnitude of what was envisaged at appraisal, provided a competent and motivated team is in
   place with adequate support at political level.

   Recommendations for the future. In the short-term, it is essential for the sustainability of the
   investments made under Component A that a technical team be maintained in the NGPR. In
   the medium-term, the State Government could initiate the preparation of a new program aimed
   at addressing rural development issues, learning from the lessons of the Pará Rural, which was
   the first such program implemented with the support of the World Bank.

B. Borrower’s Comments on the Bank’s Draft ICR

7.5      The Bank’s final draft ICR was sent to all implementing agencies – NGPR, ITERPA and
SEMA. No response was received as at the time of submission of the ICR. Should it be received
at a later date it will be archived in the Project file/WB Docs.
