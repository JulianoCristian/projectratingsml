PARA INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
RESTRUCTING PAPER
A. SUMMARY
1. This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors for the
restructuring of the Brazil Pard Integrated Rural Development Project (P082651;
Loan 7414-BR). The proposed restructuring would: (a) strengthen the alignment
of the Project with State Government priorities, thereby increasing its relevance in
view of policy developments in the State of Pard since the appraisal of the Project
in calendar year 2006; (b) reduce the scope of the Project to refocus it on a
number of activities which can successfully be completed within the revised
implementation period; and (c) enable the improvement of the Project's
management and implementation, including strengthened monitoring and
evaluation of the Project's results and outcomes.
2. The proposed restructuring would include: (a) an adjustment to the Project
Development Objective (PDO) and the Results Framework to reflect, in
particular, the reduced scope of the Project; (b) adjustments to the Project
components and subcomponents; (c) a reallocation of loan proceeds between
expenditure categories and partial cancellation of loan proceeds in the amount of
US$ 22,275,558; and (d) an extension of the closing date of the Project from June
30, 2013, to December 31, 2014, to enable the completion of the restructured
activities and the achievement of the revised PDO.
3. There are no changes to the Project's safeguard category and no new safeguards
policies are triggered.
B. PROJECT STATUS
4. Original Loan. The original loan amount of US$ 60 million was approved by the
Board of Executive Directors on December 12, 2006, and became effective on
December 17, 2007. The total Project cost is estimated at US$ 100 million. The
Project was designed as the first phase of a two phase APL, of five years each.
The second phase of the APL was to be financed through a US$60 million IBRD
loan and US$40 million equivalent in counterpart funding. According to the Loan
Agreement, the PDO is to improve the living conditions of rural poor
communities of the Borrower through the building of institutional capacity and
the strengthening of the Borrower's environmental and land administration
systems, while securing a sustainable and safe environment.
5. The Project consists of the following four components and ten subcomponents:
Component A: Productive Investments (US$31.54 million IBRD financing). This
component supports the financing of Productive Investment Plans (PIPs) prepared
6


﻿and implemented by eligible organizations of small rural producers. It comprises
two subcomponents: Subcomponent Al supports the preparation of the PIPs
through the provision of technical assistance, and Subcomponent A2 supports the
implementation of the subprojects included in the PIPs. The PIPs may include
three types of subprojects: (a) Income Generation Subprojects, (b) Environmental
Rehabilitation Subprojects, and (c) Complementary Infrastructure Subprojects.
Component B: Territorial Development (US$21.61 IBRD financing) aims at (a)
promoting the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources and the
conservation of biodiversity (Sub-component BI: Environmental Management)
and (b) improving land administration (Subcomponent B2: Land Administration)
in the State of Pard.
Component C: Policy Development (US$2.05 million IBRD financing) finances
studies to monitor income and asset levels to facilitate the development of plans
for poverty alleviation in the State of Pard (Subcomponent Cl) and a strategic
environmental assessment focusing on key sectors of the State's economy
(Subcomponent C2).
Component D: Project Management, Monitoring and Communication (US$4.80
million IBRD financing) includes four subcomponents: Subcomponent Dl
supports the operation of the PMU, Subcomponent D2 supports the creation of a
communications unit, Subcomponent D3 supports monitoring of the Project, and
Subcomponent D4 supports the design and maintenance of the Management and
Information System (MIS) and generation of periodic reports on the progress of
the Project.
6. Overall coordination of Project management and implementation is the
responsibility of a Project Management Unit (NGPR - Nucleo de Gerenciamento
do Parci Rural) in the Special State Secretariat for Economic Development and
Productive Incentives (SEDIP). Subcomponent BI (Environmental Management)
is implemented by the State Secretariat for the Environment (SEMA), and
Subcomponent B2 (Land Administration) is implemented by the Land Institute of
Pard (ITERPA). Under Component A, the Bank of the State of Pard (BANPARA)
acts as the financial agent for the Project.
7. Implementation Status. Project implementation progress is considered as
moderately unsatisfactory, which reflects its unsatisfactory implementation
performance until October 2012. However, a significant improvement has
occurred since that date. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Project was carried
out in May 2012. The MTR identified that, 4.5 years after effectiveness, good
progress had been made under the Environmental Management Subcomponent
(Bl). However, progress had been generally unsatisfactory with the other
components and subcomponents of the Project. The MTR also identified the need
to immediately strengthen all project management functions. The MTR concluded
that the Project is unlikely to meet most of its original targets, and recommended
a restructuring of the Project to strengthen its management, reduce its scope and
revisit the Results Framework accordingly.
7


﻿8. To address the identified management and implementation issues, the Bank and
the State Government agreed on a set of actions to improve the Project's overall
performance. In October 2012, the State Government replaced the management of
the NGPR and, subsequently, project implementation and management
significantly improved. A follow-up Bank supervision mission carried out in
March 2013 found that all agreed actions until March 2013 had been implemented
or were underway. The overall disbursement rate increased significantly from
33% in October 2012 to 46% in March 2013, as the new Project management
team promptly resolved many of the bottlenecks affecting execution in the field.
Key management functions (fiduciary, safeguards, reporting, monitoring and
evaluation) are being strengthened, and overall Project management has returned
to a moderately satisfactory status, including procurement and financial
management performance. The March 2013 mission also concluded that the
Project is in compliance with its safeguards policies. Overall safeguards
performance is considered moderately satisfactory.
9. The Project is currently in compliance with its legal covenants, with the exception
of the agreement between the NGPR and BANPARA, and the related agreements
between BANPARA and beneficiaries. The State Government has committed to
and is working actively on amending those agreements to ensure full compliance
with the Loan Agreement, and will monitor closely the execution of those
agreements by BANPARA. The amendments are expected to be finalized and
effective by June 30, 2013.
10. Rationale for the Restructuring. The main objectives of the restructuring are:
a. to align the Project with policy developments and State Government
priorities, in particular with regards to environmental management and
land administration;
b. to reduce the scope of the Project, including through the partial
cancellation of loan proceeds, in order to refocus the Project on a reduced
number of activities which can be successfully completed within the
revised implementation period; and,
c. to improve Project management and implementation performance.
Specific emphasis would be given to improving the management and
implementation of Component A, and to monitoring and evaluation of the
results of each component.
11. The State Government's request for restructuring and extension of the closing
date (dated April 11, 2013) was received by the Bank on April 12, 2013. The
request was approved by SEAIN/Cofiex on May 8, 2013, through its
Recommendation no. 10/0236 GTEC/Cofiex.
8


﻿C. PROPOSED CHANGES
12. Project's Development Objective. The original PDO was very broad and did not
reflect adequately the largest component of the Project (Productive Investments).
The PDO would be adjusted as follows:
"The Project Development Objective is to increase the incomes derived from
productive activities by beneficiary rural producers, while contributing to
improving environmental management and land administration in the Borrower's
territory."
13. The achievement of the revised PDO would be measured through: (a) the number
of beneficiary families whose real incomes from productive activities are raised
by at least 30% by the end of the Project, (b) the Ecological-Economic Zoning
(ZEE) and related policies are adopted and in effect by the end of the Project, and
(c) the number of families with their land partially or fully registered by the end
of the Project.
14. Results Framework. The results framework was revised to reflect the changes to
the original PDO and adjustments to PDO indicators and targets. In particular, the
original PDO indicators for Component A and B2 were modified and targets were
adjusted to reflect the reduced scope of the Project. Intermediate outcome
indicators and targets were also revised accordingly, as presented in Annex 1
(revised Results Framework).
15. Components. The main changes to the original Project design include:
16. Component A: (a) with regards to Subcomponent A2, the Loan Agreement would
be amended to clarify that there are three types of subprojects supported under the
PIPs (Income Generation Subprojects, Environmental Rehabilitation Subprojects,
and Complementary Infrastructure Subprojects); (b) the scope of the Component
would be reduced and only the 49 PIPs already approved and likely to be
completed by December 31, 2014, would continue to be supported under the
Project. Those PIPs are expected to benefit approximately 4,000 families. The
NGPR would focus on the improvement of the execution and viability of those
PIPs, as well as strengthened monitoring and evaluation of their results.
17. Component B: The scope of this component would be reduced and the remaining
activities would be realigned with State priorities to reflect the implications of
recent policy developments, such as the new national Forest Code:
a. the scope of Subcomponent B1 (Environmental Management) would be
reduced to the following activities: (1) the development of a legal and
regulatory framework for ecological and environmental zoning and land
management; (2) the detailing of the zoning plan, at a scale of 1:250,000 or
greater, for the land area designated for consolidation and recuperation, as
described in the Operational Manual, in accordance with the Macro Zoning
Law and national regulations on the subject; (3) the strengthening of SEMA,
9


﻿including (i) the provision of training and equipment, (ii) the development of
studies and new information systems, and (iii) the improvement of
environmental planning and management processes. The originally agreed
activities (mainly studies) to support the regulation of a protected area system
in the State of Pard (as per point (4), part 2.A of schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement) were completed by the Government without support from the
Project and would be cancelled;
b. The scope of Subcomponent B2 (Land Administration) would continue to
support the institutional strengthening of ITERPA and the implementation of
a new model of land administration in the State of Pard, with its scope
reduced to the following activities: (1) the carrying out of some of the
originally planned activities aimed at the modernization of ITERPA's
infrastructure and technical base, including, inter alia: (ii) the acquisition and
development of information technology, systems and equipment; (ii) the
provision of training for staff; and (iii) the technical integration of the State
land registry with the national rural land registry; (2) improvement in the
system of land administration, through the registration of land parcels and the
issuing of titles for additional land parcels using national standards; (3) titling
of selected small rural producers' lands; and (4) the creation of an
ombudsman office (ouvidoria) as a mechanism for hearing public complaints
on land management issues. Previously allocated funding for a new
headquarter for ITERPA, and additional cadastral field work, geo-
referencing, cartography and titling as well as some individual technical
training consultancies would be cancelled. Similarly, the activities for
broader improvements in the rural cadastre would be cancelled because they
were funded by Government through other resources. The originally planned
activities with land registries (cart6rios) have been transferred to the
responsibility of INCRA and would be cancelled from the Project.
18. Component C. Subcomponent Cl would be adjusted to focus on carrying out
studies to monitor income and analyze selected agricultural value-chains to
facilitate the development of plans for poverty alleviation in the State of Pard.
Subcomponent C2 would be adjusted to focus on strategic policy studies to
improve territorial development in the State of Pard, in view of policy
development since Project effectiveness. The strategic environmental assessment,
which was not initiated and could not be carried out within the remaining
implementation period, would be cancelled. The strategic studies associated with
policy changes that occurred in the last four years would include, in particular: (a)
the review of progress made during the execution of the first State Plan for the
Prevention, Control and Alternatives to Deforestation (PPCAD), implemented
from 2010 to 2012, and the preparation of the PPCAD for the period 2013-2015;
and (b) an environmental compliance audit of the meat production chain
(including cattle ranching farms and refrigeration plants) to review
sites/companies' compliance with environmental legislation, in the context of the
legal agreements (Terms of Adjustment of Conduct) signed in 2009 with the
Federal Government (through the Federal Public Ministry) and the State
Government.
10


﻿19. Component D. Under Subcomponent D2 (Communication), the Project would
continue  its  regular  communication  activities, however  no  specific
communications unit would be created.
20. Triggers for phase 2. The Project includes six triggers for the second phase of the
APL. All the triggers would be cancelled considering that, should a follow-up
operation be considered, it would not be an APL, in accordance with the new OP
10.00 on Investment Project Financing (Series of Projects).
21. Safeguards. The proposed restructuring consists in a downsizing of the Project,
and there would be no new activities which were not envisaged under the original
Project. The Project would remain classified as an environmental Category A and
no additional safeguards policies would be triggered. The Project's Environmental
Management Framework/Environmental Assessment is being updated and revised
procedures were incorporated in the Project Operational Manual. With regards to
social safeguards, the Indigenous Peoples and Quilombolas Policy Framework
(IPPF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) are being updated. The
final version of the updated safeguards instruments will be made publicly
available by May 31, 2013. Overall, environmental and social safeguards have
being managed in compliance with Bank policies.
22. Institutional Arrangements. Since October 2012, the NGPR in SEDIP (formerly
SEPE, the State Secretariat for Strategic Projects) has been strengthened through
the recruitment of new staff, and has received enhanced support from the
Extraordinary State Secretariat for the Green Municipalities Program (Programa
Municipios Verdes), which is under the responsibility of the State Governor. That
support has been instrumental in strengthening the NGPR and realigning the
Project with the priorities of the State Government. Under Component A, Project
funding for the three categories of PIP subprojects (Income Generation,
Environmental Rehabilitation, and Complementary Infrastructure subprojects)
would all be channeled to beneficiaries through BANPARA, the Project's
financial agent. In particular, Complementary Infrastructure Subprojects, which
were originally to be implemented through State agencies, would be implemented
by beneficiaries themselves, given the very small scale of those investments.
23. Financing. The detailed Project costs have been adjusted to reflect the changes in
the scope of each component and subcomponent, as well as the partial
cancellation of loan proceeds, as summarized in Table 1.

Proceeds
26. Cancellations. A total amount of US$ 22,275,558 of the original US$ 60.00
million IBRD loan would be cancelled, reflecting the reduction in the scope of the
Project.
27. Financial management. Financial management arrangements under the Project
would remain unchanged.
28. Procurement. All annual audits would cover procurement activities under
Component A (Subprojects). Other procurement arrangements would remain
unchanged.
29. Extension of the Project Closing Date. The current closing date of the Project is
June 30, 2013. While the performance of the implementing agencies
(NGPR/SEDIP, SEMA and ITERPA) has returned to moderately satisfactory
status following the actions implemented since October 2012, the new Project
management team will need additional time to fully address remaining
implementation issues and to complete the restructured Project activities. It is
therefore proposed to extend the Project closing date by 18 months, from June 30,
2013 until December 31, 2014, to enable the completion of the restructured
activities and ensure that the revised PDO can be met. A revised Project
Implementation Plan has been prepared and agreed upon to ensure that all
activities can be completed within the extended project implementation period.
This would be the first extension of the Project closing date.
30. Implementation schedule. The overall Project implementation schedule has been
updated to reflect the revised scope of activities and the extended implementation
period.

﻿D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
31. Economic and financial analysis. The original economic and financial analysis of
the Project carried out at appraisal focused on the economic viability of a sample
of PIPs to be financed under Component A. During Project implementation, the
analysis of the economic and financial viability of all PIPs was delegated by the
NGPR to BANPARA. A review of BANPARA analyses was carried out for a
sample of 25 approved PIPs, with a focus on productive investments. PIPs with
Economic Rates of Return (ERR) of at least 12% and Financial Rates of Return
(IRR) of at least 6% are considered eligible for support under the Project. Based
on BANPARA data, the ERR and IRR for four of the most common activities in
the PIPs (poultry, flour mill, honey, agroforestry systems) ranged from 36% to
62% (ERR) and from 32% to 70% (IRR) on average.
32. The economic and financial analysis of a random sample of four PIPsI was
carried out in March 2013, and confirmed the economic and financial viability of
those PIPs, with IRRs ranging from 18% to 74% and ERRs ranging from 20% to
40%. Given the uncertainty about the reliability of the data collected in the field
at the time when the PIPs were prepared, the NGPR is recruiting a Senior
Economist and Agribusiness Specialists, who will re-appraise all approved PIPs,
revisit as needed the financial and economic analysis, and recommend
adjustments to the PIPs as needed to further improve their economic viability.
33. Technical. Various adjustments to the technical approach selected at appraisal
have been made following the MTR of the Project, in response to lessons learned
during implementation.
a. With regards to Component A, only the 49 PIPs already approved and/or
under implementation and considered viable would continue to be
supported by the Project. The role of the Local Development Agents has
been refocused on support for implementation of the existing PIPs, and
supervision of the services provided by the Technical Assistants. The
performance of the Technical Assistants has been reassessed and the list of
those working with the Project has been revised accordingly. Whenever
possible, the Project is seeking additional technical support from
EMATER staff in the field (the State's Agricultural Extension Agency).
The NGPR has been strengthened with fiduciary, safeguards and technical
staff. An economist and agribusiness specialists are being recruited to
address the weaknesses identified in the design of the PIPs with regards to
economic viability and access to markets.
Details are available in the Project files. The four PIPS were those of the Association of Small Producers
of Sol da ManhA (poultry), the Association of Farmers and Fish Producers of Quatipuru-ASSAGRIAQUIQ
(flour mill), the Association of Honey Producers AMIGA (honey), and the Development Council of of
Nova Col6nia - CDCNC (Agroforestry systems).
14


﻿b. With regards to Subcomponent BI (Environmental Management), the
original Project included studies to support SEMA's reorganization and
strengthening, some of which were completed by the State Government
without support from the Project. Adjustments were made to realign the
subcomponent with State priorities and reflect recent policy developments,
such as the implementation of the Environmental Rural Cadastre (CAR) in
priority municipalities to comply with the new national Forest Code. The
same rationale was used to introduce the following studies: (i)
strengthening of water resources management in Pard to support the
State's commitment to implement the national water resource management
policy; and (ii) strengthening community forestry management, as
foreseen in the original loan, however, with a focus on community
planning and capacity development in strategic public forests.
c. With regards to Subcomponent B2 (Land Administration), the target for
regularization and titling of small rural producers was substantially
reduced due to the slow pace of conventional cadastral, geo-referencing,
cartographic and titling processes. In addition, benchmarking of costs of
these services against those incurred by the National Institute for
Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) in recent years showed that
the original Project estimates were substantially underestimated. A more
pragmatic approach has been developed by Brazil after the Project was
designed, based on intermediate land tenure arrangements (e.g. use rights)
and less precise geo-referencing, as is now being used for the CAR, and
may be required if future regularization initiatives are to achieve scale in a
reasonable timeframe in a large territory such as the State of Pard. By the
time of the MTR, a Commission for Mediation of Land Conflicts had
already been established (2007) and was functioning under an
ombudsman. Substantial progress has also been made with scanning a
significant proportion of the land records of ITERPA (up to 2009) and
sharing these records with INCRA. Finally, it is noteworthy that in the
early years of Project implementation some important laws and
regulations governing land administration were introduced or revised,
including the Land Law No. 7289 of 2009 and various Decrees to improve
the operational functioning of ITERPA.
d. With regards to Component C (Policy Development), as requested by the
State Government, activities were realigned with State priorities to reflect
recent policy developments aimed at addressing deforestation prevention
and control, including: (i) an environmental compliance audit to address
deforestation caused by illegal cattle ranching in the Amazon forest area
of the State; and (ii) the review of progress made under the first and
recently implemented State Plan for the Prevention, Control and
Alternatives to Deforestation, and the preparation of the subsequent State
Plan for 2013-2015, both to comply with a State policy established in
2009 by Decree.

﻿34. Social. Under the original Project, Component A (Productive Investments) was
expected to benefit mainly the poor through its support to income generation
subprojects proposed by organizations of small rural producers (the majority of
them with incomes below the poverty line), capacity building for participatory
decision making and management of income generating activities. The original
Project was also expected to benefit Indigenous People and Quilombola through:
(a) their participation in Component A; (b) Ecological-Economic Zoning under
Subcomponent Bl, which was meant to help control the expansion of the
economic frontier into forested areas, where Indigenous and Quilombola lands are
often located, thereby contributing to the security of those populations; and, (c)
Quilombola land regularization under Subcomponent B2. The downsizing of the
project would limit the magnitude of its social benefits commensurately:
a. Under Component A, only 49 PIPs benefitting approximately 4,000 rural
families would be supported;
b. Only three Quilombola communities (out of 103 certified Quilombola
communities and an estimate of a total of 240 Quilombola communities in
the State) applied for income generating investments under Component A.
They were prior informed on the principles and guidelines of the Project;
they were also previously consulted and freely prepared their proposals for
Project funding.
c. Under Subcomponent BI, SEMA is implementing two activities - training
of Indigenous Environmental Agents and Ethno-zoning of the High
Guami River Indigenous Land - that interfere with Indigenous Peoples
(Temb6, Timbira, Kaapor and Guaji). These activities have been carried
out in compliance with OP 4.10 and may contribute to protection of
indigenous lands and promotion of traditional livelihoods.
d. Under Subcomponent B2, land regularization activities supported by the
Project that could ensure land ownership rights and security of tenure for
Quilombola communities have only reached eight of them and have been
concluded in only two of them. In those communities, no adverse impact
related to involuntary displacement has occurred.
35. Environment. The Project remains classified as environmental Category A and no
additional environmental safeguard policies are triggered. The Project is expected
to contribute to more efficient and sustainable use of natural resources in the State
of Pard. No significant indirect, long-term, or cumulative impacts are foreseen.
Low adverse impacts on the environment could be expected at the local level as a
result of 49 PIPs financed under Component A, where the Project is assisting
small producers in developing income generation strategies that will make more
sustainable use of natural resources and discourage itinerant agriculture and
unlawful occupation. The updated EMF describes measures which will be
applied to mitigate any potential small negative impacts at the local level from
investments under Component A. Procedures for environmental screening,
evaluation, and monitoring of productive investments were updated in the EMF,
incorporated in the PIP cycle, and included in the revised Operational Manual.
16


﻿36. Risk. Overall Project risk remains substantial. The main risks that could
jeopardize the achievement of the revised project development objective and
outcome targets include the following:
a. Fiduciary risks. Financial reporting by beneficiary producer organizations
has been weak during the first years of project implementation, and this is
an area which will require continued monitoring. This risk is being
mitigated by the recruitment of additional financial management staff,
with a focus on assistance to and capacity building of producer
associations in complying with the reporting requirement of the Project.
The Project's financial management system is being strengthened to
mitigate risks, and corrective actions are being taken to ensure the full
compliance of BANPARA with the Loan Agreement. Procurement risks
are also being mitigated through the strengthening of the procurement
team in the NGPR and SEMA.
b. Technical risks. Under Component A, a number of original design
weaknesses (see paragraph 34 above) have been identified and are being
addressed. The extended implementation period will enable the NGPR to
continue to strengthen the socioeconomic viability of the PIPs, to mitigate
their initial weaknesses and ensure that they eventually result in increased
incomes for beneficiary producers. A rigorous evaluation of final results
will also be carried out to draw lessons from the implementation of this
Component.
c. Institutional risks. The capacity of SEDIP to adequately manage and
coordinate Project implementation has been a substantial issue until
October 2012, and the main reason for slow implementation until then.
Project management has been strengthened since October 2012 through
the replacement of key NGPR staff and new recruitments, and enhanced
support from the Extraordinary State Secretariat for the Green
Municipalities Program, which is reporting directly to the State Governor.
Institutional and capacity risks remain substantial however, given that
many staff are new to the Project. These risks will continue to be mitigated
through enhanced implementation support by the Bank, and continued
dialogue at State level on Bank engagement in the State of Pard.
37. Exceptions to Bank Policy. There are no exceptions to Bank policies.
