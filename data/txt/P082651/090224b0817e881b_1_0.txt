                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A mid-term review of the progress with project implementation was carried out in May 2012. The review found that good progress has been made with the environment management
                         activities under the project, but that progress has been much slower with the other components, which are falling behind the expected targets and results. Government and the Bank
                         have agreed on a number of actions to improve the implementation of the project by October 2012.
