In this Land Administration\n            Sub-component, ITERPA would carry out a mass, geo-referenced\n            cadastre of 56,000 rural properties in pre-selected\n            municipalities, and would seek to regularize land tenure\n            throughout the State. The foreseeable impacts of Cadastre\n            and Land Tenure Regularization efforts are not likely to\n            lead to involuntary resettlement as defined in OP 4.12. It\n            is possible that the registration or regularization\n            (titling) of a land parcel may result in adjusting\n            boundaries of a land claim or holding. This could result\n            from conflicting claims or from a demand for a lot in an\n            official settlement larger than the legally allowed maximum\n            (100 Ha). In most such cases, the actual physical\n            displacement of a landholder would not be necessary unless\n            his/her dwelling or other infrastructure were found to be\n            encroaching on another parcel to which the party has no\n            valid claim. In such cases, the survey team itself will\n            attempt to reach an amicable settlement between adjacent\n            claimants. Should this prove impossible, the project calls\n            for informal mediation by trained mediators to reach a\n            negotiated settlement. In cases where the State determines\n            that a person has occupied and made improvements to a land\n            parcel in good faith under conditions where the person could\n            not reasonably be expected to know that the claim was\n            invalid, the State would assume liability for financial\n            losses from investments (e.g. housing, fencing, and other\n            structures). In most cases, the party would be accommodated\n            in an agricultural colony acceptable to the person and\n            within a reasonable distance of the original parcel or\n            claim. Rural producers would only be eligible for financial\n            settlements for land only when suitable land-for-land\n            arrangements cannot be found. ITERPA will seek out cases\n            where persons occupy land parcels or expel others from\n            landholdings for purely speculative purposes. Such persons,\n            known locally as grileiros, would not be entitled to\n            resettlement or other compensation, but their moving\n            expenses could be paid. ITERPA would establish a grievance\n            procedure for persons who, having exhausted the normal\n            remedies provided, including mediation, feel that they have\n            not been fairly treated. Unsatisfied claimants will have\n            final recourse to the courts."}, "docdt": "2013-06-05T00:06:01Z"}
