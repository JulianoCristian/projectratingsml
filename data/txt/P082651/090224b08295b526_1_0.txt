Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 A Bank mission visited the Project from November 11 to 24, 2014, to supervise the project implementation progress (and a visit by the Bank's social
 safeguards specialist was subsequently carried out on December 9-10, 2014). Component B1 (Environmental Management) has progressed as planned
 and good progress has also been made with the studies implemented under Component C (Policy Development). With respect to Component A
 (Productive Investments), at this stage, it is expected that up to 42 sub-projects (PIPs) might be completed by the Project closing date. With regards to
 Subcomponent B2 (Land Administration), only 34% of the agreed land regularization progam will be completed by December 2014. ITERPA has
 committed to completing the rest of the titling processes after the project closing.
 The next Bank mission, which will carry out the final evaluation of the project, is scheduled in March 2015.

         Comments
         Will be measured in March 2015 once the second survey is concluded. A total of 1,028 families have benefitted from completed PIPs. The
         remaning PIPs will only be completed in December 2014. Therefore, the actual is not expected to exceed 1,000 families, at best (50% of
         the target), and will most likely be significantly lower, given that the related subprojects were only completed in 2013.

               The number of trained and deployed ADLs was 8 before the project restructuring, after which the number of ADLs was reduced based on
               their performance review. No new ADLs were re-hired considering the late stage of execution of the project and time needed to train new
               staff. To provide continued support in the field, the project then relied on the expertise of EMATER, and a formal collaboration agreement
               with NGPR was established.
