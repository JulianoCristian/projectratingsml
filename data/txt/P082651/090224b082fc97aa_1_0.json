development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: operations involving a multi-sector\n            approach with different institutions, components, and areas\n            of concentration need strong analytical justification and\n            should proceed only in cases of more experienced borrowers\n            with proven implementation capacity. More work is needed\n            during project preparation to analyze and understand\n            promising productive chains based on regional and local\n            comparative advantage. Projects in geographically and\n            logistically challenging areas can encounter multiple\n            constraints. It is unrealistic to define the target\n            population for a project seeking more sophisticated\n            commercial goals, principally in poverty terms.\n            Well-designed and managed revolving funds need to establish\n            good practices for the first repayment cycle before (public)\n            resources are re-lent to members, but the longer-term goal\n            should be an association\u2019s independent operations and\n            maintenance (O and M) of the facility. Mechanisms are\n            needed, backed by the Bank and with legal weight, to mandate\n            continued support for certain elements of the project - most\n            typically productive activities with income-generation\n            potential - for a minimum of one year to strengthen sustainability."}, "docdt": "2015-06-24T04:43:02Z"}
