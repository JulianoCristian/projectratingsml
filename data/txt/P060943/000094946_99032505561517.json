Social Sector Support Project aims\n            to a) support the National Economic Recovery Plan strategy\n            for ameliorating the adverse impacts of the economic crisis\n            on the poor and vulnerable by maintaining their welfare and\n            access to essential social services; and b) strengthen the\n            monitoring of poverty over time as well as of the\n            effectiveness of programs designed to reduce poverty and to\n            mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis. There are four\n            components. 1) Rural development and poverty alleviation\n            will finance the Poverty Village Development Program which\n            will construct community facilities in preschool education,\n            functional literacy, counseling, and skill training. The\n            component will also support the Early Childhood Education\n            Program by building pre-school centers, etc. 2) Health\n            clinic will maintain provision of essential health services\n            for lower income groups during the current crisis. Rural\n            community clinics and urban health clinics will be\n            constructed and equipped. 3) Social assistance for\n            disadvantaged groups will support the refurbishment and\n            equipping of some existing construction and new\n            kindergartens for poor children, and support training of\n            their teachers. 4) Poverty monitoring and impact assessment\n            will finance an Household Income Survey, an impact\n            assessment of selected anti-poverty programs; and\n            beneficiary assessments to monitor the impact of key poverty programs."}, "docdt": "1999-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
