 Second Livestock Development Project in Honduras for which\n            credit was approved on October 9, 1973. The credit was\n            closed in December 1979 after a delay of one year. The final\n            disbursement was made on January 1980 and the credit was\n            fully disbursed. Lessons and other points of interest are:\n            medium size dairy production requires better quality\n            management than small scale operations. The difficulties\n            associated with departure from the widely used dual purpose\n            (dairy/beef) system towards specialization were\n            underestimated at appraisal. The new technologies that were\n            adopted by beneficiaries are well suited to conditions in\n            Honduras at present. These are dual purpose production using\n            cross-bred cattle, with feeding based on rotationally grazed\n            pastures with some fodder grown as stand-by feed for the dry\n            season, and use of hand labor for milking and weed control.\n            During project execution the basis was laid for a full scale\n            monitoring and evaluation system and, by using data\n            processing equipment, this will also serve all other\n            projects which are managed by the project unit. The wide\n            spread participation of public and private banks in project\n            implementation indicates that the lending terms, such as\n            spread, rediscounting margin, adequate lending rate of\n            interest associated with rigorous promotion, were\n            appropriately designed to attract participation of the whole\n            banking sector in financing long-term agriculture development."}, "docdt": "1982-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
