SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        For many years the Bank has been closely assuciatU Wt. the dI v-
elopment cf Nigeria's transport sector.    From 1958 to 1965 four loans and
one crecditt totaling US$88.5 minion were made; more than half of this
amount has been for the financing of highway projects in various parts of
the country while the remainder has gone to railways and ports.
ii.       Since 1966, major political disturbances have swept the countiry,
leading to the declaration of secession by the former Eastern Region, nmcl,
in July 1967, to the outbreak of the current civil war.
iii.      The civi.l war has greatly affected the country's transport sE)ctor.
While, apext from a short period, military actions have been confined to
small are-as in the East, the transport sector throughout the Federation has
felt the repercussions.   Port Harcourt, the eastern line of the Nigeri.an
Railway Corporatioi4 and navigation on the Niger and Benue rivers have been
closed, and severe damage inflicted on roads and bridges.    An export and
import traffic, especially the transport-intensive produce evacuation from
the north, has had to be channeled through the western rail and road system,
which has been barely adequate to cope with the sudden increase in demanmd.
Lack of highway maintenance and heavy rains brought the traffic on the
Lagos-Kano road close to a halt late in 1968.    The civil war has had Jiitlt
effect on the exeeution of thA nurrAnt BAnk Group financed hiehway projiects
which are outside the war zone, but it has delayed the preparation of some
future proieets.
iv.       The CnnU=VnMAn-t is prneently preparing a ORnprnl rehabilitation
and development program. As part of this program, the proposed project
aims at restori ng +.ha nrAnn +.iT nf +Twn nf ATi. a g  ; 1-.c mert+. imnortant trunik

will assist the Ministry in the supervision.   Contracts will be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding.
vi.       The project will cost about US$17.1 million equivalent and is ex-
pected to be comnleted by the And of 1971.   The foreign exchange component
is about US$10.6 million equivalent and would be financed by the proposed
loan.   Thig amoulnt includes pronvision for contu1tants  sarvices in connec-
tion with the final design of the project works, which was started in April
1969; it is -roosed that re+..roactive financi'n  bh nernitted in respect of
payments made between that date and the date of signature of the proposed
loan and disbiursement for +his purpose is expected to be about US$40;000
equivalent.
vii.      Speedy execution of the project is of vital importance for Nigeria
in order to keep e.port tra"ffic moving and to maintain unrestricted ex-
change of foodstuffs between the various surplus and deficit areas of the
cour.try; a soluti-orn of NEligeriats criLsis andu tI-he reoper;Ling of-P Portlu H1arco.irt-
would not affect its priority.   The project will yield satisfactory rates
of return, estimated under the most adverse assumptions at between 9i and
15% for the various road sections.   It provides a suitable basis for a
Bank loan of US$10.6 million equivalent.   A term of i5 years, including a
three-year period of grace, would, on country grounds, be appropriate,
although on the basis of the economic life of the project works a shorter
term would be warranted.



NIGERIA
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      For more than ten years the Bank has been closely associated with
the develcpment of Nigerials transport sector.   In 1958, a loan (193-UN])
tote.ling US$28 million was made to help finance a five-year development
program oL the Nigerian Railway Corporation and in 1962, a loan (326-ui'rI)
of US$13.5; million was made to the Nigerian Ports Authority for the im-
Provament and extension of facilities at Apapa Quay in the Port of Lagcs.
Highways have, however, received most of the Bank Group's assistance to
the transport sector.   Two loans and one credit were made in 1965:
(i) Loan 426-UNI, US$17 million         -- Apapa Road
(ii)  Loan 427-UNI, US$14.5 million      -- Western Road Project
(iii)  Credit 73-UNI, US$15.5 million      -- Northern Road Project
The Western and Northern Road Projects are almost completed.    The con-
struction of the Apapa Road, a four-lane partly elevated structure, has
been delayed because the original design prepared by the Government waS
found, on review by consultants, to be inadequate.    The project had to be
redesignedl and will not be completed before 1972; costs will be higher
than orig-Lnallv estimated; but unit Drices for the revised work have still
to be finally agreed upon.
1.02      The outbreak of the civil war, in July 1967, has not only inflict-
ed heav  damage n Niigeria1s transnort svstem, but has also interrupted tl-,J
preparation of future development projects.    A UNDP-financed road develop-
ment survey in th.e MildWInLest 1/, for which the Rank is Executing Agency, had
to be postponed and valuable time for completing feasibility studies and
carrying out detailed engrinering of high priority road proiects was lost,
Studies financed by UNDP on highways in the liorth, although initially de-
layed by the constitutional changes of 1968, are now nroceedino satisfac-
torily.
1.03      A Bank Economic Mission visited Nigeria in November/December 1968
to discuss the im.,pact of the war on th,e econo'"y of Nigeria and, in  he pro.
cess, identified a highway rehabilitation project for early Bank financin.
The   aJect was s   euer,Jy appraised by Mssrs.     . Bergan (engineer) anc
T. Oursin (economist), who visited Nigeria again in February/March 1969.
1/ For simplicity of exposition the terms North, East, Mid-Wiest and West
are used to describe the former "Regions"; of Northern, Eastern, M1Id-
Wlestevrn and Western Nigeria.



- 2 -
1.04      The proposed project consists of:
(i)  the rehabilitation of 204 miles ol federal trunkk
roads Al and A9; 2/   and
(ii) the execution of detailed engineering of a new Lagos-
Ibadan road and feasibility studies for future road
projects.
1.05      The speedy implementation of the project is of vital importance
to Nigeria,.  As a result of the loss of the transport routes through thle
east to Port Harcourt, all produce evacuated from the north must pass along
the Kano-Lagos corridor, and quick rehabilitation of Al and A9 is, there-
fore, of f-irst priority.  The proposed engineering and feasibility studies
will prepare the ground for the implementation of future development pro-
jects in the transport sector.
1.06      The end of Nigeriats crisis and the reopening of Port Harcourt
would not affect the priority of the proposed project; Al would continue
to be the most important road in the country.
2/ Federal trunk roads will be referred to as Al, A6, A9 ... in this
report.

2t BACKGROUND
A. General
2,01      Nigeria, most populous of all African States, covers an area of
357,000 square miles, just slightly less than the combined area of France
and Spain. It is bounded to the West and North by the Republics of Dahomey
and Niger and to the East by the Republics of Chad and Cameroon, Reliab].e
demographic data are not available and population estimates vary between
51 and 60 mLllion (143 - 167 per sq. mile).
2.02      S-ince 1966, maior political disturbances involving heavy loss of
life have swept the country; a series of military coups and civil distur-
bances cu-lm-i-nated in the declaration of secession by the former Eastern
Region in may 1967 and led to the outbreak of the current civil war in July
1 967  Tn an attemnt to provide a con9titutirnal structure more responsive
to the socio-political situation) a new constitution was promulgated in

production outside the war zone continued uninterrupted. Agriculture has

ments and continued to be the principal source of exports, while manufactur-
ing, after a sh-Uarp decline during the second ha'l oL 1967, has expanded
rapidly in :19680  Petroleum operations were interrupted but are returning
to pre-war scale in the areas under Federal control; rapid nlcreabu in out-
put and export of petroleum products is technically feasible and, so long
as the oilfields remain secure, virtually certain to materialize.
B. The Transport Sector
2.O4      Wnile, apart from a short period, miJ.itary actions have been con-
fined to small areas east of the Niger and south of the Benue, the transport
sector throughout the Federation has felt the repercussions, Port harcourt
has been closed, the eastern line of the Nigerian Railway Corporation blocked,
navigation on the rivers Niger and Benue interrupted, and severe damage
inflicted on roads and bridges, both in the East and elsewhere.  Al1 export
and import traffic, especially the evacuation of groundnuts from the North,
has to be moved through Western Nigeria, causing considerable congestion on
the exdsting facilities. The western railway line is not able to satisfy
all the demand for transport services, and during the 1968 rainy season road
traffic almost ceased on the southern sections of Al.



(a) Ports
2.05      Nligeriats two large seaports, Lagos and Port Harcourt, normUlly
serve all parts of the country.   Roads and railroads connect both ports wlith
their hinterlands, the East and the Northeast being predominantly servedI by
Port Harcourt and the other areas by Lagos,   Special commodities and
particular local areas are served by a number of smaller ports, mostly in
the Niger Delta.   The terminals for river navigation on the Niger and Benue
are Burutu and Warri.
2.06     lThis pattern of port traffic was interrupted by the civil war.
Late in 1967, Port Harcourt was placed under Federal Government naval block-
ade and ceabsed to operate.  Activities in most of the river ports were
severely hampered and, at times, brought to a complete standstill.   Lago's
had to take over,,and still carries: the burden of the bulk of the foreign
trade.   In addition to military and relief supplfes, it handles all grcound-
nut exports and has once again become the main entry point for refined pet-
roleum products for the whole country.   This has reversed the supply
routes for large parts of Nigeria which, after the opening of the refinery
in Port Harcourt in 1966, had been served directly from the refinery by rail
and road.
(b) River Navigation
2.07      River navigation on the Niger and Benue, which carried about
32;0u^0 tons in 1961/62; has been completely intnrrunted.   The future of
this activity will mainly depend on improved water regulation between Oriitsha
nnd Tnkorn..   e+-.TAn  T.nknin and JTeHb- it isc qntininta-ri that a minimum
depth of 5 feet 6 inches will be maintained in the Niger as a result of rega-
la+tion o^f the river b ther + aiin;i Dam w.Thic,Wh Twas nompnlet+nr in I : +.Q 1 96R _
The construction of the dam and the power scheme was financed with two Bank

2.09'     'Chu~ Ni±gerian Railway uorporation kiRtuC nab siuitritu severely *'rom
the crisis.   About 6,000 trained employees left the service of the Corpor-
ation and returned to tne East; the eastern line was closed compiete'ly and
physically damaged in many places; a considerable number of locomotivesc and
freight cars were lost.   All indicators point to a considerable reduction
in efficiency of operation and equipment maintenance.



2.10      In an effort to concentrate all resources on produce evacuation
from the North, the NRC has seriously neglected other traffic.    Whereas
import and export traffic remained steady, the volume of internal traffic
handled by the railway dropped by almost two-thirds during the last twc
years.   The railway's inability to handle all the traffic on offer has
not only seriously affected its financial situation, but has also result-
ed in a heavy strain on the capacity of the principal north-south road of
the country.
(d) Air Transport
2.11      Damage to airports has been limited.    The eastern airports were
co-a
tions during the second half of 1968.    Only Enugu was still closed to com-
mercial. traffic at the end of the year.
2.12      Niger=ia Airways, ahea-,y in a difficult fnancial position before
the civil war, suffered losses in freight and passenger traffic, especially

of the country.
(e) Roads and Road Transport
2.13      Roads and road transport in Nigeria have developed rapidly since
the early l95O0s.   This is illustrated by the volume of trucking to and
from the port of Lagos, which grew from 0.2 million tons in 1955 to 1.4
million tons in 1967/68, increasing its share from 16g to about 60% of all
movements to and from the port.
2.14      War damage to roads goes beyond destruction inflicted by direct
military action.   We can roughly distinguish:
(i)  Damage in the war areas of the East.    The losses are
expected to be considerable but have not yet been as-
sessed;
(ii)  Destruction of, or damage to, ten bridges on roads
A6 and A9 which connect Lagos and lbadan via Benin
across the River Niger with the East.    The most sig-
nificant damage is to the 0.9 mile long bridge over
the River Niger at Onitsha, where two spans have been
destroyed; and
(iii) A rapid deterioration of Al from Lagos via Ibadan to
Jebba.   Although outside the war-affected area, this
road suffered from the coincidence of an unprecedented
high volume of heavy traffic and general lack of main-
tenance.  Tong sections have revAertedi to li+t+tl  more
than a track.

2.15      Little information is available on the development and perform-
ance of the road transport industry over the last two years.    There is,
however. ample evidence that the industrv has considerablv increased its
share in the total transport volume of the country, largely because of
the reduction in raihmy operations-     Tn 1967 shipmAnts of yroimdnuts bv
road from the North to Lagos increased by 30% over 1966; and large quanti-
ties of gnerai   argon nnA pe1.roleimn prMuc+-s shifferte   t the roads.
2.16      No data on +hn devlopment of the trucking fleet are avlable
However, there has been a marked increase in imports of commercial vehicles
an.d a sharp reduction in +>. i.orts~+ of au+gor.oild  the latter reu+n
from an import ban imposed during 1968.

2.17      The increasing share of road transport in the total transport
volume has been greatly influenced by the inability of the railways to haul
at the pre-hostilities volumes.   Under these circumstances, price and cost
considerations and questions of road-rail competition have become of secon-
dary importance.   There is no doubt, however, that when political and ecO-
nomic conditions return to normal the railway will be confronted with in-
creased competition from the trucking industry, and the problems of trans-
port coordination will then become an important issue.
2.18      Due to the civil war and the formation of the twelve new States,
collection of statistics in the highway sector is not systematic, particu-
larly in respect of traffic counts and vehicle registration.    The Govern-
ment has given assurances that it will restore svstematic collection of
data as quickly as practicable in order that adequate highwiay planning can
be resumed.

B. Federal Highway Administration
3.03      The Works Division of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing
(IM0W), which has its headquarters in Lagos, is responsible for the con'struc-
tion and rnaintenance of Federal roads, buildings, airports and Lagos water-
works.   All senior positions in the Division are staffed with Nigerian
officers.   Mostly trained abroad, they are competent but insufficient in
number.    Of the 200 professional and technical positions,64 are vacant.
3.04      The Ministry has no permanent offices outside Lagos.      Resident
engineers are assigned from headquarters to supervise major construction
works.
C. Highway Maintenance
3.05      The Works Division carries out maintenance for Federal roads in
the Lagos State directly.    All other Federal Roads are maintained by -the



-8-
State Ministries of Works on an agency basis, continuing the agree entE; in
force betwieen the Federation and the Regions prior to the creation of the
12 states.   The State organizaticns execute maintenance with funds provi-
ded through the Federal M%J budget.
3.o6      During 1965 to 1968 the following amounts were allocated for the
mtintenance of tA- roads and bridges:
Total Allocations              N

1965/66                  1,890,000                340
1966/67                  2,050,000                370
1967/68-*                2,010,000                390
* Excluding East Central State
The annual budgetary allocations for each State are calculated according to
mnleage and type of road and include periodic maintenance.   For 1968/D9
they were based on average unit rates of NE 425 per mile for paved, and
TEF 300 per mile for gravel roads   However, only part of the allocations
are transferred to the State, depending on the availability of liquid funds
and the o-vrerall positio-n of the Federal buiiget;  about 65-80'7 of the above
maintenance allocations were actually spent in recent years.
3.07      The figures are difficult to evaluate because they are applied
more or less uniformly to each State regardless of its equinment fleet, tze
staffing  of its Highway Department, etc.   However, the ability of the
States to perform their maintenance function.s varies considerably  Whereas
the creation of the new States has caused little change in the West and NIid-
west, it has greatly affected the North.   Six States have been formed out
of the former Northera Regio4 and although care was taken to share the total
assets and liabilities of the former Region equitably among them, the trans-
fer of highway equipment, shop facilities and qualified personnel did not
always meet the individual highlway needs of the Sitates.  The States are
still in a period of transition; they have great difficulty in raising funds
for theiz own ;;B;; roads, and the unsatisfactory m-aintenance performance on
the "A" roads during the recent past is partly explained by these extraordi-
nary circumstances.
D. Reoreanization of the HighwJay System and Reclassification of
Trunk Roads
3.08      The need to review the arrangements for highway organization
and maintenance was already realized before the civil war, and the Bank,
therefore, initiated a study of Nigeria's trunk road system, which has beer!
financed as part of Loan 426-UNI.   The study was carried out by cons-ult-
ants, KAtIPSAX (Denmark), and covers the establishment of economic and
teclhnical criteria for reclassification and reorganization of the truaiK
road system, including Federal and State roads.



- 9 -
3s09      The consultants submitted their report entitled "mTrunlk Road Stud4y-.
early in 1568. The principal recommendations were:
(i) A. functional system of road classification should be
established, based upon traffic generating characteristics
of the centers linked by the roads. The road system should
be divided into primary and secondary roads according to
such criteria;
(ii)- Both the primary and the secondary roads should be the
responsibility of the Federal Government;
(iii) --The highway administration should consist of an autonomous
Federal Highway Organization and 12 State Highway Depart-
ments. Maintenance of the primary and secondary road system
chould continue to be carried o-at by the State Highway
]'epartments on an agency basis; and,
(iv)  The network of primary and secondary roads should consist
of 13.700 miles as compared with the existing systems of
5,620 miles of Federal (WA?I) and 8,915 miles of State ("B")
roads. IThe remaining roads would continue to be the
responsibility of state or local authorities.
3,10      I'he report is used as a working document within the MOW but there
has been nc… official reaction from the Federal Government, and such deci.siorns
as the transfer of the 11BT roads to the Federal Government might be difficul';
ni the present circumstances.  However, during negotiations the Government,
confirmed its intention to reclassify the trunk highway system as soon as
practicable in consulltation with the Bank.
3.11 ]:t will t.ake some tim.e to reestablish nroper an.l pqVJP-KP
highway maintenance in Nigeria.  However, this should be a nrimary aim cf the
Government, and assurances were obtained during negotiations that it will ta]_
all possible steps to this end.

(a) Rehabilitation of Roads
(i) Al: Lagos-niorin (175 miles) and
A9: Lagos-Ewekoro (29 miles)
4.02      The Lagos-Tnorin road (Al) and the Lagos-Ewekoro section of the
Lagos-Abeokuta-Ibadan road (A9) have been severely damaged during the
current crisis due to the high traffic density and heavy loadings which
were never envisaged when the roads were built. The pavement has dis-
appeared aver long stretches, and, in many places, it is beyond repair.
4.03      To rehabilitate these roads, it is intended to rebuild the carriage-
way to 24 ft. with shoulders of 5 fto    Where necessary, the grade will be
raised, drainage improved, and the carriageway reshaped and widened; new base
and pavement will be provided throughout. The roads will be given a double
surface treatment, except the Lagos-Ode Remo section of Al which, because of
heavy traffic (M,500 vehicles per day). will have asphalt concrete pavement.
The existing grades and curves will only be changed where absolutely necessa;V
for consistent traffic flow.

4e°4      The Government has contracted with Stirling I sbali. (It -iy' /U
for immediate rehabilitation of the Ilorin-Jebba section of Al. The
standards to which this section is to be rebuilt are in line with u1tose
for the Lagos-Ilorin section. The Government has agreed that the works
on this section (financed entirely by the Government) wili be completed
not later -than those on the Lagos--Ilorin section and that uniform standards
will be applied. North of the Niger, from Jebba to Kaduna, Zaria and. Kano,
the Al is in acceptable condition.
(ii)  Engineering-Supervision
4.0o5     Engineering for the Lagos-Inorin and the Lagos-Ewekoro roads has
been undertaken by the Ministry of Works and has been reviewed by the
consultants, Scott, Wilson, Kirkpatrick and Partners (IJ.Ko) The rehab:ili-
tation works will be supervised by the Ministry's own staff, with the
assistance of the same consultants. The consultants will assign an engineer
to the resident supervisory staff for each of the four proposed construction
contracts (para. 4.15).
(b)  Detailed Engineering of New Lagos-Ibadan Road (70 miles)
k.06      'Under Loan h26-UNI, consultants Scott, Wilson, Kirkpatrick and.
Partners (U.K.) carried out a feasibility study of a new road connection
between Lagos and Ibadan. and recommended the construction of a two-lane
road along a new alignment between the existing Al and A9, Provision was
also made In the same loan for the detailed engineering of about 20 miles
of this new road.  In accordance with the recommendation that the whole
length to Ibadan shouild be engineered at this time, it is proposed to
delete the partial detailed engineering from the 426-UNI project and make
prouis.in for the fiill engineering work under the pro^osed loan.
J.07      Construction oosts for this scheme are estimated at TL 5.7 million
(or US$230,000 per mile). According to the consultants, twqo additional
lanes~ *w-l , be requiredin 1078       T.+,a^een Lagon (Tke.2i) and Araromi (29 miles).
and in 1981 between Odo Ona and Ibadan (5.4 miles). The civil war has
delayed the, schedule for this pro-n'+. and the first two lanes of the new
road will not be in use before 1975. Two additional lanes will, therefore,
be req--red for the southern section of the road within three years and
total engineering costs will be lower if the design of the full four lanes
is          -4. out  o   s    1,,- e  o     +a-+n1rI eneiring will; there-

no studies have been made for the remaining parts of the road. The prepa-
ration of a master plan for the future development of the road between
Ibadan and Kaduna and northwards to the Niger border at Daura is therefore
included in the proposed project. Consultants will determine the best
alignment for an improved or a new road, including a connection through or
around Ibadan, and will make recommendations on the phasing of engineering
and construction.
4.09      A major issue for study will be the crossing of the Niger River,
which at present is via a combined rail and road bridge of low service
level and capacity at Jebba.
(ii) River Crossing at Niuman and Yola
4h10      The Government has proposed that studies be carried out to identify
possible improvements to the Benue River crossings at Numan and Yola. in the
northeast of the country. Present ferries give unsatisfactory service with
frequent delays. The prooosed investigations will be limited to identifving
the nature and magnitude of these problems, to forecasting development of
traffic on roads A), (Yola-Maiduguri) and A17 (Yola-Numan-Gombe), and to
broadly assessing possible improvements to the crossings.
B. Cost Estimates
4011      The estimates for the rehabilitation of Al and A9 are based on the
design and  ngineering data prepared by the Ministry of Works.  The   s .  -
mates have 'been reviewed by consultants Scott, Wilson, Kirkpatrick and
Partners and are considered satisfactory.

the rehabilitation works in the project, an allowance of 20, has been made
for unforeseen quantity increases. Moreover, a 5% allowance for increases
in foreign and local prices has been provided for all items of the project.

4.16      The Ministry of W4orks will supervise the rehabilitation works on
Al and A9. This is acceptable since supervision will be checked and con-
trolled by experienced consultants. Terms have been negotiated with Scott,
Wilson, Kirkpatrick and Partners, and the draft contract was reviewed and
agreed during negotiations.
4.17      A contract for the detailed engineering of a new Lagos-Ibadan road
will be negotiated with Scott, Wilson, Kirkpatrick and Partners, who carried
out the feasibility study. This arrangement is acceptable, and has been
confirmed during negotiations.
4.18      The feasibility study for the establishment of a master plan for
the road development between Ibadan and Daura, and the study of the river'
crossings at Numan and Yola will be carried out by consulting firms selected
in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. These procedures were
discussed during negotiations. The studies will take 18 to 24 months.

5.ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A, General
5r01      Road transport is of ever increasing importance in Nigeria. lnporta
have to be distributed in relatively small loadl to a large and widely dis-
persed population. Most of the exported goods have to be moved from thousajv3;
of small farms to official buiying stations or to processing mills from where
they travel in growing -proportion by road to the port of Lagos.

Nigeria-s agricultural exports, mainly ground-uts, cocoa, palm produce and
cotton, face conpetition from other producing countries as well as the
constant threat of substitution, and, low transport costs are, therefore,
of v vital- -inportance.
5.02      Trunk roads Al..,and A9 are of strategic importance in this transport
pattern*.-..Apart -from the imports consu-med directly in Lagos, all road tran-
port to and.from-the pott travels over these roads. All road connections
between the capital of Nigeria and the other centers of the country finall.'
converge in. these routes.
B.. Rehabilitation of Trunk Road Al Lagos-Tlorin
5.03      Trunk road Al (Map 1); linking.Lagos with lbadan, Ilorin, and
across- the 1iger with Kaduna and Kano, is the most important road in Nigeria,
In addition-to its importance for the produce evacuation from the north, tl.
road.links the biggest urban centers, namely, Lagos, Ibadan, Oyo, Ogbomosho
and nori   in -the southr with -KaduLna, Zaria and Kano in the north,  The metro-
politan -areas of Lagos -and Ibadlan, with about one million inhabitants each,
are,less than.100 miles apart ard generate considerable movements of passen-
-gers and goods, Lagos depends almost.-entirely on roads for moving the large
Mn--ntities of food.it needs,
5.014     In 196)..-the lTst year for which comrehensive figures are avail-
able,,.road traffic between Lagos and Ilorin was as follows:



- 16 -
Section                 Miles                ADT
Lagos.-Shagamu                42                  3,700
Shaganu-Ibadan                45                  2,300
Ibadan-Oyo                    33                  i,80u
Oyo-Ilorin                    66                  1,350
According -to consultants, Scott, Wilson, Kirkpatrick and Partners, the
traffic on the road is expected to increase at a minimum of 5g per year~,
leading to daily traffic densities of about 3,000 vehicles close to Ilorin
and about '7,000 vehicles between Lagos and Ode Remo in 1975.
5.05      Most parts of the road as far north as Jebba are in bad condition,
causing high transport costs.  During the heavy 1968 rainy season the s3c_
tion north of Ibadan became impassable at times, and it is expected t1hat -the
road will 'be closed frequently during the 1969 rains. IJp to 1966/67, a truck
could make about four return trips between Lagos and Kano each month; now
only two or three are possible.
5.06      Present difficulties do not stem only from lack of maintenance or
heavy rains. Most sections of the road have low standards of design an,1
alienment and have reached, or will soon reach, their capacity for handLing
traffic.  Feasibility studies for a new road from Lagos to Ibadan have been
completed (para. 4.06). and a master plan for the long term improvement of
the Ibadan-Daura section will be developed as part of this project (para.
14e08Y. Immediate relief is, however, essential, and the proposed rehabili-
tation works are, therefore, designed to provide rapid improvement of traffioi
conditi ons and to give breathing space for planning and implementing long
term solutions.
5.07      The rehabilitation of the Lagos-Ilorin road would generate economic
benefits, principally by reducing vehicle operating costs.  Given the high
traffic densities, the proposed project will generate significant benefits,
alt'hough. the road a ignment will not be improvede The economic life of the
rehabilitation works will be determined by the optimum timing for the imple-
mentation nf t+h  long term soluitions mentioned in para. 5.06 above.  Under
present conditions, these dates are difficult to estimate, and the rate of
return calcunation i8s therefore, co-nnuted- under various assumptions of
economic life of the project, ranging from 4 to 10 years for the individual
sections of the road.  The resilts are siim'arized below; details of the cost
and benefit calculations are given in Annex 2.

C. Rehabilitation of Trunk Road A9 Lagos-Ewekoro
5.08      Trunk Road A9 constitutes the main route from Lagos (Ikeja) to
Agege and Abeokuta (about 225,000 inhabitants), and to the large cement
works at Ewekoro (Map 1). It is also an alternative route to Ibadan and
provides access to the coastal road connecting Nigeria, via Dahomey and
Togo, with Ghana. The pavement of the Lagos (Ikeja)-Ewekoro section has
deteriorated rapidly,causing severe speed restrictions and high vehicle
operating costs.
5.09      In 1967, the average traffic was well above 2,000 vpd close to
Ikeja and about 1,400 at Ewekoro. Although the through traffic to Abeokuta
and lbadan will be diverted as soon as a new road is provided between Lagos
and Tbadan, average traffic is estimated to be at a minimum of 2,000 vpd
again by 1980. Assuming an economic life of the proposed rehabilitation
works of from eight to ten years, the economic return is expected to range
from 12 to 25% (detailA are given in Annex 2).
D. Detailed Engineering of a New Lagos-Ihadan Road
5.10      Consultants, Scott, 1ilson, KirL-atrick and Partners (U.K.), studiccd
the feasibility of improving either or both of the existing roads between
Lagos and Ibadan (Al and A9) or of constructing a new road (Iap 2) . The
existing roads have poor alignments and low traffic capacities, and the
consulS"tOnt  forecast that in normal circumstances most of Al wou-Id be over-
loaded befcre 1971. Several schemes for improving both roads were considered,
but those f'or A9 gave low rates of ret-n., larelr because of the extra
distance for through traffic between Lagos and Ibadan. The choice is, there-
fore, between ipVroving the existing Al 4'ron. IkeJa (on the ^11+cskirts of' a
to Ibadan and constructing a new road to modern design standards on a new
a±g.rixi1
a'L gnm,ent,
5.11      Looking well into the future, a road of motorway standards wil1 be
required and, whereas the existing Al could at best be developed to a dual
"a -purposel: road, a new two-lane road b-uilt to m1otorway standards of alig.-
ment could be developed later to a full motorway with limited access. The!
consultante recoiTn-end this solution, -which would yield an economc rate Of
return of 26%. If traffic grows as expected by the consultants, sectiorns of
the new road would need dualling between 1978 and 1981e
5.12      Tne feasibility study was completed before the o-utbreak of the;
hostilities, and the development of traffic volumes since that time is not;
kmown. Assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations
that it will observe and record the traffic developments in order to delter-
mine the optimum timing for this investment (para. 2.18).

6. RECOTIAENDATIOWS
6.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached with the Govermnent
on the following principal points:
(i) the restoration of an adequate system of road transport
data collection (para. 2.18), with special emphasis on
traffic counts on the Lagos-Ibadan road (para 54L');
(ii) a decision, as soon as practicable, in consultation with
the Bank on the future organi%ation and classification
of Nigeria's trunk road system (para. 3.10); and
(iii)  the satisfactory maintenance of the Federal road network
(para . 'A 11 
6.02      The proposed pro,Ject constitutes a sulitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$10.6 million. A term of 15 years, including a three-year period of
grace, would, on co-mtry grounds, be appropriate, although on thle basis of
the economic life of the project works a shorter term would be warranted,

1.        The following table summarizes traffic data and rehabilitation
costs for each section of the proJect.

* Including ph-yscal contingencies and engineering services,
excluding taxes.
2.        Road maintenance costs are assumed unaffected by the project
because neither the basic characteristics of the roads nor the traffic
densities will be affected by the rehabilitation works.
3.        Traffic is expected to grow at an annual rate of 5% on the Lagos-
Ode Remo section and 6' on the other sections of the project.   Based on 0-43
surveys the traffic on the Lagos-Ewekoro road is expected to decrease by
about 40% after apening of a new Lagos-lbadan road.
4.        Tne oconornic life of the project is determined by the technical
life of the rehabilitation works and, for the Lagos-Ode Remo and Ode Remo-
rbadan sections, by the opeUnxig uate of a .ew L  agos-badan road.  .To sets
of hypotheses have been used:

5.        Basic data onvehicle operating costs are given in Table 20 ire
unit savingts in operating costs to be generated by the rehabilitation works
are expectod to be lower than the figures shown in this table because tile
alignment of the existing roads will not be changed, and the paved carriage-
way will be widened only on the Ibadan-Ilorin section. Based on two hypo-
theses for savings in aDerating costs and taking into account differences in
traffic ccqmositicn on the various sections of the roads, the following ulit
savings were used for the rate of return calculation:
