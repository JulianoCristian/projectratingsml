sustainability,\n            substantial institutional development impact, and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and the Borrower.\n            Health sector reform progressed, the health delivery system\n            raised its performance, and the health status of the\n            population also improved.  The Program of Work (POW)\n            1997-2001 reached its objectives though not completely\n            attaining projected targets forecast in the initial\n            projections.  Lessons Learned included: good governance,\n            continuity, and sustained commitment of both the Borrower\n            and its partners are important; donor coordination is a\n            difficult task that requires negotiating skills, recognition\n            of technical merits, presence in the field, and leadership;\n            partnership should be inclusive, not limited to a core group\n            of external partners; prerequisites of successful\n            implementation include testing before launching innovative\n            sector-wide operations, capacity-building at all levels,\n            early finalization of procedures, and agreement between the\n            Government and partners; supply-based services need matching\n            demand-raising activities; monitoring indicators must be\n            developed to continuously assess progress toward reaching\n            developmental objectives and make timely decisions;\n            appropriate indicators and planning of data collection to\n            provide the required information for monitoring and\n            evaluation at mid-term and project closing are important; it\n            could be more beneficial to produce an ICR prior to the\n            design of follow-up projects; and frequent external and\n            quality assessment reviews could prevent or help quickly\n            overcome difficulties arising from the implementation of a\n            new approach/lending instrument."}, "docdt": "2003-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
