Although Ghana made remarkable progress in the 1990s, particularly in comparison with the rest
of Africa, the health status of Ghanaians remained poor. The country had the advantage of one
of Africa’s more advanced health systems, but coverage was far from adequate to meet the
population’s needs.




- The Health Sector Support Project helped the government of Ghana implement its medium-term
health strategy, “Towards Vision 2020.”
- Project provided an innovative sector-wide approach focusing on Ministry of Health
reorganization and public health planning.




The Ministry of Health was reorganized and health services became more accessible –
helping to improve the provision of health care for ordinary Ghanaians.


Highlights:
- 98 percent of pregnant women now receive ante-natal care.
- Geographic accessibility to health services has increased: in addition to rehabilitating existing
infrastructure, there are now 2 new district hospitals and 11 health centers upgraded to district
hospitals, 126 new health centers, and 3 new regional hospitals.
- Provision of round-the-clock services was introduced in hospitals and primary health care
services were improved. The continuous supply of essential drugs led to 95-100 percent drug
availability at district level.
- Outpatient visits per capita rose from 0.39 in 1996 to 0.49 in 2001. Portion of births attended by
skilled health staff rose from 38 percent to 50 percent. Polio immunization rate increased from 49
percent in 1996 to 98 percent in 2001.
- Decentralization of decision-making to regional and district management teams was
strengthened through funding, training, and equipment.




- US$34.2 million from 1997 to 2002.
- Provided policy guidance—in partnership with other bilateral and multilateral agencies—to help
Ghana reform its health sector.
- IDA initiated what was at the time an innovative sector-wide approach—now used frequently—
after an analysis of the health situation in the sector. It raised awareness among other donors
about the need for comprehensive change. This was a major departure from business-as-usual.
Development and planning involved numerous partners who shared developmental objectives
but had different procedures.
- IDA channeled resources to the health sector through a common Health Fund, shared with
other development partners. IDA also contributed technical support, particularly in financial
management and the development of a trustworthy procurement system on behalf of all
contributing partners.




Many partners were involved in shoring up Ghana’s health reform program, including various UN
agencies, Denmark, the EC, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States.




- Infant, child and maternal mortality rates are stagnating –underlining the need to increase
interventions to meet MDG targets.
- A follow-up IDA credit is bringing about US$90 million to the health sector. Other foreign
sources are expected to contribute US$325 million and the government of Ghana US$638
million, with the total estimated program cost for five years at US$1,113 million.
- The preparation of the Bank’s follow-up project provided the opportunity to update and adjust
some of the Bank procedures (in particular in areas of procurement and financial management).
