“(c) “operating costs” means the incremental costs arising under the 
Project for the 
PCU, on account of salaries for contractual staff (including 
social security and medical 
expenditures) and travel allowances; the 
purchase of two vehicles and office equipment, and 
their subsequent operation and 
maintenance; selective document acquisition; maintenance 
services; utilities 
and communication charges, and reasonable Bank charges connected to 
special Account management.”
All provisions of the Agreement, except as amended herein, shall remain in full 
force and effect.
