Key lessons\n            convey that prospects for privatization of transport\n            services (even in difficult economic times) may succeed in\n            rail, road maintenance, and air transport service instances,\n            due to their high potential to operate commercially;\n            however, urban transport, particularly if under highly\n            subsidized services, would be especially difficult to\n            privatize. Furthermore, the human and financial resources\n            constraints faced by low-income countries in establishing\n            regulatory agencies may prove difficult; but Burkina's\n            policy of retaining minority ownership, may prove a suitable\n            substitute, if any temporarily. Once the privatization\n            process is launched, the government and co-financiers should\n            work in parallel to plan, and assist in the restructuring of\n            central government agencies, a role likely to change for\n            agencies after privatization; thus, the Bank should seek\n            financing in a flexible way, in order to reallocate funding\n            as needed toward technical assistance. Countries should\n            select measurement techniques for road conditions - an\n            appropriate outcome indicator of road programs - taking into\n            consideration both capital and recurrent high costs of\n            measuring road conditions."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
