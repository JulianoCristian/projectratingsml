STUDY", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project outcome is rated\n            satisfactory, with a likely sustainability and substantial\n            institutional development impacts. The particularly strong\n            performance by the Bank, during supervision, and the reforms\n            achieved - exceeding expectations - is assessed as highly\n            satisfactory, and, the Borrower's performance, given\n            the successful privatization, is rated satisfactory. Key\n            lessons address particularly, the potential difficulties in\n            achieving institutional, or other types of reform, where a\n            flexible supervision can make a difference: this project\n            supervision missions opted for privatization, rather than\n            restructuring parastatals, which evolved into profound, and\n            sustainable results. In addition, experience in performance\n            contracts for improving parastatal agencies efficiency, has\n            demonstrated that incentives, and political will is often\n            lacking in this type of reform, regardless of well conceived\n            plans. But preservation of road assets should be focused on\n            periodic maintenance, to avoid funding uneconomic projects;\n            i.e., road investment plans should prioritize maintenance,\n            ranking investments in accordance with the expected internal\n            rate of return (IRR). However, the lack of structured, donor\n            coordination proved vulnerable to the objections on road\n            maintenance finance at the economic criteria standards\n            agreed upon, a factor which would have greatly benefited\n            funding. It is suggested that Sector Investment Programs be\n            considered, if there is enough leverage to deepen\n            institutional development reforms, and, provided performance\n            indicators are linked to donor financing."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
