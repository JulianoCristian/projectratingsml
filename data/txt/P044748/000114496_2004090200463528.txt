Dear Mr. Sidorskiy: 
 
Re:  Belarus Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project 
(7056-BY) - 
 Amendment to Loan Agreement  
 
I
refer to the Loan Agreement for the Belarus Social Infrastructure Retrofitting 
Project dated September 26, 2001 between the Republic of Belarus (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank). I also refer to the letter 
of Mr. Victor Fedoseev, First Deputy Chairman, State Committee on Energy Efficiency 
dated June 4, 2002 requesting: (i) an introduction of a one-stage (as opposed to a two-stage) 
bidding procedure for the procurement of goods for the rehabilitation of heat control systems; 
(ii) a switch from the quarterly Project Management Reporting (PMR) to the Financial 
Management Reporting (FMR); and (iii) a change of the name of the Committee on energy 
efficiency to reflect its new name.     
 
After further discussions with the staff of the Project Management Unit, I am pleased 
to inform you that the Bank has agreed to amend the Loan Agreement as follows: 
 
1.         Article IV, section 4.02 (a) and (b) have been amended to read as follows: 
 
“Section 4.02. (a) Without limitation to the Borrower’s reporting obligations, the 
Borrower shall prepare and furnish to the Bank a financial monitoring report (FMR) covering 
the semi-annual periods of January 1– June 30, and July 1-December 31 of each year, in form 
and substance satisfactory to the Bank, which: 
(i)  
sets forth sources and uses of funds for the Project, both cumulatively and for 
the period covered by said report, showing separately funds provided under the 
Loan, and explains variances between the actual and planned uses of  such 
funds;

(ii) 
describes physical progress in Project implementation, both cumulatively and 
for the period covered by said report, and explains variances between the actual
 
and planned Project implementation; and 
(iii)  
sets forth the status of procurement under the Project, as at the end of the 
period covered by said report. 
(b) The first FMR shall be furnished to the Bank not later than 45 days after the first 
yearly reporting period after the Effectiveness Date of the loan, and thereafter, each 
FMR shall be furnished to the Bank not later than 45 days after December 31 and June 
30 each year.”   
 
2.  
Article 1, Section 1.02 (g) is hereby amended to read as follows: 
 
“
“Committee on Energy Efficiency” means the Energy Efficiency Committee under 
the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus established in accordance with a 
Decree of the President of Belarus No. 516, dated September 24, 2001.” 
 
3. 
Schedule 3, part B, clause 2b is hereby deleted and clause 2(c) is hereby renamed (2) 
(b). 
4.     The table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 (
Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the 
Loan
)
is amended as set forth in the Attachment hereto. 
All other terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, as amended hereby shall remain 
in full force and effect. Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment on behalf 
of the Borrower, by signing, dating and returning to us the attached copy of this Amendment 
Letter.  Upon receipt by the Bank of the copy of this Amendment Letter countersigned by 
you, the amendment will become effective as of the date of countersignature.
