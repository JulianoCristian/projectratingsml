1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country Background: BelarUs was a middle income country in 1999, with a population of about
10.2 million and a per capita income ofUS$2,450 equivalent. The Bank had not lent to Belarus
since 1994 due to slow progress on economic reforms. The Government's reform strategy (1997)
emphasized the restoration of economic growth while giving high priority to social protection and
conserving energy and other natural resources; the primary emphasis of the country's economic
progr8.m had been to insulate the population from difficult reform adjustments, resulting in an
extensive program of directed and subsidized credits for designated sectors and deferred
privatization and liberalization policies, along with an overvalued and unsustainable rate of
exchange and severe distortions in the real sector. This environment led to a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between the Bank and the Government in July 1997, but it subsequently
became clear that Government could not implement the provisions of the MOU. When the
Government of Belarus requested the preparation of a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for FY99, the lack of progress in MOU implementation led the Bank to set a single but strict
condition - exchange rate unification - as a trigger for any future lending. The unification of the
exchange. rate in September 2000, met the 1999 CAS trigger and allowed the Bank to proceed
with preparation of the Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project.

Social Sector Background: The health and education subsectors suffered from a lack of funds,
while energy was wasted in heating and lighting poorly designed and maintained facilities -
resources that could be used for more direct sector. purposes such as books, medicines and
equipment. The habitability, and functioning of social sector buildings were impaired by poorly
balanced and unstable thermal environments which interfered with the learning and healing
missions. of these facilities.    Lighting levels and lighting output characteristics were below
rudimentary standards and caused eyestrain and irritation. The poor ambient environment in
hospitals (lack of appropriate heat and hot water) impeded healing and contributed to longer or
return visits. The poor condition of heating and lighting in schools affected the delivery of
educational services, which was reflected in high absenteeism among students and teachers due to
sicknesses, and in an environment that reduced the capacity of teachers and students to perform
daily activities. Billing and tariff policies were disadvantageous to institutions operating under
state and local budgets, including social sector institutions, which cross-subsidized residential
customers indiscriminately.                                                  .

Energy Sector Background: Belarus has made significant efforts to reduce energy intensity and
improve efficiency since the mid. 1990s. The achieved results were encouraging; energy intensity
had declined from about 0.76 tonne of oil equivalent (toe) per dollar of GDP in the mid 1990s to
about 0.50 tonne of oil equivalent (toe) per dollar of GDP in 2000. The remarkable decrease in
energy intensity in Belarus since the mid 1990s occurred partly because of structural shifts in the
economy away from Soviet-era infrastructure, which was becoming obsolete, and partly because
of the government's active role in improving energy efficiency of the industrial and public sectors.
The systematic energy efficiency improvement measures in Belarus were initiated by the creation
of the Committee for Energy Efficiency (currently the Energy Efficiency Department (EED) of
the Committee for Standardization) in 1996. Between 1996 and 2000, the Government invested



                                              1
US$370 million in energy saving activities, focusing mainly on the installation of metering
devices, design of new energy saving materials and technologies, boiler rehabilitation and
replacement of old heat boilers with more efficient ones. The Government evaluated the program,
determined it was successful and extended it for the next five years, in a 2001-2005 Energy
Savings Program.

Rationale for Bank Assistance: The Bank's involvement in an investment project in Belarus at
that time was expected to strengthen the dialogue between· the Government and the Bank on
important social and energy sector issues. It was also intended to pave the way to strengthen the
ongoing dialogue on more elaborate structural and macro issues. It was important that the first
intervention ·by the Bank, after years of non-lending to Belarus, addressed the social sector and
delivered measurable impact to demonstrate the benefits of cooperation in an area where both the
Government and the Bank agreed on the need for action. The project provided the funds
necessary to support much-needed. energy saving investments in the social sector and was
expected to lay the foundation through participation and a public information campaign, to
increase awareness among the population of the needs and benefits of energy savings in Belarus.
The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (December 1998) identified the social and energy
sectors as potential areas of cooperation, given sufficient commitment on the part of the
Government, and required that low-case scenario projects should have ecoIiomic and social
benefits that were robust even in an uncertain macroeconomic and structural environment. In this
context, physical improvements in social sector facilities, focusing on reducing energy
consumption and improving functional and ambient health conditions, were seen as appropriate.
The Bank undertook an energy sector review in April 1995, which was updated in 1998, and
again in November 2000, and used in preparation of this project. The Government had already.
initiated a program for energy efficiency and had requested Bank assistance in introducing the
social sector explicitly into the existing high visil>ility program. Such assistance was seen to have
the potenti81 to directly benefit the social sector, provide the fiscal and economic benefits already
demonstrated in similar activities in neighboring countries and provide support for an eventual
country dialogue on the social and energy sectors. At the time, the Bank had experience in
addressing energy efficiency problems of Soviet-design structures and with implementing
projects in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), including the Russian Federation Enterprise Housing
Divestiture Project (approved May 1996), the Lithuania Energy EfficiencylHousing Pilot Project
(approved July 1996), and the Ukraine Kiev Public Buildings Energy Efficiency Project
(approved January 2000), as well as sector work on energy efficiency using case studies from
Estonia, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The project's development objective was to improve the functional and health environments of
social sector facilities, with particular emphasis on reducing energy consumption. The project
would retrofit social sector facilities to encourage a more effective use of resources, reducing
operations and maintenance costs in schools, medical and other selected social facilities such as
orphanages, and community homes for the elderly and the disabled.

The key indicators, taken from Annex 1 of the PAD arid Supplemental Letter No. 2 on
Monitoring Indicators (September 26,2001), were:
   • Social indicators: reduction in school absenteeism; other health indicators;


                                              2
    •   Number of schools rehabilitated and surface area (m2), number of beneficiaries (children,
        teachers, administrators);
    •   Number of hospitals/clinics rehabilitated, surface area (m2), number of beneficiaries
        (patients, medical personnel, administrators);
    •   Volume and value of energy saved;
    •   Increased seminars and participation of beneficiaries during project implementation;
    •   Environmental indicators (reduction in hazardous gas emissions, increase in local fuels
        ~~.                                                                         .

1.3 Revised PD~ (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The Project Development Objective was not revised. Key outcome indicator targets were not
quantified at appraisal in January 2000, but were listed without any target values. One project
outcome indicator (school absenteeism) was eliminated during project implementation, a;fter
discussions between the Bank and the government, as it would have been difficult to attribute to
the Project. The key indicator end of project targets were revised when the Additional Financing
was approved by the Board on December 4, 2007, to cover a cost overrun and to scale up the
project. The revised key indicator targets were as follows:
    • Number of beneficiaries: 200,000
    • Total amount of energy saved in MWh/year: 114,900
    • Number of buildings retrofitted under the Project: 717
    • Number of heat substations renovated: 541
    • Number of boiler houses renovated: 44
    • Number of buildings with lighting improvements: 301
    • Number of buildings with window replacements: 38
    • Number of demonstration sites: 8

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary beneficiaries of the Project would be the users of the social sector facilities: students,
teachers, patients, orphans, the elderly and disabled, and administrators and employees of the
institutions receiving energy efficiency improvements. They would benefit from a better learning,
healing and working environment because of a more balanced and stable thermal environment, as
well as better lighting.

Secondary beneficiaries would be regional and municipal governments and sector institutions
who would benefit from the savings generated by reduced energy costs. A sharing protocol was
created to outline how these savings should be channeled back to the health and education sectors
to meet essential needs such as equipment, supplies and employee training.
Benefits would also be generated in the form of temporary employment opportunities due to
project activities estimated by the Project Management Unit (PMU) at 137,000 person days. The
project would also introduce competitive contracting procedures and opportunities for
collaboration with international contractors and suppliers, to expose local contractors, equipment
manufacturers and material industries to new and improved standards in energy efficiency
measures and competition within and outside of Belarus.




                                               3
Buildings would be selected in all regions of Belarus and the city of Minsk; the majority of these
would receive basic improvements that have been shown to have substantial
environmental/functional impact and that would have a fast pay-back and high cost-benefit ratio.
In addition· to such low cost interventions, demonstration sites (at least one in each of the six
regions of Belarus· and the city of Minsk) would be retrofitted with more extensive energy saving
measures to demonstrate the benefits of a complete energy efficiency retrofit.

1.S Original Components
The Project consisted of two components as follows:

Component 1: Energy Retrofitting in Schools and Medical Facilities, and Associated
Supply Side Improvements (USS38.75 million)
This component would include: building envelope and heating system improvements as well as
conversion or replacement of individual autonomous boilers which served the buildings to be
improved. Boiler conversions would include conversion from oil, electricity or coal to gas, and
would pilot the use of local, renewable fuels, such as wood chips. Rehabilitation of limited
portions of the District Heating Networks (DHN), where deemed necessary to capture savings at
the heat production source would also be included. The investment retrofitting component of the
Proj~ct would be based on three options for the packaging of energy efficiency measures, which
would be applied to selected buildings according to technical and economic needs as determined
by energy audits.
   •    Option A: A combination of substation temperature control and/or boiler replacement at
        the level of the building, radiator niche thermal treatment and lighting. This option would
        include low-cost measures that deliver high comfort and savings benefit and was expected
       to comprise about 70 percent of the total physical investment cost.
   •   Option B: Option A, plus window replacement or refurbishing and roof insulation and
       renovation. The additional measures in this option would be included in cases where there
       was obvious need to limit the deteriorating state of windows and roofs in order to ensure
       maximum energy savings in the building and preservation of the investment, expected to
       be about 10% of the total physical investment.
   •   Option C: Full thermal rehabilitation, i.e. Option B with wall insulation. This option
       would be applied on a selective basis to demonstrate potential additional savings and
       structural improvements and was limited due to the relatively higher costs of wall
       insulation, expected to be about 10 percent of the total physical investment.
  •    DHN: Rehabilitation and insulation of district heating pipes (total about 30km) and
       insulation of automatic temperature controls in associated "group" stations, which would
       serVe the buildings in which energy savings measures would be undertaken. This would
       ensure that the savings realized in the buildings would also be reflected in reduced energy
       usage in the district heating network by minimizing losses in the system. This was
       expected to represent about 10 percent of the physical investment.

Between 480-500 public buildings were expected to be retrofitted to improve the functional and
health environments of schools and hospitals, with particular emphasis on reducing energy
consumption.




                                              4
Component 2: Technical Assistance (US$I.45 million)

This component would include funding for technical and financial audits, continuation of the
public awareness campaign begun under the PPF, training for PMU staff and financing for studies
and workshops. The studies would: (a) investigate the fiscal and social impact of the current
energy sector policies, the economic costs to Belarus of continuing to support complicated tariff
and subsidy policies, and the benefits of introducing more market oriented mechanisms; and (b)
review and improve environmental emission standards of wood-fueled boilers to align them with
European standards. The social surveys and public awareness campaigns were expected to
increase participation of beneficiaries and disseminate the value of energy saving measures. The
tariff and subsidy study was intended to pave the way for dialogue between the Governrilent and
the Bank on critical energy sector policy issues.

1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised during implementation. However, targets for the outcome
indicators covering the number of buildings to be retrofitted were revised under the Additional
Financing.

1.7 Other significant changes
An amendment to the Loan Agreement was approved by the Country Director on February 26,
2003, to allow one stage bidding instead of two stage bidding for the rehabilitation of heat control
systems, to change from quarterly Project Management Reporting (PMRs) to semi-annual
Financial Management Reporting (FMRs) and to change the name of the Committee on Energy
Efficiency to the Energy Efficiency Department to reflect the name change.

The Closing Date was extended from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, together with a
reallocation of funds to transfer funds from the Unallocated category to the Goods and Works
categories. The Closing Date of the original project was extended by an additional three months
to March 31, 2008, to allow completion of the final contract.

Rehabilitation of district heating pipes was not financed from the Bank loan, but from local
energy efficiency funds. The study to improve environmental emission standards of wood-fueled
boilers, initially intended to be financed under the loan, was instead financed by the PHRD
Climate Change Grant, as was the feasibility study and development of technical specifications
for, and construction of a biomass-fired boiler house in the Borovlyany-Lesnoy hospital complex
(construction financed both by the PHRD grant and by the Project).

An Additional Loan ofUS$15 million was approved by the Board on December 4,2007, to cover
a cost overrun of about US$6 million, due to higher than estimated bid prices on energy
efficiency improvements due to the strong Euro and increases in wages in Belarus, and to scale up
energy efficiency activities in about 140 additional buildings. At that time the Closing Date was
extended to December 31, 2010, to allow time to complete the activities financed by the
Additional Loan. Although the project development objective was not changed, the key indicator
end of project targets were revised to reflect the scale up under the Additional Loan.        The
original loan was fully disbursed and closed on March 31, 2008. The Additional Loan was also
fully disbursed and closed on December 31,2010.

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
 2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
 Project Preparation. The project was well prepared. Although a small amount of budget was
 expended in FYs 96 and 97, project identification began in FY98. At the time of project
 preparation, World Bank experience in Belarus was limited.· Two projects had closed in FY97
 and FY98, and there was only one ongoing project, which was to close in June 2001.
 Implementation experience on the three projects had been mixed, but had usually been
 satisfactory after slow starts.

 Soundness of Background Analysis: Sufficient diagnostic work had been done prior to the
 design of the project. The Bank completed a Belarus energy sector review in April 1995, updated
 in 1998 and again in November 2000, which was used in the preparation of the Project. The
 Bank began with a Project Preparation Facility advance (PPF) of US$1 million (P3400) approved
 in February 1998, to finance pilot energy efficiency investment activities in Minsk, public
 awareness campaigns and a social survey. The public awareness campaign was undertaken by a
 local NGO to raise stakeholder knowledge and participation in energy saving measures. The
 campaign was successful in targeting users of educational facilities, including staff,
 administrators and particularly students. The campaign also addressed public officials and was
 disseminated through school billboards and TV and radio announcements to the rest of the
 population. A social assessment was undertaken during project appraisal to verify the benefits
 perceived by the project beneficiaries and officials and to learn from good practices under the
 PPF and to avoid pitfalls, to incorporate the experience into the project and to devise monitoring
 indicators for the project.    A PHRD Grant.(TF 25129) was approved in November 1998 to
 finance pilot energy efficiency activities in schools and hospitals, launch a media campaign to
 increase public awareness of the need for energy conservation, review billing and collections
 systems, and provide assistance in preparation of tender documents for the Project. The Project
 Management Unit (PMU) was established in 1998 and gained experience in implementing Bank
 financed projects under the PPF advance and the PHRD Grant, which greatly facilitated project
 implementation.

 Assessment of Project Design. The project design was simple and well focused. The project
 was designed to target issues of immediate concern to the government by aiming to deliver long-
 term tangible benefits to socially vulnerable parts of the population and addressing a: priority
 problem, the high dependence on energy imports, combined with a wasteful energy-consuming
 infrastructure. The Bank's decision not to directly address energy pricing and subsidy issues
 under this first project in the sector was appropriate within the country context and the level of the
 Bank's relationship and dialogue with the country. However, the project included studies to (i)
 analyze the fiscal and social impact of energy sector policies, economic costs of continuing
 complicated tariffs and subsidy policies, and benefits from market oriented mechanisms and (ii)
 review and improve environmental emission standards of wood fueled boilers to ensure their
 alignment with European standards.

. Government Commitment.        Government commitment to the Project and the Project
  Development Objective was substantial, from the beginning of project preparation throughout
  implementation. The project was designed in response to a high-level Government request and



                                                6
complemented Government's various energy savings programs starting from 1995 and continuing
through 2015. The Project-supported activities were part of the Government's much larger
energy efficiency program. Stakeholders (national ministries and agencies, oblast authorities, and
administrators of the schools and medical centers) were closely involved in the selection of
buildings and improvements· and in implementation of project activities.

Quality at Entry. Although the Bank had minimal experience in Belarus, it had considerable
experience in addressing energy efficiency problems of Soviet-design structures and with
implementing projects in the Former Soviet Union, and the lessons learned from these projects
were taken into·account. The Bank study entitled "Investments to Improve the Energy Efficiency
of Existing Residential Buildings in Countries of the Former Soviet Union" (September 1997)
analyzed the technical, economic and fiscal rational for investments in energy efficiency with
case studies from Estonia, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The report concluded
that large opportunities existed for energy efficiency improvements with attractive financial and
economic returns. The Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project incorporated the lessons learned
from the Lithuania Energy Efficiency Housing Pilot Project and the Ukraine Kiev Public
Buildings Energy Efficiency Project in terms of technology used under similar climatic
conditions in virtually identical building systems. Both projects provided assurances that the
rates of return of the various energy efficiency measures were high enough to justify the
investment.

The November 2008 Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio (QALP) final report rated
quality of design as satisfactory.

 Risk Assessment. Risks were accurately assessed as moderate during preparation/appraisal, and ,
 adequate measures were put in place to mitigate the risks. The risk of consolidation in the health
 and education sectors leading to closure of facilities did not materialize as selected buildings were
 in. oblast centers where utilization was high, and there was a continuous dialogue between the
 Bank and the health and education ministries, the PMU and the oblast authorities to verify the .
future of the selected buildings. The risk of selection of buildings inconsistent with project
 objectives was mitigated by agreed selection criteria set out in the PAD and in the Operational
Manual and close coordination by the PMU, monitoring by the Bank and participation of the
 stakeholders. The third risk that the framework for sharing savings would not be implemented
was mitigated by close coordination by the PMU and monitoring by the Bank, and frequent
discussions with the government and stakeholders at the oblast level. The risk that operations and
maintenance of the newly installed equipment/renovated buildings would be problematic
materialized during implementation but was resolved after training by the suppliers was included
in the contracts and the oblast authoritie.s accepted responsibility for the maintenance, using some
of the funds generated by energy savings as a result of the Project. The risk of capacity of local
contractors (very small number of qualified local bidders and limited interest of international
bidders) materialized and was satisfactorily resolved· by the Bank team and PMU holding
workshops and discussions with local contractors and revising clauses in the bidding documents
to make them more accessible for local contractors. One risk arose during implementation which
was not envisaged at appraisal: a temporary lack of counterpart funds during most of 2007,
which delayed the Project by about 9 months, but was eventually resolved satisfactorily.




                                               7
2.2 Implementation
Project changes were discussed in Section 1.1 Significant Changes.
There was a long, initial delay in procuring the design/supervision consultancy contract, and the
Government used its own funds to initiate work in Minsk in about 40 percent of the sites
identified for project financing in order to expedite the installation of essential heat and energy
efficiency equipment in schools and hospitals. This is further evidence of Government's strong
commitment to implementing its energy saving program.

A related Japanese PHRD Climate Change Grant (TF 25129) was approved in 2003 to finance
technical assistance, including a study to review and improve environmental emission standards
of wood~fueled boilers to ensure their alignment with European'standards as well as studies and
tender documents for and the installation of the first biomass fueled boiler at the Lesnoy boiler
house for the Borovlyany-Lesnoy hospital complex.

The mid-term review in December 2004 contributed to the successful outcome of the Project by
recommending actions to: (a) expedite procurement (r~ducing the size of contracts so that more
bidders were able to qualify, increasing the number of staff of the design consultants, clarifying
the language and terms in the bidding documents, 'etc.); (b) strengthen coordination with local
governments and ( c) better manage the process of selection of sites to avoid delays. It raised the
issue of using old Soviet design standards and norms, which usually led to excess capacity design
and higher investment costs, as compared to design based on actual demand. An additional rapid
social assessment was done as part of the mid-term review. It confirmed the need for improved
energy efficiency measures· in social institutions and the contribution of a warmer and better
lighted environment to the well being of residents and users of such institutions. Operation and
maintenance of the newly installed equipment was mentioned by some focus groups as a problem
at some sites, given the considerable turnover of maintenance personnel at the sites. In Minsk, a
local maintenance organization was engaged to ensure repair and maintenance of the sites, and
this solution was replicated in the oblasts.

Counterpart funding was delayed in 2007 because the source of the counterpart funds was
changed, which caused a delay in completion of the final contract under the original loan because
the local portion of the contract (40 percent) could not be paid in a timely manner. Counterpart
funding was provided on time after September 2007, and all the works under the original loan
were completed by March 31, 2008.

Transfer of the Bank's procurement review functions from headquarters to a Moscow-based
Russian speaking procurement accredited staff had a positive impact in terms of making contacts
between the Borrower and the Bank easier and more frequent.

Implementation of the physical investments under the project was satisfactory. The number of
buildings retrofitted with energy saving measures was higher than estimated. The amount of
annual megawatt hours saved was higher.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design. The Project included adequate development and outcome indicators to assess
progress in meeting the project development objective and intermediate results. The project



                                              8
 development indicators (as revised under the Additional Financing) were: improved functional
 and health environments in social sector facilities with particular emphasis on reducing energy·
 consumption, monitored by the number of beneficiaries and the estimated megawatt hours/year of
 energy savings. Intermediate results indicators were: number of buildings rehabilitated, number
 of boiler houses and substations rehabilitated, number of buildings with lighting improvements,
 number of buildings with window replacements and number of demonstration sites. The main
 shortcoming of the results framework was that the baseline and end of project targets were not
 quantified in the PAD or Supplemental Letter for the original Loan, but were developed and
 revised over time in the various ISRS during implementation. Also, the purely social indicators
 (reduction in absenteeislll, improved health indicators, increased participation) were not
 quantified and were difficult to monitor and to attribute solely to the Project.

M&E Implementation. The PMU regularly collected data concerning the indicators, and the
actual figures were compared to the target values developed during implementation and were
available to the Bank and the Government in the Project Progress Reports prepared by the PMU
on a semi-annual basis. Energy audits were done in each of the facilities before rehabilitation, so
that savings after the completion of energy efficiency measures could be calculated.

M&E Utilization. M&E findings have been used by local and regional authorities as well as by
the Energy Efficiency Department of the State Standardization Committee for decision-making
when planning energy efficiency investments. Beneficiary institutions calculated the cost of
energy used before and after the energy efficiency improvements.

  2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial Management:        Throughout the project, a satisfactory financial management system
  was maintained by the PMU, which submitted quarterly fmancial monitoring reports and annual
  audit reports to the Bank. There was a small delay in receipt of audit reports in 2008 and 2009,
  but the audit reports were received and were acceptable to the Bank. There were some
. deficiencies in disbursement management procedures near the end of the project, as a result of
  staff turnover.

Procurement: Procurement under the project was conducted in compliance with the applicable
Guidelines, provisions of the Loan Agreement and agreed procurement plan. All contracts~
concluded under the project were subject to the Bank's prior review..Procurement supervision
was performed by the Bank procurement specialist during regular project supervision missions,
including physical inspection of contracts, observed availability and high quality of goods, works
and materials, procured by the Borrower under the project.

Environment: The project was subject to the Bank's OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and
was rated Category B. During implementation there were no environmental issues raised, and the
Environmental Management Plan was followed by the PMU, including the removal of hazardous
mat~rials in the repair and rehabilitation work, and safety, noise and other pollution issues during
the construction period. The Bank's environmental specialist confirmed compliance with the
Environmental Management Plan during site visits.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Energy efficiency efforts are expected to continue, since energy efficiency and energy savings are
part of Belarus' national energy savings program. The Directive of the President of the Republic
of Belarus No.3 dated June 14,2007 "Resource Saving and Efficient Management are the Key
Factors of Economic Security of the Country" and the Decree of the President of the Republic of
Belarus No. 433 dated September 17, 2007 "On Energy Security Concept of the Republic of
Belarus" set the task to reduce GDP energy intensity by 50 percent in 2015, compared to 2005,
and to increase the share of local fuel and energy resources in the fuel mix up to 25 percent by
2012. "The "Strategy of Belarus' Energy Potential Development" dated August 9, 2010, calls for
increasing the share of local fuel and energy resources in the fuel mix up to 28-30 percent by
2015.

The Project Management Unit (PMU) established in RUE BIES has adequate capacity for the
implementation of projects and is staffed with knowledgeable personnel, who have attended
training and workshops organized by the Bank and have improved professional skills in financial
management and procurement of goods, works and services. RUE BIES will continue
implementation of energy efficiency projects which will be financed from both the government
budget and commercial sources.

RUE BIES intends to establish a monitoring system for surveying the facilities retrofitted under
the Government program "before" and "after" the interventions, in order to measure the key
energy efficiency indicators such as: (i) achieved. savings in boiler furnace fuel, heat and power;
reduction of expenditures on procurement of energy inputs and maintenance of facilities; and
calculation of the project payback period.

All of the upgraded facilities rehabilitated under the Project have been transferred to their current
accountable owners. The upgraded facilities are public buildings, which are government
institutions. Post-warranty preventive and routine maintenance of the upgraded facilities is
funded out of the government budget. The funds are assigned .to the institution in general, and the
management of the institution then allocates the funds to the needs of the organization.

'Based on the successful outcome of the Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project, two additional
 Bank-financed Projects were approved and are ongoing: the Post-Chemobyl Recovery Project
 (approved April 18, 2006), designed to implement the same type of energy efficiency measures in
 social buildings in the Chernobyl affected area, and the Energy Efficiency Project (approved May
 28, 2009), designed to improve energy efficiency in heat and power generation in selected towns
in Belarus.                                                                                    .

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objective to improve the functional and health environment of social sector facilities, with
particular emphasis on reducing energ¥" consumption was and continues to be highly relevant to
Belarus' priorities. The Government of .Belarus realizes the importance of energy efficiency
measures as a tool to reduce energy intensiveness and dependency on energy import and at the
same time improve the heating and lighting service quality inside buildings. The project is also




                                              10
 consistent with the Bank's current (FY08-11) Country Assistance Strategy for Belarus and
 continues to support the Government's energy efficiency program under the Global Goods pillar.

 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
 The Project Development Objective has been met, and most end of project targets have been
 exceeded. With energy savings of 243,300 MWh/year,the Project has fulfilled the higher order
 outcome of reducing Belarus' dependence on imported energy. Outcomes include: (i) decreased
 energy consumption, (ii) improved heating services for social sector buildings and improved
 beneficiary satisfaction and (iii) reduced environmental emissions. Most of the end of project
 targets for the output indicators were exceeded (see Annex 2). The eight demonstration sites in
 Minsk and the Project Qblasts serve as an example of the complete range of energy efficiency
.improvements. Funds saved through improved energy efficiency measures are used to meet the
 priority needs of the social facilities.   Energy efficiency measures in schools, hospitals and
 social buildings had a positive impact on the environment and led to a significant reduction in
 greenhouse gas emissions (estimated at a reduction of about 52,000 tons of C02 emissions). The
 hospitals and schools that were retrofitted with energy efficiency improvements now provide a
 warm, comfortable environment for healing, working, or learning. In schools with lighting
 improvements luminosity has increased from 200-300 lux before the Project to more than 500 lux,
 and at the same time there has been a 15 percent saving in electricity consumed.

 Examples of Energy Efficiency Results: In one of the demonstration sites, Gomel State
 Vocational College of National Artistic Trades, heat consumption decreased by about 50 percent .
and electricity consumption decreased by about 60 percent as a result of the Project investments~
Most single energy saving measures resulted in savings of 15-20 percent, compared to the savings
at demonstration sites. The IBRD Loans constituted about 36 percent of the energy efficiency
improvements in the Gomel Oblast; the Oblast Education Department· analyzed data from 10
schools where energy efficiency measures were financed by the Bank and found that the average
indoor temperature increased from 16 to 20° Celsius. School absences related to sickness were
reduced by one third, and schools were able to regulate power consumption by reducing heat
levels during vacation periods. At Uzda District Hospital, a boiler house was built and windows
and doors were replaced. The economic analysis by the hospital administration showed that in
the three years after the new boiler became operational, the hospital saved over US$400,OOO, and
the savings were used to buy medical equipment and supplies. As a result of the energy efficient
technologies, the Gomel State Oblast Lyceum annually saves about US$50,OOO, which is used to
meet other priority needs of the lyceum.

3.3 Efficiency
At appraisal of the original Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project (SIRP), the economic
internal rate of return (EIRR) and financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the entire project
were estimated at 24.4 and 19 percent respectively, assuming an economic natural gas price of
USD 65 per thousand cubic meters (TCM) and actual natural gas price of USD 30 per TCM in
2001.

Upon completion of both SIRP and SIRP Additional Financing, the actual EIRR and FIRR for
both projects were estimated using the same methodology, taking into account the actual average
capital investments per type of energy efficiency measures (e.g. reconstruction of boiler houses,



                                             11
replacement of windows, installation of energy efficient lighting fixtures, etc.), total investments
per type of energy efficiency measures, and economic price of natural gas of USD 287 per TCM
and actual price of natural gas ofUSD 151 per TCM in 2009. Table 1 shows the economic and
financial internal rates of return and more details are in Annex 3.

                     Table 1: Economic and Financial Internal Rates of Return
 Indicator                      Appraisal                     Aetual
 EIRR, %                        24.4                          24.9
 FIRR, %                        19                             19.6

Although economic and actual prices of natural gas have increased significantly compared to
those at project appraisal in 2001, the actual EIRR and FIRR only marginally exceed the
projected values. This is explained primarily by the increased investment costs due to (a) general
price increases, (b) the strong Euro, and (c) increases in wages in Belarus. The actual EIRR and
FIRR demonstrate strong economic and financial viability of measures supported by the project.

A large part of the project benefits directly related to the project objectives are difficult to
quantify and no attempt was made to quantify them under this analysis. These benefits include
increased comfort level of users of rehabilitated schools and medical facilities, lower air pollution
levels, lower life-cyc1e costs for buildings rehabilitated (particularly roofs, windows and -exterior
wall insulation) and increased employment due to opportunities generated by the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
Based on the discussion in Sections 3.1-3.3, the overall outcome is rated as Satisfactory for the
following reasons. The project was (a) relevant, (b) implemented well, (c) met its development
objectives and (d) well justified since the efficiency indicators (economic internal rate of return
and financial internal rate of return) were satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The energy efficiency improvements undertaken demonstrated positive social impacts, resulting
in cost savings to the institutions that were used to fund other priority expenses, as part of the
Energy Savings Protocol developed for the Project. The savings stay in the education and
medical sectors - at the municipal level - and are used either for additional energy efficiency
iI.Ilprovements or for other priority needs of the institutions that achieved the savings. Prior to
the Project, users of social facilities resorted to additional measures to secure warmth in their
working, healing and learning environments, including: (a) use of additional sources of heating
such as costly, inefficient electric heating devices, (b) ad-hoc improvement of insulation of
windows and doors, (c) reduction of ventilation and airing of premises, (d) keeping on heavy
clothes (coats, boots) indoors, and (e) keeping patients in hospitals during the day and releasing
them to their homes at night. Many hospitals had no hot water during summer, which impeded
observance of hygienic norms. Users of rehabilitated schools, hospitals and other social
institutions confirmed the increase in comfort and functionality after the installation of energy
efficiency measures. From the social standpoint, new windows substantially increase the comfort
level. In addition to the reduced heat losses due to the- more efficient windows, drafts have been
eliminated, and it is easier for personnel to ventilate the rooms. Expectations of the primary


                                              12
beneficiaries have been met, and the social impact of the Project is high, as it has benefitted
socially vulnerable population groups (children, patients and disabled people).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The project had a substantial institutional development impact as demonstrated by the following:-
    • The PMU gained experience in project implementation, and its staff improved their
       project management, financial management and procurement skills through training and
       workshops under the Project. It is now managing two other Bank-financed energy
       efficiency projects as well as energy efficiency investments under the Government's
       national program.
    • Belarussian contractors and construction companies were exposed to international
       competitive bidding, opportunities for collaboration with international contractors and
       suppliers, and new and improved standards in energy efficiency measures.
    • Before and after energy audits are likely· to be used to monitor the impact of energy
       efficiency improvements under future energy efficiency programs financed by the
       Government and by other sources.
    • Increased participation of beneficiaries (teachers, students, parents and hospital staff) in
       energy efficiency efforts and use of social facilities (for example, creation of an Energy
       Efficiency Museum in Gomel, participation of all schools in national Energy Efficiency
       Days, where students perform skits to encourage adoption of low cost energy efficiency
       measures.
    • Both during and after energy efficiency renovations, beneficiaries, particularly in the
       educ~tional facilities, displayed interest in conserving energy resources. They actively
       discussed energy saving ideas in school and at home.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
No unintended outcomes or impacts were observed.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Three beneficiary surveys were conducted during the project:                   one during project
preparation/appraisal, one as input to the mid-term review, and the final beneficiary survey during
the final year of project implementation (May 2010). The final survey included 24 facilities
which underwent various types of rehabilitation (lighting improvements, replacement of window
and door frames, winterization of facades and roofs, and installation of heating equipment. Some
of the facilities received only one type of modernization whereas others received several types of
modernization at the same time. Data was collected through: (a) expert interviews and (b) focus
group discussions in 6 facilities (2 medical institutions and 4 educational institutions, including 2
boarding schools). Most of the data received is based on the subjective opinion of the end-users.

At the majority of facilities reviewed, window replacement led to improved working conditions,
increased comfort due to the increase in temperature indoors as w~ll as the new possibility of
climate control with ventilation. Window replacement facilitated operation and maintenance
(window washing, no need for additional winterization measures, easy ventilation) and made the
work of personnel easier. Large windows with new double glass panes allowed good daylight
penetration, which improved learning conditions. Several respondents mentioned the reduction in
the noise level with the insulated windows, and also the improved aesthetics of the buildings.


                                              13
 Heating system replacements improved the work and learning conditions by increasing the indoor
 temperatures to comfortable levels and making it easier for service personnel to adjust the heating
 system temperature, which led to reduced labor and-fuel costs.

 4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
 Rating: Negligible to Low
 The overall risk to the development outcome in terms of improved functional and health
 environments in social sector facilities with particular emphasis on reducing energy consumption
 is estimated to be negligible to low for the following reasons. The energy efficiency
 improvements, based on the lifetime of the new equipment installed, are expected to have a
 lifetime of 15-20 years. Maintenance arrangements have been put in place by the beneficiaries
 and training in the 'use of the improved equipment was provided by the suppliers.              5.
 Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

 s. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
  S.l Bank Performance
  (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
  Rating: Satisfactory
  TIie Bank's performance in the identification, preparation and appraisal of the project was
  satisfactory. The Bank granted a Project Preparation Facility Advance (PPF) to first test
  approaches to retrofitting of social sector facilities in Minsk prior to including other regions of
  Belarus. in the project and financed rapid social assessments and public awareness campaigns on
  the benefits of energy efficiency improvements. During preparation and appraisal the Bank took
  into account the adequacy of, project design as well as technical, financial, economic and
  institutional aspects, including procurement and fmancial management capacity assessments.
  Major risk factors were considered and incorporated in the project design. Project preparation
. was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the technical skills mix
  necessary to address sector concerns. The Bank provided adequate budget resources to ensure
  quality preparation and appraisal. The only shortcoming was in the failure to quantify baseline
  and end of project target values in the monitoring indicators and to recognize the difficulty to
  monitor the social indicators.

 (b) Quality of Supervision
 Rating: Satisfactory
 The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. The Bank
 conducted a Project Launch Workshop in May 2002, shortly after project effectiveness.
 Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately supervised
 and closely monitored. The task team utilized the available budget judiciously, taking advantage
 of the economy of scale of three energy efficiency projects in Belarus and relying on video and
 audio conference facilities between missions. The task team prepared aide memoires regularly
 and alerted the Government and PMU to problems with project execution and facilitated remedies
 in a timely manner, in conformity with Bank procedures. The mid-term review, held in
 December 2004, included a second rapid social assessment, and proposed constructive actions to
 resolve project issues. The task team reacted swiftly to resolve the issue of the limited number of
 bidders by organizing two workshops and revising the terms of the bidding documents to make


                                               14
 them more attractive to local bidders. The task: team responded in a timely manner to the
 Government's request for additional financing to cover the cost overrun and scale up the Project
 in 2007. The task team acted on the recommendations of the 2008 Quality Assessment of the
 Lending Portfolio (QALP), and arranged for a social scientist and an environmental specialist to
 join the team and supervise the project. Close supervision was facilitated by a highly
 decentralized Bank team, with a Senior Operations Officer in Belarus, a Financial Management
 Specialist in Ukraine, an Environmental Specialist in Ukraine, and a Procurement Specialist in
 Moscow. Task team leaders were Washington-based staff who provided specialized technical
 support.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
 Rating: Satisfactory
 Based on the Bank performance during the lending and supervision phases as discussed above,
 the overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory.

 5~2 Borrower Performance
 (a) Government Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory
   Throughout project preparation and implementation the Government showed its commitment to
   the objective of the project.     The project was an essential component of the much larger
   Government energy efficiency program. Total Government spending on implementation of
   energy efficiency projects amounted to about 1.2 percent ofGDP in 2009-2010. The Government
  created adequate legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks to support energy efficiency
  activities, including the energy efficiency law, national, regional and sectoral energy efficiency
  programs with specific monitorable targets, and the establishment in 1993 of an energy efficiency
  agency - The Committee on Energy Efficiency (which has now become the Energy Efficiency
  Department of the State Standardization Committee). The EED has been responsible for energy
  efficiency at both national and local levels. It implements and monitors government energy
  efficiency programs and regulations, including the compliance of energy consumers with energy
  saving indicators. Overall responsibility for implementing the project financed by the Bank loan
  rested with the EED, with day to day implementation responsibility managed by
. Belinvestenergosberezhenie, the Project Management Unit (PMU). The Government provided all
  costs for the PMU. The EED coordinated the input of the various ministries (primarily the
  Ministries of Health and Education) and the local and oblast authorities. The only shortcoming
  was the failure to provide counterpart funding for about 9 months in 2007, due to a transfer of the
  funding mechanism from one government entity to another. The funds were there, but could not
  be accessed without high level approval. This resulted in the need for a three month extension of
  the Closing Date of the original Project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
 Rating: Satisfactory.
 The Project Management Unit (PMU) was responsible for day-to-day operation of the project,
 including procurement, fmancial management, compliance with the environmental man~gement
 plan, monitoring and evaluation, reporting to both the EED and the Bank, and contract
.supervision. The PMU worked closely with the staff of the local governments and representatives
 of the sector ministries to ensure that the project was implemented on time. A local engineer was



                                               15
hired to cover each oblast and to monitor, report and supervise project progress and performance
of contractors.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Based on the Satisfactory rating for Government performance and Implementing Agency
Performance, the overall performance of the Borrower is rated as Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
   •    Cooperation with Government: When relaunching an investment program with a
        country, it is key to determine a sector for which the Government has sufficient
        commitment, and the new project should have visible economic and social benefits, even
        in an uncertain macroeconomic and structural environment.
   •   Need for realistic, quantifiable baseline and end of project indicators prior to
        implementation. In order to measure the results ofthe project, it is important to have
       the baseline and end-of-project indicators quantified prior to implementation and to have
       measurable indicators.
   •   Attracting bidders to participate in tenders: In projects that have many project sites
       that are widely dispersed throughout the country and contracts that are too small to be of
       interest to international bidders, it is necessary to provide workshops, and information to
       local bidders; to revise the conditions and terms of the bidding documents as needed to
       attract a sufficient number of bids; and for both the Bank team and the PMU to meet with
       potential local bidders to inform them about the Bank's procurement procedures and
       determine the reasons for their failure to bid.
   •   Importance of accurate basic data for technical specifications: It is important to have
       accurate basic data for the technical specifications and require the beneficiary institution
       to sign off on the data, have the design and supervision consultant and the project
       implementing agency visit the sites before finalization of the technical specifications to
       verify the basic data, and request the contractors to visit the sites before the start of works
       in order to avoid costly change orders and contract amendments during implementation.
   •   Oversizing of boiler capacity: Oversizing of the boiler capacity results in higher
       investment and operation and maintenance costs, which can be avoided by reviewing and
       revising the design practices in the country and reducing the capacity requirements.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

All of the end of project output targets were exceeded, except the number of demonstration sites,
which was reduced from 12 to 8 when the Additional Loan was approved, and during
implementation of the Additional Loan the number of retrofitted boiler houses was decreased
from 44 to 42, due to the long lead time required to procure and install new boilers. The outputs
contributed directly to the achievement of the Project Development Objective.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Economic Analysis
At the appraisal of the original Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project (SIRP), the economic
internal rate of return (EIRR) for the entire project was estimated at 24.4 percent, assuming an
economic natuIal gas price of USD 65 per thousand cubic meters (TCM).

Upon completion of both SIRP and SIRP Additional Financing, the actual EIRR for both projects
was estimated using the same methodology, and taking into account the actual average capital
investments (excluding VAT) per type of energy efficiency measures (e.g. reconstruction of
boiler houses, replacement of windows, installation of energy efficient lighting fixtures, etc.),
total investments per type of energy efficiency measures, and the economic natural gas price of
USD 287 per TCM (2009)1. The actual EIRR is estimated at 24.9 percent.

Although the economic price of natural gas has increased significantly compared to that at the
original project appraisal, the actual EIRR only marginally exceeds the projected. This is
explained primarily by the increased investment costs due to: (a) general price increases, (b) the
strong Euro, and (c) increases in wages in Belarus. The actual EIRR demonstrates strong
economic viability of the energy efficiency measures supported by the project.

Financial analysis
At the appraisal of the original Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project (SIRP), the financial
internal rate of return (FIRR) for the entire project was estimated at 19 percent, taking into
account actual natural gas price of USD 30 TCM in 2001. Upon completion of both SIRP and
SIRP Additional Financing, the actual FIRR for both loan was estimated using the same '
methodology, and taking into account the actual average capital investments (including VAT) per
type of energy efficiency measures, total investments per type of energy efficiency measures, and
the actual 2009 natural gas price of USD 151 per TCM.· The actual FIRR is estimated at 19.6
percent.




1 Economic border price for natural gas for Belarus was estimated based on the average European natural gas
border price, net-backed to Belarus using an economic (full cost recovery) price for natural gas, transmission.

Although the actual price of natural gas has increased significantly compared to that at project
appraisal, the actual FIRR only marginally exceeds the projected. This is explained primarily by
the increased investment costs due to: (a) general price increases, (b) the strong Euro, and (c)
increases in wages in Belarus~ The actual FIRR demonstrates strong financial viability of the
energy efficiency measures supported by the project.

A large part of the project benefits directly related to the project objectives are difficult to
quantify and no attempt was made to quantify them under this analysis. These benefits include an
increase in the comfort level of users of rehabilitated schools and medical facilities, lower air
pollution levels, lower life-cycle costs for buildings rehabilitated (particularly, roofs, windows
and exterior wall insulation) and increased employment due to opportunities generated by the
Project.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Three social surveys were conducted, one during project preparation in 2001, one as part of the
mid-term review in 2004, and the final survey at the end of the Project in May 2010. Below is
the summary of the final beneficiary survey.

Summary of Beneficiary Survey conducted in May 2010 by SATI.

Summarized below are the results of expert interviews and focus group discussions conducted in
those areas of the social sphere where modernization of some kind took place. The complete
survey is filed in the Project Files.

The general issues of the research and the major results are:
   1. Has the microclimate changed after modernization of the facilities of the social sphere?
      • The microclimate in the majority of the facilities at which modernization took place .
         changed for the better (no drafts, comfortable temperature, good lighting).
   2. What are the major positive effects and advantages of modernization (achieved by
      changing of only the heating systems and lighting systems and achieved by the complete
      modernization)?
       •   As a result of window replacement, warmth is preserved, there are no drafts and good
           ventilation is secured.
       •   Modernization of heating systems allowed social sphere institutions to be more
           autonomous in terms of heating and warmth saving, to adjust the heating temperature
           depending on weather conditions, which positively influenced the microclimate of the
           institutions.
       •   The main effect from lighting replacement is the improvement of working conditions
           and electric energy saving.
       •   Repair of the f~e and the ·roof is estimated positively, improvement of the
           conditions and comfort of the employees of the modernized institutions are also
           mentioned (constant temperature conditions, positive aesthetic effect).
       •   The optimal effect from modernization was mentioned in the facilities where complete
           rehabilitation took place.
       •   The optimal environment for studying (educational institutions) and patient treatment
           (medical institutions), comfortable working conditions for the employees of
           institutions.
       •   Improvement of the image of the modernized institutions.,
   3. What are the problems/issues connected with the modernization?
      There was occasional, non systemic criticism of the works: (a) the equipment breaks, and
      the warranty period is short (should be 5 years instead of2 or 3).
      • Some institutions were not able to give input on the specialized equipment that they
          required.
      • There were difficulties to organize post-warranty servicing of the equipment
          (organizations had to pay from their own funds).
      • Window replacement is the most desired option for the future.


                                              24
        •   There was limited opportunity to introduce changes once the works have started.
    4. How good was the organization of the works?
       • Fast, quality, carefully.
       • Minimal negative impact on the activities of the institutions.
       • Occasional critical comments on the conducted works.
    5. Were there changes in the consumption of fuel/warmth and electricity after
       modernization?
       • At many facilities, consumption of heat/electric power has reduced by about 10-30%
         on the average.
    6. Are there any significant differences in the indicators of absences from school among
       those schools where energy efficiency improvements were implemented under the Project
       and those schools where improvements did not take place?
       • The energy efficiency improvements did not have a significant influence on absences
           from school, but significantly improved learning conditions.

The research revealed that positive results of the energy saving improvements can be observed in
all facilities. In the subjective opinion of respondents, the increased warmth in .the improved
facilities decreased the number of seasonal cold-related diseases, but this is a subjective opinion,
and statistical data was not provided to substantiate it. The respondents linked the main increase
in warmth to the window replacement. The lighting replacements had a positive effect and
improved working and learning conditions, resulting in less eyestrain.

structures in energy sector. Support to social assessments/surveys.
Consultant services and provision of goods to support PMU in project management and
implementation.

2. Project rationale
    a) Project Preparation
Energy efficiency has been a top priority for the Belarus government since the mid-1990s. The
Belarus government's policy for reducing energy intensity has brought tangible results, with the
energy intensity factor going down from 0.76 in 1995 to 0.45 in 2004, as measured by tons of oil
equivalent (toe), to produce US$I,OOO of GDP adjusted by purchasing power parity (PPP).
However, Belarus still needed further support to energy efficiency measures to move closer to the
level of the European countries.

The government's energy efficiency agenda included both administrative measures and economic
incentives, and this combination proved to be an effective strategy in Belarus' political and



                                              27
economic environment. The strategy emphasized energy conservation through a strict regulatory
regime to promote rational energy consumption and to invest in upgrades of technical
infrastructure. In 1996 the government introduced the practice of setting energy efficiency targets
for relevant ministries and other public entities. Energy efficiency in private enterprises was
encouraged through energy consumption norms.

These energy efficiency activities were supported by legal, regulatory, and institutional
frameworks. This was achieved through the energy efficiency law; national, regional and sectoral
energy efficiency programs with specific and monitorable targets; and the establishment in 1993
of an energy efficiency agency - the Committee on Energy Efficiency (now the Energy
Efficiency Department of the State Standards Committee, EED). The EED has been responsible
for energy efficiency at both national and local levels. The role of the EED is to implement and
monitor government energy efficiency programs and regulations, including the compliance of
energy consumers with energy saving indicators. The EED has far-reaching powers, including the
right to allocate state funds in support of energy efficiency projects.

Contrary to other CIS countries, Belarus has allocated a relatively large amount of public funding
to support the implementation of energy efficiency projects. Total spending on such projects
amounted to about 1.2 percent of GDP in 2009-2010. The government recognized that a reduction
in energy consumption required investment in energy saving equipment and technologies. The
role of the World Bank has been to provide lending to support the government's energy efficiency
investments in social sector facilities.

The issues addressed under the project included efficiency of resource allocation and
environmental functionality in the social sector. The health and education subsectors suffered
from a lack of funds, while energy was wasted in heating and lighting of poorly designed and
maintained facilities - resources that could have been used for more direct sector purposes, such
as books, medicines, and equipment. The habitability and function of social sector buildings was
impaired by poorly balanced and unstable thermal environments, which interfered with the
learning and healing missions of these facilities. In addition, lighting levels and lighting output
characteristics were below standards and caused eyestrain and irritation.                  -

       b) Implementation Stage
Under a Project Preparation Facility (PPF), the Bank and the Government supported the testing of
approaches to retrofitting of social sector facilities in Minsk city. The project was expected to
refine and broaden this experience on a country-wide scale, promote public participation in and
awareness of energy conservation needs, particularly among youth through example in schools,
and encourage an intra-governmental dialogue on methods for sharing of savings to ensure local
benefits, as well as to provide incentives for sustained energy conservation through appropriate
facilities operation and management.

Belarus Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project and Additional Financing for Social
Infrastructure Retrofitting Project funded from the IBRD loans encompassed 717 energy saving
retrofitting activities in educational and health care facilities of Belarus, including (i)
reconstruction of heat substations with installation of automatic temperature controls, (ii)
renovation of lighting with replacement of low-efficiency lamps with energy efficient lighting



                                             28
equipment, (iii) commissioning of new energy efficient or renovated boiler houses, (iv)
replacement of windows with energy efficient double-glazed units, and (v) thermal rehabilitation
of buildings.

The implementation of energy saving retrofitting measures in the surveyed facilities has produced
considerable effect in terms of reduced heat and power consumption and reduction of GHG (C02)
emissions. In addition to energy saving and environmental benefits, the implemented measures
have also yielded considerable social benefits. Indoor temperature is steadily maintained within
the norms in almost all facilities where automated temperature control devices have been installed
and are properly operated. Illuminance has considerably improved after renovation of lighting in
educational facilities.

Energy efficiency measures go in parallel with provision of economic incentives for energy
saving. Revenues from energy saving are used for the needs of education and health facilities, for
investments in promising energy efficient projects and for payment of bonuses to managers and
staff involved in implementation of energy efficient projects.

The technical assistance component provided funding for technical and financial audits, training
for PMU staff and financing for studies and workshops. Tariff and Subsidy Study financed under
this component demonstrated the fiscal and social impact of existing energy sector policies and
the economic costs to Belarus of continuing to support complicated tariff and subsidy policies.
The project also supported the development of environmental emission standards for wood-fueled
boilers to ensure they are in line with the European standards.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

A system of indicators has been developed for monitoring and evaluation of achievement of the'
project development objective; the key ones include the number of rehabilitated buildings and
facilities, volume of energy saved and number of project beneficiaries. The project beneficiaries
often use such indicator as amount of funds saved. Generally, these indicators have allowed
conducting evident monitoring of achievement of the project development objective.

RUE BIES conducted monitoring and evaluation of achievement of the indicators through
contracting consulting companies for' social assessments/surveys ("SATIO" and
"Energotekhno"lUnitary Enterprise "Promenergetika',), as well as through the use of its own
capacities with assistance from local authorities and holders of the rehabilitated facilities. In 2007,
a detailed report was drafted summarizing the data of energy and environmental monitoring,
including the data on energy consumption before and after rehabilitation by each facility and
activity. The report's findings as well as subsequent monitoring suggest that the project objective
- reduction in energy consumption and GHG emissions and improvement of comfort level for


                                                       30
users of health and education facilities - has been achieved. This conclusion is also confinned by
findings of two social surveys conducted during the project implementation.

The original loan and additional financing monitoring data suggest that the annual savings of fuel
and energy resources totaled 29.9 thousand tons of oil equivalent (toe). The aggregate reduction
of C02 emissions is estimated at 51.8 thousand tons a year. The project has also generated a
considerable social effect (heat comfort and improved illuminance in premises, reduced disease
incidence among pre-school children and school students, etc.).

M&E findings have been used by local and regional authorities as well as by the Energy
Efficiency Department of the State Standards Committee for decision-making when planning
energy efficient investments.

4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement. Goods, works and services have been procured under Loan Agreement No. 7056-
BY and Loan Agreement No. 4876-BY based on the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits It and the Belarusian legislation. No facts of non-compliance



                                                  31
with the WB procurement requirements in the course of project implementation have been
reported.

Financial management. Acceptable financial management arrangements met the World Bank
requirements, provisions of the Loan Agreements, and the Project Operational Manual. Upgraded
accounting software enabled reporting on loan disbursements in line with the World Bank
requirements and the provisions of the Belarusian law. The accounting procedure provided for
double internal control of cash flows.

The financial unit was fully staffed; the employees received appropriate training at seminars
conducted by the Bank. Financial reports were delivered on time and complied with the
established requirements, as confirmed by the auditor's unqualified opinion, which showed no
deficiencies in internal control mechanisms and accounting procedures.

FM arrangements have included budget planning based on project disbursements, the accounting
system allowing to track all fmancial transactions under the project, financial monitoring and
reporting containing information about the project implementation and the armual financial
audits.

Environmental and social safeguards. Environmental safeguards have been developed for the
project including environmental management plans, measures for mitigation of potential adverse
impacts as well as a monitoring plan specifying monitoring and oversight responsibilities.
Subcontractors were informed about their responsibilities through inclusion of safety
requirements and measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts into the contracts.
The project has had a positive environmental impact by (i) reducing energy waste and pollution
caused by burning fossil fuels, (ii) contributing to reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide, and
(iii) supporting the development of appropriate emission standards for wood burning boilers,
sources of wood and management of ash.

5. Description and evaluation of transition arrangements for the project's future operation

The completion of the project does not mean that energy saving measures will be discontinued.
The Directive of the President of the Republic of Belarus No.3 dated 14 June 2007 «Resource
Saving and Efficient Managementare the Key Factors of Economic Security of the Country» and
the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus No.433 dated 17 September 2007 «On
Energy Security Concept of the Republic of Belarus» set the task to reduce GDP energy intensity
by 50% in 2015 as compared to 2005 and to increase the share of local fuel and energy resources
in the fuel mix up to 25% in 2012. Growing prices on natural gas, which is the main fuel in
Belarus, require enhanced efforts for more extensive use of domestic fuels. A target is set to
increase the share of local fuels in the fuel mix up to at least 28% by 2015 and 32% in 2020.

According to the Government program, "energy saving measures are expected to be financed
from:
    • own funds of enterprises accumulated through depreciation deductions and profits;




                                             32
    •   proceeds of the earmarked budget innovation funds of the republican authorities aDd other
        organizations subordinate to the Government of the Republic of Belarus ("sectoral
        innovation funds");
    •   republican budget allocations earmarked for financing of the republican and regional
        energy saving programs;
    •   bank credits, loans, and other attracted funds;
    •   republican budget allocations earmarked for enterprise technical upgrading;
    •   local budgets;
    •   other investments.

The Project Management Unit established in RUE BIES (PMU) has adequate capacity for the
implementation of projects and is staffed with knowledgeable personnel, who have attended
trainings and workshops organized by the World Bank's experts and have improved professional
skills on fmancial management and procurement of goods, works and services. RUE BIES will
continue implementation of energy efficient projects which will be financed both from the
government budget and commercial sources.
The key sources of financing energy efficient measures are expected to include the enterprises'
own funds (38% of the total funding), bank credits, loans and other attracted funds (20%). State
support in·the form of co-financing allocated from the republican and local budgets (22% of the
total funding), and sectoral investment funds (20%) will be provided to social and public sector
organizations and other entities in order to enable them to implement the most efficient high-
priority energy saving measures.

Evaluation of achievement of target indicators under the Government program will require
establishment of a monitoring system for surveying the facilities "before" and "after" the
interventions to be conducted by a subcontracted specialized company in order to measure the
key energy efficiency indicators of the project such as:
    • achieved savings in (i) boiler-furnace fuel of direct use, (ii) heat, and (iii) power;
    • reduction of expenditures on procurement of energy inputs and maintenance of facilities;
    • calculation of the project payback period.

Given the social importance of monitoring and dissemination of information to the public, in
future projects we propose to expand the loan budget under the "consulting services" category for
monitoring and evaluation through actual collection of data for all facilities - employing· the
appropriate techniques and specialized companies.

Reduction in energy consumption and overall GDP energy intensity and more extensive use of
domestic fuels will remain government priorities in 2011-2015. By 2015, it is intended to bring
the share oflocal fuel and energy resources inthe boiler-furnace fuel mix to at least 28%, which
would enable to replace 400-500 thousand toe of natural gas per year.

In order to achieve energy saving targets in 2011-2015, US$8.66 billion would be required to
fmance measures on more efficient use of fuel and energy resources. Further involvement of the
World Bank in supporting new projects, particularly those aimed at more intensive utilization of



                                            33
wood biomass for heating and hot water supply in medium-sized and small towns and rural areas,
would be essential.

6. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
   outcomes)

Assessment of Bank petformance
The World Bank played an active role and provided helpful and efficient assistance at all stages
of the project. The Bank's experts are sufficiently qualified, experienced and skilled to help the
Borrower to achieve the agreed objectives. All questions were clarified at the high level, and RUE
BIES is very pleased with communication and cooperation with the World Bank Energy Team.
Actions of the World Bank's management have been very detailed and clear. The World Bank
team met with RUE BIES and the Government officials on a regular basis. Efforts towards
achieving the Project objectives and addressing eventual problems have been timely and, in some
cases, anticipatory. Continuous advice was provided by the staff of the World Bank Country
Office in Minsk.

Assessment of Borrower's petformance
Overall responsibility for implementing the Project rests with the Energy Efficiency Department
(EED) with day-to-day operations managed by Belinvestenergosberezhenie, which is the Project
Management Unit (PMU) set up to implement the project. The EED is responsible for the
Government's overall energy efficiency program. Given the diversity of the final beneficiaries
and ministries involved, the EED coordinated the input of the involved ministries (mainly, the
Ministries of health and education) and local and oblast authorities.

The PMU reports directly to the EED, and it has been operating since 1998 implementing project
preparation activities under the Japanese PHRD grant for the project (No. 25129) and pilot
investment activities financed under the PPF (No. P3400). The PMU has acquired good
experience in implementing World Bank projects and is familiar with World Bank requirements
for project management. The PMU received additional training in project management, technical
evaluation of sub-projects, procurement, disbursement, and financial management.

Adequate stability and skill level of PMU staffing was important for effective project
implementation, and funding was provided from the government budget to ensure adequate
staffing. The PMU· was also responsible for coordinating and assisting in the supervision of the
work of consultants and contractors, including assistance in customs clearance, acceptance of
equipment, monitoring delivery of equipment from customs to the sites, and monitoring
installation and final acceptance and commissioning of finished objects.

At the oblast level, where investments took place, the PMU worked closely with staff of the local
government and representatives of the sector ministries to ensure the project is being
implemented on time. One local engineer was hired to coyer each oblast and to monitor, report
and supervise project progress and performance of contractors. Minsk city was covered by the
PMU staff. The established project management mechanism proved effective.




                                             34
 7. Lessons learned

 Throughout project implementation, the team of RUE BIBS in cooperation with the World
 Bank's experts gained considerable experience in the field of preparation and implementation of
 projects involving large-scale works. Procurement and financial management workshops
 organized by the Bank team on a regular basis have allowed RUE BIBS staff to improve
 professional skills and to learn from the implementation experience of similar projects in
 neighboring countries such as Ukraine, Moldova, Kazakhstan, and Russia.

It should also be noted that the project was thoroughly designed, and the goals were clearly
formulated. The Standard Bidding Documents are very clear, comprehensive and applicable.
Timely, accurate and professional preparation of project documents proved to be a very important
contribution. .

PPF implementation demonstrated that the project had· facilitated participation of the Belarusian
contractors and construction companies in competitive bidding. Benefits were also generated in
the form of employment opportunities due to project activities. The project introduced
competitive contracting procedures and opportunities for collaboration with international
contractors and suppliers, exposed local contractors, equipment manufacturers and material
industries to new and improved standards in energy efficiency measures and competition within
and outside Belarus.

Experience with implementation of additional financing (Loan 4876~BY) has shown that the most
efficient method is hundred-percent activity fmancing out of the World Bank loan proceeds. A
single funding source allowed simplifying and expediting payments to contractors for
accomplished works. Moreover, RUE BIES acted as an organizer of international competitive
bidding exercising control functions rather than a facility renovation employer, whereas under the
original loan (Loan 7056-By), RUE BIBS acted as an employer and simultaneously held
international competitive bidding, performed the functions of the site owner and paid for works
accomplished by the contractor, established a tender evalUation committee, etc., which eventually
impeded transfer of the upgraded facilities to their current accountable holders, which should
have served as employers.

The upgraded facilities are government institutions. Post-guarantee preventive and routine
maintenance of the upgraded facilities is funded out of the government budget. The funds are
assigned to the institution in general and the management of the institution then allocates the
funds to the needs of the organization. The current post-guarantee maintenance and repair system·
has its peculiarities in each institution and depends on the funds and personnel assigned, as well
as on distance from spare part vendors.

In general, the project implementation has resulted in a positive experience of cooperation with
rayon and oblast executive authorities. Interaction with rayon and oblast authorities improved
during the project implementation, as the project owners and executive bodies became aware of
the project goals and objectives, specifics of procurement procedures and methods of payment for
works. The interaction of site owners and authorities with contractors also improved.




                                            35
According to the Order of the President of the Republic of Belarus, the facilities for renovation
are selected by the Oblast and Minsk City Executive Committees based on feasibility studies for
each individual facility, which are prepared jointly with the employer and the accountable asset
holder. The inclusion of heat generating facilities (such as heat only boilers for conversion to
CHPs) in the project is based on economic efficiency of construction, payback period and other
technical and economic criteria There were cases when some proposed investments [heating
system upgrade in Zeliony Bor hospital (Zhodino rayon) and Pilepy boiler house upgrade
(Smolevichy Region)] had to be excluded from the project due to their long payback period

It should be noted that the objectives of the World Bank projects fully comply with the priority
areas of international cooperation in the field of energy saving; at the same time, the project
activities fully correspond to the high-priority technical areas set forth in the Republican Energy
Saving Programs for 2001-2005 and 2006-2010. Besides, a certain contribution to energy saving
efforts in Belarus can be attributed to the projects funded by grants allocated by the World Bank
for improving the legislation of the Republic of Belarus, staff capacity building, raising public
awareness, and etc.

The international competitive bidding allowed expanding the number of foreign companies
interested in implementation of energy-saving projects in the Republic of Belarus; it also
facilitated adoption of advanced foreign technologies and equipment supporting higher energy
efficiency.

Belarus is highly interested in various approaches to project implementation offering apparent
individual benefits (demonstration projects and mass duplication of homogeneous activities).
Implementation of a set of energy-saving activities in one facility allows establishing highly
energy-efficient demonstration objects in various regions, which illustrate the actual maximal
economically justified energy saving capacity at an individual facility, including significant
reduction of consumption of energy resources, while providing for a highly-comfortable
environment in social facilities. Implementation of homogeneous activities at multiple objects
expedites the procedure of competitive bidding, contract award and work completion due to
application of standard technical solutions. It also helps to considerably reduce the number of
project contractors and improve disbursement rates.

Demonstration sites upgraded under the SIRP serve as an example of energy efficient
construction. Funds saved through energy efficiency activities are used to meet the priority needs
of the, facilities. The economic efficiency obtained in each facility is registered·in the Government
Reporting Form I-Energy Saving (for instance, the following annual savings were attained at
educational demonstration sites of Brest Oblast: 17, 8 tons of coal equivalent through window and
exterior door replacement, 0.84 tons of coal equivalent through the replacement of light fixtures
with energy-saving units ).

Another example is Secondary School No. 60 (82 Karl Liebknecht Street, Minsk). Introduction of
heat supply automatic control and replacement of heat exchanger resulted in reduced annual heat
consumption by 159.0 GCal (22.1%). The installation of energy-efficient light fixtures curtailed
the annual electricity consumption by 12.29 kWh (33.0%).
