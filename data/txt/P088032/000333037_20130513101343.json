APL) is to enhance the provision of water and\n            sewerage services for the benefit of low-income people, in\n            particular for those people living in highly vulnerable\n            areas; to improve high priority road segments of the\n            borrower's road network; to mitigate urban flooding;\n            and to support the reactivation of the borrower's\n            economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness. The\n            additional financing in the amount of US$50 million,\n            approved by the Board on July 27, 2010, aims at filling the\n            financing gap in the parent project caused by unforeseen\n            cost increases and scaling up the parent project to include\n            additional works. Because of reasons outside of the\n            borrower's control, the additional financing loan only\n            became effective on February 17, 2012, 18 months after its\n            approval by the Bank's Board. Thanks to the\n            Borrower's proactive engagement, the additional\n            financing loan has disbursed US$15.07 million (30 percent)\n            in just one year since effectiveness. The project\n            implementation progress and the performance of the\n            implementing agency have been rated satisfactory in the\n            parent project for several years (and continue to be\n            satisfactory currently), the project is not under suspension\n            of disbursements, and the project has no outstanding audit\n            reports or audit reports not satisfactory to the Bank."}, "docdt": "2013-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
