                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of
                         supporting the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end, the Province is prioritizing a set of
                         interventions through a sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2010 specifically aimed to: i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line
                         with the priorities of the Province, to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal
                         framework. ii. Enhance access to water and sewerage services to low income people living in highly vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding. iii.            Improve
                         high priority segments of the productive paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional competitiveness.

                         1. This ISR covers the period of December 2013 to August 2014. In total under the original loan and the Additional financing, there are 39 roads works (35 under the original loan and
                         4 under the Additional Financing), 12 water and sanitation works (9 under the original loan and 3 under the additional financing), 1 drainage work (under the additional financing) and
                         27 technical assistance activities (all under the original loan). Progress under the APL1 Project continues to advance well. The original loan was closed in December 2013: it has
                         been fully disbursed and all works have been concluded in time. All the technical assistance activities of the institutional strengthening components of the original loan have also been

                         finalized. Expenses under the original loan were fully justified during the grace period. The additional financing is fully disbursed, although some works are still in execution (they are
                         now paid with counter-part funds).The great majority of indicator targets has been met, with the remaining two pending the finalization of the AF drainage and WSS works and some
                         adjustments to the drainage works contract to reflect changes discussed during the last mission. Under the Additional Financing, only the WSS works (85.7% completed) and the
                         Arroyo Soto drainage work (44% completed) are still underway, with the latter expected to be finished in early 2015.

                         2. The Province of Buenos Aires continues to give adequate attention and supervision to social and environmental aspects, and best practices are being documented. An
                         environmental and social supervision visit to the Arroyo Soto took place during the last official mission in April 2014.
