Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The development objectives (PDOs) of this project are to: (i) enhance the provision of water and sewerage services for the benefit of low-income
 people, in particular for those people living in highly vulnerable areas; (ii) improve high priority road segments of the Borrower’s road network; (iii)
 mitigate urban flooding; and (iv) support the reactivation of the Borrower’s economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This ISR covers the period of December 2014 to May 2015. This is the last ISR of the Project. In total under the original loan and the Additional
 financing, there are 39 roads works (35 under the original loan and 4 under the Additional Financing), 12 water and sanitation works (9 under the
 original loan and 3 under the additional financing), 1 drainage work (under the additional financing) and 27 technical assistance activities (all under the
 original loan). The original load has been closed since December 2013 with timely conclusion of all works, full justification of the expenses and
 finalization of all technical assistance activities of the institutional strengthening components.

 Though the Additional Financing loan is fully disbursed, the works in Berazategui remain in execution and the PBA confirmed that they will be finalized
 within the grace period with local funds. The great majority of indicator targets has been met, with the remaining two pending the finalization of the
 sanitation works.

         This number is higher than expected due to the sewerage connection rate, wherein people connect over time, and the longer exposure time
         of the Project.
