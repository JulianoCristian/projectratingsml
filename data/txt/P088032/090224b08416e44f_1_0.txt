F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the
Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of supporting the return to a
sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end,
the Province is prioritizing a set of interventions through a sector wide Infrastructure Program for
the period 2005-2010 specifically aimed to:

  i.   Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province,
to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergence
towards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.

  ii.   Enhance access to water and sewerage services to low income people living in highly
vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding.

  iii. Improve high priority segments of the productive paved road network to support the
reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional competitiveness.

Summary and Overview of ICR Findings

1.       The Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable Infrastructure Development Project, Phase I
(APL1) was prepared in the aftermath of Argentina’s 2001-2002 financial and economic crisis as
the first of a two-phase, multi-sectoral infrastructure investment project with the Province of
Buenos Aires (PBA). The project intended to finance major investments in provincial road
rehabilitation and water and sewerage network expansion, as well as investments to mitigate urban
flooding. This was proposed in the context of the PBA’s overall objective of strengthening its fiscal
performance and of reinvigorating the provincial economy.
2.       The project was successful in several ways; the original loan was fully disbursed with little
lag from original projections; project outputs for one of the components (road rehabilitation)
exceeded the original targets by a wide margin; Additional Financing in an amount of USD 50
million enabled the implementation of a significant part of the original water and sewerage
investments; the economic returns to investments have been positive; and implementing agencies
noticeably increased their planning, implementation, and safeguards management capacity. In
addition, Phase II of the project (APL2) contributed as well to road rehabilitation, sewerage
network expansion, and urban drainage improvements, assisting the PBA toward meeting
investment targets that it could not have met without financing from the Bank. Despite these
achievements, however, the overall success of the project has to be judged based on the formal
objectives and targets established and formally revised in project documentation. As project
objectives were broadly worded, included objectives that were unlikely to be met through project
activities, and were only restructured after much of the project had been implemented, this
Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report has evaluated the project’s outcome as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Section 1: Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1      Context at Appraisal

3.       Country Background. The project was prepared in the aftermath of Argentina’s 2001-
2002 financial and economic crisis. While the economy had largely stabilized at the time of project
preparation and appraisal, poverty rates in the country had more than doubled during the crisis –
from 25 to 54 percent1 – and both federal and provincial investment in infrastructure had, due to
lack of funds, fallen significantly.
4.      The Province of Buenos Aires (PBA) was (and remains) the largest province in Argentina,
with a population of 14.4 million – just under 40 percent of the country’s population – and produced
approximately 29 percent of the national gross domestic product. As a result of the economic crisis,
64 percent of the provincial population was living under the poverty line in 2002, compared to less
than 20 percent in 1994.
5.      In terms of economic and financial management, the province had experienced significant
deterioration in the years leading up to the crisis. During the 1990s, the province had balanced fiscal
accounts and was the largest revenue contributor to the federal revenue-sharing system. However,
beginning in the late 1990s, changes at the national level in education, health, and social security
policy, which shifted responsibility for spending in these areas to the provinces, as well as general



1 The 2003 poverty rate reported in the World Bank’s Country-at-a-Glance Annex was 55 percent. The 2005 poverty rate
was reported to have fallen to 31 percent, as reported in the Country-at-a-Glance Annex for the 2007 PAD for the Phase
II APL. Poverty rate here refers to the percentage of the population below the national poverty line.

                                                          1
public-sector wage increases, resulted in increased current expenditures by the PBA and net
revenue losses. On top of this, significant problems in the provincial bank (Banco de la Provincia
de Buenos Aires) resulted in extraordinary transfers from the PBA to the bank. In 2001, the
provincial deficit was 50 percent of revenues, financed with locally-issued quasi-money –
effectively adding to the province’s debt stock. In 2002, the PBA defaulted on its international
bonds.
6.       To address the above, the federal government entered into bilateral agreements with the
PBA in 2002, 2003, and 2004 that allowed the province to access federal resources to meet its
financing needs and to service much of its public debt. As part of those agreements, the PBA
committed to certain fiscal targets. These agreements were followed by the passage of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law in 2004, which formalized fiscal norms for the participating provinces.
Participation in the law limited provincial borrowing to international financial institutions (IFIs)
and to loan agreements that would improve the debt profile. In return, the province would be
eligible for continued financial support from the national government, although this would be
subject to annual negotiations.
7.       Sector Context. One of the consequences of the 2001-2002 crisis was a drastic decrease
in infrastructure investment and rehabilitation by the PBA. In 2002, investment was less than one
percent of total provincial spending, a level far below that needed to rehabilitate existing
infrastructure – in particular, the provincial road network – and to make needed new investments,
including in areas unserved by water and sanitation infrastructure and areas subject to repeated
flooding.
8.       Rationale for Bank Assistance. In this context, and consistent with the agreements made
with the national government, the Province’s Ministry of Economy prepared a comprehensive
infrastructure investment program within a framework of long-term fiscal balance and approached
the World Bank for support. The subject project was prepared to assist in the financing of the
infrastructure proposed in the PBA’s investment program, the strengthening of public-sector
capacity, and improvement in the environment for provincial economic growth. An Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) was chosen, as opposed to a single Investment Loan, in order to provide a
framework for additional funding for the program upon successful implementation of the initial
investments. Phase II of the Project (APL2), in an amount of USD 270 million, was approved by
the Bank’s Board of Directors in 2007. APL2 was fully disbursed and closed in December, 2013.2
1.2      Original PDO and Key Indicators

9.     The Project Development Objective (PDO), as defined in the Loan Agreement between the
World Bank and the Province of Buenos Aires (dated March 8, 2005; page 24), was to:
             i.    enhance the provision of water and sewerage services for the benefit of low-
                   income people, in particular for those living in highly vulnerable areas;
            ii.    to improve high-priority road segments of the Borrower’s road network;
           iii.    to mitigate urban flooding; and
           iv.     to support the reactivation of the Borrower’s economy and strengthen its regional
                   competitiveness.

II (Report No. 39558-AR), dated May 29, 2007; and Implementation Completion and Results Report for APL2 (Report
No. ICR0000742), dated June 30, 2014.

10.      The project components and activities follow closely from the above project objectives,
with the exception of the last objective. That said, the main text of the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) does not explicitly mention the PDOs as defined in the Loan Agreement; it emphasizes
instead the objectives of the PBA’s fiscal reform and investment program, which was presented as
follows: “to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework of
fiscal responsibility as a means of supporting the return to a sustainable path of economic growth,
to alleviate poverty and increase social equity”. As a means to that end, the PAD specifies that the
Province’s program prioritized investments and activities aimed to:
        i.    Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the
              Province, to implement the infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to
              ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework.
       ii.    Improve and maintain high-priority segments of the paved road network to support the
              reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional competiveness.
      iii.    Enhance water and sewerage services to low-income people living in highly vulnerable
              areas and to mitigate urban flooding.

11.     This ICR evaluates the performance of the APL1 against the objectives as stated in the
Loan Agreement. The project is not being evaluated based on the outcomes of the PBA’s overall
program, nor are the combined outcomes of APL1 and APL23 being jointly evaluated. However,
aspects of the PBA’s program that were particularly highlighted in the PAD will be commented on,
and Annex 3 provides summary information on the infrastructure goals of the government’s
investment program (which APL1 and APL2 supported) and the associated contributions from both
APL1 and APL2.
12.     PDO indicators were presented in the main text of the PAD and in the Results Framework
annex consistent with the statement of goals as described in paragraph 7, above, although with
differences between the main text and the annex. In the main text of the PAD (pg. 11), key
indicators established to measure progress towards the achievement of the PDO were expressed as
follows:
         i.    Implementation of the Fiscal Framework, including the maintenance of monitoring
               indicators at levels consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability;
        ii.    Number of kilometers (of road) rehabilitated under the program and overall average
               roughness of the network;
       iii.    Population benefitting from the water and sewerage component (population
               connected to piped water and/or sewerage system); and
       iv.     Number of municipalities adopting urban and land-use regulations that minimize the
               hydrological impact of urban development in flood-prone areas.

13.   In comparison, the Results Framework (PAD Annex 3, pgs. 43-45) provides the following
PDO outcome indicators:
         i.    Fiscal framework regularly updated to reflect the evolution of agreed fiscal
               monitoring indicators;

          ii.    High-traffic productive road assets preserved with an acceptable average roughness
                 (IRI) to reduce operational and travel time costs, and avoided accumulation of future
                 liabilities in the overall network; and
         iii.    Reduced waterborne diseases.

14.     The Results Framework also specified component-specific indicators; these were largely
consistent with the PDO indicators mentioned in the main text of the PAD. Component-specific
indicators included: kilometers of key productive roads rehabilitated; increased water supply and
sewerage coverage in poor areas and number of poor people connected to water and sewerage
services; number and type of non-structural measures implemented (with respect to flood
prevention); and, with respect to a component focusing on institutional capacity, the percentage
decrease of (axle) overload in the pilot road and the number of infrastructure projects aligned with
the new productive strategy assessed in the provincial Projects’ database.
15.     As the first phase of a two-phase APL, the PAD specified several triggers and related
indicators that would need to be met in order to move forward with Phase 2 of the APL4. These are
provided in the following table.

                 Trigger                                                   Indicator
    Evidence of satisfactory             1. Satisfactory implementation of the Fiscal Framework and its
    implementation of the Fiscal            dynamic use to review and update projections to reflect the evolution

                                            Framework.
                                         7. Borrower enacts adequate policies for investments in urban drainage
                                            in accordance with a Manual of Best Practice acceptable to the Bank.

1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators

16.     An Additional Financing (AF) loan in an amount of USD50 million was approved in mid-
2010, at which time a Level 1 restructuring was undertaken.5 The AF was intended to fill the

  The compliance with the triggers was analyzed during the preparation of APL 2; while the triggers related to the fiscal
framework were considered not to have been met and were waived, overall progress was considered sufficient to move
forward with APL2.

financing gap caused by unforeseen cost increases that affected the scope of the works. There was
no change in the PDO as specified in the Loan Agreement.6 However, the Results Framework of
the Project Paper specified that the PDO (as stated in the PAD) was changed to remove its first part
(“Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province, to
implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergence
towards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework”) and the associated outcome indicator was
removed. Since there was no change in the PDO as specified in the Loan Agreement, for the
purposes of the evaluation of the outcomes of the project, there were no changes in the areas to be
evaluated.
17.      In addition to the removal of the indicator related to monitoring fiscal performance, the
revision in the Results Framework at the time of the Additional Financing changed the outcome
indicator related to water and sewerage from “reduction in water-borne diseases” to “additional
poor people with access to (i) water supply and (ii) sanitation services.” 7 Component-specific
Intermediate Outcome Indicators had minor adjustments, but remained largely consistent with the
original intermediate indicators. The project restructuring also included an extension of the closing
date to December 31, 2013 and the triggering of the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policy
(OP/BP 4.12).
18.     In 2012 a level II restructuring was carried out in order to revise the scope of the civil works
to reflect construction cost increases and to adjust the target values of project indicators
accordingly, among other minor changes. In addition, the 2012 restructuring enabled financing of
100 percent of project costs through the AF loan. In 2013, another level II restructuring extended
the deadline of the AF loan from December 31, 2013 to May 30, 2015.
1.4      Main Beneficiaries

19.      While the main text of the PAD did not mention specific beneficiaries, particularly with
respect to the rehabilitation and improvement of roads, the PAD Results Framework specified that
water and sewerage investments would benefit a total of 450,000 persons. Water and sewerage
investments were required to take place in areas with higher levels of low-income residents,8 and
therefore most beneficiaries were likely to be poor. In addition, the project’s drainage investments
and policy measures were most likely to benefit households subject to regular flooding, and
therefore more likely to be low-income.
20.     Specific beneficiary targets for water supply and sewerage were originally established and
revised as follows:




6 Loan Agreement for the Additional Financing for the Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable Investment Development
Project-Phase I, dated February 6, 2012.
7 The Results Framework for the Additional Financing incorrectly states that there was no change in the outcome
indicator for water and, sewerage. The authors may have been following the results framework established for APL2.
8 Requirement that target areas for water and sewerage extensions have an IPMH (Indice de Privación Material de

Hogares, which is a Provincial indicator that proxies poverty) greater than 40. See footnote 10 for more details.

* Targets specified in the 2010 Additional Financing are the total number of beneficiaries for the combined
original loan and AF (not only for the investments to be financed under the AF).
** The calculation of active sewerage connections (i.e., households that have connected to the sewerage
network) is a function of an assumed connection rate and time. It is therefore possible to have a reduction in
the total number of people with access to a sewerage service line (a decrease from 272,512 to 254,057) and
an increase in the number of people with an active sewerage connection (an increase from 173,722 to
181,495). Note that the number of people with active sewerage connections is an estimate based on the
connection rate of one of the water supply and sanitation (WSS) operators who tracks the figure. Most
operators do not track the figure, as all customers with access to a sewerage line pay a sewerage charge
regardless of whether they are connected.

21.     In addition to the above direct beneficiaries, the project design benefitted the agencies of
the PBA implementing the project – the Unit for Coordination with Multilateral Credit
Organizations (UCO) within the Ministry of Economy and its predecessors, the Roads Directorate
(DVBA), the Water and Sewerage Directorate (DIPAC), and the Hydraulic Works Directorate
(DIPSOH). 9 This was through both project-supported interventions (capacity building and
technical assistance, strategy development, planning) and through on-the-job project
implementation, which had a significant impact on the agencies’ capacities to design, plan, and
manage infrastructure investments. These benefits are discussed further in section 3.5 (Overarching
Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts).
1.5      Original Components

22.      The original APL financed four components as follows:
23.     Component 1: Provincial Roads (Estimated Cost: USD 136.2 million; IBRD financing:
USD 101.2 million). The roads component proposed to rehabilitate high-priority segments of the
road network, remove critical bottlenecks, and implement a maintenance program for the Provincial
road network.
24.     Component 2: Water and Sewerage (Estimated Cost: USD 66.1 million; IBRD financing:
USD 52.3 million). The water and sewerage component proposed to finance the extension of treated
water and sewerage networks to unserved, low-income areas. Targeted areas, in addition to being
technically feasible, had to meet identified poverty criteria (areas had to have an Index of
Household Material Deprivation (Indice de Privación Material de Hogares (IPMH)10) higher than
40 percent. In addition, beneficiary operators had to have signed a binding Framework Agreement,
which established the legal and operating requirements for the investments, with the PBA.

deprivation and current resource deprivation. For a complete description and calculation references, please see PAD

25.      Component 3: Drainage (Estimated Cost: USD 14.3 million; IBRD financing: USD 11.3
million). The drainage component planned to finance storm sewers in five urban and peri-urban
areas of greater Buenos Aires in order to reduce urban flooding.
26.      Component 4: Technical Assistance (Estimated Cost: USD 14.8 million; IBRD financing:
USD 11.7 million). The technical assistance (TA) component intended to finance (i) institutional
strengthening of the various project implementing agencies, provincial regulators, and other
infrastructure and economic-planning and finance functions within the PBA and (ii) activities to
support economic competitiveness and job creation, e.g., identification of bottlenecks to economic
growth, the development of appropriate policies, etc.. In addition, the component was to finance
some costs related to project implementation.
1.6      Revised Components

27.     Project components were not revised during project implementation. Additional Financing
was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors in July, 2010 (signed in February, 2012).11 The
Additional Financing provided additional funds for the infrastructure components listed above –
Provincial Roads (USD 14.9 million); Water Supply and Sewerage (USD 20.3 million); and
Drainage (USD 21.3 million), as well as additional funds for contingencies. The Additional
Financing was arranged primarily in order to meet the financing needs of the Water and Sewerage
and Drainage components, whose funds under the original loan had been transferred to meet cost
increases under the Roads component.
28.      This review notes that, while the original project was heavily framed in the context of the
PBA’s program, which emphasized the development and maintenance of a sustainable fiscal
framework, the fiscal framework was not one of the formal project development objectives. The
project included funding for some technical assistance as well as IT hardware and software related
to budgeting and fiscal management. The original project’s M&E framework included a monitoring
indicator related to the fiscal framework, and one of the triggers for APL2 was related to the fiscal
framework. As the fiscal arrangements between the Province and the national government had
significantly shifted since the original PAD such that the fiscal targets related to the PBA’s primary
balance could no longer be met, the Additional Financing and related restructuring removed the
associated PDO indicator (see para 71 and 72 for additional information).
1.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements
and schedule, and funding allocations):

29.     There were no significant changes to the project components, which were largely
implemented as originally designed. That said, more funds than originally intended were allocated
to the Roads component, while fewer funds were allocated to the Drainage component and the
Technical Assistance component. The outputs and outcomes of these components are discussed in
Section 3.2 (Achievement of the Project Development Objectives).
30.      Implementation Period: The original project was intended to be implemented over a five-
year timeframe (2005 – 2009). The original funds were 100 percent committed at the time of the
original closing date and were effectively entirely disbursed by June, 2010. The USD 50 million
Additional Financing, approved in June, 2010, was expected to be completed by December 31,
2013, however, it was not signed until February, 2012 due to an extended process between the PBA
and the National Government to exchange relevant fiscal information in order for the National
Government to guarantee the loan. The closing date was later extended to May 30, 2015, to allow


11 TheProject Paper for the Additional Financing states (page 2, paragraph 5) that there were six components in the
Original Project. The authors may have been referring to the project design for APL2, which had six components.

                                                        7
the completion of activities. In all, the implementation period of the project was approximately ten
years. Additional information about the implementation of the project is provided in paragraphs 38
through 41.
31.      Cofinancing: Under the original loan and AF, the PBA was expected to co-finance 25
percent of total project costs. That co-financing arrangement remained throughout the disbursement
of the original loan; a restructuring in October, 2012 eliminated the co-financing requirement due
to financial constraints within the PBA (and Argentina in general) due to a slowdown in the
economy and constraints in accessing foreign currency, enabling 100 percent IBRD financing of
AF activities. That said, the PBA contributed its own funds to the completion of the last project
activities once all AF funds were disbursed, and PBA funding ultimately contributed 25 percent of
total project costs.

Section 2: Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

32.     Project preparation was extremely thorough, with significant background analysis and
component preparation in all aspects of the project. The project was tightly aligned with the PBA’s
investment program, which was focused on core public-service infrastructure needs. The project
made funds available at a crucial time given the financial crisis and PBA’s inability to undertake
necessary rehabilitation in the preceding years and lack of access to other sources of financing.
33.      Project implementation arrangements appear at first glance to be overly complex due to
several layers of responsibility and authority. Implementation had to be coordinated through the
provincial Ministry of Economy’s Unit for Coordination with Multilateral Credit Organization
(UCO; later the Sub-Secretariat for Coordination of International Credit from Countries and
Organizations (SCEOCI)), with direct implementation by three separate directorates
(water/sewerage, drainage and roads) under the Ministry of Infrastructure. The Ministry of
Infrastructure established a unit – the UCPO (Unidad de Coordinación de Proyectos y Obras) – to
coordinate the three directorates and to maintain communications with the UCO/SCEOCI. The
implementation arrangements worked well, with clear lines of decision-making and reporting, and
internal communication that enabled the sharing of lessons learned and problem-solving.
34.     Readiness for implementation: the various components evidenced mixed readiness for
implementation. Roads rehabilitation sub-projects were reasonably well identified, but water and
sewerage sub-projects were to be identified and assessed during project implementation. In
addition, the water sector was undergoing significant uncertainty and restructuring due to the
collapse of contracts with international private operators during and following the currency
devaluation, and therefore it was not yet clear which operators would be able to apply for project-
funded network extensions. Despite this, the project included eligibility criteria for water supply
and sewerage proposals and operators, a poverty-focused selection criteria, and a social and
environmental safeguards framework.
35.      Drainage subprojects were postponed after a supervision review of the initial designs of
the subprojects, which revealed technical weaknesses that would likely have resulted in a failure of
the works to meet performance expectations. Instead, the project adopted a more updated design
methodology, which was then adopted across the Province for all drainage works. After this
updated design approach (see para. 68) the works were able to be designed and implemented. By
that time, however, funds had largely been allocated to other components. In addition to the
drainage works financed under the Additional Financing, APL2 financed the drainage works for
the city of Finochietto, originally intended under APL1, at a total cost of USD 48 million.


                                                 8
36.     Complexity of Technical Assistance: Most of the technical assistance originally specified
was not undertaken. Based on a review of the original TA plans, the component was somewhat
overdesigned, with a comprehensive, long-term program of activities that should probably not have
been identified without earlier phases being completed. There seems to have been a prescriptive
nature at the component planning stage, rather than an investigative nature. Delays in initial
implementation, combined with complex terms of reference, uncertainty with respect to intended
outcomes, and lack of experience within the implementation agencies with respect to technical
assistance, resulted in overly slow implementation for the component as a whole. There were,
however, notable successes within the TA component. Additional information is provided in the
Project Outcomes section.
37.      Consistency of Project Documentation: Internal documentation with respect to the PDO
as described in the PAD, the initial project results framework, and the PDO as defined in the Loan
Agreement was inconsistent. Only one PDO indicator – related to road roughness – was well tied
to the PDO and to project activities. An outcome indicator related to the province’s fiscal
framework was not tied to the PDO (it was later removed), while the original outcome indicator
related to improvements in water supply and sewerage was not able to be measured or monitored,
and had to be revised.
2.2         Project Implementation

38.     Project implementation was consistent with infrastructure-focused operations. Issues that
arose during implementation were not unusual in infrastructure investment projects and are
discussed below.
39.      Unexpected price increases for works: Both roads and water and sewerage investments
were faced with unanticipated price increases during project implementation, which resulted in
procurement delays, funding reallocations, and reduced overall investments. As roads sub-projects
were at more advanced stages of preparation than the water/sewerage and drainage sub-projects,
funding under the original loan was reallocated from the other components to the roads component
during the first several years of implementation, and particular attention was paid to price increases
in that sector. A comprehensive review of price increases in the roads sector was undertaken in
2009/2010.12 Price increases in road works in Argentina between 2004 and 2008 were estimated to
be nearly 75 percent; this increase was consistent with other infrastructure sectors, and mirrored
increases in construction costs globally in that period. As works under APL1 were bid out and
contracted in that period, the project faced a combination of higher costs and, where funding was
not increased, lower outputs.
40.     Effectiveness Delays for the Additional Financing: There were significant delays in the
signing of the Additional Financing for the project, which was approved by the Bank’s Board of
Directors in mid-2010 but was not signed until February, 2012.13 This was reportedly due to the
national government’s unwillingness to guarantee the sub-sovereign loan to the PBA. The PBA
continued to proceed with the major procurement processes during the delay and was able to sign
key contracts shortly after the AF effectiveness.
41.     Adaptability due to Parallel Project Implementation: Project implementation was
considered to be significantly more adaptable due to the parallel implementation of APL2, which
was approved in June, 2007 and became effective in August, 2008. APL2 had similar goals,

indicators and components and was implemented by the same agencies and under the same
conditions, and therefore sub-projects that had originally been planned to be financed under APL1
were able to be undertaken under APL2 when cost increases reduced the amount of funding
available. In addition, following the approval of the AF, sub-projects originally planned to be
financed under APL2 were able to be financed by the AF. Total funding under the two phases (USD
520 million, consisting of USD 200 million under APL 1, USD 50 million under APL1 AF, and
USD 270 million under APL 2) enabled the development of a critical mass of investments and
activities that not only noticeably improved the road, water and sanitation and drainage
infrastructure within the PBA but also significantly strengthened the planning and implementation
capacity of all the agencies involved.
42.      Impact of Inflation and Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Despite local inflation and
fluctuations in the ARS/USD exchange rate during project implementation, the impact on project
implementation seems to have been relatively minor. According to official figures published by
INDEC, inflation was 139 percent from 2004 to 201414, while depreciation of the peso against the
USD was 64 percent. Inflation and changes in the exchange rate affected the project in different
ways. Depreciation of the Argentinean Peso relative to the US Dollar helped the project, as every
dollar disbursed from the Loan effectively purchased more Pesos. However, inflation in Argentina
resulted in higher costs in local currency, offsetting the improved purchasing power of the US
dollar. For investments financed under the original loan, it is estimated that local prices were 21
percent higher (in nominal terms) than 2004 prices. For investments financed under the AF, local
prices are estimated to have been eight percent higher than expected during the preparation of the
AF. However, these price increases appear to have been largely offset – although with a slight lag
– by the weakening of the Peso relative to the US Dollar. Additional detail on local inflation and
exchange rate patterns is provided in Annex 4.
2.3         Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

43.      M&E Design: The original project design included a monitoring and evaluation framework
for the project. It was well designed for monitoring project outputs (e.g., kilometers of roads
rehabilitated, number of household water and sewerage connections created), however, at the level
of outcomes, in some cases it was not consistently tied to project activities, and in some areas was
not measurable. For example, a PDO indicator related to the development of a multi-year public
expenditure program was agreed, however, there was no related PDO. With respect to infrastructure
investments, while water and sewerage activities could have been tied to the initially established
outcome indicator of reduced waterborne diseases, due to disperse data and the difficulty in
showing causal links between diseases and sanitation investments (which would require a
comprehensive impact assessment), no benchmark was established, and no means of tracking the
indicator was put in place. That indicator was removed in the restructuring associated with the
Additional Financing, and replaced with an estimate of the number of beneficiaries. An outcome
indicator for roads investments – monitoring the level of roughness of roads (IRI) – was established
and tracked over the life of the project.
44.      The monitoring framework was amended as part of the 2010 Additional Financing. Of the
original PDO indicators, the indicator related to the fiscal framework was removed. In terms of
output (intermediate outcome) indicators, the key changes were that indicators related to water and
sewerage coverage were amended to directly reflect the number of water and sewerage lines
constructed (thus aligning with the APL2 indicators). The drainage-related output indicator was
also amended in order to reflect AF-funded drainage works, however, in retrospect, it is clear that



14   Other sources say that inflation may have been significantly higher.

                                                             10
the target was highly unrealistic. Both output and outcome targets were reduced, reflecting lower
expected outputs due to cost increases.
45.      Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation: The indicators discussed above were
tracked consistently on a semi-annual basis by the executing agencies. The indicators were closely
tied to the outputs of the project, and therefore provided information to the PBA and to the Bank
on project implementation and were the basis for project restructurings. In addition, the tracking of
road surface quality became embedded in the work of the DVBA and was regularly reported. The
quality of the information was consistent and sound. In addition to specific project output and
outcome monitoring, the PBA, through the project financing, implemented various systems for
public expenditure and overall investment monitoring, including the Provincial System for Public
Investments (SPIP), the Bank of Public Investment Program (BAPIN), and the Sistema de Gestión
y Análisis de la Deuda (SIGADE – System for Debt Analysis and Management). The PBA
consistently tracked and reported relevant fiscal indicators even after the indicator was removed
from the reporting framework.
46.     Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization: The focus during project implementation was on
ensuring that project outputs were made in a timely manner. Indicators were a key tool of
implementation monitoring. Beyond implementation tracking, the monitoring and reporting of road
surface roughness feeds back into the DVBA’s broader road maintenance and investment planning
through the project-financed HDM4 program. In addition, although this was removed from the
project monitoring framework, the Province closely monitors operational and investment spending,
debt levels and debt service obligations, and investment programs, all a vital part of provincial
fiscal management.
Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental and Social Safeguards:
47.     The project was a Category B Project, as works were not expected to cause significant
environmental impacts and measures were identified to mitigate any short-term environmental or
social impacts. No resettlement was anticipated under the project. As part of project preparation,
the PBA developed a safeguards framework to guide the environmental management of subprojects
during the project cycle, revised socio-environmental management instruments in each of the
implementing agencies and ensured that contracting documents included standards for
environmental and social impact monitoring. In addition, the project included financing for
safeguards-related capacity building in the DVBA, DIPAC, and DIPSOH.
48.      In 2010, as part of the APL2 Mid-Term Review (MTR), a case of involuntary resettlement
under that project’s roads component was identified. Although the review indicated that policies
consistent with World Bank requirements had been followed by the implementing agency, it was
noted that the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard had not been triggered in either of the APLs. To
ensure that a framework for possible involuntary resettlement cases was incorporated into project
implementation, the Additional Financing for APL1 triggered OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary
Resettlement. 15 In addition, the APL2 MTR highlighted that borrower capacity for environmental
and social safeguards monitoring could be strengthened. As a result, the PBA prepared an action
plan to strengthen its environmental and social oversight of works. Subsequent supervision reports
indicated significant borrower commitment to safeguards capacity and supervision; post-project
interviews indicated impressive follow-through on the part of the borrower, including incorporation
of World Bank-compliant policies into projects financed internally and through other international



15   At the end, no resettlement took place under the project.

                                                                 11
financiers. In addition, the project implementing agency introduced oversight of occupational
health and safety issues, applying such to a range of infrastructure investments. Prior to this, there
had been no regular oversight of such issues, and its introduction in a systemic manner was a
significant innovation in the region.
49.     No social or environmental safeguards issues were identified under APL1 or its Additional
Financing, thus safeguards compliance is considered satisfactory.

Procurement:
50.     Procurement is assessed as Satisfactory. While there were no specific procurement issues
highlighted during implementation, procurement in general took longer than originally anticipated.
This was largely due to (i) lengthy internal (PBA) procurement processes; (ii) higher bids than
expected, particularly for roads sub-projects in the initial project stages, due to higher international
input prices; and (iii) low capacity to carry out the selection process for technical assistance
assignments. In addition, capital and exchange controls may have discouraged international firms
from bidding on works and, in particular, technical assistance, reducing competition in the
procurement process. While several ISRs for APL1 noted issues with respect to procurement,
including a case of misprocurement, these were mostly references to issues in APL2, and did not
apply to APL1 investments.

Financial Management:
51.     Financial Management (FM) is assessed as Satisfactory. Throughout the implementation
period, the Project indicated adequate FM arrangements that in general complied with Bank
requirements, and no accountability issues were identified. The project implementing unit provided
timely financial information throughout the project, with accounting undertaken within the
framework of the larger PBA accounting systems. The project reached a level of disbursement of
99.5 percent; the remaining balance was refunded to the Bank. Financial and concurrent audits,
performed by the Honorable Tribunal de Cuentas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, PBA’s Supreme
Audit Institution, were received in a timely manner by the Bank. Financial statements all received
unqualified opinions, and no ineligible expenditures were identified.
Post-Completion Operations/Next Phase

52.      The PBA considers the project to have been a major success, with targeted and impactful
investments and significant capacity-building within the implementing agencies (DVBA, DIPAC,
and DIPSOH) through both project activities and the on-the-job training through implementation
of over USD 520 million of investments and activities. PBA budget and financial management –
augmented by targeted technical assistance and IT software and hardware – now provides a
foundation for maintenance and investment planning in overall provincial infrastructure. Although
both phases of the APL are now complete, the implementing agencies’ work with respect to
infrastructure planning and implementation continues, with internal and external funding.
53.      DVBA maintains its primary role in all aspects of provincial road maintenance and
investment. It has incorporated the project-funded HDM4 software into its maintenance and
rehabilitation planning, thereby prioritizing activities based on road quality and traffic volumes. In
addition, it is actively monitoring load limits on provincial roads by using project-funded
equipment. That said, DVBA’s overall budget is entirely dependent on transfers from the PBA, and
its allocation for road maintenance are considered to be significantly underfunded. Additional
information is provided in Annex 4 (Economic Analysis).
54.     With respect to the APL water and sewerage investments, maintenance now falls to the
relevant operators; at the project outset, PBA signed framework agreements with operators

                                                  12
receiving investments from the project specifying operating and maintenance requirements; all
operators are under the regulatory oversight of OCABA (Organismo de Control de Aguas de
Buenos Aires). It is recognized that tariffs do not currently cover the operators’ operating and
maintenance costs (they similarly do not allow for new investment or major rehabilitation). This is
a situation accepted by the provincial government, which has chosen to maintain below-cost tariffs
to consumers and to separately provide subsidies to operators. 16 To date, this arrangement has
functioned successfully.
55.      Ongoing maintenance of the storm drains and sewers financed under the project is the
responsibility of the receiving town (in this case, Arroyo Soto drainage works, in the municipality
of Ituzaingó). The municipality of Ituzaingó already maintains existing sewers and drains without
issue, and problems are not expected. Several policies and guidelines were adopted with respect to
urban planning and flooding mitigation through the project, including land-use guidelines,
environmental protection guidelines as part of urban planning, the adoption of operations and
maintenance (O&M) guidelines for urban drainage, and the preparation and distribution of the
drainage manual, which introduced the integrated hydrology of the watershed as the primary factor
in drainage design.

Section 3: Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

56.      Relevance of Objectives: Substantial. The objective of the project was consistent with
the development priorities and circumstances at the time of project preparation. The 2004 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) had three focus areas – (i) sustained economic growth with equity, (ii)
social inclusion, and (iii) governance – and specified, respectively, the need to maintain and
improve infrastructure in order to promote equitable growth, the restoration of basic social services,
including access to sanitation in the Greater Buenos Aires area, and to improve the effectiveness
of provincial governments.17 The objectives of the project – (i) to enhance the provision of water
and sewerage services for the benefit of low-income people; (ii) to improve high-priority road
segments of the Borrower’s road network; (iii) to mitigate urban flooding; and (iv) to support the
reactivation of the Borrower’s economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness – were
therefore consistent with the 2004 CAS focus areas, and they remain largely relevant at this time.
The World Bank’s current Country Partnership Strategy with Argentina (CPS, FY 2015-2018) is
structured around three major themes – “employment creation in firms and farms”, “availability of
assets for people and households” and “reducing environmental risks and safeguarding natural
resources” – the latter two highly relevant to the project’s investments and activities (water,
sanitation, and drainage investments). In addition to the need for continued broad-based economic
growth, the CPS notes that access to services – e.g., water and sewerage, particularly in areas of
rapid and unplanned growth in the greater Buenos Aires area – and their quality remain uneven in
Argentina, and that investments in flood mitigation measures remain necessary in order to reduce
vulnerability to flooding events in urban areas. It should be noted, though, that the current CPS de-
emphasizes World Bank support for roads and roads maintenance programs, stating that this is an
area that is well established within the Government’s own programs. This is in part a reflection of
the successful work of this and other World Bank-supported projects.




16 This situation is not specific to the PBA. Other provinces and major utilities in Argentina, including AySA, the largest

utility in Argentina, follow the same policy approach.

                                                           13
57.     Relevance of Design and Implementation: Modest. The design of the project was well
targeted to three of the four stated objectives – i.e., road improvements, water and sewerage
investments, and flood mitigation. Project activities and implementation were directly linked to the
PDO. The exception was the fourth project objective – “to support the reactivation of the
Borrower’s economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness”. While there are activities that
were likely to have eased some constraints on economic efficiency – for example, reducing key
road bottlenecks, and improving policies, procedures, strategies and infrastructure related to ports
– outcomes were not established, and the link to such would have been difficult to make.
58.   The quality and relevance of project design was hindered by confusion between
Government program objectives, PDOs, and indicators in the main text of the PAD, the Results
Framework, and the Loan Agreement. Please refer to paragraphs 9 through 13 for additional detail.
59.       Although not a formal PDO, fiscal monitoring and performance was linked to the project
through the inclusion of a monitoring indicator and Phase 2 triggers. The large provincial
investment program was intended to be undertaken within a framework of improved fiscal
performance. While some project-supported activities contributed to the PBA’s monitoring of the
fiscal situation (e.g., the procurement of IT equipment for budget and financial management), the
PBA’s objective – a stable and improving fiscal surplus – was necessarily more reliant on the
province’s fiscal relationship with the national government, on which the project could have little
to no influence.
3.2      Achievement of the Project Development Objectives

60.      Efficacy Ratings: Although the project’s PDO remained unchanged over the life of the
project, some PDO and output indicators were amended during the 2010 restructuring. For that
reason, the project’s efficacy is judged related to both the pre- and post-restructuring PDO
indicators.18 In addition, as there were four parts to the PDO, efficacy is rated separately for each
part, pre- and post-restructuring. Finally, note that although project resources were heavily focused
on roads and water supply and sanitation, evaluation guidelines are that all parts of the PDO should

18Another restructuring took place in October, 2012, at which point some targets were revised slightly in order to align
the targets more closely with likely outcomes. As the revisions were minor, they are not considered for the purpose of
rating the efficacy of the project.

    Roads: Efficacy pre-restructuring: Substantial. Efficacy post-restructuring: Substantial
    61.      The project largely achieved its outcomes and outputs with respect to the roads component
    under both the original and revised expectations; the efficacy for the component is judged to be
    Substantial. The original project design anticipated the rehabilitation and/or widening of 457
    kilometers of provincial roads; over the course of the project, reflecting implementation successes
    and implementation readiness of additional sub-projects, the component was expanded; by project
    closing, 649 kilometers had been rehabilitated or widened. Project investments – in road surface
    rehabilitation, in the development of a strategy for road maintenance and investment at the DVBA,
    and in the control of truck loads on provincial roads – kept road roughness indicators very close to
    the original targets set in 2004 (actual IRI levels were less than 3.3, vs. an original target of 3.0)
    and succeeded in meeting the 2010 revised targets. Individual project-financed roads had an IRI
    higher than 4 in 2004 (i.e., in bad condition). After the works, the IRIs of those roads have improved
    substantially, to no more than 2 (with just few cases slightly over 2). However, project’s
    interventions only accounts for 10% of the total provincial network. By analyzing the whole
    network (as per outcome indicators), it is important to note that, on paper, IRI figures have remained
    roughly the same as the 2004 baseline, and in some cases appear to have worsened. However, the
    overall condition of provincial roads is significantly better than if the rehabilitation had not taken
    place. In terms of traffic, in a sample of 72.5% of the project-rehabilitated roads network, the
    average traffic has increased by 16.5% over a period of 10 years. In addition, by all reports, the
    project activities and their implementation had a very positive effect on capacity building within
    DVBA, with the department now able to measure the condition of roads and prepare and implement
    ongoing maintenance programs based on road condition and traffic volume. Finally, the project
    financed cost overruns of a performance-based roads rehabilitation and maintenance contract
    (CREMA – Contracto de Rehabilitación y Mantenimiento) with a private-sector firm under the
    Additional Financing that was primarily financed under APL2. Although the DVBA and the PBA
    have decided not to continue roads rehabilitation and maintenance under the CREMA framework,
    the experience proved useful in terms of capacity building in performance-based contracting and
    contract supervision. This review considers the achievements under this component to be
    substantial.
    62.      The following table summarizes the achievements of the main PDO and output indicators
    established at Appraisal and during the project restructuring. Annexes 2 and 7 present details on
    the location of the beneficiary roads.

    Water Supply and Sanitation: Efficacy pre-restructuring: Modest.                       Efficacy post-
    restructuring: Substantial
    63.      The efficacy of the project with respect to the original expectations for WSS is judged to
    be Modest, while the efficacy with respect to the revised expectations is rated Substantial. The
    original PDO indicator related to WSS was to reduce waterborne diseases, and the initial
    beneficiary target was that the project would benefit 450,000 persons who would receive new piped
    water connections or access to piped sewerage connections. Because it was not possible to measure
    the original PDO indicator, and as the estimated beneficiaries as of the end of the project were
    notably lower than originally planned, the efficacy of the project with respect to the original WSS
    targets is rated as Modest. This rating is largely due to the inclusion of a PDO indicator that was
    not monitored, as well as to lower component outputs due to increased costs.
    64.       During preparation of the Additional Financing the original PDO indicator was removed,
    and the target for beneficiaries was revised to 259,073, reflecting the higher cost of WSS works.
    The project more than met the revised target, with an estimated total number of beneficiaries of
    314,840. Of these, 85,775 benefited from piped water connections, while 254,057 gained access to
    piped sewerage connections. While actual connections to piped sewerage always lag relative to the
    initial installation, it is estimated that approximately 58,700 households have connected to the piped
    sewerage network, for an active beneficiary population of over 229,000. The efficacy of the project
    with respect to the revised WSS targets is rated as Substantial.

66.      Similar to the roads component, the water and sewerage component resulted in significant
capacity building within DIPAC, the department responsible for capital investments and network
expansion in the water and sewerage sector. At the outset of the project, the unit that evolved into
DIPAC had a staff of eight; over the course of the project, and with the experience and capacity
building of APL1 and APL2, the unit became a 40-person department, completing 64 sub-projects
with a total value of ARS 1.3 billion. DIPAC currently has 15 subprojects valued at a total of ARS
355 million under execution. Funds from several international financiers (the Inter-American
Development Bank, in particular), as well as from the national and provincial governments, are
now managed by DIPAC.

Flood Mitigation: Efficacy pre-restructuring: Modest. Efficacy post-restructuring: Modest.
67.      Only limited funds were originally allocated to drainage investments – total investment
costs were estimated at USD 14.3 million. In addition, investments and activities related to the
objective were lower than initially planned, although all planned investments were ultimately
undertaken under APL2. No PDO indicator was established in either the original project design or
in the revised design. The original output indicator related to the component was “the Number and
Type of Non-Structural Measures Implemented”; this was revised to “Hectares of Improved
Drainage”, with an end-of-project target of 3,063 hectares. In the first years of implementation, the
project supported several policies and guidelines aimed at reducing the impact of flooding on the
built environment. In addition, at closing, the project had financed improvements to the Arroyo
Soto drainage system, affecting 230 hectares in the municipality of Ituzaingó, at a total cost of USD
7.9 million.
68.      The original results framework intended five non-structural (i.e., policies and procedures)
measures related to flooding to be undertaken through the project. Included among these were the
preparation of land-use guidelines and environmental protection guidelines as part of urban
planning as well as the adoption of O&M guidelines for urban drainage. The most successful
project-supported policy related to urban flooding was the development and adoption of an updated
drainage design approach (consolidated into a drainage manual for municipal planners that was
distributed to provincial localities). Earlier design standards did not take into account the larger
watershed (i.e., outside of city boundaries). The revised approach considers the whole watershed
and its hydrologic dynamic in a more holistic and integrated way as primary factors in drainage
design. The borrower reports that the new design guidelines have resulted in a complete rethinking
of the way planners approach drainage infrastructure and in significantly better outcomes in events
that used to cause damaging floods.



                                                 17
 69.      Recent heavy rains in the area of the investment in Ituzaingó – which previously flooded
 streets, homes, and businesses on a regular basis – resulted in no flooding or damage, and surveys
 of residents showed very high levels of satisfaction. These results are consistent with the results of
 the drainage investments under APL2, where flooding in the targeted urban areas has been
 significantly reduced and even eliminated. Despite the fact that the physical outputs of the project
 were noticeably lower than expected, the objective’s efficacy is rated as modest due to the very
 positive impact in the affected areas and the contributions that the non-structural measures have
 made on drainage design and implementation.

 Reinvigoration of the Province’s Economy: Efficacy pre-restructuring: Negligible. Efficacy
 post-restructuring: Negligible.
 70.     It is unfortunately not possible to assess the impact of the project on the objective to support
 the reactivation of the Borrower’s economy and strengthen its regional competitiveness. No
 indicators or framework were established to track this goal, however, even if indicators had been
 specified, it would have been exceedingly difficult to assess causality. The Borrower’s economy
 strengthened and recovered in the years following the approval of this project, however, this is
 consistent with the recovery experienced by Argentina as a whole. Public works financed under the
 project contributed to a sense that the Province was active and engaged in necessary investments
 (which it has built on using its own and other funds since then), contributing to confidence in local
 capacity. By default, however, the efficacy of the project in this respect is considered Negligible.

 Other
 71.       Although it was not a specific project objective, the PBA’s overarching program included
 an objective of strengthening the Province’s fiscal sustainability. In addition, the original results
 framework intended to track the Province’s fiscal monitoring and performance, and the PBA’s
 fiscal results were one of the triggers for APL2. The project provided support to strengthen capacity
 in this regard, including: (i) support for the design and implementation of SIGADE (Sistema de
 Gestión y Análisis de la Deuda), the public debt management system; (ii) IT equipment allowing
 the integration of budget management and financing systems; and (iii) capacity building of the
 statistics office. PBA managers and staff are particularly appreciative of the debt management tools
 and their integration into overall budget management.
 72.     While the PBA provided information regarding its fiscal results on an annual basis to the
 World Bank, its performance deviated noticeably from the targets from the beginning; the APL2
 trigger was waived, and fiscal monitoring and performance was dropped from the Results
 Framework as part of project restructuring during the preparation of the Additional Financing. The
 deterioration in fiscal results was reported to be mainly due to national-level changes in provincial
 responsibilities and revenue sharing. Annex 5 of this ICR provides additional information regarding
 the PBA’s fiscal performance, as well as comparisons between targeted and actual performance
 between 2004 and 2014.

as well as the weighted rate of return. The roads components achieved an estimated ERR of 48
percent; water supply investments achieved an estimated ERR of 30 percent, while sewerage
investments reached an estimated ERR of 13 percent. The combined water supply and sewerage
ERR is calculated to be 16 percent. Drainage investments achieved an estimated 13 percent ERR.
The weighted ERR for the project is estimated to be 36.8 percent, largely due to the strength of the
returns on the roads investments. Additional information regarding the economic analyses is
provided in Annex 4.

* The economic analysis of roads investments at appraisal included a program of roads investments that were
intended to be undertaken under both the APL1 and APL2, and reported an average economic rate of return
(ERR) of 122 percent. When only the investments intended to be financed under APL1 were considered, the
average ERR was 82 percent.
** Economic analyses at appraisal for WSS were undertaken only for sewerage investments. Water supply
investments – whose returns are generally higher than for sewerage – were also undertaken under the project;
water supply subprojects were approximately 22 percent of total costs of the WSS component. The ex-post
economic evaluation includes an analysis of economic returns for water supply investments.

75.    As part of the economic analyses, the costs of roads investments and water supply and
sewerage investments were reviewed relative to costs in similar investments in Argentina and
elsewhere in Latin America. The costs of roads investments are judged to have been very
competitive; water and sewerage investments were somewhat less expensive than investments
elsewhere. The project investments can be considered to have been implemented efficiently.
Additional detail is provided in Annex 4.
76.      Implementation Efficiency: While on paper the project took 10 years to implement,
compared to an initial estimate of five years, an evaluation of disbursements indicates that nearly
all funds were committed and disbursed in a timely and efficient manner. Of the original USD 200
million loan, over 80 percent was disbursed by May, 2009, and 97 percent disbursed by May 2010,
which was less than a year beyond the original completion date. The USD 50 million in Additional
Financing was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors in July of that year, however, signing
was delayed due to negotiations with the national government to guarantee the sub-sovereign loan
to the PBA. Following effectiveness in February, 2012, the AF was fully disbursed by August,
2014 – a two-and-a-half-year period. Completion of the (few) last remaining investments used
counterpart funds; all activities were finalized by this ICR.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of
PDOs, and efficiency)

Overall Outcome Rating:
77.      As detailed in the Efficacy evaluation, the Project’s 2010 restructuring resulted in a change
in the PDO-level indicators, and efficacy ratings were given for each PDO pre- and post-
restructuring. For the overall outcome rating, a split-level evaluation for the overall outcome rating
was calculated. This ICR has rated the overall outcome of the pre-restructuring project as
Moderately Unsatisfactory, taking into account the Substantial rating for relevance of objectives,
the Modest rating for the relevance of design and implementation, the Modest pre-restructuring
efficacy rating, and the Substantial efficiency rating. The post-restructuring rating of the project
has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory, taking into account the Substantial rating for relevance
of objectives, the Modest rating for the relevance of design and implementation, the Substantial
post-restructuring efficacy rating, and the Substantial efficiency rating.
78.     The overall outcome rating for the project is Moderately Unsatisfactory, taking into
account the following calculation:
                                                                     Rating under

 5. Final Rating
                                                                                           Unsatisfactory
79.     The ICR notes that the Bank supervision team consistently rated achievement of the
Development Objectives (DOs) in the Project Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) as
Satisfactory. This was due to the team’s focus during project implementation on the project
components and outputs. Unfortunately, the scope and specifics of the DOs were not well
understood or incorporated into the supervisory framework. The final supervision mission, in May,
2015, undertook a significantly more detailed review of the DOs, assessing that full achievement
was in fact not likely. There is still a disconnect between this final supervisory assessment (ISR)
and the ICR assessment due to the greater rigor and detail of the ICR assessment.
3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
80.      The water supply and sanitation works were implemented in areas where the average IPMH
was 40 percent or higher, ensuring that the poorest segments of the PBA’s population benefited
from the project. In addition, sub-project selection criteria, particularly in water and sanitation, led
to a greater awareness of the importance of poverty mapping in planning and investment decisions,
including those financed internally. This is expected to result in longer-term benefits to poorer
segments of the province’s population. No specific gender activity or gender indicators were put in
place for this project.




                                                  20
(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening
81.      The project resulted in significant capacity building within the PBA’s implementing
agencies. All agencies report greater research, planning, procurement, implementation, and
monitoring capacity; this capacity has been reflected in greater reliance on the agencies, higher
budgetary transfers, and higher investment levels, financed both through internal funding and
international financial institutions. As noted in the ICR for APL2, the UCO went from a unit status
to agency status and, ultimately, to a sub-secretariat. Similarly, the SCEOCI team has been
recognized as one of the best-organized and functioning teams in the country.
(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
82.      The project resulted in significantly greater capacity in the Ministry of Infrastructure and
its implementing agencies with respect to environmental and social safeguards and occupational
health and safety issues. Project documents and counterparts reported consistently over the past
several years that capacity building activities and the incorporation of safeguards monitoring into
project oversight has resulted in a much better understanding of key issues in environmental and
social impacts, and that these have been extended to other parts of the agencies and the provincial
government.
83.     In addition, the project’s focus on the technical feasibility of investments paid heavy
dividends in terms of implementing agency capacity, in particular for roads and drainage. Modern
approaches for technical designs in roads and drainage led to greater staff ability to ask key
questions and consider alternative solutions throughout their portfolios.

Section 4: Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

84.      The risk to development outcomes is Substantial, based on risks related to each area of
project intervention. The risks to the project outcomes related to roads are considered to be
substantial. Investments made in the roads sector have been implemented by the same agency as is
responsible for their maintenance, and all roads have been incorporated into the Province’s roads
database, which is updated through periodic road quality assessments and traffic counts, and the
HDM4, which helps to determine necessary repairs and rehabilitation. The major risk, however, is
the provincial budgetary allocations to DVBA, which is dependent on the PBA’s overall budget
situation. It is currently estimated that the budget for road maintenance is only 30 percent of the
level estimated to be needed to maintain the roads in their current condition. Budgetary resources
for road maintenance need to be raised significantly. In addition, while a detailed survey was
undertaken in 2013, only partial data was input in 2014 and 2015 in the Routine Preservation
Management System – it is necessary to institutionalize and prioritize annual implementation.
85.      Risks to investments in the water supply and sanitation sector are considered to be
moderate. Investments made in the water supply and sewerage sector have been fully transferred
to the water operators responsible for operations and maintenance of the assets. Aguas Bonaerenses
SA (ABSA) has been by far the largest recipient of project investments, which would be expected,
as it serves 27 percent of the population of the Province.19 ABSA currently does not fully cover its
operating costs; its cost-recovery ratio, however, has significantly improved, from 72 percent in
2009 to 92 percent in 2013. Consistent with national policy, which prioritizes the affordability of
water supply tariffs, the PBA covers operating deficits for all water supply and sewerage providers.




19 ABSA is the second-largest operator in the Province after Agua y Saneamientos Argentina SA (AySA), which serves

the greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area).

                                                       21
86.     The drainage investments made in Arroyo Soto have been transferred to the municipality,
which regularly operates and maintains local streets and other local infrastructure. Risks are
considered to be moderate.

Section 5: Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
87.      Project preparation was noticeably thorough despite a very tight timeline (approximately
one year), with an exceptionally high level of detail in most aspects of project documentation. The
project was prepared with close collaboration between the World Bank team and the PBA, which
had a clearly defined program of infrastructure investments combined with goals with respect to
fiscal balance. Although initially Bank management had decided that the project should be prepared
as a traditional Single Investment Loan, the ultimate decision was to structure the project as an
APL. Although this APL was not structured to support reforms (as usually APLs do), it provided
useful flexibility operational implementation, as some infrastructure projects were at a closer
readiness for implementation than others (roads vs. water and sewerage and drainage). Road
investments were focused on efficiency and cost savings, while water and sewerage investments
focused on access in low-income areas.
88.      This ICR notes two aspects of the Bank’s preparation of the project that result in a
moderately unsatisfactory rating for preparation of the project: (i) the size and design of the
institutional development component, and, more substantially (ii) the identification and consistency
of project objectives and elaboration of the results framework. The institutional development
component – defined as activities that would provide capacity building and would support
provincial competitiveness and job creation – was in retrospect too detailed and too prescriptive.
Total costs were estimated at USD 14.8 million, USD 11.7 of which would be financed by the loan.
Over 20 areas of support were specified, with many envisioned as follow-on activities from initial
TA assignments, even though the recommendations from the initial assignments hadn’t yet been
made. In the end, a total of USD 3.6 million was spent on technical assistance – only 24 percent of
the appraisal estimate. The identification of project objectives, their consistency across
documentation, and their relationship to outcome and intermediate indicators, as discussed in
Section 2.3, were problematic. The results framework included aspects that were not well tied to
some project objectives and components, and initially included results that could not be well
measured. For these reasons, Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry has been rated as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision:

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
89.      The Bank’s supervision of the project is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The Bank
team provided strong supervision in many respects, including consistently providing overall
guidance with respect to project implementation, responding in a timely manner to questions from
counterparts, and identifying constraints and weaknesses and designing solutions. Despite the long
implementation period (ten years) and multiple formal task team leaders (four), there was strong
continuity among staff members and team leaders, with both participating over many years. Bank
staff located in Buenos Aires provided key aspects of implementation support, particularly in

                                                22
fiduciary areas and safeguards, which resulted in significant strengthening of PBA capacity in
social and environmental safeguards. PBA counterparts report that the working relationship with
the Bank team was consistently supportive and flexible, albeit tough, and that they greatly
appreciated the implementation support and guidance.
90.      Despite these strengths, however, the Bank team did not identify inconsistencies between
the PDO, project activities, and the monitoring and evaluation framework and, related to that, did
not focus on the ultimate development impact of the project as part of project supervision.
Similarly, project supervisory reporting focused primarily on implementation progress, rather than
on development impact. Bank missions, while undertaken on a semi-annual basis, focused mostly
on contract implementation. Finally, restructuring of project outcome and output indicators
occurred at too late a stage – after nearly full disbursement of the original APL1 loan – to affect
the final evaluation of the project. This is despite the fully successful implementation of works and
institutional strengthening within the PBA.
91.     This ICR also notes that, while for the most part the joint and parallel implementation of
APL1 and APL2 was a positive aspect of implementation, there appears to have been several
instances of confusion between the two, including in both design (re. the APL1 AF Project Paper
citing the APL2 components) and supervision (there were several instances in APL1
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) reporting on issues in APL2). Taking into
account all of the above, the quality of overall Bank supervision is therefore rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
92.     The overall assessment of the Bank’s performance has been rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory, reflecting the ratings for Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry and for
the Quality of Supervision.
5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
93.       The PBA showed consistent commitment to the project throughout implementation,
including allocating sufficient staffing and financial resources, first, to meet the PBA’s 25 percent
co-financing requirement and, later, to cover remaining costs and complete sub-projects when loan
funding had been fully disbursed. The delay in the signing of the AF was attributed to an extended
process of information exchange between the National Government and the PBA in order to issue
the Loan guarantee. It is important to note, however, that the delay in signing most likely did not
result in implementation delays on the ground, as the implementing agencies completed nearly all
procurement processes for activities funded by the AF during the signing delay. Works contracts
were able to be signed immediately after effectiveness of the AF, with total delays compared to the
initial timeframe of perhaps only a few months.
(b)     Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
94.    The coordinating agency (SCEOCI/UCO) and implementing agencies (DVBA, DIPAC,
DIPSOH, under the Ministry of Infrastructure) evolved into highly competent and committed
implementing entities over the course of the project. Although implementation design looked
complicated on paper, with a lead agency within the Ministry of Economy, which then coordinated
with component implementing agencies situated within the relevant provincial departments, in fact

                                                 23
the arrangement worked well. Strong coordinating teams within each agency overcame the
complexity associated with having many entities involved in project execution through close
communication and investment in the development of staff members. This may have been in part
due to the critical mass of activities across the three infrastructure subcomponents financed by both
APL1 and APL2. During Project implementation, the agencies significantly increased their
environmental and social safeguard monitoring capacity. The agencies also actively worked to
streamline and systematize procurement processes throughout implementation. The administrative
delays the Project experienced were largely due to lengthy internal processes that were outside the
scope of the Project. The implementing agencies successfully supervised the implementation of the
Project, enabling the Project to close with full disbursement and substantial achievement of
originally planned works. The implementing agencies produced regular progress reports,
incorporating procurement and financial management reports, as well as outcome/output
monitoring reports.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
95.    The overall performance of the Borrower and the implementing agencies is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, taking into consideration the implementation strengths discussed above,
achievement of results, and compliance with agreements, safeguards and fiduciary controls.

Section 6: Lessons Learned

96.     The following lessons learned have been distilled from the project’s implementation
experience and challenges:
97.      Lending to and engaging directly with the PBA most likely strengthened project
implementation and counterpart capacity. Infrastructure lending in Argentina has generally been
to the national government, with sub-projects and benefits often disbursed throughout the country.
Working directly with the PBA to identify and implement investments most appropriate to the
needs of the province provided an example of the benefits of decentralized decision-making, with
investments better tailored to the needs identified by the PBA. In addition, the size and scope of
the APL1 and its concentration within the PBA resulted in clear impacts: improvements to the built
environment, institutional strengthening within the PBA, and an increase in confidence in the
provincial government’s capacity. The large pipeline of projects financed by APL1 and APL2
succeeded in cementing experience among staff that could then be used independently of World
Bank financing.
98.      It is unclear whether the APL structure was an appropriate means of support to the
PBA’s investment program. While the APL structure provided flexibility in terms of day-to-day
operational implementation, this review has not been able to identify any particular advantage to
the APL structure for promoting reforms or supporting the PBA’s investment program. This review
notes that both APL1 and APL2 were straightforward investment projects, with no planned reforms
related to the targeted sectors that were often included in APLs (e.g., ensuring sustainable funding
for asset maintenance). Rather than an APL structure, a straightforward Additional Financing or,
alternatively, a follow-on project could have been pursued. The choice to use an APL structure
probably contributed to the focus in the APL1 PAD on the PBA’s fiscal restructuring and
performance, despite the fact that the APL1 did not support structural reforms, and may have
contributed to the complexity observed in the project’s PDOs, indicators, and triggers.
99.      Good selection of project implementation arrangements can strategically foster
institutional strengthening. The involvement of the Ministry of Economy as the lead implementing

                                                 24
agency was a strategic decision to ensure efficient implementation of a multi-sector project,
including timely allocations of funds. As a result of the project, the PBA created a consolidated
unit dedicated to implementing projects with credit from international organizations that had
sufficient capacity to coordinate other ministries and institutions within the Province (such as the
Ministry of Infrastructure). In the ten years since the launch of the APL Program, the SCEOCI has
become integrated in the operating structure of the PBA, going from unit status to agency status to
becoming a sub-secretariat. The establishment of a sub-secretariat with significant experience
implementing projects with foreign credit has had a multiplier effect, facilitating the PBA’s ability
to borrow from other IFIs.
100.    World Bank safeguards requirements can be adopted and championed by borrowers.
Compliance with environmental, social, and workplace health and safety safeguards is often viewed
with skepticism by borrowers. In this case, however, incorporation of safeguards frameworks into
planning and design phases resulted in the PBA incorporating several safeguards into their own
processes and procedures.
101.    Early review and adjustment of design standards pays dividends in the long run.
Implementation of the water and sanitation component and the drainage component was delayed
somewhat due to the need to ensure adequate organizational and technical feasibility of
investments. Implementation and disbursement speed could have happened more quickly without
the additional technical reviews required by the Bank supervision team, but would not have yielded
the same post-construction results, and, in particular, the technical capacity strengthening of the
implementing agencies.

Section 7: Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

102.     National Government/Guarantor: The national government considers that the criteria
used to evaluate the Project results as Moderately Unsatisfactory are not appropriate. The document
states that, despite having been a satisfactory project, the fact that the indicators were not well
defined and weren’t modified in time renders this project unsatisfactory. We consider that this
statement distorts the purpose of the evaluation, which ends up focusing on the elaboration of the
indicators and their targets, instead of the implementation of the project. Additionally, it is
important to point out that of the 23 evaluations of the project during its implementation, 22
assessed it as satisfactory. Only in the last one (May, 2015) was it assessed as moderately
satisfactory.

103.     Grantee/Implementing agencies: The PBA considers that the implementation
performance of the Project was successful. Both loans (IBRD 7268-AR and 7947-AR) were
disbursed in a timely and efficient manner. The results were achieved and in some cases surpassed;
the works met the required quality standards and were implemented in the poorest segments of the
population of the PBA, and the capacities of the participating teams were strengthened in the
process. However, the PBA agrees with the Bank’s conclusion that the results indicators chosen for
the Program were not adequate and were not restructured during its lifetime. The PBA understands
that this is attributable to the design of the operation and not to the performance of the teams
involved in project implementation.

4.      The water and sewerage component financed the extension of treated water and sewerage
networks to unserved, low-income areas. Targeted areas, in addition to being technically feasible,
met identified poverty criteria (areas had to have an Index of Household Material Deprivation
(Indice de Privación Material de Hogares (IPMH)) higher than 40 percent. In addition, beneficiary
operators had to have signed a binding Framework Agreement, which established the legal and
operating requirements for the investments, with the PBA.

5.      Nine subprojects in eight municipalities were financed under the original Loan (four water
extension projects; five sewerage extension projects). Three sewerage projects were fully financed
under the Additional Financing in two municipalities. In addition, four sewerage projects in two
municipalities that received initial financing from APL2 were completed using the APL1
Additional Financing. Sub-projects are summarized in the following table.

  7.       The drainage component financed storm sewers in the municipality of Arroyo Soto, at a
  total cost of USD 7.9 million (100% finance under the IBRD Additional Financing). The storm
  sewerage investments improved drainage in an urban area of 230 hectares, benefitting
  approximately 6,000 households.

  9.       The technical assistance component was formally designed around two main areas of
  support – Institutional Strengthening (estimated total costs of USD 7.2 million), with planned
  support to both implementing agencies in their areas of functional responsibility and to other
  provincial government functions (water regulation, environmental regulation), and Pre-Investment
  for Competitiveness and Job Creation (estimated total costs of USD 7.6 million), with a goal of
  identifying strategic growth sectors and supporting private investment. The component also
  planned to support Project Management (estimated total costs of USD 5.8 million).

  10.     The following table summarizes the major technical assistance activities undertaken within
  the framework of the project. Note that additional activities were carried out but have not been
  included here due to their marginal contribution to project costs.

(including assumptions in the analysis)

I.      Introduction
1.       Ex-post economic analyses were undertaken for the roads, water supply and sanitation, and
drainage investments. This annex provides information regarding the original economic analyses
undertaken at appraisal, the ex-post economic analyses, and additional information regarding other
aspects of investment efficiency, as available, and maintenance of project investments. In addition,
recent financial performance of a key water utility is provided as a proxy for ongoing operations
and maintenance of water utilities that have received project-financed water and sanitation assets.
2.       Information is provided separately for (i) roads investments and (ii) water supply and
sanitation and urban drainage investments.

II.     Roads Investments
A.      Economic Analysis at Appraisal
3.       The original economic analysis for the roads investments analyzed a 10-year,
comprehensive road rehabilitation, improvement, and construction program in the Province of
Buenos Aires. Initial prioritization of the full program was undertaken using the HDM-4 program,
taking into account traffic levels and composition, road conditions, and location. Prioritization
criteria included: (i) reducing the cost of travel and operations through the rehabilitation of the
primary paved inter-urban network, (ii) reducing congestion and improving transport efficiency in
the metropolitan Buenos Aires area, (iii) improving access to ports, and (iv) improving linkages to
local communities. Based on those priorities, a full economic evaluation was carried out for 5,136
kilometers of road network. Investment priorities were then established given budgetary and
funding limitations, i.e., limited to investments intended to be financed under APL1 (and ultimately
under the Additional Financing). The results of the original economic analysis are presented here:

B.      Ex-Post Economic Analysis
4.     An economic analysis of the project’s roads component was undertaken using the HDM-4
model on a sample of works and results, extrapolating the results to the whole of the kilometers of
road executed under the APL1 and its Additional Financing. The analysis was based on

                                                 37
rehabilitation works, which accounted for the large majority of works under the project; a sample
of seven rehabilitation sub-projects was taken, totaling 206.7 kilometers.
5.      The following table provides the results of the evaluation of the sample investments.

     Total                                     206.7            32.5                 48.4%

6.       Extrapolating from the above sample for a total of 650 kilometers rehabilitated under the
project, the analysis indicates an estimated NPV of USD 106.6 million, an average NPV per
kilometer of USD 164,000, and an IRR of 48.4 percent. The IRR (and NPV) is lower than the ex-
ante estimates of 82 percent (NPV of USD 357). While the estimated benefits from the road
investments are largely the same as those estimated at appraisal, the lower IRR and NPV are due
nearly entirely to the higher actual costs of investment. That said, the estimated returns are still
significantly higher than the discount rate of 12 percent and the cost of capital. The returns to the
investments under the component remain impressive.

C.      Project Cost and Efficiency Analysis
7.       The total cost of investments financed under APL1 and the Additional Financing was
approximately USD 200 million (USD 177.7 million for APL1 investments and USD 22.2 million
under the Additional Financing). A summary of costs – including the original contracted prices,
contract modifications, and price adjustments – are provided in the table below. The contracted
costs for the works – ignoring post- signing cost increases – was nearly twice as much as the costs
expected at appraisal.

8.       The above tables show that, while there were some post-signing cost- and price increases
that affected contracts funded by the project, on the whole they were minor. The one exception to
this was the main contract for road rehabilitation, which was under a Contrato de Rehabilitación y
Mantenimiento (CREMA – Performance-Based Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Contract),
which was intended to be an output-based contract for road rehabilitation and maintenance.
Structured into the contract pricing were automatic price increases related to the passage of time;
due to significant delays in the implementation of the rehabilitation portion of the contract, the cost
of this portion of the contract was significantly more expensive than expected – in this instance the
cost of the contract was approximately 45 percent higher than expected.
9.       A review of the above per-kilometer costs indicate that the actual costs under the project –
while nearly double the cost of the project appraisal estimates– were in fact consistent with
rehabilitation and other roadwork costs financed by other sources and in other countries in the
region. That is, they can be considered fair and efficient.20 The significant discrepancy between the
final costs of the roads component and the initial estimate is due to two factors: (i) appraisal costs
were significantly underestimated; to some degree this is due to the fact that proposed works were
only at a preliminary design stage; (ii) construction costs experienced noticeable increases
worldwide between 2004 and 2006, largely linked to significant increases in the cost of oil; and
(iii) US Dollar cost increases between appraisal and contracting (2004 vs. 2006), during which time
the USD/ARS exchange rate remained largely steady, while local prices experienced a significant
increase. The last factor alone resulted in an approximately 30 percent increase in the USD price
of contracts.

D.       Evaluation of the Condition of the Road Network
10.     The Road Directorate carried out a measurement of the primary and secondary paved road
network, consolidating the outcomes of the traffic measurements and evaluation in a current
condition / traffic matrix (consolidation with cumulative 2014 measurements), covering a total of
6,070.7 km measured, which means an increase in measurements with respect to coverage of 14%
compared to the network measured in 2004 (5,316 km).
11.     The following chart provides a comparison of the condition ex ante (2004) and ex post
(2014) of the paved road network, taking into account roughness measurements.

12.       The average IRI of the paved road network remained steady throughout time: 2.98 IRI
measured in 2004 to 2.97 m/km in 2014. The conclusion of the analysis of the condition of the road
network is that approximately 50 percent of road network is in good conditions, while 50 percent
is in fair to poor condition. That said, while the percentage of roads considered in good condition
has remained the same over the decade under evaluation, a much higher percentage of roads was
considered to be in poor condition in 2014 (23 percent) compared to 2004 (10 percent). While
additional evaluation would be necessary to determine the cause of the changes in road quality, a
possible conclusion is that, while DVBA has been able to maintain the quality of major roads
(including through the investments financed by APL1 and its Additional Financing), it has not been
able to expand its attention to smaller roads in fair condition and at risk of falling into poor condition.
Additional capital investment in roads in fair and poor condition is likely necessary in order to raise
the overall condition of roads. However, this would need to be complemented by a greater focus
on maintenance.
13.    It is important to note that, prior to the project, roads targeted for rehabilitation had
an IRI higher than 4 -- i.e., in bad condition. After the works, the IRIs of those roads
improved substantially, to no more than 2 (with just few cases slightly over 2). However,
the project’s interventions only account for approximately 10% of the total provincial network.

E.      Sustainability of Road Investments
14.      Although the IRI targets have been met for the network’s paved roads, with an average IRI
for the primary and secondary network of 2.97 m/km, an evaluation of the road maintenance budget
relative to the ongoing needs of road assets in the province indicates that there is a need to increase
DVBA’s budget for road maintenance.
15.     DVBA’s total budget (in ARS) over the last four years (2010 – 2014) has increased a total
of approximately 15 percent – from ARS 1.2 billion in 2010 to ARS 1.4 billion in 2014. In USD
terms, however, the budget has decreased by 44 percent over the same period, from USD 313.9



                                                   40
million (3.90 ARS/USD on average in 2010) down to USD 176.0 million in 2014 (8 ARS/USD on
average).21
16.     In addition to the declines in USD terms, the maintenance budget is only a small portion
of the total budget. From 2011 to 2014, the maintenance budget increased in ARS from 115.9
million to 159.3 million. In USD terms, this was a decrease of 29.3 percent – to USD 19.9 million
equivalent in 2014. The road maintenance budget is only 11 percent of the total DVBA budget. In
contrast, it is estimated that a minimum of ARS 500 million annually should be allocated to road
maintenance. The current maintenance allocation is estimated to be only 32 percent of the
recommended amount. The shortfall in the maintenance budget calls into question the sustainability
of DVBA’s major rehabilitation investments over the past decade.

III.     Water Supply and Sanitation and Drainage Investments
A.       Introduction
17.      An economic and financial analysis was carried out to evaluate the project’s water,
sewerage, and drainage investments pre- and post-project. The evaluation was conducted using the
same methodology – a cost-benefit analysis – as was conducted at appraisal. At the time of appraisal
of the original project and the Additional Financing, the economic analyses of the water and
sanitation component of the project evaluated the returns only for the sewerage investments. For
this ICR, the evaluation included not only sewerage interventions but also water network extensions.
Benefits for sewerage were measured as savings resulting from connecting to the sewerage network
versus maintaining their septic tanks. Benefits from water were measured as improved water
service.
18.     At appraisal, drainage sub-components were evaluated as follows. For small drainage
works affecting the poorest segments of the population and where the rate of recurrence of flooding
was under five years, a cost effectiveness approach was selected. For basins with permanent or
semi-permanent drainage basins with flood recurrence rates over two years, a cost benefit approach
was selected, with a discount rate of 12 percent. For this ICR, the evaluation was conducted using
a cost-benefit approach as well, measuring benefits as avoided loss of time at work (for the working
population) and avoided loss of time at school (for the student population) when flooding reduced.

Beneficiaries
19.     The following table summarizes the expected and actual number of beneficiaries for (i) the
water supply and sewerage component and (ii) the drainage component.

21 Note that the recommendation at the time of project Appraisal was that a minimum maintenance budget of USD 15

million equivalent would be maintained each year. In retrospect, this is far below levels for adequate maintenance.

B.          Costs
20.      Costs of interventions were transformed to 2004 prices for interventions implemented
under the original APL1, and to 2010 prices for interventions implemented under the AF. Official
figures for the Consumer Price Index and applicable exchange rates, as published by INDEC, were
used.
21.      During the implementation period the value of the Argentinean peso fluctuated widely.
According to official figures published by INDEC, inflation was 139 percent from 2004 to 201422,
while depreciation of the peso against the USD was 64 percent. Inflation and changes in the
exchange rate affected the project in different ways. Depreciation of the Argentinean peso relative
to the US dollar helped the project, as every dollar disbursed from the Loan effectively purchased
more Pesos. However, inflation in Argentina resulted in higher costs in local currency, offsetting
the improved purchasing power of the US dollar. For water and sanitation investments financed
under the original loan, it is estimated that local prices were 21 percent higher (in nominal terms)
than 2004 prices. For sanitation investments financed under the Additional Financing, local prices
are estimated to have been eight percent higher than expected during preparation of the AF.
22.     The following chart shows the pattern of Argentinian inflation and the Peso/USD exchange
rate over the course of project implementation. The left axis provides the exchange rate; the right
axis provides the rate of inflation. While local inflation and the depreciation of the Peso have
generally moved in the same direction, it is important to note that there has been a lag in Peso
depreciation relative to inflation. That is, local price increases due to inflation have not been
immediately matched by depreciation of the Peso, and therefore there has been some loss of
purchasing power of the US Dollar-denominated loan during the implementation period. Only in
2014 was this pattern reversed.

23.     Results of the cost analysis of water supply and sanitation investments show that actual
unit cost per service line was similar to what was expected. Moreover, the resulting unit cost per
connection was close to the ceiling established in the original project (USD 830) as eligible for
financing.

25.     Drainage works were implemented only under the AF and only in one of the two areas
studied at the time. For this specific area, actual costs were 14 percent lower than expected.

C.       Benefits
26.      Sewerage Investments. For sewerage investments, benefits were estimated as savings when
switching from septic tanks to conventional sewerage connection. Costs of cleaning septic tank and
rehabilitating when it reaches its lifetime corresponded to USD 268 per year23 per household and
corresponded to actual prices paid in the project areas. This benefit is partially offset by the cost




23 This price consists of two components: cleaning the septic tank is about USD 29 per month per time and the required

frequency is every other month. Rehabilitating the septic tank is recommended after 15 years of use at an approximate
cost is USD 750.

                                                         43
of investment of adjusting in-house connections, which was estimated at the time of appraisal as
USD 200 (without taxes).
27.      The benefits do not apply to all households with sewerage service lines built under the
project, as not all of them connect to the sewerage system. The effective connection rate is not
known due to the practice used by sewerage operators of charging the sewerage fee to all
beneficiaries regardless of being connected or not. At the time of preparation of the AF, a
connection rate of 64 percent was expected.

28.     At the time of preparation of the AF, out of 20,700 sewerage service lines built, only 8%
were active connections. Interventions implemented under the AF built 38,000 services lines. This
evaluation tested results under different connection rate scenarios.
29.     Water Interventions. For water interventions, benefits were estimated using avoided costs
obtained from works by beneficiaries. Before the interventions households had to buy water from
private vendors at prices that at the time ranged from ARS 7 to ARS 15 24 for a 20-liter container.
Households need at least 20-liters per day to satisfy basic cooking and drinking needs of all
members of the family. They are assumed to complement this very small amount of purchased
water with additional sources such as nearby streams, digging wells, or rain water for other uses.
Note that this is a very conservative estimate of purchased water, and likely underestimates the cost
to households of obtaining water prior to connection to the piped water system. In addition, the
analysis does not include the cost of household members’ time in fetching water from other sources.
30.     For this evaluation the benefits were estimated taking into account the price paid to water
vendors, using the lowest price paid for a 20-liter container (ARS7). These prices were transformed
to 2004 prices.

31.      Drainage. The benefits from drainage works were estimated based on results of a survey
conducted in September 2015 by the PBA25 in the target area. The objective of the survey was to
evaluate the impact that drainage works had on residents. The questionnaires were applied to two
areas: (i) a control area where the situation was similar to the without-project scenario; and (ii) the
project area. The control area is located in the same neighborhood as the intervention area.
Residents living in the control area are currently affected in a way similar to the project
beneficiaries prior to project investments. Blue lines represent the streets where drainage
interventions were implemented; while red lines represent the streets where drainage interventions
are not implemented. Control areas corresponded to the area highlighted with red; while project
area is highlighted with blue.




32.     The project area consists of about 6,000 dwellings with 18,000 residents. Twenty-six
percent are under the age of 18; and 53 percent are active, working-age.

33.     Strong rains (at least 90mm per day) in the area occur with a frequency as high as ten times
a year and generate floods that disrupt regular activity. In the without-project situation, 49 percent
of the houses were affected with floods, either with water accumulation on the street, in their front
yards, or inside their houses. With the intervention, the number of affected houses was reduced by
57 percent.
34.     During the floods the working population reports trouble getting out of their houses to get
to work, causing them to miss work or arrive late. Students were similarly affected, either missing
school or arriving late. In addition, parents often need to miss work when students are unable to get

35.     Benefits were estimated only as the avoided loss of time at work (for the working
population) and avoided loss of time at school (for the student population). Reduction in the cost
of damage to properties was not estimated due to lack of data.
36.    To estimate the cost of time for those who miss school or work the Argentinian minimum
wage per day (USD 29) was used; 50 percent of the value was applied for students and adults
accompanying the student. For lateness, 50 percent of the value was applied.

C.         Economic Returns
37.      The WSS and drainage investments generated positive economic returns. The estimated
ERR of water investments is 30 percent. With respect to sewerage investments, assuming a
sewerage connection rate of 64 percent, the ERR is estimated to be 13 percent. The estimate for
drainage investments – also 13 percent – is considered conservative given that main benefit – the
avoided damage costs in property and infrastructure, was not quantified. The combined ERR of the
water supply, sewerage, and drainage investments is estimated to be 16 percent. At a discount rate
of 12 percent, the net present value is estimated to be USD 44 million. Actual benefits are very
likely higher, as several benefits cannot not be quantified, including pollution reductions and health
improvements resulting from investments in sewerage.

38.     While the actual results of WSS and drainage were lower than expected both at the
appraisal of the original project and at the preparation of the AF, results are considered good for
these types of projects, especially considering that the unit costs were 16 percent higher than
expected, and that the evaluation cannot take into consideration a number of benefits that could not
be quantified.

D.         Financial Returns to Project Investments
39.     An analysis of the financial returns to the project was conducted for WSS investments, as
those investments are operated by revenue-generating entities. Costs and benefits were included
as they were paid or received by the operator. Costs consisted only of operating costs, as investment
costs were fully financed by the PBA. As with the economic evaluation, all prices were transformed
to 2004 or 2010 prices.
40.     Net financial benefits were estimated as incremental revenues minus incremental operating
costs. Incremental revenues consisted of sewerage revenues generated by service expansion.
Revenues were estimated as the sewerage bill times 100 percent of beneficiaries, whether or not
the beneficiary household was connected to the network. (Operators begin billing sewerage service
when sewer networks are built and households are able to connect to the system. If households do
not connect to the system they are still billed.) Some households do not pay, however, and hence
revenues were adjusted with the revenue collection rate, estimated at 60 percent of billing, based
on financial information from operators. Operating costs related to the new investments are then
subtracted from the incremental revenues to determine the project’s net financial benefits.
41.   The sewerage tariff corresponds to actual charges applied by operators, which in the case
of ABSA, the main operator, is ARS 2.39 per cubic meter (about USD 0.25/m3).
42.     Results show that sewerage interventions are not financially sustainable at current tariffs
and collection efficiency. The annual operating deficit is as high as USD 655,000 in all
interventions of the project. Efforts have been made in order to improve the sustainability of the

                                                    47
water and sewerage utilities. In particular, tariffs have increased at a higher rate than operating
costs. Additional information is provided in the following financial analysis of ABSA.

E.          Financial Analysis of Agua Bonaerenses SA (ABSA)
43.     There are a variety of operators of sewerage services in the PBA. The composition of
providers and the share in the market is as follows: 49 percent of the population is served by AySA
(Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos SA); 27 percent by ABSA (Aguas Bonaerenses SA); 17 percent
by municipalities; 4 percent by municipalities with participation of private parties; and 3 percent
by cooperatives.26
43.     A financial analysis was conducted only for ABSA, as they are the main operator of
investments implemented under the original project and the AF. Other interventions were
conducted in the municipalities of San Nicolas and Berazategui, however their financial
information was not available – the municipalities as providers of the service do not separate their
accounting system by service.
44.      ABSA provides water and sanitation services for more than 3 million people living in 80
localities. The financial analysis was based on financial statements from 2007-2013 and some
additional financial indicators (Tables 3.8 and 3.9). Results of the analysis show that ABSA has
improved its financial performance over the last several years and that it is close to achieving
financial sustainability for its operations.
45.     ABSA’s net income has been negative through the period under review, although net losses
have decreased from 68 percent of revenues in 2007 to 6 percent in 2013. This situation has made
ABSA less dependent on resources from the PBA to pay for operations. Funds transferred from
PBA varied widely during the period, decreasing from 1.6 times total billed revenues in 2007 to
almost none in 2013.
46.     From 2009 to 2013 the financial situation improved, as revenues increased by 224 percent,
while operating costs increased by only 155 percent. The increase in revenues was due to tariff
increases as well as expansion of the customer base. As a result, the operating cost recovery ratio
improved from 72 percent in 2009 to 92 percent in 2013.

Annex 5. Province of Buenos Aires: Provincial Fiscal Indicators

1.      Although it was not a specific project objective, because the PBA’s overarching program
included an objective of strengthening the Province’s fiscal sustainability, the original results
framework intended to track the Province’s fiscal monitoring and performance. The project tracked
fiscal performance – the PBA sent fiscal indicators to the Bank team on an annual basis – and
provided support to strengthen capacity in this regard. This included: (i) support for the design and
implementation of SIGADE (Sistema de Gestión y Análisis de la Dueda, the public debt
management system); (ii) IT equipment allowing the integration of budget management and
financing systems; and (iii) capacity building of the statistics office. PBA managers and staff are
particularly appreciative of the debt management tools and their integration into overall budget
management. Tables 5.1 and 5.2, attached to this Annex, provide the PBA’s original projections
for key fiscal indicators and actual performance up to 2013.

2.      The Province’s fiscal situation changed during implementation. This was reported in
project documentation (Project Paper for APL1 Additional Financing; PAD for APL2) to be due
to national-level changes in provincial responsibilities and revenue sharing, as well as due to a
national decision to increase, specifically, teacher salaries, which are the responsibility of the
provinces.

3.      PBA was successful in increasing the amount of its own revenues (as a percent of net
current revenues). It had been expected that its own revenues would stabilize at about 58 percent
of total revenues; in fact, own revenues were at or above that level throughout the review period,
including reaching 63 percent in 2008/2009. Chart 5.1, which is attached to this Annex, shows the
evolution of PBA’s own revenues compared to original projections.

4.     It was expected that the Province would be able to run a primary surplus; however, with
the exception of 2013, there has been a primary deficit. This has largely been due to higher-than-
expected personnel expenses – primarily the result of nationally-mandated salary increases for
personnel costs that are the responsibility of the provinces (e.g., teacher salaries). Personnel
expenses reached 63 percent of revenues as of 2013. Chart 5.2 shows the evolution of personnel
expenses over the project implementation period compared to initial projections.

5.      The higher-than-expected personnel expenses and (presumed) lower, discretionary
contributions from the national government resulted in (i) lower current savings and (ii) lower
capital expenditures than original projected. Current savings were expected to rise from a low of
7 percent in 2005 to 17 percent in 2015, providing the fiscal space for the PBA to maintain capital
expenditures at between 7 and 10 percent of net current revenues for the projected period and to
generate a primary balance. Instead, current savings were reported to be only 4 percent in 2005
and to worsen significantly in the following years, reaching nearly -10 percent of net current
revenues in 2009, 2011, and 2012. PBA reported that they generated no current savings in 2013;
however, they projected that they would generated current savings of 2 percent of net current
revenues in 2014. The lack of fiscal space resulted in reported capital expenditures of 8 percent in
2005 through 2008, 6 percent in 2009 through 2011, and 4 percent in 2012 and 2013. Presumably
these capital expenditures were financed with new debt, including the World Bank-financed APL1
and APL2. Chart 5.3 shows projected v. actual current savings.

                                                 50
6.      On a more positive note, debt stock and debt service improved at a faster rate than initially
projected, although it should be noted that the 2013 actual debt stock and originally-projected 2014
debt stock are approximately equal. Lower debt levels in earlier years were reported in project
documentation to have been due to debt restructurings with the national government. Debt service
remains significantly below the amounts initially projected, presumably due to both lower overall
debt levels and renegotiated interest rates. Charts 5.4 and 5.5 show projected v. actual debt stock
and debt service.

7.     The PBA has not provided projections of future fiscal performance, and Bank staff did not
analyze projections as part of project supervision. That said, with the exception of the high level
of expenditures on personnel and the low level of savings, the other indicators reported by the
province are trending in the right direction and are significantly stronger than the projections made
during the start of the project. The two areas of potential concern remain the high expenditures
devoted to personnel expenses and the low savings. The Province may also have higher upcoming
debt service obligations, particularly as the grace periods for the post-crisis lending from IBRD
and the Inter-American Development Bank expire.

1.        Context

The Buenos Aires Infrastructure Sustainable Investment Development Program (2004-2010) was designed
against the backdrop of the severe economic crisis of 2001-2002 from which Argentina emerged. Because
of the crisis, fiscal discipline became a priority for the provincial government, and in 2003 it resulted in a
small primary surplus. Although the spending policy was more austere, it continued providing basic and
unavoidable services, focusing primarily on the social sectors that were hardest hit by the crisis. Based on
projections for 2004, which showed encouraging signs of economic recovery, it was possible to design a
management plan for public services in the Province of Buenos Aires, which identified investment needs
of about USD 700 million for the period 2004-2010 in two main infrastructure sectors: roads and water
(sewers and drainage).

2.        Description of the Project

2.1. Project development objective

The Project’s objective is to enhance the provision of infrastructure services in the province in a framework
of fiscal responsibility, with a view to supporting the return to a sustainable path of economic growth that
will pave the way for poverty reduction and increased social equity.

This objective was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) considered by the Executive
Directors of the Bank on April 14, 2004, which sought to reduce the extent and severity of poverty in
Argentina by focusing on: (i) promoting sustained economic growth with equity; (ii) social inclusion; and
(iii) improving governance by strengthening the institutions and increasing responsibility and transparency.
The CAS identified infrastructure services as the pillars of sustainable economic growth.

Reconstruction of the province’s basic infrastructure and the simultaneous search for gradual convergence
toward fiscal equilibrium were an essential step for sustainable economic growth. Moreover, by promoting
fiscal responsibility and institutional capacity in the provincial government, the Project sought to create a
strategic framework and policy guidelines with which future infrastructure investments could be made to
help reduce poverty in the province.

2.2. Components

On this basis, three works components were identified for infrastructure investment and one for technical
assistance:

     COMPONENT                 OBJECTIVE

     Provincial roads
                               Rehabilitate high-priority segments of the productive road network,
     (APL 1/FA)
                               eliminate critical bottlenecks, and implement a low-cost sustainable
                               maintenance system for the entire network, with a view to reducing
                               transportation costs in the province and improving competitiveness in
                               general.




                                                     58
     Water and sanitation
                                  Expand water supply coverage and, especially, sewerage networks,
     (APL 1 and FA)
                                  subsidizing access to these services for approximately one half million
                                  low-income persons who live in highly vulnerable areas—most of whom
                                  are in the Conurbano Bonaerense—in terms of sanitation and/or
                                  environment.

     Drainage                     Mitigate flooding caused by heavy downpours of relatively short duration
     (APL 1 and FA)               that cause extensive damage to households, especially low-income ones,
                                  as well as to industries and commercial activities, both directly and
                                  indirectly, owing to disruptions in transportation and other services.

     Technical assistance         Support the design and implementation of measures needed in the medium
     (APL 1)                      and long term to rebuild the province’s institutional capacity, which
                                  requires: (i) implementing the proposed infrastructure program,
                                  strengthening the execution capacity of the participating agencies; and (ii)
                                  supporting the province’s strategic planning capacity to promote
                                  competitiveness and job creation.

                                  Subcomponents:
                                  - Institutional strengthening
                                  - Pre-investment for competitiveness and job creation




3.          Results

Indicators achieved in the works component

The works were strategically important for advancing on the path of economic growth, poverty reduction,
and increased social equity in the province.

        The 649.36 km of rehabilitated roads, and 28.11 km of widened urban roads contributed to improved
         regional productivity and competitiveness in the domestic and international markets.

         314,840 persons living in the province’s highly vulnerable areas in terms of sanitation and/or
         environment.
        Improved drainage over a 230-hectare area with investments in urban drainage helped reduce flooding
         caused by rains that resulted in major losses for households, especially low-income households, as
         well as for industries and commercial activities, both directly and indirectly, owing to disruptions in
         transportation and other services.

Indicators achieved in the technical assistance component

 Four urban drainage non-structural measures implemented by the province (5 measures were
  implemented):

    (1) It is important to note that the change of $ 2,724,481.65 in the “Arroyo Sotto Sanitation” project is due to the increased
    cost for removal of public services, in order to relocate the lines that connect to the mains in the project. The impact on the
    reduction of its scope is minimal, given that the critical hectares will have better drainage that will mitígate the effect of the rains.

Summary of main studies on the technical assistance component

Institutional strengthening

The institutional strengthening component was designed to support measures for the development of
institutional capacities in the entities engaged directly or indirectly in the execution of subprojects;
strengthen infrastructure planning functions in the province; improve the regulatory capacity for the
provision of public services, and generate better information systems for decision making by establishing
a provincial system with georeferenced information and supporting the digitalization of cadastral data.

In the context of this component a series of studies was conducted to strengthen institutional, regulatory,
and planning capacity in the Province of Buenos Aires. The main studies are as follows.

Strengthening of the capacity to manage the public debt in the Province of Buenos Aires (SIGADE)
By providing computer hardware and software through the Project, it was possible to upgrade the current
information system for recording the debt by implementing the SIGADE Version 6 program, which


                                                                              61
generated quality, reliable, transparent, and permanently updated information for optimum management of
the debt. This was accompanied by human resources skilled in the system’s implementation, facilitating the
insertion of SIGADE in the province’s comprehensive financial information system. IT personnel of the
Provincial Directorate of Debt and Public Credit were trained in the operation and maintenance of the local
network for the normal operation of SIGADE.

Design and implementation of the Provincial Public Investment System (SPIP)
Through the SPIP it was possible to upgrade the information on public investment projects in the province;
provide immediate access to information on the status of projects for each district, which is uploaded into
the system; apply criteria and indicators to prioritize projects; and generate detailed reports on the projects
for officials.

Design of a strategy to deal with the erosion problem on the Buenos Aires coast
The DHI (MIKE 21 LITPACK) system for predicting tidal currents that was acquired analyzes the behavior
of coastal processes on the maritime coast of the Province of Buenos Aires, estimates the potential coastal
sediment transport caused by waves and currents in different coastal areas, the sediment balance, the
location of erosion-accretion, and the interrelationship of existing or projected coastal structures. The
system optimizes the level of environmental-economic design of maritime works projects to be executed
all along the provincial maritime coast, raising them to international quality standards.

Auditing and Pilot Development of the Information and Auditing System of the Regulatory
Framework of the Water and Sanitation Sector in the Province of Buenos Aires
An information and regulatory auditing system of the province’s water and sanitation sector was prepared
and developed. It included Aguas Bonaerenses S.A. (ABSA), Obras Sanitarias de Mar del Plata (OSSE),
Cooperativa Limitada de Consumo de Electricidad y Servicios Anexos de Olavarría, the Municipality of
Benito Juárez, the Municipality of Saladillo, and the Cooperativa de Provisión de Agua Potable de Abasto.
Management tools have been provided to the regulatory authority (Ministry of Infrastructure) and OCABA
(water control authority of Buenos Aires), to implement the current regulatory framework of the province’s
water and sanitation sector. Their use will mitigate information asymmetries, make management costs
transparent, strengthen regulation and control activities, facilitate analysis of benchmarking to comply with
norms established by the regulatory framework for water and sanitation services in accordance with the
objectives established therein, taking into account the actual situation in the province. After implementation,
training was provided for forty (40) users in pre-implementation of the Regulatory Scorecard (TCR).
Resolution 348/13 of the Ministry of Infrastructure approved the data forms and regulatory scorecard that
must be filled out by sanitation service providers in the Province of Buenos Aires to exercise preventive
control over their provision of services.

Procurement of HDM 4 Software
The HDM4 is used to define cost-effective maintenance strategies and for preparation of the multiyear plans.

Design of the System for Load Control on the primary road network (Procurement of utility vehicles)
The load control system enabled the province to take effective action to penalize overloaded vehicles and
raise awareness with respect to maintenance of the roads and highways. Data obtained from each operation
make it possible to analyze the load per axle and type of truck, as well as the overload percentage of each
truck and overload levels that serve as input for the development of future methodologies.

Implementation of the system for management of routine maintenance of the road network under
provincial jurisdiction (SGCR)
The computer tool developed and updated with data from the reports offers a way to manage routine
maintenance of the DVBA and prepare annual operating budgets (POA). The report provided information
for the database of the GIS (Geographic Information System) of the DVBA. The software development of

                                                      62
the SGCR app gives users of the area a web page with available current data
(www.vialidad.gba.gov.ar/sgcr). One output offered by this computer tool is printouts of the road inventory,
broken down by pavement, shoulder, culverts, horizontal signs, vertical signs, bridges, etc.

Pre-investment for competitiveness and job creation

The pre-investment component for competitiveness and job creation was intended to: define a strategic
framework to shape provincial development; identify sectors and regions that are likely to play a priority
role in provincial development; design a series of sector and territory policies and instruments to improve
competitiveness and employment opportunities; identify infrastructure requirements and establish strategic
priorities to avoid bottlenecks in infrastructure; and adjust the drafting and execution of the budget to a
spatially organized multiyear framework. To do this, funding was provided primarily for the studies
described below.

Strategic Port Plan of the Province of Buenos Aires
The Strategic Plan made it possible to achieve the following: draw up and implement port policies as an
input for territorial and economic planning for provincial development; determine the profile of each port
based on expected changes in trade and transportation systems; introduce more appropriate criteria for
efficient operation and management of ports; determine the port and other installations needed to respond
to the future demand of the port system of the Province of Buenos Aires; establish the requirements and
needs for the other complementary forms of transportation; and, finally, establish the requirements of an
Environmental Management Plan for each port.

Strategy for Productive Provincial Development
A development strategy for the productive sectors was prepared to ensure the redistribution of opportunities,
potential, and comparative and competitive advantages, in accordance with the expectations and aspirations
of the population. The goals were to be achieved in a specific time frame to emphasize productive sectors
that would sustain the development model with competitive capacity and a more equitable income
distribution.

Strategy for Territorial Development and Investment
A document was prepared with mapping and analysis of the current and potential supply and demand for
infrastructure in the province, based on all available information on pre-defined sectors and regions, and
mapping and analysis of the main institutional and regulatory problems with the use of the infrastructure
and logistics of the province in general, and specifically by sector and region based on field work results.

4.      Final Evaluation

4.1. Sustainability

Actions of the province to ensure the benefits of the project

The program addresses long-term sustainability through (i) development of a fiscal framework in which the
proposed works ensure adequate fiscal space for successful implementation of the infrastructure program,
and ensure its convergence toward a long-term sustainable situation; (ii) prioritization of the works among
sectors and within each sector so as to adapt them to the available fiscal space and prioritize subprojects
that have high return and impact, complying with specific program objectives; (iii) implementation of
adequate road management strategies and provision of stable financial resources to ensure continuous
maintenance of the network; (iv) implementation of subprojects in a context of economic-financial
equilibrium of the water and sewerage operators; (v) provision of appropriate standards to retain and
increase the efficiency of the water sector, stimulating new investment; (vi) encouragement of public-

                                                     63
private partnerships to subsidize accessibility of the service to people of limited means; and (vii)
construction of a strategic framework to guide investments and infrastructure policies, to give guidelines
for sectoral and territorial development in the province. More importantly, sustainability is undergirded by
the firm decision of the provincial government to implement the proposed program and the necessary
institutional frameworks and policies.

4.2. Changes in the original design

The process to request additional financing for IBRD loan 7268 (APL1) from the Bank began in April 2010.
This additional financing was justified by the need to achieve the goals established in the design of the
operation, because they could not be met within the specified timeframe with the amounts provided. To that
end, the province assigned priority to a series of works to be included in the additional financing, based on
specific criteria, in three components: (1) Provincial roads; (2) water and sanitation; and (3) drainage. The
agreement for IBRD loan 7947 (APL1-FA) was signed on February 6, 2012.
In October 2012 the World Bank approved restructuring of loans 7472-AR and 7947-AR. To cover part of
the estimated deficit in the works component the amount earmarked for water and sanitation works was
increased by USD 4 million. Given that the increase covered part of the deficit, in order to complete the
works underway in APL II –resources for which had been exhausted–some of the works were transferred
from IBRD 7472 to IBRD 7947. This restructuring was of vital importance to ensure completion of the four
water and sanitation projects and one road project (IBRD 7472-AR), which, without this additional
financing in 7947, would have to be completed with local resources. This transfer of works was based on
prioritization of the percentage of physical progress in the works of the program and their impact on the
results to be achieved (program indicators). An extension of IBRD 7947 APL1-AF was requested, and it
was extended for 18 months, until May 30, 2015.

4.3. Lessons learned

• The teamwork of officials and experts of the province and the World Bank was of crucial importance
  for reaching rapid, efficient, and effective agreements to address the problems and challenges that arose
  during the program’s execution.
• The strategy for planning, action, and public investment associated with the program has produced a
  model of a comprehensive approach that takes into account not only efficacy in the execution of the
  works but also their quality, measured in terms of the beneficiaries’ interests and needs.
• The institutional strengthening activities have fostered the development of a climate of cohesiveness
  and confidence within the public administration, facilitating the operation of projects with multilateral
  lending bodies.

4.4. Outcomes

• Constitution of a multidisciplinary and interagency provincial team of political/technical professionals
  composed of the SCEOCI, the UCPO, the DIPAC, and the DIPSOH.
• The expanded institutional role and responsibilities of the SCEOCI and the UCPO, which over time
  developed important strengths in project formulation and management (procurement, financial
  management, monitoring, and evaluation); they were converted into Offices of the Assistant Secretaries
  in their respective sectoral ministries.
• Consolidation of the Provincial Directorate of Public Water and Sewer Services (DIPAC) as the body
  responsible for planning expansion of water and sewer service.


                                                     64
• A new methodology for the design and management of urban drainage, and subsequent approval of the
  “Manual for the design of master plans for improvement of the infrastructure and management of urban
  drainage” and its dissemination by printing and distributing 500 copies.
• Execution of structural measures with own funds and national resources, and implementation of non-
  structural measures for urban drainage.
• Strengthening of the capacity for planning and evaluation of investments in road projects, through the
  incorporation of modeling and programming tools.
• An improvement of the Province’s installed capacity through the incorporation of high-tech equipment
  (mobile equipment for highway scales) for activities to preserve and upgrade the provincial road network
  with a view to long-term sustainability.
• An improvement of the Province’s installed capacity through the incorporation of high-tech equipment
  (HDM4 software) by the Provincial Highway Department.
• Development of a software tool for the management and calculation of tasks for the maintenance and
  preservation of the paved road network by implementing the system for management of routine
  maintenance of the road network under provincial jurisdiction.
• Reduction of congestion and more efficient transportation in the Conurbano Bonaerense with the
  expansion and rehabilitation of key urban segments of the primary paved road network.
• Improved connection of local communities to the primary paved road network by rehabilitating their
  access roads.
• Improved installed capacity in the province thanks to the incorporation of high-tech equipment (DHI
  MIKE 21 LITPACK software) for tide prediction.
• Modernization of the computer system for recording the provincial debt by implementing the SIGADE
  Version 6 program, which generates reliable and permanently updated information for optimum
  management of the debt.
• Strengthening of the financial and budgetary management of the Province of Buenos Aires by providing
  computer equipment to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, the Office of the Assistant
  Secretary for Economic Coordination, the Provincial Directorate for Municipal Coordination, the
  SCEOCI, and the Comptroller General of the Province.
• Improved allocation of investment resources in the province, by launching the Provincial Public
  Investment System.
