Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province
within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of supporting the return to a sustainable path of

aimed to: i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province,
to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergence towards a
long-term sustainable fiscal framework. ii. Enhance access to water and sewerage services to low income
people living in highly vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding. iii.       Improve high priority
segments of the productive paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and
strengthen regional competitiveness.
