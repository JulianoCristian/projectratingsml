                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of
                         supporting the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end, the Province is prioritizing a set of
                         interventions through a sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2010 specifically aimed to: i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line
                         with the priorities of the Province, to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal
                         framework. ii. Enhance access to water and sewerage services to low income people living in highly vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding. iii.            Improve
                         high priority segments of the productive paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional competitiveness.

                         1. This ISR covers the period of May 2013 to December 2013. In total under the original Loan and the Additional financing, there are 39 roads works (35 under the original loan and 4
                         under the Additional Financing), 12 water and sanitation works (9 under the original loan and 3 under the additional financing), 1 drainage work (under the additional financing) and 27
                         technical assistance activities (all under the original loan). Progress under the APL1 Project has advanced extremely well, with fast execution of works and high technical quality. The
                         original loan is fully disbursed, and the additional financing will be fully disbursed as of the next disbursement, for which the request is to arrive shortly. The great majority of indicator

                         targets has been met or is on track to be met as soon as the additional financing works finish. Under the original loan, all the works and 23 of the 27 technical assistance activities are
                         fully completed; the remaining 4 technical assistance activities are partially completed and still have some sub-activities pending finalization. Under the Additional Financing, all works
                         are underway, with estimated finalization dates in mid-2014 (long before the closing date of May 2015); the only work that will take longer is the Arroyo Soto drainage work, expected
                         to be finished in early 2015.

                         2. The Province of Buenos Aires is giving adequate attention and supervision to social and environmental aspects, and several social and environmental training workshops have
                         taken place to reinforce the capacity of the Province in this area. This activity follows the Bank’s recommendation for an increased focus on safeguards since the preparation and
                         launch of the Project. Best practices are being documented, and an environmental and social supervision visit to the Arroyo Soto is planned for early 2014.
