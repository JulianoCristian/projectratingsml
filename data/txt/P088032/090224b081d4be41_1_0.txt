                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility as a means of
                         supporting the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end, the Province is prioritizing a set of
                         interventions through a sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2010 specifically aimed to: i. Develop a multi-year public expenditure program, in line
                         with the priorities of the Province, to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal
                         framework. ii. Enhance access to water and sewerage services to low income people living in highly vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding. iii.            Improve
                         high priority segments of the productive paved road network to support the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional competitiveness.

                         1. This ISR covers the period of December 2012 to May 2013. It reflects the closing date extension to the additional financing loan from December 31, 2013 to May 30, 2015, granted
                         on May 21, 2013. It also includes the main findings of the supervision mission carried out on May 24 to 31, 2013.

                         2. The performance of the first Adaptable Program Loan (APL1), which consists of an original loan and an additional financing (AF) loan, is satisfactory. The original loan was fully

                         disbursed. All Water Service and Sanitation (WSS) and roads works have been finalized and the original targets have been met. In the technical assistance components, 21 out of the
                         27 studies and activities to be financed under this project are concluded, five are ongoing, and one is in the bidding phase.

                         3. Progress under the USD50 million AF loan has been very good: all works are ongoing, with the exception of one road work (Lincoln Access), for which the contract has been
                         signed and the order to start works is imminent. These works include roads, water supply and sanitation, and one drainage work, all of which were recently begun. After only 15
                         months of implementation, the loan is 49% disbursed (US$24.63 million). On May 21, 2013, the Bank extended the closing date of the AF loan until May 30, 2015, to allow for
                         sufficient time for the works to be completed and the PDO to be achieved.

                         4. The Province of Buenos Aires is giving adequate attention and supervision to social and environmental aspects, and several social and environmental training workshops will be
                         organized in the coming months to reinforce the capacity of the Province in this area.
