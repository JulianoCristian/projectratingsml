Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The overall purpose of the program is to improve the provision of infrastructure services in the Province within a framework of fiscal responsibility as
 a means of supporting the return to a sustainable path of economic growth, to alleviate poverty and increase social equity. To this end, the Province
 is prioritizing a set of interventions through a sector wide Infrastructure Program for the period 2005-2010 specifically aimed to: i. Develop a multi-
 year public expenditure program, in line with the priorities of the Province, to implement the Infrastructure Program following sound fiscal policies to
 ensure convergence towards a long-term sustainable fiscal framework. ii. Enhance access to water and sewerage services to low income people
 living in highly vulnerable areas and to mitigate urban flooding. iii. Improve high priority segments of the productive paved road network to support
 the reactivation of the provincial economy and strengthen regional competitiveness.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This ISR covers the period of August 2014 to December 2014 and is meant to reflect the findings of the supervision mission carried out from November
 11 to 14, 2014. In total under the original loan and the Additional financing, there are 39 roads works (35 under the original loan and 4 under the
 Additional Financing), 12 water and sanitation works (9 under the original loan and 3 under the additional financing), 1 drainage work (under the
 additional financing) and 27 technical assistance activities (all under the original loan). The APL1 Project continues to advance smoothly. The original
 load has been closed since December 2013 with timely conclusion of all works, full justification of the expenses and finalization of all technical
 assistance activities of the institutional strengthening components.

 The additional financing is fully disbursed, although some works are still in execution. Under the AF, only the Berazategui sanitation works (70%
 completed) and the Arroyo Soto drainage work (60% completed) are still underway, and both expected to be finalized in March 2015. The great majority
 of indicator targets has been met, with the remaining two pending the finalization of the AF drainage and sanitation works. The drainage indicator was
 reduced due to changes in the scope of the related works. The Province of Buenos Aires continues to give adequate attention and supervision to social
 and environmental aspects, and good practices are being documented.
