moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: given its\n            important policy implications, the timely and successful\n            implementation of the DPL reform program requires continuous\n            support from senior government counterparts. Moroccan\n            authorities generally have the know-how to prepare and carry\n            out large investments, whereas it is more difficult for them\n            to improve policy and regulatory frameworks with the\n            required institutional and capacity building. While awaiting\n            the development of the required institutions to fully assume\n            their intended functions, the Bank has to initially play an\n            important role as a catalyst in fostering program\n            coordination. A main lesson from this urban transport DPL is\n            that reforms requiring inter-ministerial coordination have\n            moved more slowly than others. The DPL involved various\n            stakeholders in different ministries and government\n            agencies, both nationally and locally. Future urban\n            transport DPLs should be accompanied by investment lending\n            and technical assistance operations. The DPL is an\n            appropriate instrument for supporting urban transport sector\n            institutional and legal reforms in Morocco, as the country\n            is proceeding step by step in a medium term program. Single\n            tranche DPLs are an adequate instrument to undertake urban\n            transport sector reform in Morocco, provided they are\n            allowed a longer implementation period to properly measure\n            the impacts of the reforms. Morocco is a good case of using\n            successive single tranche adjustment loans as an effective\n            way to assist structural reform, provided there is a link to\n            an agreed medium-term reform program with well broadly\n            defined milestones and transparent triggers per subsequent operation."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
