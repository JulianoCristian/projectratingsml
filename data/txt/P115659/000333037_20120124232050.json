Development Policy Loans (DPL) is to improve the efficiency\n            of urban transport in Morocco's large cities through:\n            a) better governance of the sector; b) increased performance\n            and supply of urban transport services and infrastructure;\n            and c) higher environmental and social sector\n            sustainability. The single tranche DPL will support the\n            Government's urban transport reform program and\n            accelerate its implementation. The growth of cities and the\n            accompanying social and economic changes are essential\n            features of Morocco's current development process.\n            Improving urban transport has become a key priority for\n            Morocco's central and local governments. It will focus\n            on key institutional and regulatory measures as well as the\n            implementation of the Government's reform program in\n            main cities, primarily Casablanca and Rabat. Bank support to\n            the urban transport sector in Morocco has been provided in\n            close coordination with international partners, including\n            especially the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and\n            the European Investment Bank (EIB) which are currently\n            providing financial and technical assistance to the sector.\n            This program was designed with support from the Bank, which,\n            at Government's request, has been involved in the\n            sector since 2006 through an in-depth relationship focused\n            on technical support, assistance in capacity building, and\n            transferring best practices and lessons of experience from\n            other middle income countries."}, "docdt": "2011-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
