Some lessons learned included: (i) for\n            Development Policy Loan (DPLs) to achieve results, the broad\n            and early participation of implementing agencies and local\n            governments, and a strong reform momentum by the government,\n            need to be in place at entry; (ii) flexible and adaptive\n            responses by the government are required to continue\n            pursuing the DPL\u2019s objectives when specific actions do not\n            achieve expected results; (iii) the Bank\u2019s convening\n            authority and intellectual leadership need to support the\n            government\u2019s work on consensus building and interagency\n            coordination, especially at the initial stages of DPLs; (iv)\n            the Bank has an important role to play in ensuring that all\n            investment options are analyzed, with a view to selecting\n            the least-cost options; and (v) sector DPLs could be more\n            effective if accompanied by parallel investment lending and\n            technical assistance, or designed as a programmatic series\n            that would expand the implementation time frame to several years."}, "docdt": "2016-06-14T02:25:02Z"}
