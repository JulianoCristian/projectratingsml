Among Program-related\n            lessons it is highlighted this credit (unlike many typical\n            Technical Assistance (TA) ones) gave the Bank the\n            opportunity to engage the government on a large number of\n            sectoral policy dialogues, as well as to build institutional\n            capacity, particularly on petroleum sector issues, legal\n            reforms, and public finance management issues. This was due\n            to the nature of the small economy, and the large scope of\n            the credit. Taking the following two lessons into account\n            may ensure future TA projects will have the same positive\n            effect on sectors covered by the credit. There should be\n            flexibility in the provision of TA in order to adapt it to\n            the changing needs of the government (in this case in the\n            petroleum sector). It is important to keep a certain\n            percentage of credit as unallocated, while flexibility of\n            design is equally important in light of capacity-building\n            activities, especially in terms of prioritizing capacity\n            issues. Implementation-related lessons indicate that better\n            preparation/training of the Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) as of the early stages, would ensure an easier\n            implementation process, especially on procurement and\n            financial management issues. This leads to the essential\n            need for a strong team, so that the burden does not fall on\n            a single person, particularly, in the context of prevailing\n            weak institutional capacity, and political volatility."}, "docdt": "2005-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
