The Credit has complemented and\n            deepened actions already agreed under the programs of the\n            IMF, the African Development Bank and the European Union in\n            the area of public expenditure management.  This report\n            summarizes progress in the execution of the reform program\n            and actions taken by the Government of Sao Tome and Principe\n            (GSTP) to meet the specific conditions for the release of\n            the second tranche. The report concludes that conditions for\n            the release of the second tranche have been met and\n            sufficient progress has been made in implementation of the\n            overall program of reforms set out in the Letter of\n            Development Policy (LDP) despite political instability and\n            lack of institutional capacity. In addition, the Government\n            is receiving Bank technical assistance in developing\n            petroleum revenue legislation and building transparent\n            institutional frameworks in the financial and petroleum\n            sectors institutional frameworks that would be transparent\n            and beneficial to the long term development of the country.\n            In light of this performance, this report proposes that the\n            second tranche of the Credit, in the amount of SDR 1.9\n            million be released for disbursement."}, "docdt": "2004-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
