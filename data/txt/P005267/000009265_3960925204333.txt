PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JORDAN
EIGHT CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (LOAN 2425-JO)
AND
GREATER AMMAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (LOAN 2483-JO)
HIGHLIGHTS
The two loans under review were the second and third World Bank loans
to Jordnr, in the water supply and sewerage sector.  The Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan was thie Borrower and th-e Water Authority (WA) was the implementing
agency for the loans. Previously there had been one loan and four IDA
credits in the sector.
Toon 9425-
Loan 2425-JO, approved in May 1984 for US$30.0 million, was expected
to finance about 80%o of the estimated foreign exchange requirements of
US$37.60 a!nd to cover about 51% of the total proJect cost of US$59.27
million.
The project aimed at providing much needed improvements in the water
supply systems and eliminating problems associated with inadequate cesspools
in eight cities in Jordan; it should lead to a general upgrading of the
health and environment of these cities. The proJect, as described in the
appraisal report, included: (i) the construction of about 110 km of trunk
and distribution water mains, and 8,000 iP of reservoir storages; (ii) the
construction of about 177 km of trunk and collection sewers and about 14,000
laterals for house connections; (iii) the construction of four wastewater
stabilization ponds to treat a total average flow of 6,500 if/day of sewage;
(iv) the construction of a sewage treatment plant for an average flow of
1,800 nf/day and two sewage pumping stations and force mains; (v) the supply
of water meters and operating equipment; and (vi) consultant services for
construction supervision.
The scope of the completed proJect is larger than what was proJected
at appraisal. Unanticipated financing of parts of the project by the
European Investment Bank and USAID allowed, after consultation with the
Bank, the extension of the water supply and sewerage system to include
fringe areas of the cities. It allowed the additional construction of
distribution water mains and collection sewers representing an increase of
about 82% of appraisal estimates.



- viii -
A loan for 9.0 million ECUs (US$7.5 million at the prevailing
exchange rate) from the European Investmerit Bank was used to partially
finance the construction of water and sewerage networks in Madaba and sewage
treatment plants in Madaba and Ma an. USAID assistance equivalent to
US$4.045 million partially financed the consulting services, including
supervision of construction. Total international financing of US$41.545
million equivalent, including the Bank loan of IIS $30.0 million, covered
55.8X of the project cost of US$74.48 million equivalent.
Total project cost expressed in JD was only 23% higher thai. estimated,
in spite of the substantial increase in the length of pipes laid. The loan
was fully disbursed two years ahead of the scheduled closing date.
Consultants, suppliers and works contractors performed reasonably
well, except for two international contractors who defaulted soon after
being awarded the contracts because the support they expected from local
sub-contractors did not materialize. In general, however, completion dates
agreed between the contractors and the WA were optimistic. The anticipated
construction periods did not sufficiently take into account subsurface
oonditions and the difficulties of working in urban environments.
La 248¢3=.
Loan 2483-JO, approved in January 1985 for an amount of US$30.0
million, was expected to finance about 97 % of the estimated foreign
exchange requirements and to cover about 65 % of the total project cost of
US$47.7 million.
The project aimed at continuing the development of institutions in the
water supply and sewerage sector started under previous loans and credits
and at improving water supply and sewerage services in the Greater Amman
area. The project, as described in the appraisal report, included: (i) the
extension and rehabilitation of about 100 km of water mains; (ii) the
construction of about 350 km of trunk and collection sewers; (iii) the
construction of two sewage treatment plants; (iv) the supply of operating
and maintenance equipment; and (v) consultant services for engineering,
project management and construction supervision.
Actually, because the population of Wadi-Sir obJected to the site of a
sewage treatment plant, a new site had to be selected and the plant
redesigned. Because of delays, this component was transferred to a
subsequent project (Loan 2694-JO). on the other hand, the Bank agreed to the
inclusion of more water distribution mains than envisaged at appraisal.
Overall, the completed project included: (i) the extension and
rehabilitation of 883 km of water mains; (ii) the construction of 477 km of
trunk and collection sewers; (iii) the construction of one sewdge treatment
plant; (iv) the supply of operating and maintenance equipment; and (v)
consulting services.



- ix -
The loan became effective after a slight delay (para 2.23) but was
fully disbursed about four years ahead of schedule. The loan covered about
53% of the total project cost of US$56.61 million which, expressed in JD was
14% higher than estimated.
Consultants, suppliers and works contractors performed rea 'nably
well, except for one international contractor who defaulted after completing
only about 40% of his contract. In general, however, contract completion
dates set by the WA for this project were optimistic. They did not take
into account subsurface conditions and the difficulties of working in the
urban environment and congestion of Greater Amman.
The Authority s financial performance for the period 1984-87 was below
appraisal expectations (para. 5.02). Revenues were substantially below
appraisal forecast, due mainly to lower than -nticipated tariffs (para.
5.04). In all three years -- 1985, 1986 and 1987 -- total revenues failed to
cover operating expenses. Thus, in those years, WA was not able to service
its debt to the Government, and at the end of 1987 some JD 16.8 million of
principal and interest was overdue. The same situation is expected to exist
for 1988. One maJor source of potential financial improvement receiving
attention is the reduction of unaccounted-for water, which has been
thoroughly studied in the Greater Amman area. However, improvements which
can be realized through better management of customer services (metering,
meter reading, billing and mollection) and rehabilitation are not expected
to close the Authority's ca.ai flow gap in the foreseeable future. Tariffs
will have to be adJusted.
The maJor objectives of improving water supply and sewerage services
were achieved by 'the projects. Over the period 1984-1987, the volume of
water sold increased by an average of 9.7% per year (Appraisal 8.4%), and
the volume of billable sewage by 22.7% (Appraisal 28.5%). The projects
represent the least-cost solutions. However, using existing sewerage
tariffs, the internal rate of return of the sewerage investments for both
projects is -5%, as compared to 8% at appraisal. This indicates that WA's
sewerage revenues are too low compared to costs (para 7.02).
The projects have proven that the proper management of water supply
and sewerage systems is as important as the construction of new facilities.
They show also that replacing pipes may not be enough to decrease
unaccounted-for water. An integrated approach is needed, including
strengthening of customer services and billing departments.

EIGHT CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (LOAN 2425-JO)
AND
GREATER AhIAN WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (LOAN 2483-JO)
I. INTE=10TIN
Background Data
1.01 In Jordan water resources are scarce and expenisive to exploit. Water
is conveyed considerable distances from its source to the areas of urban
concentration, and there are substantial and costly interbasin transfers.
The projects were part of the ongoing water supply and sewerage sector
development strategy of the Government, which included improvements in the
water supply distribution systems and the elimination of problems associated
with inadequate cesspools in Greater Amman and in eight other cities
(Ramtha, Mafraq, Anjara, Ajiloun, Ein Janneh, KufrinJa, Madaba and Ma an).
1.02 The Borrower was the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the implementing
agency for both proJects was the Water Autlority (WA), created under
Temporary Law No. 34 of 1983. Following its establishment in January 1984,
the WA took over all existing water supply and sewerage operations in
Jordan. These included the Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA), the
Water Supply Corporation, the water resources branch of the Natural
Resources Authority, the domestic -ater supply department of the Jordan
Valley Authority, and the water supply and sewerage operations of about 300
mmicipalities. Dibring the implementation period of th-;se projects, the WA
was a semi autonomous agency reporting to the Prime Minister's office. In
March 1988, under Law No. 18 of 1988, a Ministry of Water and Irrigation was
created, combining the Water Authority and the Jordan Valley Authority.
Bank Role in the Sector
1.03  Tle Bank group's involvement in the water supply and sewerage sector
began in 1961 with Credit 18-JO for the financing of the foreign exchange
component of a project to augment and improve the Amman water supply (US$1.5
million). This was followed in 1963 by Credit 43-JO for the financing of
water supply projects in Ramallah-El Bira, Azraq-lrbid and Zarqa (US$2.5
million). In 1273, with Credit 385-JO (US$8.7 million) the Bank group helped
finance the extension of water supply and sewerage services for Amman and
was instrunmntal in the establishment of AWSA. This was followed in 1978 by
the Amman Wiater Supply and Sewerage ProJect (Credit 780-JO for US$14.0
million). In 1982 a loan of US$17.0 million was made for the Zarqa-Ruseifa
Project (Loan 2213-JO), which is still under implementation, to improve the
water supply and establish a modern sewerage system in Zarqa and Ruseifa.
Two y'ars later, In 1984, one of the loans under review (US$30 million) was



2
made for the Eight Cities Water Supply and SewciWge Project (Loan 2425-JO).
It was followed in 1985 by a loan, also under review, of US$30 million for
the Greater Amman Water Supply and Sewerage ProJect (Loan 2483-JO). In 1986
a loan of US$50 million was made for the Jordan Water Supply and Sewerage
ProJect (Loan 2694-JO) for selected water supply and sewerage activities in
various parts of the Kingdom.
II.  PJECT PREPARATTON. APPRAISAL AND IMPIENATIO
A.  Eight Citie  Water Supply nd Seweraae Project (Toan 2425-JO)
Proiect Origin. Preparation and Appraisal
2.01   The eight cities in the project are Ramtha, Mafraq, AnJara, Ailoun,
Ein Janneh and Kufrinja in the north of the Kingdom, and Madaba and Ma'an in
the south. In 1984, these cities had an estimated population of about
136,000 and an estimated population growth rate of about 3.6% per year. The
water distribution systems in the eight project cities were weak, and the
municipalities had no sewerage systems. Using grants from the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Planning Council
signed contracts with an American engineering consulting firm, in
association with a local engineering finm, for a feasibility study for the
siX northern cities; a contract was signed with another American firm for a
feasibility study for the four cities of Madaba, Ma'an, Karak and Tafila.
2.02  The preparation of design and contract documents, at a cost of US$2.6
million, was funded with USAID assistance and carried out by three local
consultants for northern cities, Madaba and Karak, and Ma an and Tafila, and
supported by three consultants from the United States under contract to the
Water Supply Corporation.
2.03  The proJect was appraised in November 1983 on the basis of the two
above-mentioned feasibility studies. The Loan Committee raised the
possibility that the newly created Water Authority (WA) might not be able to
meet the Bank s proposed financial requirements. During negotiations of the
Loan, in April 1984, the financial requirements were softened. The Loan was
presented to the Board under special procedure and approved on May 24, 1984.
Proiect Oblectives
2.04 The maJor project objectives were to: (i) strengthen the water dis-
tribution systems in eight cities in order to meet the demand up to year
1995, bring additional water from externa] sources through the laying of
transmission mains and provide additional storage capacity for some cities;
(ii) eliminate problems associated with inadequate cesspools by construc-
ting sewer networks, which did not. exist in the eight cities, and
constructing sewage treatment plants in Ramtha, Mafraq, Kufrinja (serving
also AnJara, AJloun and Ein Janneh), Madaba and Ma'an; and (iii) improve
water supply services and reduce water losses through distribution system
rehabilitation.

Project Deacr = ion
2.05  The project origi lly consisted of the following main componeuts:
(M)  the extensio,. nd rehabilitation of about 100 km of water mains;
(ii) the construction of about 350 km of trunk and collection sewers;
(iii) the construction of five sewage treatment works;
(iv) the supply of operating and maintenance equipment; and
(v) consultant services for engineering.
Revisions to the original proJect scope are discussed in para 2.10.
Loan covenats
2.06   The loan documents for the two projects (Loan 2425-JO and 2483-JO)
included the following special covenants:
(i)   The Government would provide to the Authority all required local
funds as equity. This covenant was met.
(ii)   The Authority would (a) have its accounts audited by auditors
acceptable to the Bank; and (b) have the audited financial statements and
auditors' report forwarded to the Bank within six months after the end of
each fiscal year. The covenant was met, but ;tubmission of reports was
generally delayed.
(iii)   The Authority would, for its metered water services, maintain or
adjust tariffs to provide sufficient revenues: (a) to cover its operating
and maintenance expenses (excluding depreciation) and debt service; and (b)
to generate funds from internal souroes sufficient to cover 5% of three-year
average annual capital expenditures in 1987 and 1988, and 10o in 1989 and
thereafter. It would also, for its sewerage services, maintain or adjust
tariffs to provide sufficient revenues to cover its operating and
maintenance expenses (excluding depreciation) and debt service. These
covenants were not met (para 5.02).
(iv)   Three months before the beginning of each fiscal year, the Authority
would review the adequacy of its tariffs on the basis of a three-year
financial forecast. Financial forecasts were prepared in 1985 for the
appraisal of Loan 269A-JO, and in 1987 by a consulting firm for a tariff
study which clearly showed that tariffs were inadequate.
(v)   The Authority would, for civil works contracts exceeding 24 months,
include price escalation provisions in the bid documents for major materials
with administered prices (cement and fuel). This covenant was not used
because it was assumed that construction contracts would be completed within
24 months. In any event, there was no increase in the official price of
these materials.



4
(vi)    The Aut-hority would, if required, make adequate arrangemente to
enable low-income families to be connectedl to the sewerage system. No
general measures were taken because it was judged that the cost of
connection was affordable to the poor.
(vii)   The Authority would establish a Project Unit (Loan 2425-JO) and
maintain it (Loan 2483-JO). This covenant was met.
(viii)   The Authority would employ engineering consultants to assist in
detailed engi aeering, evaluation of bids, and stupervision of cotnstruction.
The Authority used consultants but evaluated most of the bids itself.
Effectiveness and Start-up
2.07    The loan became effective on January 10, 1985, about three months
later than originally envisaged because of delays in administrative
procedures (ratification by the newly reconvened parliament was needed) and
delays in the payment of front-end fees that were not capitalized, at the
Government's request.
2.08   The final engineering for sewerage and sewage treatment works
proceeded approximately as scheduled. Tender documents for construction in
the northern cities were issued in early 1985, and for the southern cities
in late 1985.
Revision of Financint Plan
2.09   Unanticipated financing of parts of the project was obtained from
the European Investment Bank and USAID. A loan for 9.0 million ECUs (US$7.5
million at the prevailing exchange rate) from the Europcwi Investment Bank
was used to partially finance the construction of water and sewerage networks
in Madaba and sewage treatment plants in Madaba and Ma 'an. UISAID assistance,
equivalent to US$4.0 million, partially financed the consulting services
including supervision of construction. As a result, the Bank loan financed
only 48.7% of the costs of eligible civil works, instead of the 60% foreseen
in Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement. It also financed less consulting fees,
but considerably more equipment and material than originally enviwaged.
Total international financing of US$41.5 million equivalent, including the
Bank loan of US$30.0 million, covered 55.8Yo of the project cost of US$74.5
million equivalent.
Revision of the Scope of Works
2.10    Because of the above-mentioned additional financing, the scope of
the project was, after consultation with the Bank, expanded to include
extensions to the water supply and sewerage system in the fringe areas of the
eight cities. Provision of pipes, pumps and operation and maintenance
equipment was also added. The project, as actuLally implemented, provided
water supply and sewerage services for: (i) Ramtha, with a population of
about 32,200, where 49 km of water mains and 112 km of sewers were
constructed, as well as a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 1920
u?/day; (ii) Mafraq, with a population of 25,300, where 8 km of water mains
and 78 km of sewers were constructed in addition to a sewage treatment plant.
with a capacity of 1800 iF/day; (iii) AnJara, Ajloun, Ein Janneh and
KufrinJa, with a combined population of 30,800, where 49 km of water mains



5
and 78 km of sewers were constructed, together with a sewage treatment plant
with 1,800 ni/day capacity; (iv) Madaba, with a population of 34,700, where
38 km of water mains, 76 km of sewers, a ground reservoir with a capacity of
6000 i3, an elevated reservoir with a capacity of 400 rii, and a sewage
treatment plant with a capacity of 2000n m/day were constructed; and (v)
Ma'an, with a population of 13,400, where 20 km of water mains, 55 km of
sewers and a sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 1200 ni/day were
constrmcted. In addition, about 178 km of water lines were constructed in
communities adjacent to or in the general area of the cities. A comparison of
the projected and actual works completed for the appraised project by city
and component is shown in Annexes 1.1 and 1.3. It indicates that the length
of water pipes and sewers completed were 82.8% over the appraised estimate. A
total of 152 km of water mains were installed, compared with 110 km
projected; 402 km of sewers and laterals were installed, compared with 191 km
projected. Similarly, the capacity of sewage treatment plants was increased
by 5.0Mo.
Project Implementation
2.11  The project implementation lasted from mLd-1984 to August 1988. It was
practically completed 10 months ahead of schedule. Because of forward
planning by the Authority during the preparation and appraisal stages, tender
documents for more than half the civil works contracts w re issued, and
contracts were awarded within the first two months after the loan became
effective. The civil works used contractor-furnished water pipe and locally-
produced sewer pipe, since all civil contracts were for supply and
installation.  International competitive bidding procedures were followed for
civil works contracts, but only four contracts were awarded to international
contractors; seventeen contracts were awarded to local contractors, since
knowledge of local conditions was an important factor in the bidding. Two of
the international civil contractors who were awarded contracts did not com-
plete them because support that they expected from local sub-contractors did
not materialize. The remaining works had to be retendered.
2.12    The quality of construction, which was supervised by the consultants
and monitored by engineers from the Projects Department of the Au';hority, was
generally good. Delays were encountered in congested areas and where rock
was closer to the surface than anticipated. The times set for completion by
the Authority proved to be unrealistic. In Dst cases, the civil works
contractors compieted the original scope of work within a year after the
original completion date. In some cases, however, variation orders were
issued, adding related additional work within the monetary limits allowed in
the contracts and extending the contract completion date, while in other
cases the volume of work was reduced. Delays in the completion of
construction under fixed-price contracts increased the cost of supervision
oontracts which were priced on a time basis
2.13   The contracts at-wrded under the loan are summarized in Annex 1.2.
There were 18 water and sewerage civil works contracts for the appraised
project and three contracts for general water works, which were added to the
scope of the proJect. For the supply of equipment and materials, there were
23 contracts totalling about $14.0 million, which were financed retroactively



6
following the Bank's agreement to change the project description to include
che supply of pipes, pumps, and operation and additional maintenance
¶,quipment; four contracts were awarded after the Loan was signed.
nroLect Costs
2.14  A comparison of appraisal and actual costs by city and component for
the project as a whole is shown in Annex 1.3.   The actual total cost of the
proJect amounts to JD 26.6 million, as compared with J1D 21.6 million, i.e. an
increase of 23% due mainly to the substantial increase of project scope (para
2.10). Although the length of water mains and sewers increased by 82%, their
cost increased by only 9.5%. However, the cost of the sewage treatment plants
increased by 12.7%, while their capacity increased by 5%.
2.15   Overall, the economic conditions in Jordan during the project period
led to lower price increases than envisaged at appraisal. The appraisal
estimates were based on mid-1984 price levels and the Bank's Guidelines for
Expected Price Increases and Interest Rates. Price contingencies for both
civil works and equipment and for local and foreign components were estimated
at 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6 % thereafter. Actually, during the years
of maJor activity on the project, 1985-1987, the rate of inflation in Jordan
declined. It dropped from 3% in 1985 to zero in 1986, to -0.3% in 1987,
according to the Central Bank of Jordan. There was no increase in
administered prices (fuel and cement).
nisbr-thrments
2.16  Appraisal forecasts, actual disbursement amounts, and disbursements by
category are shown in Annex 3.1. The loan was completely disbursed 18 months
earlier than originally envisaged. At the Borrower's request, the Bank
amended Schedule 1 of the Agreement to revise the disbursement categories to
take into account unforeseen co-financing and changes in the proJect scope
and costs.
B.   Graater Am=an Water SuPPlY and Sewerage Proiect  (Loan 2483-JO)
Pro ect Origin, Pretparation and A_raisal
2.17. In addition to the natural growth of its population, Amman, as the
capital city, has attracted migrants from the rural areas of the country as
well as a large percentage of the refugees who have come to Jordan since
1948. In the early 80's, the population growth was about 4.4%. The increased
population spread rapidly to the suburbs, outside the city limits. Concerned
about the potential problems of unplanned growth, the Government entered into
agreements with consu'ting firms to study various aspects of infrastructure
development in Greater Amman, which was defined as the area within 25 km of
the city center. One such agreement, in 1980, was for the preparation of a
master plan for wastewater collection and disposal in the area; it formed the
basis for this loan and resulted in the establishment in 1986 of the Greater



7
Amman Municipality. The project area includes Amman, 14 other municipalities,
and 14 villages; 8 other municipalities in the Amman governorate; and 3
municipalities and a refugee camp in the Baqa a valley, which are part of the
Balqa governorate.
2.18. With the assistance of three IDA credits and other international
agencies, the Amman Water Sipply and Sewerage Authority was able to meet the
water supply and sewerage needs of the Amman municipality reasonably well, as
reflected in the Project Complet.ion Report for IDA Credit 780-JO. (Ctside
the municipal limits, however, water supply in Greater Amman was pro ided in
htlk by the Water Supply Corporation to the municipalities and villages,
which constnrcted and managed their own water distribution systems  There
was little or no sewerage services. These bulk sources of water supply and
the distribution systems were absorbed by the Waber Authority when it was
established in January 1984.  Assistance was urgently needed to integrate,
expand and improve the aoquired water distribution systems and to provide
sewerage and sewage treatment for the parts of the Greater Amman area that
were not being served.
2.19.  The study for the Master Plan for wastewater collection and disposal,
undertaken by the National Planning Council, was financed by USAID. At the
completion of the study in 1982, the Government requested World Bank
assistance for certain components of the plan. In four missions to AWSA from
October 1982 to December !Q83, and a mi6sion to the Water Authority in
February 1984, the Bank assisted in ihe identification and preparation of a
Project package. The project was appraised in June 1984, and the Appraisal
Report issued in Oc.tober 1984.
Prolect Cbiectives
2.20. The major project objectives were to (i) extend the sewerage services
in the project area to about 94% of the total population from the previous
coverage of about 67%, through rehabilitation and extension of the sewerage
syBtems; (ii) reduce the infiltration of cesspool effluents within the
Greater Amman area through a reduction in the number of cesspool
installations so that. by 1989 only about 45% of the population would be
served by cesspools, as compared with 60% in 1984; (iii) enable recycling of
wastewater for agricultural purposes through the provision of satisfactory
sewage treatment facilities; (iv) improve water supply services and to reduce
water losses through the rehabilitation of the distribution system; (v)
assist in the development of the Water Authority and in the establishment of
adequate financial policies in order to achieve financial self-sufficiency
through adequate charges for water supply and sewerage services; and (vi)
prepare for the extension of water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal
facilities on a priority basis.
Pro.fisG Descrilptionn
2.21.  The project aimed at providing water supply and sewerage services in 3
of the 10 drainage basins in the Greater Amman area: (i) the Seil Amman
drainage zone with an estimated 1990 population of 1.13 million, including the
former AWSA service area and most of the densely populated suburbs; (ii) the
Baqa'a valley with an estimated 1990 population of 83,000, including three
municipalities and the largest refugee camp in Jordan; and (iii) the Wadi es
Sir valley with an estimated 1990 population of 14,000 and a large military
hospital. The project originally consisted of the following main components:



8
(i) the extension and rehabilitation of about 100 km of water mains; (ii) the
construction of about 350 km of trunk and collection sewers; (iii) the
construction of two sewage treatment works; (iv) the supply of operating and
maintenance equipment; and (v) consulting services for engineering.
Effectiveess and Start-un
2.22.  The loan became effective on September 9, 1985, about four months
later than originally foreseen because of delays in the ratification process
arid in the execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and the Authority.
2.23.   The final enginecring for sewerage- and sewage treatment worke
proceeded approximately as scheduled. Tender documents for the construction of
the two sewage treatment plants at Baqa'a and Wadi es Sir were issued in
March 1985. The Bank approved the award of construction contracts for both
plants on August 1, 1985. The contractor for the Baqa 'a plant received the
notice to proceed with construction on October 1, 1985. Similarly,
contractors for 14 of the 16 sewerage contracts received notices to proceed
during the three months from August 29 to November 20, 1985. Contracts for
the water lines, which were designed in house, were awarded from December 1985
to July 1986.
Revision of the Scone of Works
2.24.   Comparison of the proJected an--, actual works completed for the
appraised project by component is shown in Annex 2.1. After contract award for
the Wadi es Sir sewage treatment plant was announced, a few residents of the
area obJected to the site - even though the project had been discussed at
public meetings during the feasibility study stage and had been received
favorably. After some delay, the Government accepted their objection. Not
only was it necessary to find a new site, but also to select a new consultant,
because of a disagreement with the original design consultant As these
delays would extend the project completion beyond the original closing date,
at the Authority's request the Board agreed to delete the Wadi es Sir
treatment plant and the related sewerage works from the ProJect. These were
eventually included in a subsequent loan. Funds originally intended for works
in the Wadi es Sir drainage zone were mainly used to finance the laying of
additional lengths of water distribution pipes (abouxt 780 km) and additional
lengths of trunk and collection sewers (about 127 km) in the project areas.
The Bank also agreed to an increase in the design capacity of the Baqa'a plant
from 4,000 m3/day to 6,000 m3/day to meet the projected needs up to year 2000
when the detailed design .howed that this was the least-cost solution.
However, loan funds proved insufficient to finance the Baqa'a outfall sewer,
which had to be extended in length for environmental reasons. This component
was also included in a subsequent project.
Pxoiect Implementation
2.25. Project implementation lasted from early 1985 to August 1988 and,
except for the Wadi es Sir sewage treatment plant (para. 2.24), was
practically completed 28 months ahead of schedule. Because of forward planning
by the Authority staff during the preparation and appraisal stages, tender
documents for more than half the civil works contracts were issued and



9
contractz were awarded before the actual effective date of the loan. ExcePt
for the Baqa a sewage treatment plant, the civil works used owner-furnished
water pipe or locally-produced sewer pipe. International competitive bidding
procedures were followed for civil works contracts, with all but one of the
civil works contracts awarded to local firms since knowledge of local
conditions w.ae an important factor in the bidding.  The international sewerage
contractor did not complete his contract, because support from a local sub-
contractor did not materialize. The Bank agreed to include the financing of
completion of these works in a subsequent loan. The completion dates set in
the civil works contrac.ts by the Authority proved to be unrealistic. In most
cases, t.he civil works contractors completed the original scope of work within
a year after the original compl.-tion date.   In some cases, however, variation
orders were issued adding additional related work within the monetary limits
allowed in the contracts and extending the contract completion dates.
2.26.    The quality of construction, which was supervised by the consultants
and monitored by engineers from the Project Department of the Authority, was
generally good. Delays were encountered in congested areas and where rock was
closer to the surface than anticipated.
ProcurentnD
2.27.   The contracts awarded under the loan are summarized in Annex 2.2. In
total, there were 23 civil works contracts, (16 for sewerage and 7 for water
distribution systems) and 10 contracts for supply of equipment and materials.
Retroactive financing was applied to: (i) two civil works contracts with
disbursements totaling the equivalent of about $1.6 million, and; (ii) four
contracts for supply of equipment with disbursements totaling the equivalent
of aboxut $1.6 million. Thus, actual retroactive financing totaled the
equivalent of $3.2 million, while the Loan Agreement indicated a ceiling of
$1.0 million and the appraisal report indicated a ceiling of $3.0 million.
Four of the five consultant contracts were entered into before the Loan was
signed and were financed by the Authority.
Project Costs
2.28.   A comparison of appraisal and actual costs by component is shown in
Annex 2.3. The actual total cost of the project amounts to JD 20.21 million,
as compared with JD 17.66 million, i.e., an incre,-e of 14.4% due mainly to
the substantial increase in length of water mains laid in the diztribution
systems (para 2.24). Overall, the economic conditions in Jordan during the
project period led to lower price increases than envisaged at appraisal (para.
2.15).
2.2S.   Appraisal forecasts, actual disbursements, and disbursements by
category are shown in Annex 3.2. The loan was completely disbursed about four
years ahead of the original secaedule. At the Borrower s request, the Bank
amended Schedule 1 of the Agreement to revise the disbursement categories to
increase the proportion of the Loan to be allocated for the supply of pipes
and equipmenit.

III.   INTIIUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Orgazatial Dvelopnent
3.01 When the Water Authority was established in January 1984, it was as-
signed the responsibility for water resources management and for supplyirg
water and sewerage services for all of Jordan. Its first organizational task
was to take over the staff and functions of part or all of the four water
agencies and to integrate the water supply, water distribution, seewerage and
se-wage treatment systems of these agencies and those of about 300
municipalities and vJllages.  This task was substantially c.ompleted early in
1985. At the same time, the Authority had to mniage seven major water
projects costing nearly tUS$400 million, partially financed by loans of about
US$220 million from six international lendinig agencies. This work was divided
into more than 70 construction contracts.  The system integration and t.he
construction program, both of which were major accomplishments, were aachie.ved
with a higlly centralized organizational stru ture, which was appropriate at
the time the job was done. During the implementation period of the two
projects, 23 department directors reported directly to the President of the
Water Authority.
3.02   In 1987, realizing the need for a more r.t'onal organization. t.he
Authority undertook to reorganize its stnrcture with t.he assistanc.e of a
tUSAID-financed consultant and its Jordaniin subcontractor.  Amexet; 4.2 aid
4.3 show the current organization charts.  The new organization took effect in
April 1988, at about the same time as the entire water sector was reolrganized,
following the creation of a Ministry of Water and Irrigation (para. 1.02). At
the Water Authority'.: headquarters, only five directors re-port to the
executive head of t.he agency, known as the Secretary Gieneral. nTe diretoWrs of
the eiaht regional governorate offices also report to the Secretary General on
important issues but have  cornsiderable autonoomy to mwaage the day-t.o-day



11
activities of their regions. Under the new organization, there iB greater
loca] participation in the water supply and sewerage sewtor since the
involvement of the Aathority in each governorate is also closely monitored by
the Gkoveanorate Water Councils, of which each Governor is a member.
3.03   Following the extensive efforts to integrate the water supply and
sewerage systems and tAo reorganize the water and irrigation sectors, the
Authority is now embarking on a substantial program of institutional
cornsolidation. The principal elements of the program include: (a) the
development of systems for the improvement of meter reading, billing and
collection; (b) the development of new general and cost accounting systems;
and (t) t.he development of management information systems. Resources available
for the program include the technical advisory services provided under a
contract financed by USAID, numerous reports and studies relevant to the parts
of the program completed by other consultants during the past four years, and
recently acquired data processing facilities.
Staffin
3.04   Since 1984 the Authority's staffing has remained fairly constant at
about 5,000 persons. About 1,000 emplevees are engaged in water resource
activities, while 4,000 are engaged in water supply and sewerage operations.
The latter is equivalent to about eight employees per thousand water and
sewerage connections which is reasonable, given that the Authority's
responsibilities are spread over the whole Kingdom and that the population
density is low even in the Greater Amman area.
Traininm
3.05  The training provided under the two Bank financed projects was
primarily focussing on construction supervision and equipment operation and
maintenance and was successfully carried out within the Authority's overall
training program. Since its establishment in 1984, the Authority has been
pursuing an extensive program for training its personnel at all levels, both
locally and internationally. It has actively sought the assistance of
international and bilateral agencies for staff training abroad and for
delivering courses and seminars in Amman. Some of the programs it has set up
arr worc.h mentioning.
-     The Authority has strengthened its vocational training center, which
provides practical training in technical skills to supervisors, meter readers,
mechanics, plumbers, electricians and operators.  It has trained 879 persons
in 44 courses since 1983. In 1988, a total of 312 employees, or about 6% of
the total staff, received training.
-      sting residual funds from a loan from the United Kingdom, the Authority
arranged with the local British Council to provide training in English to some
of its employees. To continue this program, the Bank approved the use of
US$100,000 from Loan 2694-JO for training employees who need a knowledge of
spoken or written English in their work.
-     Along similar lines, the Bank provided assistance for department heads
whose foreign language proficiency was not sufficient to qualify them for
training courses offered by international agencies -- which are almost never
given in Arabic -- to attend management development seminars conducted in
Arabic.



12
-      The Bank Group, throtgh the Econiomic Development Institute (EDJ),
organized three seminars in Amman. Two of these were regional se.minars
sponsored jointly with the Amman-based Center for Environmental Health
Activities (CEHA) of the World Health Organization (WHO) on planning in the
sector and on water re.sources development.  The two agencies also sponsored a
training program in unaccounted-for water in Amman in November 1988.
CEHA was involved, with thle Authority, in several regional aid national
training programs and seminars in Amman for mid-level engineers and
technicians in water and wastewater treatment, plant operation, preventive
maintenance, and unaccounted-for water.
-     WHO, with financial support from USAID, sponsored a course in Human
Resources De.velopment and an on-going 18-month D&ual-Focus traininig program in
which Jordan and two other countries are participating. Jordan s teams are
concentrating on unaccounted-for water and water quality management.
-     The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAC) established a regionial
center in Amman to study the treatment and use of sewage effluent for
irrigation. It sponsored two regional seminars in Amman, which several
Authority personnel attended.
-     Most of the bilateral assistance in training was provided by the United
Kingdom and the United States.  Other countries such as Japan, France and the
Federal Republic of Germany have supported the training of a few individuals
each year.
-     Working through the British Council, the United Kingdom has been
providing academic training (both degree and diploma) in water supply and
sewerage at British universities for an average of four engineers per year,
and theoretical and practical training, usually at one of the Water
Authorities in Britain, for an average of six engineers per year.
-    The tUnited States, through the Agency for International Development, has
continued to provide academic and practical training in the Unitea States.
During the four-year period since the Authority was established, 60 employees
have been trainsd. In addition, USAID sponsored two one-month training
seminars in Amman on Procurement and Contract Negotiations and on Management
of Contract Performance. More than 20 engineers at.te.nded each seminar.
-   17SAID has also provided more t.han US$3 million from its Water Svstems and
Services Management proJect to fund a contrac.t to provide water and wastewater
sector training, water quality management and technical advisory services.
The contract team is advising the Authority on training and institutional
improvements.
IV. OPERATING PERFQRiA8CE
Inttroduction
4.01   The following areas were. evaluated in t.he appraisal reports:  (i) the
increase in t.he population served by public water supply; (ii) the control of



13
unaccounted-for water; (iii) the increase in population served by sewerage
systems; and (iv) the provision of services to the urban poor.
Wate Lupply
4.02   The increase in water produced and sold d'x-ing thle project period is
sho0wn in Annex 6.1. From 1984 to 1987 water produced inereased by 85%, against
23% proJected. Water sold increased by 32% against 27% projected. The
additiorial production capacity became available, for Amman, with the
commissioning of a plant for the treatment of surface water at Deir Alla on
the. King Abdullai Canal; and, for Irbid, with a plant for the treatment of
Wadi Arab well water. The comnissioning of the treatment plant at Irbid
penmitted the diversion to Amman of part of the grmod water supply from wells
at Mafraq. An increased amount of water from that source became available for
four of the six northern cities in the Eight Cities project. Except for a
brief period in 1988, the demand was met without rationing. The contribution
of the projects to increased coverage of the water supply was greater than
anticipated in the appraisal reports as a result of the increases in the scope
of works (paras. 2.10 and 2.24).
Unaccounted-for Water
4.03   From 1984 to 1987 unaccounted-for water increased from 38% to 58%
(Annex 6.1), although leak detection, metering, and replacement of pipes were
financed under Loan 2483-JO. This shows that improvement of unaccounted-for
water requires more than equipment and new pipes. An integrated approach of
the problem is needed. This involves good management of the distribution
system and above all good management of customer services (maintenance of
connection and meter, proper meter reading and billing, and addressing
diligently and efficiently all customers complaints). A hydraulic analysis of
the water system in Greater Amman was financed by the Bank under a subsequent
Loan (2694-JO) and carried out by a joint venture of French, British and Jor-
danian consultants. The consultants upgraded the system maps and prepared a
network analysis and detailed designs for the rehabilitation of the distribu-
tion system. They studied the sources of unaccounted-for water (UFW, and
estimated that the amount of UFW in the area was 59%. Physical losses
consisted of 19% leakage and 2% transmission losses. The balance, 38%,
resulted from meter under-registration and errors in billing (Annex 5.1).
Although such  precise data are not available for the eight cities, it is
estimated that the amounts of UFW in each category are similar. tinder the
reorganization of the Authority, responsibility for subscriber services has
been shifted to the governorates' regional offices which are closer to the
consumer and where meter reading and collection can be better controlled.
Billing should improve now that the records of all subscribers have been
consolidated using the Authority's central computer. The Authority s
extensive training program has included several courses and seminars on
various aspects of UFW.  An action plan for reducing UFWi has been developed
and is underway, part of it financed under Loan 2694-JO. It should result in a
slow, but steady, improvement in efficiency.
4.04    During implementation of the proJects, from 1984 to 1987, the volumes
of billable sewage increased by 85%, against 112% proJected (Annex 6.1). This



14
reflects the deterioration of water unaccounted-for. The number of sewerage
connections doubled, as projected.
4.05   All the se.wage treatinent plants have now beeni tested and commissioned.
Enough house connections have been made to operate the Ramtha, Mafraq, Tafila
and Baqa'a plants full time.
Urban Poo
4.06  The Authority has not. deemed it necessary to make fornma arrangements
to enable low income inhabitants of the project areas to meet the cost of
connecting their dweJlings to the sewerage systems. Charges for sewer
connections are based on the rental valuLe of the property and the length of
the sewer connectioni. The uirban poor generally live in low-value properties
that are close to street sewers. Experienc.e has shown that they can generally
recover the cost of a connection by not having to have their cesspools pumped
out. Although no formal arrangements for financial assistance exist, the
Authority has, in the past, provided such assistance on a case-by-case basis.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01   The appraisal and actual consolidated Income and Expenditure
Statements, Source and Application of Funds Statements, and Balance Sheets of
the Authority for the years 1984 through 1987 are shown in Annexes 6.1, 6.2,
and 6.3, respectively.
5.02   Operating results for the period 1984-87 were not as favorable as
forecast despite the fact that (i) the iLumber of connections for both water
and sewerage was considerably higher than foreseen at appraisal; (ii) the
volume of water sold increased by an average of 9.7% per year (Appraisal
8.4'); and (iii) the volume of billable sewage increased by 22.7% (Appraisal
28.5%). Revenues increased by an average 13.8% per year (Appraisal 20.2%). In
'bsolute terms, revenues were substantially below appraisal forecast due
mainly to lower than anticipated tariffs (para. 5.04) and the fact that
Govenment subsidies to the Authority for supply to small commnities through
tankers and standpipes did not materialize. In 1984, year of Appraisal, the
volumes of water and billable sewage used in the financial proJections were 3%
and 9% respectively higher than actual. In the same year, average revenues per
m3 for water, sewerage surcharge and sewerage rate were 10%, 30% and 3%
respectively higher than actual. Thus, the financial results indicated for the
base year were much too high. Tariffs were not increased in the 1984-87
period; the only increase in revenues per m3 was therefore the result of an
upward movement of average consumption along the tariff scale. Projections
assumed that average revenues per m3 for water, sewerage surcharge and
sewerage rate would increase an average of 12.5%, 54.3% and 1.2% per year,
respectively, while in fact, these increased 2.6%, 0% and -3.1% respectively.
On the other hand, total operating expenses evolved in line with the Appraisal
forecast, although individual expense categories varied. It is noteworthy that
while by 1987 water produc.tion was 51.1% higher than anticipated at appraisal,
the cost of energy was only 20.2% greater and that of chemicals 66.7% lower.



15
That maintenance was neglected in the period under review is evidenced not
only by the fact that the period ended with unaccounted-for water amounting to
about 57.9% of water produced (Appraisal 37.0*%) but also by the fact that the
cost of maintenance went down in aLsolute terns. In all three years --1985,
1986 and 1987-- total revenues failed to cover operating expenses. Thus in
those years, the Authorit.y was unable to service its debt to the Government
(all foreign loans are made to the Gevernment which oni-lends the proceeds to
the Authority at terms normally different from the original loan). At the end
of 1987, some JD 16.8 million of principal and interest was overdue. The same
situlation is expected to contJnue in 1988. The Government and the Authority
are studying measures to restore the latter's financial viability. One major
source of improvement which is receivinig attention is tlhe reduction of
unacctoun.ted-for water, which has been thoroughly studied in the Amman area. A
comprehensive action plan is underway. Such improvements as may be obtained
through rehabilitation and administrative measures, however, are not expected
to close the Authority s cashl flow gap in the foreseeable future. Tariffs will
have to be adjusted.
5.03    Receivables were considerably underestimated in 1984, the year of
appraisal. In that year, estimates showed receivables equivalent to 2.8 months
of revenues, while in fact, they were around 9.4 months. Furthermore, these
were projected to decrease to an unrealistically low figure of about 1.8
months of sales. Efforts to further reduce receivables have been hampered by
prevailing unsatisfactory operating conditions, including poor metering and
billing practices. The ongoing action program to reduce unaccounted-for water
is expected to create a better customer relations climate and enable the
Authority to reduce arrears.
Tariffm
5.04   The tariffs currently in application appear in Annex 6.4. The last
tariff increase took place in 1982. Since then, the lower step, generally
considered the level of consumption of the poor, has been reduced twice. A
tariff study carried out by consultants financed by USAID was completed in
1987. While the study was comprehensive, the report was not found completely
satisfactory by the Authority or the Government., who felt that several aspects
of the study, such as using latest available data, modifying the basis for
cost allocation, changing assumptions, would require adjustment before it
could be implemented. In the meantime, the Authority has bee  studying
alternative tariff structure arrangements which, while not affec-ting thlie poor,
could increase overall revenues.
VI. WORLD R PE
6.01.   Relations between the Bank, the Borrower and the Authority were good
throulhout project preparation and implementation. The Bank supervised the
projects about twice a year with missions that were balanced and provided
continuity and practical expertise. When the sowpe of the projects needed to
be revised, the Bank showed flexibility (paras. 2.10 and 2.24). The Jordan
Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 2694-JO) was prepared during the
period of the projects. During the implementation of the two proJects under
review, the Government asked the Bank to update its earlier Water Sector Study
(Report No. 4699-JO) to cover both municipal water supply and irrigation. The



16
new study (Report No. 7099-JO) will assist in the developmenit of policies and
strategies by the new Ministry of Water and Irrigation.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Frojet Achiexnm t
7.01.  The major obJectives of the water supply anid se.werage comp-oents of the
projects, to meet increasing water den>sud and to proivide sewerage services ir
the proJects areas, have been met (paras. 4.02 and 4.04). Early 1988, thie
Authority was able to supply water to 399,700 connections, 53% more than
projected, and to collect and treat sewage from 103,400 custcmers compared to
89.400 (Annex 6.1).
Least-Cost Solution
7.02   The water supply and sewerage works cornstructed under the projects we-re
the least-cost solutions among several alternatives analyzed by the
consultants. For se-wage treatment, stabilization ponds were always chosen when
there was no shortage of land (Ramt.ha, Mafraq, Madaba, Ma'an).
7.03 At the time of appraisal of the Greater Amman Project (Loan 2483-JO),
sewerage revenues were used as a minimum measure of economic benefits. On this
basis, the internal rate of return for sewerage investments was 8%X.
7.04 With the same method as used at appraisal, the internal rate of return
has been recalculated using the actual costs of the Eight Cities and Greater
Amman sewerage components, actual and projected incremental volumes of
billable sewage, and associated average sewerage rates (surcharge and taxes).
The new internal rate of return is -5.2%. Its sensitivity in relation to an
increase of plus 20%, or plus 40% of sewerage revenues, or of billable sewage
volumes are calculated in Annex 7.1 and summarized as follows:

The negative rates of return confirm that the Authority's sewerage revenues
are too low compared to costs (para. 5.02).
7.05  At the time of appraisal, the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of water at
a discount rate of 10% was between JD 0.37/m3, in areas where water is locally
available, to JD 0.49/m3 for areas such as Amman, where part of the water has
to be pumped over long distances. The LRMC for water supply for the Wahdeh Dam
and Northern Conveyor Scheme, which entails large economy of scale, is
estimated at JD 0.64/m3. This cost is higher than the highest block tariff
currently charged (JD 0.5/m3).

7.06 Mainly because of the projects, the Authority was able to supply water
to about 270,000 additional urban poor, and sewerage services to about 100,000
additional urban poor.

8.01    The projects were technically well-conceived and represent least-cost
solutions.  In both projects more construction and procurement were
accomplished than proJected in the appraisal reports. The primary obJectives
of improving water sulpply and sewerage services were achieved.  Operations
during the project period and a Bank sector study highlighted once again the
urgent need to reduce unaccounted-for water. Effective implementation of the
Authority s action plan in this regard shiould generate more revenues and
slowly improve WA s financial performance. However it would not be sufficient
to enable WA to meet its financial obligations, i.e., to pay for its operating
expenses and working capital increases, and to service its debt. Other
measures, including action on tariff level and structure, are necessary.
8.02 The projects show the need to attach at least as much importance to
operating and maintaining water supply and sewerage systems and to the
financial management of a utility, as to the constructing of new facilities
and extensions to the systems. This is especially true in a country like
Jordan where water resources are scarce and costly to develop (para. 1.01).
Reduction of unaccounted-for water needs an integrated approach which involves
not only purchases of meters, pipes and leak detection equipment, but also
good management of customer services (maintenance of connections and meters,
meter reading, billing, etc. - para 4.03). The on-going Jordan Water Supply
and Sewerage Project (Loan 2694-JO) has beens recently restructured to give
priority to implementing WA's action plan for reducing unaccounted-for water
and to rehabilitating the systems rather than expanding them.
