and create employment and\n            income for the war-affected rural population including\n            returning displaced persons. The project comprises the\n            following components: (a) farm mechanization will provide\n            motor-cultivators and tractors, replacement of lost\n            tractors, replacement of selected combine harvesters, and\n            provision of related technical assistance and training; (b)\n            livestock production will assist in rebuilding the national\n            herds for milk and meat production, through the import of\n            cattle, goats and sheep; (c) animal health services will\n            help strengthen veterinary services by equipping and\n            rebuilding private veterinary stations, and provide\n            equipment; and (d) project implementation will assist with\n            start-up and will implement the project through provision of\n            equipment, technical assistance, training and studies, and\n            through financing of incremental recurrent expenditures."}, "docdt": "1996-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
