                                                                                                             91747
Connecting Isolated Villages to Markets in Peru                                                              July 1, 2002
                      "Before, we had to walk four or five hours each way to go to the market in Cuzco.  Now it is one hour
                      by bus," says Julia Juana Viuda de Guamán, a widow and the sole provider for her six children who
                      lives in the village of Ccorca in Central Peru.

                        A small town of about 700 poor families, Ccorca is located high atop the Andes. To help the residents
                        of this region have access to markets and basic services, the Peruvian government got together with
                        the World Bank, NGOs, and the Inter-American Development Bank to create the Peru Rural Roads
                        Program. Under this initiative, the 20 kilometers between Cuzco and Ccorca can now be covered in
just one-tenth of the time it took on the old roads.

In addition to buying food, medicine and clothing in the town, and selling their own products in the market, the people of Julia
Juana's village are now going to Cuzco to do part-time work in the city's buoyant tourist industry, which is benefiting from its
proximity to Macchu Picchu.

Ccorca is not the only indigenous village in the area benefiting from a new road and greater access to basic services. 
Around 3 million people in the Andean region are reaping the benefits of the expansion and rehabilitation of some 13,000
kilometers of rural roads and highways.
