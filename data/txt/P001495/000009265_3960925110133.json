The\n            project has, through both its successes and its failures,\n            taught a number of important lessons: First, studies of the\n            rice sub-sector kind are often ignored, but the study was\n            good enough and timely enough to be used as a catalyst to\n            bring about a major policy reform. The rice crisis, the\n            receptivity and astuteness of the Rural Development\n            Minister, the willingness of decision-makers to be convinced\n            by good analysis, the readiness of producers and merchants\n            to respond to price signals: all of these conditions\n            permitted the study to have a decisive impact. Of the four,\n            only the existence of the crisis was knowable in advance.\n            The lesson is simply this and no more. If certain key actors\n            are receptive, technical assistance is capable of providing\n            a seminal study that starts a process of policy reform."}, "docdt": "1992-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
