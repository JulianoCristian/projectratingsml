INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Senegal for the equivalent of US$8.2 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Agricultural Credit Project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the current economic position and prospects of Senegal
was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1970 (Report AW-15a).
A Bank economic mission visited Senegal in March 1972, to assess the current
economic situation and prospects. The following paragraphs reflect the
findings of that mission. Country data are given in Annex I.
Economic Potential
3.        Endowed with few natural resources, Senegal has only limited possi-
bilities for economic development. Agricultural conditions are generally
poor, particularly in the groundnut basin where the bulk of the population
lives. The south and southeast offer better prospects for development of a
variety of agricultural products, but groundnuts still account for the cash
income of most of the rural population and for nearly half the country's
export earnings. Although there are certain definite possibilities for devel-
opment of new crops and new sectors, diversification will take a long time.
The economy will continue to be affected by the vagaries of the weather and
by fluctuations in the world market price of groundnuts.
4.        Apart from agriculture, the main possibilities for economic develop-
ment are fisheries, tourism and manufacturing. Thanks to rich resources off
the coast, fish production has been growing rapidly. International tourism
to Senegal has started to develop only in recent years, but prospects for
further expansion of this sector are promising. Senegal developed its manu-
facturing industry earlier than other West African countries and its indus-
trial labor force is one of the best in Africa.
Past Development
5.        During the early 1960's, Senegal's economy remained stagnant.   The
growth of GDP in real terms was minimal (1 percent a year) and per capita
income may have declined, though at about US$250, it is higher than in most
other African countries. Two factors were primarily responsible for this
slow growth. First, independence caused Senegal to lose its privileged posi-
tion as the center of French West Africa. This resulted in the loss of



- 2 -
export markets for manufactures as domestic industries developed in other
West African countries. At the same time, departure of most of the French
civilian and military personnel resulted in declining demand for services
and locally produced goods. Second, the Government was slow in attacking
the country's difficult adjustment problems. The heavy administrative
apparatus could not respond quickly to the new situation and government
policies stressed administration rather than development. The First
Davelopment Plan (1961-64) concentrated on investments for social and
transport infrastructure, including housing, urban water supply, and admi-
nistrative buildings; investment in rural sectors accounted for less than
20 percent of total development outlays, though it included the initial organi-
zation of the country's agricultural programme.
6.        The second half of the 1960's saw more energetic development policies
by the Government. There was a considerable increase in the public investment
program, made possible by substantial improvements in absorptive capacity
of the public sector. The program became more directly development-oriented
with the share of investments in productive sectors increasing from 24 to 45
percent during the Second and Third Plans. Rural investments improved in
quality, and tripled between the First and the Tlird Plan. Rural diversifi-
cation, mainly for cotton, rice, and tomatoes, was successfully begun.
7.        The change in the Government's development policy, however, came
too late to have a significant impact on the economy until after 1968. Falling
producer prices for groi dnuts and exceptionally bad weather in 1968 reduced
groundnut production by 50 percent and even production of millet and other
major food crops remained insufficient to cover local demand. In the modern
sector, though, the Covernment did succeed in stimulating import substitution,
and this partly offset the loss of export markets for manufactured products.
Manufacturing output grew at 6 to 7 percent annually.
8.        Since 1968, a number of factors have combined to bring about an 8
percent annual growth of GDP (in current prices). Sharp increases in world
market prices for groundnuts after 1968 permitted a 25 percent increase in
producer prices in 1971 and this, combined with other measures designed to
stimulate groundnut output, helped to restore agricultural production. In
addition to these measures the Government's agricultural diversification
efforts started yielding benefits in rice, cotton, and vegetable production.
The modern sector of the economy continued to expand, partly due to a marked
increase in exports of manufactured products averaging 14 percent a year,
which reflected Senegal's improving competitive position. At independence,
the country had been plagued with a high cost structure which seriously
hampered economic growth.   Since then, however, Government policies have been
aimed at containing price and salary increases, which then allowed local in-
dustries (e.g. textile and shoe manufacturing) to start competing successfully
in export markets, and contributed to the rapid growth of the tourism sector.
It is estimated that salary and price increases may have averaged 3 percent
per annum ir. recent years.



-3-
Public Finance and Foreign Aid
9.        These overali economic trends are reflected in the condition of
public finances which deteriorated throughout most of the 1960's. By 1968/69,
public savings had declined slowly but continuously to virtually zero. Reve-
nues stagnated because of the decline in imports, the most important element
of the tax base. Thus, keeping the tax ratio at roughly 20 percent of GDP
was quite an achievement. But current expenditures grew, albeit moderately,
at 3 to 4 percent annually thus eroding the current account surplus.
10.       After 1968/69, a recovery of public savings was made possible
because of better tax collection, increased tax rates, and substantial sur-
pluses of the groundnut stabilization fund following the rise in groundnut
export prices. In 1970/71, public savings represented 7 percent of current
revenues. Yet locally-financed public investment continued to exceed savings
by a wide margin, as it had throughout the 1960's, and this resulted in a
steady decline in Treasury deposits.
11.       Senegal has benefited from a large inflow of foreign aid, mostly on
concessionary terms. Between 1966 and 1970, foreign aid financed about 65
percent of public investment and averaged US$30 million per year. This cor-
responds to US$8.8 per capita annually, mainly financed by the European
Economic Community (40 percent) and France (30 percent). The World Bank Group
and Germany contributed, respectively, 13 and 10 percent of the total. Foreign
aid concentrated on infrastructure and on directly productive projects in the
rural sector. Also important was technical assistance, mainly in education,
which amounted to US$29 million annually, mostly financed by the French
Government.
Prospects
12.       A severe drought in 1972 seriously affected agricultural output.
Groundnut production may have declined by 45 to 50 percent. The impact of
the drought on overall economic growth and public finances cannot yet be
precisely assessed, but there can be no doubt that the economy has suffered
a serious setback.
13.       In coming years, the economy will probably grow faster than in the
past decade, largely as a result of on-going efforts to diversify agricul-
tural output and to expand fisheries, tourism, and industrial exports. Medium
term prospects would be more favorable were it not for the fact that ground-
nut prices are expected to fall from their present level of over £100/long
ton to £80/long ton by 1980, thus eliminating the surplus of the groundnut
stabilization fund.
14.       The government is determined to keep the expansion of current
expenditures to a minimum and to improve the financial performance of public
enterprises. However, since tax rates are already relatively high, the
urgently needed revenue increases will have to come from better collection
and overall economic growth.



15.       Considering the need to diversify the economy, it appears essential
that public investment be increased from US$60 million annually during the
Third Plan (1969/73) to US$80 million during the Fourth Plan. However, while
such a program is in line with the recent improvement in the government's
capacity to prepare and implement projects, the slow increase in public
savings, together with the limited possibilities of deficit financing with-
out endangering the difficult foreign exchange situation or restricting
credit to the private sector, make financing of the Fourth Plan difficult.
To offset the expected shortfall in local resources associated with the
deterioration of terms of trade, foreign lenders will have to increase
their share in the financing of the Fourth Plan to about 85 percent of
total development expenditures. Foreign aid is expected to continue to
expand rapidlv, based on the programs of the European Communities (Third
FED Program), bilateral aid donors (Canada, Italy, Belgium, and oil produc-
ing countries in the Arab world), and the World Bank Group. In view of Senegal's
improved economic performance and absorptive capacity, increased external
assistance is warranted.
16.       External aid will have to continue to be on relatively soft terms
if it is not to create serious debt service problems. The proportion of
grant aid has declined from 85 percent in 1964-66 to 55 percent in 1969-71
and is likely to drop to about 40 percent of total foreign financial aid
during the period of the Fourth Plan. Although the foreign debt service
ratio is still low at 5 percent, financing of the remainder of foreign
aid on conventional term   would soon lead to unmanageable balance of pay-
ments and budgetary difficulties. Projections indicate that at least half
of non-grant aid should be extended on concessionary terms if an excessive
increase in the debt service ratio is to be avoided. Budget constraints
are even more serious, as debt service charges are already projected to
absorb one-half of gross public savings by 1980. Any substantial harden-
ing of the blend could result in negative public savings.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       The Bank Group has had 13 operations in Senegal to date.    Total
lending amounts to US$67.45 million (net of cancellations), including nine
IDA credits, three Bank loans and one project financed by a blend of Bank and
IDA funds. The Bank Group is now Senegal's third largest aid donor (after
France and the European Economic Communities) providing about 13 percent of
Senegal's external capital assistance. IFC has invested US$3.25 million in
two projects in Senegal. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973 and notes on the execu-
tion of on-going projects.
18.       Initially, Bank Group lending in Senegal was limited to the trans-
port and agricultural sectors. The implementation of a railway project



-5-
financed in 1966 (Credit 96-SE) was delayed, and there were shortfalls in
the railway's financial performance. However, the project eventually
succeeded in strengthening the railway authority which, xwth the assistance
of a second project approved in FY1972 (Credit 314-SE and Loan 835-SE) should
soon be showing an operating surplus. A loan for the Dakar port (Loan 493-SE)
had more immediate success and helped improve the finances and administration
of the Port Authority. A further project to extend the capacity of the port
is being prepared. The Bank Group's first operation in the rural sector
was an agricultural credit project (Loan 584-SE and Credit 140-SE) to assist
groundnut and millet cultivation, which is discussed in paragraphs 33 - 35.
The rural sector has also benefited from a 1970 project (Credit 198-SE) for
construction and maintenance of feeder roads in the groundnut basin, which
has now been satisfactorily implemented.
19.       Wqhile transport will continue to account for a substantial proportion
of future operations, the Government and the Bank now emphasize the diversi-
fication of agricultural production and the development of new productive
sectors. In the field of transportation a loan to improve existing airport
facilities at Dakar (Loan 867-SE) was approved in November 1972. The Second
Highway Project (Credit 366-SE) approved in February 1973, promotes a reorgani-
zation of road maintenance and includes the strengthening of six sections of
roads. In the longer term, a third highway project will be prepared on the
basis of studies included in the second highway project. It will include
further trunk road strengthening work and will also emphasize feeder road
development.
20.       The Casamance Rice Project (Credit 252-SE) approved in 1971, the
Terres Neuves Project (Credit 254-SE), also of 1971, and the River Polders
Project (Credit 350-SE) all aim at developing new crops and opening up new
agricultural regions. The proposed agricultural credit project would not be
limited to groundnuts, but would also involve development of cotton, rice and
other food crops. From the experience gained with the first Terres Neuves
settlement scheme, a further project is to be prepared on a larger scale.
21.       In view of Senegal's limitations in agriculture, we are actively
exploring with the Government other avenues for diversification. Perhaps
the most promising of these is tourism, for which Senegal's pleasant climate
and attractive beaches are important assets. A Bank mission recently reviewed
the prospects for Senegalese tourism within the context of the overall develop-
ment of the sector in West Africa. The Dakar airport project of November 1972
will facilitate tourism development, while in the longer run a tourism infra-
structure project is to be prepared. Other possibilities for diversification
currently being examined by the Bank include fisheries and manufacturing. In
connection with the development of the manufacturing sector, a Bank mission
recently visited Senegal to review the prospects for a Development Finance
Company. The Government has also asked the Bank to take the lead in assessing
the viability of a large tanker repair project, and we are currently appraising
a project preparation loan.



- 6 -
22.       Among other relatively new developments in the Bank's lending in
Senegal is an urban development program and other projects of social importance.
Urban housing problems are being tackled by a Site and Services project
(Credit 336-SE) of September 29, 1972; a project to improve drainage and
sewerage in Dakar, which would complement the first urban project, is being
prepared. Following a project begun in 1971 (Credit 253-SE) for technical
asd agricultural education, a second education project is currently being
appraised, which would strengthen teaching in practical and scientific subjects
and introduce informal practical education and vocational training. Another
recent development in Bank lending was a loan to the! Senegalese Post Office
(Loan 866-SE) for a telecommunications project.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
23.       Agriculture plays a central role in Senegal's economy; it employs
over 70 percent of the total labor force, and contributes about one third
of GDP. The agricultural sector is primarily dependent on two products,
millet as a food crop, and one major cash crop, groundnuts, which produces
about 60 percent of value added by the sector.
24.       Agricultural development in the central Groundnut Basin is severely
restricted by ecological conditions and human problems. Rainfall is low,
fluctuates widely and i limited to three or four months of the year. Since
1967 this difficult situation has been compounded by three droughts which
have reduced the groundrut and other harvests causing a reduction in rural
incomes. Overpopulation in this region, where most of the population is
centered, prescribes farms that are uneconomic in size, while over-working
the land has further impoverished soils. Rural potential for the cultivation
of rice, cotton and fruit is greater in the sparsely populated south and
south-east, but development is hampered by lack of feeder roads and other
infrastructure.
25.       In the years immediately following independence, the Government
assigned low priority to agricultural development in allocating public invest-
ment and current budget expenditures. At a time when introduction of new
crops and new techniques and development of new regions required special
efforts to provide adequate extension services and to improve transport
facilities and rural infrastructure, the efficiency of agricultural and
other Government services concerned with the rural sector deteriorated
seriously.
26.       During the Second and Third Plans period (1965-73), however, the
Government undertook several programs to meet the most urgent needs of the
rural sector; the forthcoming Fourth Plan (1973/74-1976/77) aims at expanding
and intensifying these efforts, with the help of the Bank Group and other
donors such as FED and FAC. The main aspects of the new Government strategy
for agricultural development is directed at:



-7-
(a) increasing productivity of groundnuts and millet;
(b) developing under-utilized land in the south-east; and
(c) diversifying agricultural production.
27.       Production of groundnuts and millet will continue to play a domi-
nant role in Senegal's agriculture for some time, though the efforts of the
Government to increase production during the Third Plan period have been
frustrated by the repeated droughts, and, initially, by too low groundnut
prices at the farmgate. Given the limited potential of the Groundnut basin,
productivity increases are essential to support the growing population and
to raise rural incomes.  The first Bank/IDA agricultural credit operation
(Loan 584-SE and Credit 140-SE) together with this proposed credit support
the Government's endeavors in raising productivity, and in strengthening the
institutions which serve the rural sector. These two projects may be followed
in a few years by another project which would involve introduction of more
sophisticated cultivation techniques in the more fertile southern end of the
groundnut basin.
28.       The first Bank Group Terres Neuves project is a pilot scheme to
test the most effective methods of facilitating settlement in the south-east,
where soils and climatic conditions are more favorable than in the Groundnut
Basin. The project involves construction of feeder roads, warehouses, and
wells, resettlement of 300 families and provision of extension services; it
also includes detailed studies on the human and technical problems of large-
scale migration, which will pave the way for a much larger follow-up project.
29.       Rice, cotton, and vegetable production in the south (Casamance) and
irrigated areas are promising avenues for further agricultural diversification.
Domestic production of rice has fluctuated with the weather around the level
of 100,000 tons, while rice consumption has increased steadily, reaching
300,000 tons in 1970, making Senegal West Africa's largest importer of rice at
an annual foreign exchange cost of about US$25 million. About 80 percent of
domestically produced rice is grown in the Casamance region. The Casamance
project (FY71) in the south and the River Polders project (FY73) in the north
will increase rice production and help agricultural diversification.
30.       In addition to farming, livestock herding is an important source
of income for the rural sector. A good local market for beef exists, and
a considerable number of cattle are now imported on the hoof from Mauritania
and Mali, some of which could be supplied from an improved domestic herd.
The Government has already launched a project to improve the quality of
the herd in the Fleuve region. Livestock potential in the drier areas will
inevitably be limited by shortages of natural forage, but other areas of the
country represent an untapped potential for livestock development. Preparation
of a project in the Eastern Region for Bank Group consideration will soon be
started with UNDP assistance.



- 8 -
31.       The broad lines of the Government strategy for agricultural develop-
ment define satisfactorily overall objectives for the agricultural sector
(para 26). In implementing these objectives, there remain open to the Govern-
ment several policy options which would reduce the dependence of the economy
on the climate. Among the possible actions open to the Government would be
the development of large scale irrigation works along the Senegal River, for
which studies have recently been completed by the United Nations Development
PLogramme. Other strategies available include continued resettlement of the
population into less drought prone areas, further diversification and intensifi-
cation of cash crops using underground water reserves, and the introduction
of varieties of groundnuts which are less susceptible to present climate dif-
ficulties. A Bank sector mission is planned to visit Senegal during FY 74
to assist the Government in assessing the relative merits of these policies
options and in defining a more detailed strategy which will serve as a basis
for our continuing project identification and preparation effort.
PART IV - TIE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Senegal, Appraisal of the Second Agricultural
Credit Project" (128-SE) is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. A credit and project sunmary is provided as Annex III.
Background
33.       In 1966, the Senegalese Government set up an Agricultural Productivity
Program, which the Bank Group has been assisting since 1968 through its First
Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 140-SE and Loan 584-SE). The purpose of
this first project was to finance farm implements and to strengthen the
agencies responsible for agricultural credit, marketing, and extension services
during the 1968-72 period.
34.       Severe drought or poor weather in 1968, 1970 and 1972 resulted in a
general decline in agricultural production, though during the first years of
the project adverse government policies further hindered its progress. Use
of funds for medium term loans to farmers was much below expectations at the
outset due to farmers increasing reluctance to grow groundnuts. This reluctance
stemmed not only from poor financial returns due to low farmgate prices, but
also to a large extent from an inadequate marketing organization based on a
system of cooperatives which failed to meet farmers' real needs. Finally
matters were aggravated by the inability of the Government to ensure satis-
factory coordination among all institutions involved, and a decline in the
operating efficiency of the National Development Bank (BNDS) in distributing
credit to farmers. In 1970 the Bank urged the Government to take strong
action in revising certain policies, as a result of which, in 1971 after some
delay, producer prices for groundnuts were raised and stabilized, accumulated
debts were cancelled, planting bonuses were paid, and a retroactive payment



- 9 -
was made to farmers for the previous harvest. The Government has stated that
it intends to keep farmgate prices for groundnuts at remunerative levels in
the future. On the institutional side the Government and the Bank cooperated
to strengthen and reorganize BNDS and ONCAD in an effort to improve services
to cooperatives. The low demand for credit during the early project years
and changed circumstances of the project required a reduction in the agricul-
tural credit category of project costs, and consequently the loan portion of
the Bank Group assistance, amounting to US$3.5 million was cancelled in
March 1971. As a result of the measures taken, farmers' resistance to ground-
nut production has been reversed, despite the occurrence in 1972 of the
severest drought for 50 years.
35.       Although crop output was far below appraisal estimates, credit for
farm implements has served a very useful purpose. Experience indicates that
where equipment has been purchased and used, farmers were able to acliieve
much higher production levels than could have been obtained without equipment.
Good groundnut prices in 1971 and 1972 resulted in an increased demand for
farm inputs, and an expansion of the area cultivated. The performance of the
institutions involved in project implementation has improved substantially.
In particular, ONCAD, the marketing agency, has been reorganized. While
there is room for further improvement, ONCAD has become increasingly more
effective. Given these encouraging results and the high priority of ground-
nut development for the Senegalese economy, a second agricultural credit
project was prepared by PMWA in May and July 1972 and appraised in November
1972. Negotiations with a government delegation led by the Director of the
Senegalese Development Bank( BNDS), Mr. Djibril Sakho, were held in Washington
in May 1973.
Description of Project
36.       The proposed project would extend beyond the Groundnut basin and
include outlying regions where diversification projects (rice and cotton
developments) are currently being carried out. The proposed project would
meet the medium-term credit requirements of the Agricultural Productivity
Program over three years (1973/74 through 1975/76). It would include:
(a) medium-term credit for animal-drawn implements, carts and
draft animals;
(b) transportation, office and demonstration equipment for
the extension agency, SODEVA, and equipment for the research
agency, IRAT, to continue rhizobium 1/ research;
(c) buildings and teaching equipment for SODEVA's training center
for extension agents;
1J   Groundnuts, like many other legumes, often live in association with
bacteria (Rhizobium) which have the property of providing the plant with
nitrogen. Whenever the appropriate strain of rhizobitum is mission from
the soil -- as appears to be the case in Senegal -- a decrease in yields
occurs unless sufficient fertilizer is applied. rRAT's research program
consists of selecting Rhizobium strains suitable for Senegal.



- 10 -
(d) technical assistance to ONCAD and SODEVA; and
(e) studies to provide information on seed storage, on fertilizer
response at the field level, and on the feasibility of expanding
an ongoing production improvement scheme irn Sine-Saloum.
Cost of Project and Financial Plan
37.       The total cost of the project would be US$11.5 million, including
duities and taxes of US$1.3 million. Tne foreign exchange component is US$5.6
million, or 49% of the total cost. The proposed IDA credit would be US$8.2
million, which would correspond to 80 percent of project cost, net of taxes;
B.^;" Group financing of this share of project costs is in accord with Senegal '.
over..l external capital requirements, as discussed in paragraph 15. The
Senegalese contribution would be US$3.3 million, of which US$3.1 million wouLd
be financed by the National Development Bank (BNDS) from its amy resources,
and USS0.2 million by the Government. US$6.3 million of the IDA funds would
be relent by Government to BNDS for 20 years, including four years of grace
at an interest rate of 5.5 percent, equal to the new rediscount rate of the
Central Bank. BNDS would make sub-loans to farmers for five years at the
Central Bank discount rate plus two percentage points. US$1.45 million wouild
be used to help finance equipment and buildings for SODEVA and IRAT, technicci
assistance to ONCAD and SODEVA, and studies; and US$0.45 million would be heLd
as a contin-gency reserve.
38.       Funds for the credit portion of the First Project will be fully
disbursed with the 1972/73 campaign. In the absence of suitable alternative
sources of finance and in order not to interrupt the agriculttural credit
program, credit for implements and carts for the 1973/74 campaign is included
in the Second Project.  To allow timely delivery, orders for these items for
a total of USS2.0 million have already been placed based on the procurement
procedures otutlined in para 39. Loans to farmers based on th-;e ordern wc'ir
be eligible for reimbursement tinder the proposed project.
Procurement
39.       Under the first project procurement contracts for farm implements
and carts were submitted by ONCkD to international competitive tender; ONCAP
assembled one single order for implements each year in order to attract as
wide a range of suppliers as possible.   This procedure r,as been beset by
frequent delays in ordering and late arrival of equipment in the field; and
farmers refusing to accept delivery. Moreover, the only bide received for
farm implements have been from SISCOMA, a local manufacturer. In the case
of carts, competition has been somewhat wider, but only Senegalese manufac-
turers tendered. SISCOMA implements have been developed and proven under
Senegalese conditions, and are well-liked by the farmers. It is proposed
that under the second credit, an exception be made to inter-national competi-
tive bidding with respect to farm implements and that new procurement arrange-
ments be employed which would permit ONCAD to negotiate contracts each year
directly with SISCOMA and thus avoid problems that have arisen with the co-
ordination of ordering and delivery of equipment. Procurement of carts, with



an estimated value of US$3.8 million, and equipment for project organizations,
estimated at US$0.5 million, would be through competitive bidding following
the Bank Group guidelines on procurement.
Organization and Management
40.       BNDS, SODEVA, and ONCAD, the three organizations that have imple-
mented the first project, have by and large performed adequately and would
continue to be responsible for project implementation in the future. BNDS
provides seasonal and medium-term credit to farmers. It would make five-year
loans to farmers to finance the full purchase cost of farm implements and
draft animals. Farmers cash flow projections indicate that they can afford
the new interest rate. BNDS financial situation has improved considerably
in the last three years, after a period of serious deterioration in 1967-68.
BNDS income has been sufficient to cover operating expenses and make adequate
provision for doubtful debts. The proposed terms of the Government subloan
to BNDS and of BNDS credits to farmers should permit the agency to become
financially autonomous in its Agricultural Productivity Program activities.
41.       In its Agricultural Productivity operations, BNDS deals almost
exclusively with groundnut farmer cooperatives. Cooperatives are assisted
by ONCAD which maintains their accounts, distributes inputs, markets ground-
nuts, and recovers farm credits. A major reorganization of ONCAD, with the
assistance of the consulting firm ITALOONSULT, was financed under the first
project and since 1969, ONCAD has operated at a small profit. However, there
is room for further improvement of ONCAD's performance, and the proposed proj-
ect would finance some limited technical assistance over three more years. An
accounting and a data processing expert would assist ONCAD in operating its
accounting system.
42.       SODEVA, the Agricultural Development Agency, was set up in 1968
to take over the extension services then managed by the French consulting
firm SATEC. Although its expatriate staff has been considerably reduced,
SODEVA has been consistently well managed and has effectively promoted the
use of improved cultivation techniques. SODEVA has recently set up a
small unit to evaluate the results of applied extension techniques. The
proposed project would finance (a) the addition of four experienced agronomists
over two years to help SODEVA improve its analysis of the performance of
farmers' receiving implements and to guide the fertilizer and Sine-Saloum
studies to be carried out during project implementation; and (b) a seed
storage specialist to determine additional seed storage requirements.
Economic Justification
43.       The project's direct economic benefits would comprise production
increases resulting from farmers switching either from basic hand cultivation
to light donkey or horse-drawn equipment or from light equipment to the
use of heavier ox-drawn equipment, and production that would be lost if
farmers' animal-drawn equipment were not replaced under the project. The
sale of this additional production would raise the per capita income of the



- 12 -
participating farms between 40 and 80 percent. The 55,000 farm families,
representing about 450,000 people, or about 11 percent of the population who
are expected to participate in the project, now have per capita income of
US$40-60, considerably below the average of US$100 for the rural sector, and
the project would therefore benefit a particularly poor part of the population.
The overall economic rate of return is 22 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       A draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Senegal
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided in Article V,
Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement
conforms to the normal pattern for agricultural projects. The signing of a
subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Association under which the
Government would lend the equivalent of US$6.3 million to the National
Development Bank would be a condition of effectiveness of the Credit.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C.    Projects in Execution
Cr. No. 96 First Railwa- Project, US$9.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1966; Closing Date; June 30, 1973
1.         The project was designed to put the Railways (Regie) on a sound
technical and financial footing. All project items, mainly track material
and some rolling stock, have now been delivered and the project will be com-
pleted by June 1973, about three years behind the original schedule. Due
to the Regie's internal administrative difficulties, lack of qualified
staff to prenare and issue tender documents and also to labor problems, de-
livery of materials and equipment was delayed and, as a result, disbursements
were slow.
2.         The financial performance of the Regie during the first project
fell considerably short of expectation, principally because traffic did not
increase as expected at the time of appraisal. Furthermore, the Regie's
effort to cut personnel costs was largely offset by an increase in its mate-
rial costs. As a result, the Regie is still operating at a loss as compared
1/    These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

to a target rate of return for 1969/70 of 4 percent as agreed in 1966. The
shortfalls in the Regie's performance under Credit 96-SE must be viewed in the
light of the Senegalese and Malian economies' failure to move ahead as rapidly
as expected. The recent economic recovery in both countries will assist in
improving the financial situation of the Regie.
Ln. No. 493     Port of Dakar; IJS$4.0 Million
Loan of May 1, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1972
3.        The first port project, which was approved in 1967, was to improve
Dakar port facilities by extending the wharves, reconstructing quay walls,
and dredging various areas in the port. Execution of the project was slow but
satisfactorv and work is now complete. Special loan covenants have helped
improve the finances and administration of the Port Authority. Some loan
funds remain, which the Port Authority wishes to apply to additional rehabili-
tation work. A supervision mission is to visit Senegal to examine this pro-
posal.
Cr. No. 140     First Agricultural Credit Project; US$6.0 Million and
ln. No. 584i   IJS$3.5 Million
Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Closing Date: M4arch 31, 1974
4.        The objective of the First Agricultural Credit Project was to bring
about increases in farmers income and Government's revenues by an increase in
production and yields of groundnut and millet in Senegal's "Groundnut Basin".
The project financed 75% of the cost of animal drawn equipment purchased by
farmers and varying percentages of the costs of management assistance to
marketing, extension and credit institutions. A sharp fall in groundnut out-
put due to low prices and poor weather caused a drop in demand for credit and
led to a cancellation of the Bank Loan. In 1971 a combination of better
financial incentives and normal weather conditions permittecl thle recovery of
groundnut production, but as a result of drought conditions in 1972 the crop
for that vear was the smallest of the last 25 years, as a result, actual
production levels have stayed well behind expectations at the outset. It is
felt, however, that the essential component under the first project, the
distribution of animal drawn equipment on credit, has benefitted the farmer
even under adverse weather conditions and that without equipment availability
overall production would have been even lower.
Cr. No. 198     First Highway Project; US$2.1 Million
Credit of June 19, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1972
5.        The first highway project provided for construction of feeder roads,
purchase of highway maintenance equipment, and a study of road improvement
and maintenance. Execution of the project has been satisfactory. Actual
costs are within appraisal estimates and surplus funds available are being
used to provide additional maintenance equipment.

Cr. No. 252     Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Nillion
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
6.        Launched in earlv 1972, the project has satisfactorily completed
its first season. Cultivation targets have been met and despite particularly
noor rainfall, production was in line with the appraisal report estimates.
Project management is good and the difficulties previosly experienced are
now being solved.
Cr. No. 253     Technical and Agricultural Education Project; USS2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: October 1, 1976
7.        Construction of all Project schools is expected to be completed
bv January 31, 1975 in accordance with the appraisal schedule.    Completion of
the lists of enuipment and furniture is progressing satisfactorily except
for the Merchant Marine School at Dakar. The Government has met major diffi-
culties in finding a suitable fisheries specialist related to Section 4.02 of
the Credit Agreement, and the deadline in the Credit Agreement, December 31,
1972, already extended by six months, will need to be extended again. No
extension of the closing date is expected.
Cr. No. 254     Terres Neives Settlement Project; US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
8.        Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfactorilv
and first vear's results (1972) are in line with the appraisal report estimates.
Administrative difficulties in making STN (the State Corporation In charge of
the project) operational has created financial difficulties and caused delays
in implementation of the project's infrastructure program. The situation is
being regularized. The preparation of a second phase project is under way
and the feasibilitv study should be readv by mid 1974.
Cr. No. 314
Ln. No. 335     Second Railway Project; ITS$3.2 Million and US$6.4 Million
Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
9.        This project involves contintuation of track renewal towards the
Mali border, modernization of workshops tn increase efficiency and thus
improve availability of rolling stock, purchase of locomotives and moderniza-
tion of freight cars to reduceemaintenance costs, technical services and
training. Tenders have already been invited for freight car modernization,
machine-tools for the Thies workshops and track renewal material. Retendering
for part of this last item is necessary as onlv one offer was received.
Operating and workshops experts are in the field. Transport coordination
experts are being selected. Overall progress is satisfactory.

10.       In order to achieve full potential benefits of the Investment
Program and to allow the Regie to reach financial viability by 1975/76 a
Plan of Action has been agreed upon with Government and the Regie. This
Plan outlines measures to be adopted by the Regie to improve operations,
reduce staff, and study certain branch lines which appear to be unprofitable.
Cr. No. 336    Site and Services Project; US$8.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
11.       The Credit Agreement was not signed until September 29, 1972 and
is not yet effective. However, the executing agency, Office des Habitations
a Loyers Moderes is carrying out its reorganization and has begun the detailed
engineering for the first phase of the project.
Ln. No. 867    Airport Project; US$3.0 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
12.       This loan was made effective on May 22, 1973.

Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date; June 30, 1976
