                         The project development objectives are the establishment and implementation of comprehensive natural disaster risk management framework to assist the Government
                         to : (a) strengthen the capacity of national and local disaster risk management institutions; (b) reduce the vulnerability to flood and storm hazards in project areas; and
                         (c) increase the efficiency of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts.

                         The original project was closed on June 29, 2011, while implementation of the Component 3 continued under the additional financing. Overall implementation towards achievement of
                         the project development objectives (PDOs) is satisfactory because two key project outcome indicators: (a) establishment of comprehensive disaster risk management framework,
                         and (b) strengthening Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control have been fully met. An institutional framework for disaster management framework (e.g. National Strategy for

                         assessment (DANA), which is a tool to assess damages and help post disaster reconstruction.

                         The additional financing (AF) of US$ 75 million has been provided by the International Development Association (IDA) to support scaling up of post-disaster reconstruction under
                         Component 3 of the original project. Implementation of the AF-funded activities is being implemented well. These activities have not only contributed to the rapid post disaster
                         reconstruction after 2008, 2009 and 2010 storms, but also contributed to developing and adopting the procedures for post disaster damage and needs assessment. Recent field visit
                         shows, however, that while the physical reconstruction has been progressing well, the AF has not yet contributed to the improved speed and efficiency through the streamlined
                         procedures, which is one of the two development objectives of the AF. As the completion of the closing date is nearing, the client has started a study to improve the current
                         procedures.
