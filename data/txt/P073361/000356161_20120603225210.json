The closing date of the project will be extended by\n            28 days from May 31, 2012 to June 28, 2012. This will be the\n            fourth extension of the project. The 28 day extension of the\n            closing date would allow the supplier of the equipment to\n            deliver the major part of the equipment to the Borrower,\n            thus allowing the partial financing for the contract\n            financed by the project. The extension is considered to be\n            critical to achieve one of the project's development\n            objectives: to reduce the vulnerability to flood and storm\n            hazards in project areas. The extension of the ongoing\n            project would also lay an important basis for implementing\n            the hydromet component under this follow up project."}, "docdt": "2012-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
