                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are the establishment and implementation of comprehensive natural disaster risk management framework to assist the Government
                         to : (a) strengthen the capacity of national and local disaster risk management institutions; (b) reduce the vulnerability to flood and storm hazards in project areas; and
                         (c) increase the efficiency of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation towards achievement of the project development objectives (PDOs) is satisfactory based on the achievement of the following two of the key project outcome
                         indicators: (a) establishment of comprehensive disaster risk management framework, and (b) Strengthening Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control have been fully met. An
                         institutional framework for disaster management framework (e.g. National Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation to 2020) has been established,

                         approved, and functional at National and Provincial levels. In the meantime, in the 17 provinces supported by the project after extensive training on disaster risk management and
                         analytical training (e.g. hydrological modeling, Geographical Information System and mapping), a comprehensive investment plan for DRM has been developed and being
                         implemented. Awareness of disaster management has also been increased through the community based disaster risk management (CBDRM) and integration of DRM into
                         education curricula. Further, the project also helped sharpen and disseminate the damage and needs assessment (DANA), which is a tool to assess damages and help post disaster

                         reconstruction. With the PHRD Grant support, the project continues to support DANA dissemination and help address specific technical issues based on the respective provinces’
                         request to further strengthen their technical skills.

                         In addition, most intermediate indicators such as preparation of natural disaster mitigation investment plan, completion of disaster mitigation infrastructure (subprojects), and
                         preparation of safer commune plans have been fulfilled. An intermediate target: percentage of people in targeted communities with improved early warning of floods and storms, has
                         been largely achieved as 100 percent of the target community residents have access to the early warning system. Work is still on-going in the Mekong Delta to improve reliability of
                         the early warning, as the installation of the hydromet equipment at the Southern Hydromet Institute is on going. The additional financing (AF) of US$ 75 million has been provided by
                         the International Development Association (IDA) to support scaling up of post-disaster reconstruction under Component 3 of the original project. Implementation of the AF-funded
                         activities is being implemented well. These activities would not only contribute to the rapid post disaster reconstruction after 2008, 2009 and 2010 storms, but also contributed to the
                         developing and adopting the procedures for post disaster damage and need assessment.
