 VIET NAM- NATURAL DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT PROJECT (P0733610)
                       CREDIT NO. 4114-VN

                               Extension of Closing Date



1.      The closing date for Credit No.4114-VN under the Natural Disaster Risk
Management Project will be extended by 28 days from May 31, 2012 to June 28, 2012 in
order to allow continued implementation of the on-going purchase and installation of the
hydro-metrology equipment for the Center for the Southern Hydro-Metrology under
Component 1 of the project (Control Number 19HD-TB1/2012, 01316940) under the
Disbursement Category (2) of the amended Development Credit Agreement dated March
5, 2010. All other disbursement categories shall be closed as of May 31, 2012.

2.     On June 23, 2011, the Borrower requested a 12 month extension to enable
completion of the investments. The Bank granted an 11 month extension as it was
considered that the project activities would be completed by May 31, 2012. However, on
May 11, 2012, the Borrower requested to extend the closing date based on the
aforementioned Government request in June 2011 to enable shipment and delivery of the
goods from Italy and subsequent partial payment from the project. Due to the unforeseen
delay in administration, the opening of the Letter of Credit for the supplier has been
delayed, which has further affected the shipment for the equipment, and the contracts
could not be completed before the current closing date.

3.     The project has been jointly executed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development which is in charge of implementing three components and by the Ministry
of Finance in charge of one component (dealing with post-disaster reconstruction
support). The project was approved in September 2005, and became effective on May
29, 2006. The original closing date was June 30, 2010. In order to respond to the
reconstruction needs resulting from the 2009 Typhoon Ketsana, an additional financing
(AF) of US$75 million was approved in August 2010, and became effective on
November 8, 2010 and is supporting Vietnam address post-disaster reconstruction efforts.

4.       There has been good progress in implementation during the last 10 months since
June 2011, including: (a) good implementation of the post disaster reconstruction
activities under the AF, (b) completion of all three major pending infrastructure
subprojects under Component 1, (c) completion of the pending ICB procurement for
hydromet and start of the implementation of the contract under Component 1. As of May
15, 2012, the total disbursement of the original IDA allocation (US$91 million) reached
about US$86.5 million (or approximately 95 percent of the total original IDA allocation).
The disbursement of the project’s AF has reached about $47 million or more than 60
percent of its value.

5.      The proposed 28 day extension of the closing date would allow the supplier of the
equipment to deliver the major part of the equipment to the Borrower, thus allowing the
partial financing for the contract financed by the project. The supplier has already

                                           4
shipped the equipment, and the equipment is scheduled to arrive in Vietnam in mid-June
2012. The proposed extension is considered to be critical to achieve one of the project’s
development objectives: to reduce the vulnerability to flood and storm hazards in project
areas.

6.      At present, the Bank is formulating a follow up disaster management project,
Vietnam Managing Natural Hazards, scheduled to be presented to the Board of Directors
in July 2012. It includes a component to further develop capacities for hydromet data
collection and analysis. The proposed extension of the ongoing project would also lay an
important basis for implementing the hydromet component under this follow up project.

7.      The Project’s development objective is still achievable, and implementation of the
project has been moderately satisfactory and there are no significant issues related to
either fiduciary or safeguards policies. There is no overdue audit report and financial
management has been rated moderately satisfactory. The Borrower has also prepared an
action plan dated May, 2012, stating the target date of the delivery of the goods, which is
found to be considered applicable and sufficient for the purposes of this extension.

8.      As of May 23, 2012, there are outstanding ineligible expenditures of about
US$236,000 equivalent, including salary supplements for government officials, some
contract overpayments, incorrect financing percentages, and recruitment of ineligible
consultants, identified through an independent review carried out in January 2012. The
bulk of these ineligible expenditures derive from the misunderstanding of the Borrower
as to the permissibility of the financing salary supplements of civil servants from the
proceeds of the IDA credit. The Government of Vietnam has acknowledged these
ineligible expenditures and has already started the process to make the refunds. On May
23, 2012, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development sent a letter confirming the
refund of the ineligible expenditures by June 14, 2012. In this context, it has been
considered that the project has maintained acceptable financial management
arrangements, and that the actions allowed for under Annex A to BP. 10.02 to withhold
necessary extension of the closing date are not warranted, and therefore the proposed
extension should not be withheld.

9.     This will be the fourth extension of the project. As a result, a total extension
period of 23 months and 28 days would be made from the original closing date.
