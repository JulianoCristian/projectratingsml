                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are the establishment and implementation of comprehensive natural disaster risk management framework to assist the Government
                         to : (a) strengthen the capacity of national and local disaster risk management institutions; (b) reduce the vulnerability to flood and storm hazards in project areas; and
                         (c) increase the efficiency of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation towards achievement of the project development objectives (PDOs) is moderately satisfactory because among three key project outcome indicators, only two
                         outcome indicators: (a) establishment of comprehensive disaster risk management framework, and (c) strengthening Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control have been fully
                         met. An institutional framework for disaster management framework (e.g. National Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation to 2020) has been established,

                         approved, and is functional at National and Provincial levels. A comprehensive investment plan for DRM has been developed (after extensive training on disaster risk management
                         and analytical training in e.g. hydrological modeling, Geographical Information System and mapping for the 17 project provinces), and is being implemented. Awareness of disaster
                         management has also been increased through the community based disaster risk management (CBDRM) and integration of DRM into education curricula. Further, the project has
                         also helped to sharpen and disseminate the damage and needs assessment (DANA), which is a tool to assess damages and help post disaster reconstruction.

                         The outcome indicator: (b) increase the efficiency of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts has been only partially achieved. Additional financing (AF) of US$ 75 million has
                         supported scaling up post-disaster reconstruction under Component 3 of the original project. These activities have closed the funding gaps for post-disaster reconstruction of public
                         infrastructure, including schools, health facilities, road, bridges, water and sewerage infrastructures, canals, dykes and pumping stations, which were seriously damaged by storms
                         and floods during 2008-2012. Since the start of the NDRMP’s implementation, post-disaster reconstruction has gone through five cycles of post-disaster reconstruction (2008 – 2012).
                         However, on average the fund allocation took about 8 – 14 months for each cycle, whereas the project targets the completion of both fund allocation and reconstruction processes
                         within 12 months. Technical assistance was provided to review current practices and proposed an improved mechanism for the post disaster reconstruction. The consultant’s findings
                         will be presented to government at national and provincial levels at the project closing workshop in December, 2013.
