outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: DRM decisions\n            should be made based on perceived risk reduction benefits\n            and a combination of the physical and non-physical solutions\n            in a context of larger integrated river-basin management\n            scale. Existing institutional settings need to be leveraged\n            to implement community-based (CB) DRM activities. Tailored\n            public information and awareness-raising, including gender\n            mainstreaming, are essential for commune participation,\n            accountability, and investment ownership. Operating and\n            maintenance (O and M) budget should be sufficiently\n            allocated through the government annual budget planning\n            cycle conducted in all levels. Strong institutional reform\n            and leadership of the coordination agency is essential for\n            project success and sustainability. Clear institutional\n            arrangements and responsibilities need to be determined\n            before project start. Achievement of the sustainable goal\n            for post-disaster reconstruction should be monitored closely\n            and properly throughout the implementation of both original\n            credit and additional finance (AF). Comprehensive monitoring\n            and evaluation (M and E) framework should be prepared and\n            put in place before the project start."}, "docdt": "2014-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
