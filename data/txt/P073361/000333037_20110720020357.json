The executing agency, the Ministry of Agriculture\n            and Rural Development (MARD) in close collaboration with the\n            Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), has\n            prepared a detailed implementation plan for the remaining\n            activities towards project completion. Agreement on the\n            pending contents and procedures for an International\n            Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement of hydromet equipment\n            is expected to occur in the coming weeks enabling the start\n            of the bidding process in July 2011. If this does indeed\n            occur it is expected that the closing date will be extended\n            for a further six months to the end of June 2012 to enable\n            the completion of the procurement and the equipment\n            installation. This will be the second extension of the\n            project. As a result, a total extension period of 18 months\n            will be made from the original closing date."}, "docdt": "2011-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
