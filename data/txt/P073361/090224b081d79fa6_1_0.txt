                         The project development objectives are the establishment and implementation of comprehensive natural disaster risk management framework to assist the Government
                         to : (a) strengthen the capacity of national and local disaster risk management institutions; (b) reduce the vulnerability to flood and storm hazards in project areas; and
                         (c) increase the efficiency of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction efforts.

                         The original project was closed on June 29, 2011, while implementation of the Component 3 continued under the additional financing. Overall implementation towards achievement of
                         the project development objectives (PDOs) is satisfactory because two key project outcome indicators: (a) establishment of comprehensive disaster risk management framework,
                         and (b) strengthening Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control have been fully met. An institutional framework for disaster management framework (e.g. National Strategy for

                         comprehensive investment plan for DRM has been developed and being implemented. Awareness of disaster management has also been increased through the community based
                         disaster risk management (CBDRM) and integration of DRM into education curricula. Further, the project has also helped to sharpen and disseminate the damage and needs

                         assessment (DANA), which is a tool to assess damages and help post disaster reconstruction.

                         The additional financing (AF) of US$ 75 million has been provided by the International Development Association (IDA) to support scaling up of post-disaster reconstruction under
                         Component 3 of the original project. Implementation of the AF-funded activities is being implemented with satisfactory outputs. These activities have contributed to the rapid post
                         disaster reconstruction after storms and floods during 2008-2012. As the project is nearing completion, the project also aimed at supporting the MOF and the provinces to establish
                         procedures for post disaster reconstruction from the post disaster damage and needs assessment to actual post disaster reconstruction. Currently, it takes 8-14 months to complete
                         these procedures, and the project aims at streamlining them.
