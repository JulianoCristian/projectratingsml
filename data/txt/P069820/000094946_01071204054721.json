sustained Government ownership of reforms, and\n            strong constituent support; adequate institutional capacity\n            to implement the reforms, and monitor progress and outcomes;\n            effective monitoring of the economic, and social impact of\n            reforms, particularly on the most vulnerable members of\n            society.
