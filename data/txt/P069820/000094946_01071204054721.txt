3. Assessment of Development Objective and D)esign, and of Quality at Entry
3. 1 Original Objective:
Obiectives. Building on the satisfactory results of its macroeconomic reform program implemented during
the early 1990s, the Government elaborated in 1997 an advanced tariff reform and indirect tax reform



covering the period 1997-2001, and in 1999 a direct tax reforn program for the 1999-2002 period. This
program is spelled out in the Letter of Development Policy of February 29, 2000, attached to the
President's Report.
The Fiscal Reform Support Operation (FRSO) assisted the Govemment implement the fourth and final
phase of the 1997-2001 tariff reform agenda, and the first phase of the 1999-2002 direct tax reform
program. The overall objective of the direct tax and tariff refonn programs was to:
*   Harmonize the corporate and personal tax regime with the Arab Maghrebian Union (AMU), and
with Mali and Senegal
*   Align extemal tariffs with neighboring countries
*   Facilitate Mauritania's economic integration into the regional and global economy, and
*   Continue the implementation of sound macro-economic policies, strong structural reforms, and an
active poverty strategy.
DesigZn. The FRSO was a budget support operation covering the first phase (FY 2000) of the 1999-2002
tax reform agenda. Its focus was on revenue mobilization (direct tax reform) and the allocation of adequate
public resources toward the social sectors (education, health, basic infrastructure). The Credit aimed to: (i)
offset part of the transitional revenue losses arising from ongoing fiscal reforms (direct tax reforn and the
reduction of trade tariffs); and (ii) counter possible reductions in spending for the social sectors. The
program of direct tax reforn for the period 1999-2002 is laid out in Table I below:

The FRSO was a quick-disbursing one-tranche operation of SDR 22.4 million (about US$ 30 million), to
be released at Credit effectiveness. This approach was based on evidence that the Borrower had achieved
satisfactory progress in strengthening tax administration, broadening the tax base and reducing tax and
customs duty exemptions, compared to the status on December 31, 1998, by implementing a reform of
direct taxes that amended previously existing tax regulations. This evidence, a condition of Board
presentation, was provided at negotiations. The amended tax regulations were approved by the Council of
Ministers on October 6, 1999, translated into the Budget Law (Loi des Finances) 2000, and approved by
Parliament on December 6, 1999.
Justification for single-tranche release. Up-front implementation of agreed tax reform measures triggered
the release of the entire Credit amount in one single tranche. Justification for the single tranche was based
on: (i) significant progress of policy actions in the areas of taxation and public finance; (ii) strong past
performance of the fiscal reforn program; (iii) the need to offset anticipated fiscal revenue losses arising
from implementation of tariff reforms and reductions in corporate income tax rates. Not coincidentally, the
up-front conditionality helped assure that revised tax regulations were implemented with effect at the start
of fiscal year 2000.
Sector Context.  The FRSO  logically followed on the Public Resource Management Credit (Cr.
2887-MAU, closed Dec. 31, 1999) which helped broaden and diversify the tax base and improve public
expenditure allocation consistent with the macroeconornic framework.
The FRSO was in keeping with the May 1997 Country Assistance Strategy (the most recent CAS) whose
main theme was the maintenance and consolidation of macroeconomic stability through, inter alia, tax and
tariff reforms. The 1997 CAS includes two policy actions to help maintain macroeconomic stability: (i)
diversify and simplify taxation; and (ii) maintain the focus .of expenditure on priority areas (education,
health, basic infrastructure). These are perfectly in line with the tax reform and poverty-oriented measures
of the FRSO. The FRSO objectives complement theS strategies recommended by the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative, and the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement fiLnded by the IMF.
As indicated in the President's Report, there are also clear links between the FRSO and the Ninth Policy
Framework Paper (PFP, 1999-2002). In the area of fiscal policy, the PFP expected total revenue to decline
by about 3.5 percent during 1999-2002 owing to lower tariffs, no exceptional dividends from the national
mining company (SNIM), and expiration of the fisheries agreement with the EU in 2000. To counter this
revenue loss, the PFP recommended that fiscal policy should aim to increase domestic tax revenues by: (i)
eliminating remaining tax exemptions for public enterprises; (ii) unifying the VAT rates; and (iii)
streamlining tax administration. The PFP also identified tax reforms and the elimination of tax distortions
as strategic measures to promote private sector development.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Objectives were not revised.
-3-



3.3 Original Components:
The FRSO essentially focused on three areas: (i) Tax and Tariff Reforms; (ii) Public Expenditures; and
(iii) Fiscal Administration.
Tax and Tariff Reforms. A number of decisions regarding improving tax administration, broadening the tax
base, and reducing or eliminating tax and customs duty exemptions were taken prior to the start of FY00
and implemented within the framework of the Budget Law 2000 (Loi des Finances 2000). Specifically, tax
regulations were amended as follows:
*  reduction of tax on real estate income from 30% to 20%
*  introduction of an accelerated tax depreciation rate system for registered enterprises
*  extension of carry-over of losses from previous years from 3 to 4 years for registered enterprises
*  introduction of a withholding system on property transfer tax
*  introduction of a withholding system  of 4%  on all non-commercial income for registered
enterprises
*  increase from 25% to 50% of the deduction of the minimum presumptive tax (Imp6t Minimum
Forfaitaire) from the corporate commercial and non-commercial income tax.
Evidence that these tax measures were implemented (Parliamentary Resolution No. 147 dated December 6,
1999) was provided in fulfillment of the condition of Board presentation of the Credit.
Public Expenditures. The Government is committed to ensure that public expenditures remain consistent
with a sound macroeconomic framework, and that resource allocations and expenditures are efficiently
made, according to policy priorities. To support the budget preparation process, the following measures
were to be taken under the FRSO: (i) prepare a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for the
education, health and infrastructure sectors; (ii) implement the MTEF for education and health in 2001 and
for infrastructure in 2002; and (iii) conduct multi-year Public Expenditure Reviews.
Fiscal Administration. This component essentially focused on strengthening the General Tax Directorate
(DGI) of the Ministry of Finance. Three measures were to be taken: (i) create a Directorate of Large
Enterprises (DGE) within DGI; (ii) follow up on non-payment of taxes; and (iii) improve fiscal controls.
This program was to be completed in 2000.
3.4 Revised Components:
Components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry is rated highly satisfactory. The program's objectives and components were
appropriate and consistent with the Government's macroeconomic reform agenda. The program was
well-designed, with good implementation arrangements that incorporated the lessons drawn from previous
adjustment operations. Local conditions and limitations were adequately taken into account. The program
complemented the economic and financial programs supported by the IMF, particularly those of the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Macroeconomic performance has continued to improve, reflecting prudent policies and strong ownership of
the program. Macroeconomic stability has been achieved through cautious fiscal and monetary policies.
Economic growth has picked up and the external position remains stable.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Tax and tariff reforms. Corporate and personal tax reforms for fiscal year 2000 have been implemented as
agreed. The tax system is being simplified and strengthened: tax rates as well as the number of tax
brackets have been reduced and tax administration has become more efficient with the restructuring of the
tax directorate (DGI) in 2000. The reforms undertaken under the FRSO in year 2000 are being continued
in 2001, with a focus on eliminating VAT exemptions, unifying VAT rates, further reducing the corporate
tax rate, and further strengthening tax administration (see Annex 1: Policy Reforms/Key Monitoring
Indicators). These are good steps for improving the business environment.
Public Expenditures. Medium-termn expenditure frameworks (METF) for the education and health sectors,
originally scheduled to be completed in September 2000, have been delayed and rescheduled to June 2001.
In spite of this delay, public expenditures in the education and health sectors have been largely protected
from the effects of revenue loss. Table 2 below (prepared for the PRSP) shows trends in actual and
projected expenditures for these poverty-sensitive sectors from 1997 to 2002.

Fiscal Administration. The General Tax Directorate in the Ministry of Finance has been strengthened, as
agreed. A Directorate of Large Enterprises has been set up, staffed and equipped. As a result, the
follow-up on non-payment of taxes has improved and fiscal control has been strengthened. These are
- 5 -



excellent first steps but more needs to be done to further improve the efficiency and accountability of public
resource management. Specifically, accounting practices need to be strengthened and brought into line with
international practice, transparency in public financial management needs to be improved, and monitoring
of budget execution needs to be reinforced. The Go-vemment's tax reform agenda for 2001 and 2002 will
pay attention to these shortcomings and a further strengthening of tax administration and reduction of
distortions can be expected. Technical assistance provided by the IMF, and by France under its ongoing
bilateral assistance program, will continue to support the Ministry of Finance in these areas.

4.4 Financial rate of return.
Not applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The main objective for institutional development was to strengthen the General Tax Directorate in the
Ministry of Finance. As noted above, all planned improvements have been made and the unit is reaching its
expected operational efficiency. The impact of the project on institutional development is therefore rated
substantial. Continuing technical assistance from the IMF, France and other donors is building on the
positive results achieved under this operation, and more improvements are expected in the future.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The main factor with a potential negative impact on the program was the 1999-2000 oil shock. Current
account deficits widened as a result of a larger petroleum import bill, but these were partially offset by
additional IDA funding under the Program of Supplemental Credits relating to the Impact of Oil Prices on
Africa, approved by the Board in December 2000 (see below).
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government's strong and sustained commitment to the reform process and the effective participation of
its staff in the preparation and execution of the program were key factors that positively affected outcomes.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control.
Satisfactory supervision of program execution by the Ministry of Finance was a positive factor.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Amendment to the Credit Agreement. A supplemental credit of SDR 14.1 million (equivalent to US$ 18.0
million) was approved by the Board on November 28, 2000. This amendment was part of the Bank's
program to help African countries with urgent financing needs to counter the negative effects of the
1999-2000 oil shock and keep their adjustment programs on track. For Mauritania, the additional
financing requirements caused by the oil shock were estimated at US$ 22.7 million in year 2000. The
- 6 -



supplemental credit provided balance of payment suplport of US$ 18.0 million, with the remainder to be
covered by the Government. An amendment to the Ciredit Agreement was issued on January 2, 2001 and
the original Credit closing date was extended to June 30, 2001. There were no conditionalities associated
with the amendment.
6. Sustainability
6. 1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Prospects for sustainability are rated highly likely.  This rating is based on: (i) continued strong
performance of the Government's macroeconomic and sector policy reforms, based on a high level of
commitment and competence at both political and operational levels; (ii) the Govermment's determination to
integrate the Mauritanian economy into the global economy; and (iii) the fact that the agreed tax reform
measures were legally adopted before Credit effectiveness and fully implemented since then. Further, the
implementation of the second phase tax reform was implemented with the Budget Law 2001 without Bank
financial assistance.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
As shown in Annex 1, reform measures in phase 2 of tax reforms (FY01) focus on corporate income taxes,
property taxes and payroll taxes. The third phase, under preparation, may be considered for further Bank
assistance in FY02, through a second budget support operation or a Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC), if necessary, thereby completing the 1999-2002 tax reform agenda.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Preparation assistance was extensive and sustained. Discussions with the Borrower on tariff and tax
reform began in 1997, and continued prior to and during the preparation of this operation. Two joint
World Bank/IMF missions were held in September 1999 and February 2000, respectively. The team
updated the macroeconomic framework, examined the 2000 budget, reviewed the first phase of tax reform
underway with the Budget Law 2000, helped prepare the second phase for implementation under Budget
Law 2001, recommended additional studies, and settled the negotiations conditions, including the draft
Letter of Development Policy.
Appraisal was brief (fast track processing). It was based on a well-prepared, highly focused Concept
Paper that defined tax reform objectives and measures to help place the economy on a higher sustainable
growth path. It was decided that a separate appraisal rnission was not required and the Concept Paper was
transformed into a draft President's Report.
7.2 Supervision:
Since all agreed tax reform measures were implemented up-front, formal supervision missions were not
conducted. The impact of the third phase of tax reforrn program, including the possible implementation of
new tax rates based on marginal effective tax rates, will similarly be assessed by the 2002 budget review
mission. The Resident Mission effectively supported preparation and supervision of the program.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Bank's overall performance is rated highly satisfactorv.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Letter of Development Policy (February 29, 2000) prepared by the Borrower provided a
comprehensive framework for program design. The Borrower participated actively and competently in all
phases of program development and implementation. The working groups that assisted the World
Bank/IMF teams in designing the tax reform program were of high calibre and committed to the task at
hand. The Borrower conducted several major tax reform studies (Annex 7). These studies were of
satisfactory quality and provided recommendations that were incorporated in the reform programs.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government provided full support to the operation by actively participating in the preparation of the
tax reform program, by timely passing needed tax laws and regulations, mobilizing constituencies affected
by the tax reform program, and ensuring that the poverty aspects of the reform were adequately taken into
account.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The Ministry of Finance satisfactorily monitored implementation of the reform program as well as overall
macroeconomic performance. Its tax department (DGI) was strengthened to handle the additional work.
Bi-annual reviews were conducted jointly with the Bank/IMF in the context of preparing the next phase of
reforms. Credit funds were used correctly. A special account (SA) in UM was opened in the Central Bank
and expenditures were monitored by the Ministry of Finance. Withdrawals from the SA were made in
accordance with Bank procedures. There is no evidence that credit funds were used for purchases of
restricted items specified in the "negative list" (Credit Agreement, Schedule 1). A final audit is expected to
be conducted prior to the Credit closing date.
7. 7 Overall Borrower performance:
The Borrower's overall performance is rated highlv satisfactorv.
8. Lessons Learned
Key lessons from similar operations in the region and in the country stress the importance of:
a Sustained Government ownership of reforms and strong constituency support
* Adequate institutional capacity to implement the reforms and monitor progress and outcomes
* Effective monitoring of the economic and social impact of reforms, particularly on the most
vulnerable members of society
-8 -



These lessons were incorporated in the implementation and monitoring arrangements for the Fiscal Reform
Support Operation by: (i) matching the level of Government commitment and implementation capacity to
the pace of program execution; and (ii) proceeding to program implementation with clearly defined
development objectives and an effective monitoring system.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Borrower, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in its contribution note states the objectives of the
Fiscal Reform Support Operation (FRSO). The FRSO credit served to support a fiscal reform program
undertaken by the Government in recent years. The Borrower then outlines the program components and
the expected results of the operation.
With regards to the execution of the program, the Borrower states that the fiscal reforms undertaken,
notably the simplification and lowering of corporate tax rates, the harmonization of external tariffs with
neighboring countries, as well as lower taxes on oil products would have led to loss of tax revenue in the
budget. This loss would not have been sustainable by the country without the aid of development partners.
The Borrower then states the rationality of the supplemental credit granted following the oil shock, with a
view to continue sustaining the reform efforts within the context of this program. The supplemental credit
also supported the government in executing the measures contained in the Budget Law.
The results of the Fiscal Reform Support Operation are evident in lower corporate tax rates; the tax
structure of Mauritania is now comparable to that of its neighboring Sub-Sahelian countries. The fiscal and
tariff reforms have been incorporated into the new law. There was an increase in growth in 2000, the
external position is deemed sustainable, and inflation is maintained at a steady rate.
Overall, the Mauritanian partners concur with the conclusions reached by the World Bank in this
Implementation Completion Report.

Contribuo   au Rapport dachivement du Projet
"Appul i b RMrtme de b FP< II'r
Banque Mondlale" IDA- 33520; MDA-33521
Mal 2001
La presente note decrit bri6vement le point de vue de l'Adrninistration mauritanienne
concemant l'opportunlte, la justification et les resultats de l'operation d'Appui a la balance
des palements consentie en I'annee 2000 par le Gro.ipe de la Banque Mondiale a notre pays,
au titre de son programme de reforme de la fiscalite.
Elle constitue donc une contribution au rapport de fin dexecution dudit programme elabore
par la Banque mondiale.
I -ntouo
La politique d'ajustement structurel renforcee entreprise par la 4auritanie depuis 1992 est
destin6e a restaurer les equilibres internes et externes et a creer les conditions d'une
croissance economique soutenue et durable.
Dans ce cadre, le Gouvemement s'est engage dans un ambitieux programme de reforme de
la fiscaiite avec pour objectif de mettre en place une fiscaiiti 4ciiiIbrke et plus equitable, au
moyen dune adminisbtrion fiscale plus performante ainsi que de procedures simplifiees et
mieux adaptees.
Les resultats encourageants obtenus ces demieres annees ont conduit le Gouvernement a
poursuivre les reormes en mettant un accent particulier sur la mobilisation des ressources
interieures ainsi que sur la rationalisation des depenses publiques.
II- objeah. et contenu du Pramme
Le Programme de reforme fiscale vient en appui des efforts d6j4 entrepris par les autorites
mauritaniennes et qui visent a renforcer le position budgetaire de IEtat, de maniere a
permettre I'affectation de ressources suffisantes aux secteurs prioritaires (Sante, education
et infrastructures de base, notammnent). Les principaux objectlfs du programme sont donc:
(i) simplifier, elargir I'assiette et assurer une plus grande equite du systime; (ii) promouvoir
le developpement et la diversification du secteur prive b travers une fiscalite allegee et
simplifiee au profit des Pedtes et moVennes entreprises (PME); et (fii) assurer une meilleure
repartition des richesses interieures.

Les resuJtats attendus au terme de lex&cution du Programme sont: (i) J'harmonisation de

II- Aports et ex6cution du PMoGamme
Les reformes fiscales engagees, notamment la simplification et lallegement fiscaux,
l'armronisation avec le tarit exterieur des pays voisins ainsi que la reduction des taxes sur les
produits petroliers conduiront a un manque i gagner significatif pour le budget de l'Etat. Ce
manque 6 gagner ne pouvalt etre supporte par ia Mauritanie! sans un appul substantiel de
ses partenaires au developpement.
C'est dans ce cadre que la Banque Mondiale a accorde 6 notre pays, au mois de mai 2000,
une enveloppe de 30 millions de dollars US destinee a soutenir ies efforts de reformes du
Gouvernement et a appuyer la balance des paiements. La hausse du prix international du
petrole enregistr4e au cours de l'annee 2000 a conduit ta Banque mondiale i apporter un
appui additionnel d'un montant de 18 millions de dollars US en novembre 2000.
Les appuis consentis par la Banque ont ainsi permis au Gouvemement dexecuter les
mesures inscrites dans la ioi de finances 2000. 11 s'agit, notamment
a) Administration fiscale
r6organisation et renfortement de la Direction Gdnerale des Impots (DGI) avec la
creation d'une Direction des Grandes Entreprises (OGE) dot6e de moyens humairs
et materiels suffisants;
b) Fiscalit* directe
augmentation de 25% A 50% de la deductfon des paiements effectues dans le
cadre de lImp6t minimum forfaitaire (IMF);
- institution dlIMF applicable aux benefices des petites socitis;
- r6duction forfaitaire de li'mp6t sur les revenus fonciers;
- adoption d'un systeme d'amortissement accil&i de linvestissement
c) RWforme tarifaire
- adoption du systime harmonise de classement tarifaire;
- ex6cution de la quatrieme et derniere phase de la r6forme tarifaire engagee
depuis 1997.

Ainsi, des Janvier 2000, les deux (2) taux les plus eleves sont passes respectivement de 22%
a 20% et de 13% a 10% (taxe statistique non comprise). De ce fait, la structure tarifaire de
la Mauritanie est maintenant comparable a celle des pays de la sous-region.
Les reformes fiscales et tarnfares prevues au titre de 1ann4e 2001 ont ete, egalement,
incorporees dans Ia loi de finances 2001.
Par ailleuirs, les resultats economiques du pays ont et satisfaisants en 2000. avec
notamment une croissance economique estimee a plus de 5%, urie position exterieure jugee
soutenable et une inflation maitrisee a 3,3%.
D'une mani6re generale les appreciations portees par ia Banque Mondiale dans le projet de
Rapport d'achevement emportent l'adh6sion de la partie mauritanienne.
