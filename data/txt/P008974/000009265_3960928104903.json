To improve extension staff's\n            contact with farmers, the project would provide housing in\n            the villages, vehicles and equipment. It would provide\n            additional specialist staff and training to widen the range\n            of technical support given to field staff, and assist them\n            in their work. The project would support research institutes\n            and develop strong linkages between extension, research and\n            farmers through diagnostic surveys. It would formulate\n            responses to the needs of homogenous categories of farmers,\n            monitor farmers' uptake and reactions to extension\n            recommendations, and transfer research-based recommendations\n            to reduce the degradation of Turkey's environment and\n            agricultural resources. It would initiate a pilot program to\n            train women engaged in agriculture, and a pilot program of\n            mobile veterinary units to supply improved livestock health\n            services in the villages. Finally, it would provide\n            technical assistance to help implement the project, and\n            funds to prepare a follow-up project."}, "docdt": "1990-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
