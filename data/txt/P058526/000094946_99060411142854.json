Argentine context. There are\n            three project components. 1) Participatory approaches to\n            drug prevention will promote local solutions to drug use in\n            selected municipalities on a pilot basis via training local\n            community members and sector professionals; training youth\n            leaders; and financing the implementation of the municipal\n            plans for drug prevention. 2) Information systems,\n            monitoring, and evaluation will establish the network to\n            facilitate generation and exchange of information relevant\n            to drug prevention, as well as to carry out the monitoring\n            and evaluation of the project by means of a) a survey-based\n            epidemiological study to obtain information on drug\n            consumption patterns; b) development of prevention methods\n            and training modules that will be disseminated via national,\n            regional, and provincial workshops; c) creation of a network\n            of monitoring centers to strengthen existing institutions\n            focused on drug prevention; and d) monitoring and evaluation\n            of overall project implementation processes. 3) Project\n            management will set up a project implementation unit."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
