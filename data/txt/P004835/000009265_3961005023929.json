The purpose of this project is to\n            improve the quality and relevance of primary education;\n            rehabilitate existing infrastructure and extend access; and\n            strengthen the management of primary education at the\n            school, district, provincial, and national levels. Improved\n            quality and relevance will be accomplished through a\n            sustainable system for textbook publishing and distribution,\n            introduction of a uniform school day and year, and provision\n            of basic teaching aids. Rehabilitation of the existing\n            infrastructure includes repairs of buildings and the\n            provision of water supply, latrines and furniture.\n            Strengthened primary education management includes a better\n            knowledge base for decision making, systematic collection,\n            storage, processing and utilization of statistics, and\n            enhanced project identification, planning and implementation capacity."}, "docdt": "1993-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
