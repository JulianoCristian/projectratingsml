          to replace inadequate facilities and to provide additional\n            capacity in compulsory (grades 1-9) and general secondary\n            (grades 10-12) education, improve availability of\n            laboratories, libraries and workshops in upper-secondary\n            schools, and increase the vocational content of curricula.\n            In addition, the project would contribute to the\n            institutional development of the MOE, already initiated\n            under the earlier Bank-financed education projects. The\n            project would include: (a) constructing, equipping, and\n            furnishing 25 compulsory schools and 7 general secondary\n            schools for girls as well as 6 compulsory schools and 9\n            general secondary schools for boys; (b) constructing,\n            equipping and furnishing science laboratories, libraries and\n            multi-purpose workshops for 53 existing upper general\n            secondary schools; and (c) technical assistance for training\n            instructors, education planning and technology, project\n            implementation and preinvestment studies."}, "docdt": "1983-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
