Administration Reform Project\n            aims to strengthen Albania's weak institutional and\n            governance capacity. The project has four components. The\n            public expenditure component addresses five elements of the\n            public expenditure system, plus strengthening of the\n            management of the Ministry of Finance itself: budget\n            formulation; budget execution (treasury); macroeconomic and\n            fiscal forecasting and analysis; accounting; procurement;\n            and management of the MOF. The second component, the\n            strengthening of human resource management, includes three\n            sub-components: implementation of the recently enacted Civil\n            Service Act; strengthening of the Department of Public\n            Administration; and support of the establishment of an\n            Albanian Institute of Public Administration. The third\n            component, policy coordination, strengthens the capacity of\n            civil service professionals to provide the council of\n            ministers with policy analysis and support its coordination\n            function. The last component ensures project management and\n            implementation, including supporting all the required\n            project administration capacities (accounting, audit,\n            procurement, disbursement management, monitoring and\n            evaluation) and supports several specific initiatives for\n            monitoring and publicizing the intermediate impacts of the\n            government's institutional and public administrative\n            reform program."}, "docdt": "2000-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
