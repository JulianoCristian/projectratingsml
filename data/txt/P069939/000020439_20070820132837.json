Administration Reform Project (PACTA) were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            Bank's role in promoting public administration reform\n            in accession countries is delicate and essential but\n            requires very strong coordination with other development\n            donors, especially the EU; maintaining a narrow focus on the\n            development objectives and the project design ensures\n            improved supervision and allows better utilization of\n            supervision resources; a divided polity requires ensuring\n            commitment and ownership for reforms that goes beyond the\n            Government; complementarities with adjustment operations has\n            positive effects which should continue to be pursued; and\n            difficult automation projects, such as the Treasury\n            Management System require adequate project planning ahead of implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
