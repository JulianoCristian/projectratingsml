The key problems encounters\n            were: i) shift in government commitment, when a change in\n            Prime Minister led to dilution of the earlier civil service\n            law/regulations, and the protections that were built in for\n            merit; ii) slow implementation progress with consequent\n            delays in disbursements; iii) frequent changes in government\n            Ministers making continuity of reform difficult. In the\n            process it made sound use of field office staff to interact\n            with the borrower on a continuous basis and to sustain the\n            agencies' attention on implementation issues, again\n            using the leverage of the poverty reduction support credit\n            (PRSC) and related projects as needed. Finally, the team\n            worked well with other key donors such as department for\n            international development (DFID) to ensure that\n            complementary activities were adequately funded, when they\n            ran short of resources. Linking technical assistance (TA)\n            loans to policy based operations is an effective way of\n            ensuring that less glamorous activities of the TA get needed\n            attention and are properly implemented. Also, good\n            implementation requires that Bank staff work outside their\n            own \"sectoral silos\", as in Albania."}, "docdt": "2004-09-08T00:00:00Z"}
