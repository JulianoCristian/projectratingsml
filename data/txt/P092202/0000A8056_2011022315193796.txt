                         The global environmental objective of the proposed project is to conserve El Salvador's globally significant biodiversity by strengthening the national protected
                         areas system and consolidating two priority protected areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has picked up considerably. In the last seven months the project has disbursed about 12% of the grant, a significant increase compared to 27% disbursement
                         during the first 3 years of implementation. The situation is expected to improve further as a result of: 1) the signing of the contract for field works, including delimitation, demarcation
                         and field surveying in the pilot areas; and 2) strengthened capacity through the appointment of a project co-director within MARN. The project objectives remain achievable but only
                         with an extension of at least 18 months.
