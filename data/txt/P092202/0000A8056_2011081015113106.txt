                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues on a positive trend. Since February 2011, the project has disbursed an additional 8% of the grant, for a total disbursement to date of 47%
                         (compared to 27% disbursement at Mid Term Review in April 2010). Field works, including delimitation, demarcation and field surveying, which is a key activity for the consolidation of
                         the pilot areas, started in March 2011 and the Rationalization and Prioritization of the National Protected Areas System study, which is a key input for decision making on the update
                         of the National Protected Areas System strategy, is being finalized.
