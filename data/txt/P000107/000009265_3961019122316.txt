REPUBLIC OF BENIN
RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN REHABILITATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2086-BE)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Rural Savings and Loan
Rehabilitation Project in Benin, for which Credit 2086-BEN in the amount of SDR 2.0 million was
approved on June 1,1990 and made effective on November 27, 1990.
The Credit is scheduled to close on December 31. 1995, but was almost fully disbursed in June
1995. Cofinancing for the project was provided by the Caisse Centrale de Developpement Economique
(CCCE, now the Caisse Francaisse de Development, CFD), the Fonds d'Aide et de Coop6ration
(FAC), the European Development Fund (FED), the Federal Republic of Gemiany and Switzerland.
The ICR was prepared by a consultant and reviewed by L. Mosele, A. Brizzi, T. Turtiainen, S.
Singh all of AF4AE; and Mr. Bertrand de Chazal, AF4DR. It is based on material in the project file
and a field mission report.
The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by assisting the consultant during the
field mission. In addition, it prepared its own completion report. This report is available upon request
in the project files, and a summaiy prepared by Bank staff is attached as Appendix A.
The borrower's comments on a draft ICR are included as Appendix B. The co-financiers did
not provide any comments.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Credit No. 2086-BEN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The project addresses the needs and constraints of the fornal rural financial sector of Benin
which became essentially insolvent in the late 1980s as a result of a very high percentage of non-
performing loans and the bankrupcy of the National Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCA). More
specifically, it deals with the urgent requirements of the cooperative savings and loan societies. It is
consistent with the government's strategy to rehabilitate the national banking and financial sector and
was the first Bank project in the sector.
Project Objectives
2.    The project objectives were to promote a self-sustaining rural financial intermediation system
by strengthening the local and regional branches of the rural savings and loan cooperatives (CLCAMs
and CRCAMs). Specific objectives were to: (i) undertake an institutional rehabilitation program; (ii)
institute a financial rehabilitation program; and (iii) define and implement a credit development
program.
The project objectives adequately reflected the needs and constraints of the Benin financial
sector in the context of rural credit and the urgent requirements of the savings and loan cooperatives.
In this context, the project pertinently addressed the critical question of the legal status of these
cooperatives; the deregulation of interest rates on their credit operations, the determination of prudent
loan to deposit ratios; the guarantees and collaterals required for the loans; the setting of individual
credit ceiling and the reconstitution of the equity and savings of the CLCAMs and CRCAMs members
depleted as a result of previous mismanagement and the bankruptcy of the National Agricultural Credit
Bank (CNCA). The project as designed was consistent with the government's strategy to rehabilitate
the national banking and financial sector and its program of action worked out with the assistance of
the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the BF and the World Bank. Related major
covenants include (i) CRCAMs and CLCAMs establish a Federal Union of Savings and Loan
Cooperatives (ii) carrying out of a financial and management audit of CRCAMs and CLCAMs; (ii)
setting up of a recapitalization account and CFAF 600 million paid in; (iv) CRCAMs and CLCAMs to
have full autonomy on determination of interest rates and selection and dismissal of staff and
determination of their salaries; and (v) political and administrative authorities not to interfere with the
financial and credit operations of the CRCAMs and CLCAMs. Lending policies to be followed by the
cooperative network have been spelled out in detail. The main features included:
(i)   credit shall be either short-or medium-term and shall finance investment projects;



- ii -
(ii)   elected officials of the local CLCAM/CRCAM should be deeply involved in the review
and approval of credit applications;
(iii)  credit can be either to individuals or to groups. Credit to individuals shall have a ceiling
of CFAF 200,000;
(iv)   credit shall be secured by lien on assets or a repayment guarantee from solvent persons;
(v)   credit beneficiary shall be a member of good standing and have an amount of savings
equivalent of at least 10 percent of the amount of credit applied;
(vi)  interest rate shall range between 12 and 24 percent; and
(vii)  the credit/deposit ratio shall not exceed 40 percent for a CLCAM and 50 percent for a
CRCAM.
Covenants and lending policies were essentially met and were crucial to projet success.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The project achieved its major objectives. Sector Policy: the redefinition of the legal statutes
governing the operations of rural savings and loan cooperatives was completed and interest rate
ceilings were removed and the cooperatives exempted from rules governing interest rates on deposits
and credits. This made it possible for the cooperative network to charge positive real interest rates.
Institutional Rehabilitation: institutional development objectives have been substantially achieved:
restructuring of the 64 CLCAMs has been completed with the closing down of many of them and the
operational merging of others; the six CRCAMs have been restructured and no longer provide loans
but only support services to the CLCAMs within their jurisdiction; the legal status of the savings and
loan cooperative system has been changed; a Federal Union of Savings and Loan Cooperatives
(FECECAM) has been established to replace the central project unit and at the level of each region; the
CLCAMs created a union of local cooperatives (URCLCAM); an improved budgeting, accounting and
financial information system is being put in place; and substantial training activities have taken place.
4.    Financial Rehabilitation: all the major financial rehabilitation objectives have been achieved:
members' equity and savings depleted by accumulated losses have been reconstituted and the frozen
deposits at the defunct National Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCA) compensated; administrative,
accounting and financial control procedures have been put in place and are continually being improved;
interest rates have been deregulated; personnel audits have been conducted and organization
restructuring has been pursued; and finally, all new credit requests are effectively reviewed and
approved by the boards of directors of the individual cooperative societies without interference from
political or administrative structures. Loan recovery rates have substantially improved and most
cooperatives now show a loan recovery rate of more than 97 percent.   Savings and Credit



- iii -
Development Program: the savings and credit development program has been successful. Total
membership increased from 20,800 in September 1989 to almost 41,000 in September 1992 and more
than 80,000 in December 1994, clearly attesting to the return of the rural population's confidence in
the network. Total deposits increased from CFAF 2.4 billion in September 1989 to CFAF 6.6 billion in
December 1994 while total loans increased from FCFA 205 million to FCFA 3.2 billion during the
period. The CLCAM network could lend up to 40 percent of its total deposits and same enjoyed a
very favorable financial situation which allowed for convenient returns on excess liquidity invested with
commercial banks (10 percent) and on loans (24 percent). This situation has, however, changed since
the CFAF devaluation in January 1994 which caused a considerable fall on returns on invested excess
liquidity (4-5 percent) and on loans (18 percent). The lower returns have reduced the capability of the
network to cover all its administrative and operational costs. Increasing the amnount of deposits and
loans and reducing administrative and operational costs would have to be part of an action program to
address this problem.
5.    Sustainability. Interest rates need to remain deregulated to allow the network to continue to
have positive gross financial margins on its loan operations. The cooperative system should be allowed
to continue with its current procedures and the government should maintain its non-interference policy.
This would ensure that loans are made for viable operations and that repayments collection is
enforced. Given the current commitment of the government, these conditions are likely to be met.
Financial viability cannot be achieved in the short-to-medium tern because of the current structure of
the network, which leads to relatively high administrative and other overhead costs. More generally,
experience elsewhere with similar undertakings suggests that the important functions of training and
institutional building that are required for sustainability cannot be satisfactorily carried out over a
project implementation period of five years. The potential for deposit and loan demand growth is good
because of the still low level of penetration of the network in the rural areas. Also, ownership and
commitment by the members of the cooperative societies have been achieved and this remains one of
the major achievements of the project. The overall assessment is that project activities and
achievements can be maintained and developed although some subsidies for capacity building would
need to be provided for several years to strengthen the network through training and technical support
especially for the key functions of financial and accounting management.
6.    Actual project costs and their financing have been basically in line with appraisal estimates.
Estimated costs were US$12.8 equivalent compared to current estimates of US$12.3 with most of the
difference coming from exchange rate fluctuations. The financing arrangements have been substantially
as envisaged at appraisal. The implementation timetable has been basically respected except for some
initial delays for some components such as training and the replenishment of members' equity and
deposits.
7.    The project outcome has been highly satisfactory. The performance of the Bank has been
satisfactory through all the stages of the project cycle. The performance of the Borrower has also been
satisfactory. The single most important factor for success has been the decision to reconstitute the
members' equity. This reestablished members' confidence in the rural savings cooperatives and led to
their strong support by the local population. The restructuring of the network to decentralize decision-



- iv -
making to the local level also had a similar impact. The insistence of the lenders that the govemment
does not interfere with the rural savings network management, allowed the project to proceed with
susbstantial management autonomy; and technical assistance made a positive contribution to project
implementation. The government promulgated the required new laws on the legal statutes governing
the administration and operations of rural savings and loan cooperatives; it cancelled claims on the
cooperatives network as a result of the liquidation of the CNCA and deregulated interest rates. The
Central Project Unit (CPU) carried out its responsibilities in a satisfactory manner. FECECAM and its
secretariat, both created in 1993 to succeed the CPU, continued to consolidate on the achievements of
the CPU.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
8.    The key lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
(a)    The right mix of financial sector policies that encourage effective financial
intermediation were vital to the success of the project.
(b)    Obtaining the confidence of the rural population and the real transfer of decision
making authority to the local level are prerequisites for the establishment of a sound
savings and loan rural cooperative network.
(c)    Significant resources should be allocated to institution building and training functions in
order to lay the foundation for a sustainable savings and loan network. Areas to be
emphasized include management and financial control mechanisms, development of
perfornance criteria, and independent auditing of the financial operations.
(d)    Savings mobilization should be made a priority as a basis for future sustainability;
lending should be based on own resources and savings generated; the use of external
lines of credit should be avoided as much as possible.
(e)    Group lending yields the best results and is facilitated through (i) awareness campaigns,
and (ii) peer pressure under repayment rule that all the group members are refused new
loans if previous ones are not 100 percent repaid.
(f)    The government should respect the autonomy of the cooperatives and encourage self-
reliance.
(g)   Interest rates should be deregulated so that real positive interest rates can be charged
for the loans to provide sufficient margins for cost recovery..
(h)   Insofar as possible, the savings generated should be kept in the rural areas and not be
transferred to savings-deficit sectors that cater mainly to the needs of the urban
dwellers.



9.    A follow-on project, the Second Rural Savings & Loan Cooperatives Rehabilitation Project (or
Rural Credit I[), has become effective in December 1994. The central objective of the second phase
project is to continue with the rehabilitation and strengthening of the network of rural savings and loan
cooperatives initiated under the project under review. The project aims to assist the network in
establishing an efficient institutional structure and making substantial progress toward financial viability.
It is expected that full financial viability and autonomy would be reached only in the longer term (10 to
15 years). Emphasis is being given to reducing overhead costs, increasing membership, and expanding
deposits and loans.

RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Credit No. 2086-BE)
PART L PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Project Objectives
1.           The primaiy objective of the project was to help transform Benin's rural savings and
loan cooperative system into a better managed, more efficient, and financially viable rural
savings mobilization and credit delivery network. This was to be achieved through:
(i)   an institutional rehabilitation program for: (a) restructuring the 64 existing local
savings and loan cooperatives (CLCAMs) and recasting the role of the 6 regional
cooperatives (CRCAMs); (b) redefining the legal statutes goveming rural savings and
loan cooperatives in Benin; (c) helping establish a Federal Union of Savings and Loan
Cooperatives (FECECAM); (d) reestablishing improved budgeting, accounting and
financial information systems; (e) designing and implementing a training program for
board directors, members and staff of the cooperative network; and (f) reducing the
staff of the cooperative network.
(ii)    a financial rehabilitation programn for: (a) reconstituting members' equity and savings
depleted by accumulated losses of the previous National Agricultural Credit Bank
(CNCA); (b) putting in place adequate administrative, accounting and financial control
procedures; and (c) supporting the efforts of the local and regional cooperatives
towards financial autonomy by financing the equivalent of their first year operating
losses.
(iii)   a credit development program for: (a) mobilizing savings to meet part of the credit
demand; and (b) developing sound lending policies.
2.    The project objectives adequately reflected the needs and constraints of the Benin financial
sector which was in distress and, more specifically, the rural credit sector and its savings and loan
cooperative societies. The objectives also pertinently addressed the critical question of the legal status
of these societies and the deregulation of interest rates in their credit operations. The project as
designed was consistent with the government's strategy to rehabilitate the national banking and
financial sector and the program of action worked out with the assistance of the Central Bank of West
African States (BCEAO), the 1MF and the World Bank for its longer term viability.



- 2 -
3.    Project scope and activities were manageable. The policy measures to be implemented were
essential and sector specific. No interagency coordination was required given the large measure of
autonomy granted to the network and the number of components was limited. The provisions for
technical assistance were adequate. There were several co-financing agencies and the lack of
familiarity of the CPU with their respective procedures led to disbursement delays. Although, the
project's geographical coverage reflected the existing network of cooperative societies, the project
design failed to take into account the regional diversity in operating conditions.
Achievement of Objectives
4.    The project's major objectives were substantially achieved. The main criteria for assessing the
achievement of the objectives were clearly defined in the SAR. The attainment of specific objectives is
reviewed below.
5.    Sector Policy. The required policy reforms were completed. Legal statutes governing the
operations of rural savings and loan cooperatives were amended to eliminate government interference.
Interest rate ceilings were removed and the cooperatives were exempted from rules governing interest
rates on deposits and credits. Cooperative societies were forbidden to run complex banking operations.
6.    Insitudonal Rehabilitation. Institutional development objectives have been substantially
achieved: All 64 CLCAMs were completely restructured with the closing down of many of them and
the operational merging of others. All six CRCAMs have been restructured and no longer provide
loans and their main activity now is the provision of support services such as training, accounting,
budgetary and financial control and overall supervision to the local cooperatives which are now solely
responsible for mobilizing savings and providing loans. The legal status of the savings and loan
cooperative system has been changed and a Federal Union of Savings and Loan Cooperatives
(FECECAM) has been established. Despite delays and problems, an improved budgeting, accounting
and financial information system is gradually being put in place with already visible results. An intemal
audit system is already functioning with noticeable results and extemal audit reviews are routinely
conducted by a foreign firm in partnership with a local one. The auditors issued a clean opinion on the
accounts, statements of expenditures and special accounts for financial statements covering the fiscal
years ending September 30, 1993 and September 30, 1994.
7.    Staff restructuring, including redeployment and lay-offs, was implemented following a
personnel audit. An adequate training program was designed and implemented by the project. A
training unit was established early but training activities only started one year after project effectiveness.
These activities have included seminars, rural radio broadcasts, attachment to relevant organizations,
study tours and formal and on-the-job training. Personnel taking part in training activities have included
directors of cooperative societies and members, and officials of cooperatives surveillance boards.
Training costs have averaged CFAF 25 million per annum compared to the average of about CFAF 5
million planned at appraisal.
8.    Financial Rehabilitation. All the major financial rehabilitation objectives have been achieved.
Members' equity and savings depleted by accumulated losses have been reconstituted and
compensation obtained for the frozen deposits at the defunct CNCA. Administrative, accounting and



- 3 -
financial control procedures have been put in place and need continued vigilance to make these fully
effective. The first year's operating losses of the cooperative societies were financed by the project as
planned. The deregulation of interest rates has facilitated the financial rehabilitation program. The
establishment of standard operating budgets including a salary structure decided by the boards of the
societies, and defining more narrowly the operations has had similar effect. Finally, all new credit
requests are effectively reviewed and approved by the boards of directors of the individual cooperatives
without interference from the political or administrative structures.
9.    Savings and Credit Developmewnt PWgram. The savings and credit development program has
been very successful in mobilizing savings. Total membership went up from 20,822 in September 1989
to almost 40,000 in June 1992 and more than 80,000 in December 1994 clearly attesting to the return
of the rural population's confidence in the network. Total deposits increased from CFAF 2.4 billion in
September 1989 to CFAF 6.6 billion in December 1994 while total loans went from FCFA 205 million
to FCFA 3.2 billion during the same period. A substantial share of total deposits are mobilized from
non-members who use the CLCAMs as a banking facility without contributing to their capital and,
therefore, are not eligible to borrow. Under the project, the network was restricted to lending up to 40
percent of its total deposits. Although loans to individuals are permitted, most loans are made to
farmers' groups who provide group-guarantees. The strict application of the rule that fresh loans are
only made after all loans due for collection have been fully recovered, has been critical in restoring
financial discipline. Peer pressure has proved to be a very effective instrument to achieve recovery
rates close to 100 percent. Loan recovery rates have improved substantially and most societies now
show a loan recovery rate of more than 97 percent. Since there is a high proportion of non-member
deposits, it has been agreed that under the follow up operation, Rural Credit II, that CLCAMs would
be allowed to lend up to 50 percent of savings deposits. There is a geographical dimension to the
network's performance largely related to the resource base and transportation infrastructure. The
Atacora region, which is generally resource poor and has deficient road infrastructure, has consistently
shown lower performance than the other regions in all categories. Limited natural resources and poor
road infrastructure have influenced negatively savings generation resulting in a weaker lending base and
therefore, lower lending volumes and higher operating costs.
Major Factors Affecting Project Performance
10.   Four major groups of factors have affected project implementation performance: (a) features of
the project design; (b) factors beyond government control; (c) government-influenced factors; and (d)
factors related to the implementing agency.
(a)   Project Design. Probably the single most important factor that has contributed to the
substantial achievement of project objectives was the decision to reconstitute the
members' equity and savings. Members' confidence in the rural savings network was
reestablished, and this led to their strong support. The second design factor which
contributed to the project's success was the restructuring of the network to
decentralize decision-making to the local level. This created a strong sense of
identification with the project and established a sound sense of project ownership which
provided strong motivation.



- 4 -
(b)   Factors beyond the government's control. Although technical assistance generally
made a positive contribution to project implementation correcting the initial lack of
experience of local personnel and contributing to its training, the impact of short term
consultancies has been quite variable. Some consultants have performed in accordance
with their terms of reference and thus contributed to the development of the project.
However, others have misinterpreted and ovestepped their role and mandate and,
ignored the role of the local technical personnel of the project. Finally, the schedule
and cadence of consulting missions often did not fit with the development and
absorption capacity of the network resulting in a number of reports neither being
discussed nor utilized. This is particularly true for the 'brientation audits"
(c)    Government-related factors. The government generally fulfilled its obligations. In
particular, it promulgated new laws on the legal statutes governing the administration
and operations of rural savings and loan cooperatives, it cancelled claims on the
cooperatives as a result of the liquidation of the CNCA and it deregulated interest
rates. The government's decision not to interfere with the network's policies and
implementation rules had a substantial impact in the achievement of the project's
objectives as it facilitated orderly operations in the network.
(d)   Implementation agency-relatedfactors. The Central Project Unit (CPU) carried out
its responsibilities in a satisfactory manner. FECECAM, that was created in 1993 to
succeed the CPU, has consolidated on the earlier achievements. CPU commissioned a
personnel audit as required and implemented staff reduction to reduce costs and
redeployment for better skills match.  Staff training rightly emphazised member's
ownership, sound lending policies and financial discipline. The CPU made effective use
of technical assistance to clean up the network's accounts and to institute a system of
internal control and audit. There was no major work foi contractors under the project
and no irregularities or specific procurement problems have been reported.
11.   Implementation delays of one year were experienced in the replenishment of members' equity
and savings, and instituting improvements in budgeting, accounting and financial information systems
which are still continuing. Major reasons for these delays include difficulties of the CPU in mastering
the disbursement procedures of the different lenders and the long-term nature and requirements of
effecting institutional change.
Project Sustainability
12.   The sustainability of the project is dependent on four main factors: (a) the policy environment;
(b) financial viability; (c) potential for savings mobilization and credit demand; and (d) project
beneficiaries' ownership and commitment.
(a)    Policy Envronment. For the achievements of the project to be sustainable, interest
rates on loans would have to continue to be deregulated and the current statutes of the
cooperative credit system maintained. The deregulation of interest rates is important
because it allows the network to have positive financial margins. When interest rate



ceilings existed, the savings and loan societies had negative real interest rates and
negative financial spreads and operated at a loss. The government would need to
continue its non-interference policy. In the absence of any other credit institution in the
rural areas, the rural savings and loan network could be pressured by authorities to
meet credit demands that do not correspond to its mandate. This could affect the
viability of its operation.
(b)   Financial Viability. Sustainability of the current scheme will depend on the level of
administrative expenses, loan recovery performance, structure of interest rates, and
cost of financial resources. The network has widespread coverage and the local
cooperatives tend to be smaDl and the average amount of the loan modest with
operating costs relatively high. However, because of their interest rate policy, the
adequate spread between deposit and loan rates, and the financial revenues from excess
liquidity, almost al CLCAMs are financially autonomous and do not receive any
subsidy. Under the new policy adopted by the network in April 1993, CLCAMs
incurring losses would be submitted to a restructuring plan and closed after three
consecutive years of losses. Such losses are covered through a Solidarity Fund
established under the Federation and which is funded from CLCAMs profits. The
costs of the regional and central services provided by the network cannot yet be
internally sustained. External donors have, therefore, played an essential role in
financing the training, technical assistance, audits and some of the recurrent costs
incurred. Appraisal projections did not envision that financial sustainability would be
achieved during the five years of the project. From that perspective, some subsidies
would still be required for capacity-building purposes, but could be justified only within
a framework of consistent policy and institution strengthening measures. The project
shows satisfactory trends towards financial viability. According to projections made
for the follow-on Rural Credit II, the system would become financially self-sustaining
in the year 2001 at the regional level and in the year 2007 for the entire network. The
projections might, however, be modified by events. Until 1993, the network enjoyed a
very favorable financial situation which allowed for convenient retums on excess
liquidity invested with commercial banks (10 percent) and on loans (24 percent). This
situation has radically changed since the CFAF devaluation at the beginning of 1994
which caused a considerable fall in returns on invested excess liquidity (4-5 percent)
and on loans (18 percent). This fall has reduced the capability of the network to cover
all its administrative and operational costs. This deficit can be made up by increasing
the amount of deposits and loans and by reducing administrative and operational costs
as the benefits of a devalued CFAF work back into the rural economy.
(c)   Savings Mobilization and Credit Demand The financial autonomy indicated in
subparagraph (b) above assumes that deposits would grow by 10 to 15 percent per
annum and that actual lending would stabilize at 45 percent of deposits from 1995
onwards. Based on current trends, this level of growth is quite likely to be achieved.

(d)   Beneficiary Ownership and Commitment. The ownership and commitment of the
beneficiaries is one of the main assets of the network and can be expected to remain so
if government continues to respect its autonomy.
12.   The overall assessment is that project activities and achievements can be maintained and
developed if some financial assistance continues to be provided in the medium-term to build up the
network through training and technical support especially for the key functions of financial and
accounting management. The volume of deposits and loans must also continue to grow to a level that
generates sufficient income to meet the costs.
Bank Performance
13.   Bank performance was consistent and satisfactory throughout all the stages of the project
cycle. The macro-policy framework of the project was consistent with the strategy of the government
in the financial sector and the reform programs worked out with multi-lateral and regional partners.
Project identification and preparation were closely coordinated with potential co-lenders. The appraisal
report incorporated the findings of separate missions conducted by co-financiers. Before the start of
project implementation, pre-project activities were initiated with funds from some of the co-lenders.
This made it possible to test in advance some of the key project assumptions. Bank supervision
missions were regular and staffed with qualified persons with the appropriate skills mix. Staff continuity
was not always maintained in supervision missions and the Borrower has expressed some concern at
this. These missions were usually coordinated with those of the co-lenders..
14.   However, the Bank at appraisal did not fully appreciate the regional economic differences
within the country. This penalized regions such as the Atacora which are not as well-endowed or as
developed as others and which also face severe communications problems. The higher staff inputs and
operating costs for the particular situation of the Atacora region should have been taken account of or
it could have been decided that the Atacora region did not meet the criteria for project assistance or
provisions made for more support in the form of subsidies..
Borrower Performance
15.   The performance of the Borrower was highly satisfactory. Key prerequisites for the success of
the project were the commitment of the government to reform the rural savings and loan sector and to
restore the confidence of the beneficiaries. Both these prerequisites were met. All the measures that
were planned were taken within a reasonable time. The statutes of the savings and loan sector were
changed as proposed; interest rates on credit and on deposits were deregulated; and outstanding claims
on the savings network were canceled as agreed. From a financial perspective, proceeds from the
Credit were promptly put at the disposal of the network and the recapitalization of the network's
account carried out as stipulated. Institution-wise, the CPU was set up on time and staffed with
competent local staff and technical assistance. It was subsequently replaced by the FECECAM. The
required financial and management audit of the network was conducted and its recommendations
implemented. Most importantly, the Borrower refrained from interfering in the operations of the
savings and loan cooperative network respecting the ownership and autonomy of the cooperatives.

Assessment of Outcome
16.   The project outcome was highly satisfactory because all the major objectives were achieved or
exceeded. The key project objective of regaining the trust of the members of the cooperative societies
has been achieved beyond expectations. This was mainly achieved through the restoration of the equity
and savings of the members and the decentralization of management to provide credibility to
ownership. The institution building objectives have also been substantially achieved with better staff
skill-mix and competence at all levels, and a reliable accounting and financial monitoring system. Also,
the establishment of FECECAM heralds the transfer of project operations to the beneficiaries.
Future Operation
17.          A follow-up project, Rural Credit II was approved in June 1993 and became effective
in December, 1994. The central objective of the new project is to continue with the rehabilitation and
strengthening of the network of rural savings and loan cooperatives initiated under the project being
reviewed. The new project aims to assist the network in establishing an efficient institutional structure
and expedite progress toward financial viability. It is expected that full financial viability and autonomy
would be reached only in the longer term (10 to 15 years) and that, by the end of project
implementation, all primary level cooperatives would not only break even financially but also contribute
to finance the operating costs of network' regional and national levels. The new project will support,
over five years, activities, such as: (i) the establishment of efficient service units at the regional level
(URCLCAM) to provide CLCAMs with the necessary backstopping (accounting and financial
management); (ii) the institutionalization of FECECAM as the network's policy-making and
supervisory body; (iii) technical assistance, equipment, training and annual audits; and (iv) completing
the financial restructuring of CLCAMs and providing limited financial assistance to a few CLCAMs
operating in the poorest areas of the country but having a potential to reach a deposit base necessary to
break-even financially.
Key Lessons Learned
18.          The key lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
(a)    The right mix of financial sector policies that encourage effective financial
intermediation were vital to the success of the project.
(b)    Obtaining the confidence of the rural population and the real transfer of decision
making authority to the local level are prerequisites for the establishment of a sound
savings and loan rural cooperative network.
(c)    Significant resources should be allocated to institution building and the training
functions in order to lay the foundation for a sustainable savings and loan network.
Areas to be emphasized include management and financial control mechanisms,
development of perfornance criteria, and independent auditing of the financial
operations.



- 8 -
(d)    Savings mobilization should be made a priority as a basis for future sustainability;
lending should be based on own resources and savings generated; the use of external
lines of credit should be avoided as much as possible.
(e)    Group lending yields the best results and is facilitated through (i) awareness campaigns,
and (ii) peer pressure under a repayment rule that all the group members are refused
new loans if previous ones are not fully repaid.
(f)    The government should respect the autonomy of the cooperatives and encourage self-
reliance.
(g)    Interest rates should be deregulated so that real positive interest rates can be charged
for the loans to provide sufficient margins for cost recovery.
(h)    Insofar as possible, the savings generated should be kept in the rural areas and not be
transferred to savings-deficit sectors that cater mainly to the needs of the urban
dwellers.

APPENDIX A
StUMMARY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT PREPARED BY
FECECAM'
.     INTRODUCTION
This summary has been prepared by Bank staff based on the French document provided by
FECECAM. It particularly deals with: (i) impact of the project; (ii) major factors affecting the project;
(iii) project sustainability; (iv) Bank performance; (v) Borrower performance; (vi) Suppliers
performance; and (vii) key lessons learned.
2.    IMPACT OF THE PROJECT
The CLCAM/CRCAM network has become a major institution to promote rural development
and poverty alleviation because of its presence in rural areas, where it serves mainly the rural poor,
including women, who have no access to the commercial banks mainly based in major urban centers.
Moreover, it promotes group solidarity, participation, sense of ownership, and progressive realization
that the improvement of the economic and social situation can only come from self-help.
Its success is demonstrated by the performance indicators: membership (from around 21,000
in 1989 to more than 80,000 in 1994), equity (from CFAF 103.7 million in 1989, to 289.7 million in
1994), deposits (from CFAF 2.4 billion in 1989 to 6.6 in 1994), loans ( from CFAF .2 billion in 1989 to
3.2 billion in 1994) and number of borrowers (from 4,000 in 1989 to 25,000 in 1994).
3.    MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
The project benefited much from the stable political situation and from the government non-
interference in the activities of the network. Until 1993 the network enjoyed a very favorable financial
situation which allowed for convenient returns on excess liquidity invested with commercial banks (10
percent) and on loans (24 percent). This situation has radically changed since the CFAF devaluation at
the beginning of 1994 which caused a considerable fall on returns on invested excess liquidity (4-5
percent) and on loans (18 percent). This fall has reduced the capability of the network to cover all its
administrative and operation costs.
4.    PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
The sustainability seems to be guaranteed by the excellent results obtained in building a viable
institution and by involving the members and their representatives in the decision-making process. In
fact, the project has promoted people's participation and ownership and has trained a large number of

CLCAMs' elected officials on the principles and working of the system. Considerable sensitization
efforts and adequate procedures have been set in place to promote close collaboration among the
different actors of the network and in particular between the elected officials and the staff. Adequate
management, accounting, inspection and auditing procedures guarantee transparency and
accountability, therefore reinforcing the confidence of the rural population in the network.
5.    BANK PERFORMANCE
The Bank has played an important role in the improvement of the network. At the moment of
preparation and appraisal of the project, the Bank in collaboration with the other donors, contributed to
the formulation of objectives, strategy and procedures with the aim of earning the confidence of the
rural population and ensuring the viability of the network. The Bank has contributed to the creation of
a culture of transparency and accountability which proved to be crucial to the success of the project.
The positive impact of the Bank has been obtained despite the concem caused by the frequent turnover
of Bank personnel responsible of the project.
6.    BORROWER PERFORMANCE
The network greatly benefited from the support of the govemment and its non-interference in
the management of the network.
7.    SUPPLIERS PERFORMANCE
The network had to work with a large number of suppliers of goods and services(mostly
consultancies). For the supply of goods the network worked with both local and intemational suppliers.
The main findings are that local suppliers of imported goods and equipment are usually costlier and that
intemational bidding is the most adequate procedure to ensure better prices for the network. Long
term consultants attached to the project made a valuable contribution to the reorganization of the
network and the establishment of adequate management, accounting and auditing procedures. The
impact of short term consultancies has been quite variable. Some consultants have performed in
accordance with their terms of reference and thus contributed to the development of the project.
However, others have misinterpreted and overstepped their role and mandate, ignoring the role of the
technical personnel of the project, and have considered the project as a domain for practicing their
personal philosophies. Finally, the schedule and cadence of consulting missions often did not fit with
the development and absorption capacity of the network resulting in a number of reports neither being
discussed nor utilized. This is particularly true for the " orientation audits".
8. KEYLESSONS LEARNED
The key lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
(a)  people's participation dynamism is the best indicator of the success of the project;
(b) the access to credit is the main cause of growth of the membership;



- 23 -
(c)  at the beginning of a development of a cooperative organization such as the network,
there might be a confusion of roles between elected officials and staff The former
sometimes engage in micro-management, the latter often resists the guidance and control
imposed by the elected officials. Training and sensitization are required to clarify
responsibilities; and
(d) the promotion of savings and loan cooperatives needs to be customized to take into
account the particular requirements of the banking sector.

APPENDIX B
Comments of FECECAM on the Implementation Completion Report for Cr. 2086-BEN
Prepared by the World Bank2
On the whole, the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) prepared by a Consultant
recruited by the World Bank adequately describes the project's development during its five-year
life-span.
The report demonstrates that the results achieved by the network correspond with the
Bank's expectations. In terms of the volume of activity undertaken and the results achieved by
the network at the end of the project is two years ahead of projections.
The report mentions that one of the network's achievements was the continued
improvements of its administrative, accounting and iffnancial control procedures. On a number of
occasions, the report stresses the importance of supporting the management and financial control
mechanisms, establishing performance criteria and conducting an independent audit of the
financial statements. We agree with the report that medium-term subsidies should be provided to
strengthen the network through training and technical support, to a point where it is able to carry
out its key financial management and accounting functions autonomously.
With regard to the financial viability of the network, the report confirms the Bank's
expectations; in essence, financial viability and autnomy can be expected in 10 to 15 years (the
maturity date is set for the year 2007).
The network will make it an objective to break even before this maturity date, as the
development of rural savings and loans is already ahead of schedule.
The report highlighted the weaknesses of the Atacora region whose achievements, in all
performance categories, are always less impressive than those of other regions. Even if there are
improvements, and these should be apparent by the end of the 1994-1995 fiscal year, a more
systematic support structure ought to be established for the implementation and monitoring of
management methods suited to local conditions.
Finally, with regard to the sustainability of the system, the report notes that the network
could be under pressure to respond to other credit requests which are not part of its mandate, and
this could entail negative consequences.

We would like to emphasize the importance of the FECECAM in West Africa and in
Benin where the network is critical to rural development. However, because there is a great
demand for the network's success, it should exercise caution in carrying out its activities as it runs
the risk of being overburdened in expanding services, managing several external lines of credit and
adapting to the procedures of the various donors, etc.
