MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A RURAL SAVINGS AND LOAN REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Benin for SDR 2.0 million
(US$ 2.5 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help
finance a cooperative rural savings and loan rehabilitation project. The
project would be cofinanced by CCCE for SDR 2.7 million (US$ 3.4 million
equivalent), FAC for SDR 0.6 million (US$ 0.7 million equivalent), EEC for
SDR 0.8 million (US$ 1.0 million equivalent), the Pederal Republic of
Germany for SDR 0.4 million (US$ 0.5 million equivalent), and Swiss
Cooperation for SDR 1.0 million (US$ 1.2 million equivalent).
2.        Background.   Within the macroeconomic and financial reform
framework of its Structural Adjustment Program, Benin intends to
rehabilitate the cooperative rural savings and loan network and render it a
more efficient, financially viable, and autonomous institution. The
network is owned by the rural population who a--, owner-members.  Aside from
these savings and loan cooperatives, the country has had a commercial bank
(BCB), a development bank (BBD), and an agricultural credit bank (CNCA),
all three fully owned by Government. These banks failed to apply rigorous
standards especially in their dealings vith public enterprises and are now
virtually bankrupt, paralysing most banking services. The Structural
Adjustment Program foresees the restructuring of the financial sector,
including the liquidation of all three banks and reorganization of the
rural savings and loan network. The restructuring program has been agreed
on between Government, the IMF, the Central Bank (BCEAO), and the Bank.
Two new privately owned regional commercial banks are nov being set up and
are expected to allow resumption of normal banking activities in the
country within the next few months.
3.        Although they play a minor role at the macro-economic level, the
rural savings and loan cooperatives, which would be supported by the
proposed project, are significant financial intermediaries for the rural
population. Despite the collapse of the genecal banking and financial
system, the regional and local savings and ioan cooperatives (CRCAMs and
CLCAMs), which vere made regional and local affiliates respectively of CNCA
in 1976, have managed to maintain a degree of stability, mobilize a fair
level of savings, and provided some credit for their members.  This vas
achieved in spite of heavy interference from CNCA in their financial
management. Members have thus retained c<if idence in a system which has
preserved some of its democratic charactk and is ready to revive, if it is
provided favorable conditions. The CRCAMs, vere initiated in 1975 and
today are well established throughout the country's six provinces. Thirty-
five local units (and 64 associated sub-units) (CLCAMs) are overseen by the
6 regional CRCAMs. Their partial assimilation into the CNCA-managed
agricultural credit banking system in 1976 resulted in losses that have
practically viped out members' deposits. Despite being mutualist



- 2 -
cooperative institutions, CNCA gave them a quasi banking status, whereby
regulatory limits on interest rates set by BCEAO were applied to them,
salaries and benefits of CNCA seconded staff were aligned to those of the
banking system, and they were asked by CNCA to provide full banking
services such as checking and interbank transactions vithout any
compensation. Despite the banking services they provided and the banking
rules applied to them, they did not have access to the banking facilities
that the normal banks had, such as rediscounting facilities from BCEAO or
remunerated deposits at the Central Bank. In addition, their deposits were
frozen and did not earn any interest at CNCA since 1987 as the latter vent
into liquidation.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project is consistent with
Government's strategy of improving macroeconomic growth, including the
rehabilitation of Benin's financial and banking sector, supported by the
Bank, through its structural adjustment program. More significantly, it
represents a first attempt to reform the rural credit sector, tc remove
direct Government intervention in rural credit operations, and to encourage
greater responsibility of the rural community for management of its local
economy. It aims at developing competitive and self-sustaining rural
financial intermediaries that would serve the needs of the rural
population. The project is consistent with the Bank's new policy on
support for financial sector development. It involves support for
individual farmers' credit needs and is expected to have far reaching
implications on the future functioning of Benin's rural savings and credit
system. The Bank's lending strategy is designed to support Government's
program to restructure the financial sector and/or privatize para-public
enterprises. Support for similar efforts with other public enterprises is
being provided by the Bank through the Public Enterprise Sector Project
(Cr. 1748-BEN) as vell as the recently approved structural adjustment
program (Cr. 2023-BEN). IDA involvement also seeks to coordinate
activities of the various bilateral donors participating in project
financing in order to ensure consistency -ln the operations of all the
regional and local savings and loan cooperatives.
5.        Project Objectives.  The primary objective of the proposed
project is to help transform Benin's savings and loan cooperatives into a
better managed, more efficient, and financially viable rural savings
mobilization and credit delivery network. It would support the declared
Government policy of promoting sustainable private rural financial
intermediation systems. It would do this through the proven savings and
loan cooperative approach and by ieveloping an independent central
federation of local and regional cooperatives that would be responsible for
supervising and overseeing the network.
6.        Project Description.  The project, to be executed over three
years would involve the institutional and financial rehabilitation of the
savings and loan cooperatives in all of the six provinces of Benin. It
provides for reforming the institutional base of the cooperatives through
measures to correct and strengthen their management and administrative
processes and through an intensive training program. The measures,
developped after extensive discussions with members of the CRCAM/CLCAM
network, would include: (a) redefining the statutes of the savings and loan



-  3  -
network to conform to the private and mutualist character of the
cooperative movement that would permit them to set competitive interest
rates and maintain adequate margins between saving and deposit rates;
(b) initiating a member training program in cooperative administration,
credit and financial management; (c) instituting credit committees in each
CRCAM/CLCAM; and (d) a staff training program in accounting, internal
auditing, credit and financial management. A financial rehabilitation
program would: (a) recapitalize the CRCAM/CLCAMs by reconstituting merSers'
equity and deposits depleted by accumulated losses over the years;
(b) financing the balance of deposits frozen at CNCA; (c) deregulating
interest rates on credit operations and deposits subject only to the
regulatory maximum usury rate (currently at 24.52); (d) support cost
reduction measures, better review and follow up on all credit operations;
and (e) initiate financial policies for a gradual build up of financially
autonomous local institutions. Internal financial control would be
complemented by external financial audit and monitoring and evaluation. A
Central Project Unit supported by technical assistance would be
responsible, during the first year, for reorganizing the network,
supervising its rehabilitation and putting in place a Federal Union of
Saving and Loan Cooperatives.
7.        An interim program of priority measures based on the report of a
CCCE financed study in June 1988 has been agreed between Government and
Donors. The program, which is monitored by an interim committee of donors,
and supervised by the IDA-financed Public Enterprise Project (Cr. 1748-Ben)
includes: (a) financial audit of all CRCAM/CLCAM accounts as of September
30, 1988 (preliminary report issued in May 1989); (b) technical assistance
to update accounts pending a full financial and management audit of
operations as of September 30, 1989; (c) a test credit program involving
full responsibility of the CRCAMICLCAM board members; and (d) urgent
funding of some portion of the frozen deposits at CNCA to maintain minimal
liquidity at some CRCAMs. The latter has been financed by FAC and Swiss
Cooperation at a total cost of CFAF 257 million (US$ 0.86 million).
8.        The project, to be carried out over three years, provides funds
for recepitalizing the network, project management costs, training, studies
and audits, and personnel and operating costs of the network. Total
project costs are estimated at US$ 12.8 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$ 2.4 million (19Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Benin are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7992-BEN dated January 3,
1990 is also attached.
9.        Agreed Actions.  Agreements have been reached with Guvernnent
and the cooperative members on project objectives and design and on actions
necessary to permit a successful institutional and financial rehabilitation
of the CRCAMICLCAM including the interim support program (para 7).
Government has also confirmed the following effectiveness conditions at
negotiations: (a) to ask the CRCAM/CLCAMs to open a deposit account
(Recapitalization Account) at a bank and under terms and conditions



acceptable to the Association and deposit therein an amount equivalent to
CFA? 600 million representing the initial contribution of foreign donors to
the financial rehabilitation program; (c) to establish new model statutes
governing the operations of cooperative savinge and loan associatiorns; and
(d) to appoint key staff o0 the project management team. ather conditions
that Government confirmed at negotiations aret (i) to permit the
CRCAMICLCAMs to maintain competitive interest rates and interest rate
margina on their savings and credits; and (ii) to ensure that local and
regional political and administrative authorities do not interfere with the
financial and credit operations of the CRCAMtCLCAM.
10.       Justification.  The project would help in rebuilding the
institutional framework for, and restoring financial health to, a key
sector that has the potential to mobilize large amounts of rural savinga.
The success of the project would make the CRCAM/CLCAM a useful vehicle for
promoting private investment initiatives in the rural areas by ensuring the
recycling of rural savinga for productive activities. A broad spectrum of
smallholder farm families would benefit from the cooperative saving and
loan system to meet their seasonal credit needs especially during the lean
seasons.
i1.       Risks.  There are two possible riska.  First, if Benin's banking
sector crisis worsens, the public sector may put pressure on the savings
and loan cnoperatives to undertake normal banking activities, for which
they are still ill-suited and ill-prepared. However, banking sector reform
constitutes an integral part of Benin's structural adjustment program bein8
supported by the Bank, IMF and other donors. Two regional commercial
banks, operating in the West Africa sub-region, have obtained Government
agreement to set up in the country vithin the next few months. Government
has also agreed to a number of measures that would preserve the cooperative
character of the institutions. Second, the cooperatives may not achieve
the annual 17 to 20 percent expected growth in saving mobilization. This
risk is minimized by the fact that these institutions have, in the past,
mobilized annually large amounts of savings (about 22 percent growth per
arnum) despite their problems. Thus, with the confidence that their
rehabilitation would restore in their membership the target savings
mobilization is not overly optimistic.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
