The project\n            will assist a Government initiated institutional and\n            financial rehabilitation program to restructure the rural\n            financial sector by supporting existing cooperative rural\n            savings and loan associations. These cooperatives are owned\n            entirely by the rural population with no Government\n            participation. The project provides for: (a) the\n            institutional reform and restructuring of the existing\n            saving and loan cooperatives; (b) restoration of cooperative\n            members' savings and equity, depleted through\n            accumulated losses in an inadequate policy environment, and\n            frozen deposits in bankrupt commercial banks; (c)\n            liberalization of interest rate policies on savings and\n            loans; (d) training of cooperative administrators and staff;\n            and (e) establisment of an accounting and financial control system."}, "docdt": "1990-01-03T00:00:00Z"}
