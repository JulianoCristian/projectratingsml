INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR THE
ENGINEERING EDUCATION PROJECT IN WEST PAKISTAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $8 million to
the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to assist in the financing of an Engineer-
ing Education Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed development credit would be the fourth credit for
education in Pakistan. In March 1964, the Association made two credits to
assist in the financing of education projects in Pakistan, one in West
Pakistan and one in East Pakistan. The credit for West Pakistan (Credit
No. 50-PAK in an amount of US $8.5 million) was made to finance about half
of the estimated total cost of construction of and the procurement of equip-
ment for the Agricultural University in Lyallpur, the procurement of equip-
ment for six Technical Institutes and the employment of expatriate teachers
and overseas training of Pakistani teachers of the Technical Teacher Training
Colleges at Karachi and Rawalpindi. The credit for East Pakistan (Credit
No. 49-PAK) provided US $4.5 million for construction of and equipment for
the Agricultural University in Mymensingh, equipment and services for eight
Technical Institutes and technical assistance for the Technical Teacher
Training College at Dacca. The second East Pakistan Education Credit
(Credit No. 87-PAK) was made in June 1966 and provided US $13 million to
finance about 60 percent of the second phase of the expansion and improve-
ment of the Mymensingh Agricultural University, including the provision of
overseas teacher fellowships, as well as construction and the procurement
of equipment at five Technical Institutes. All three projects are still
being implemented. The Technical Institute and Technical Teacher Training
College programs are proceeding well, some ahead of schedule, but construc-
tion at both Agricultural Universities for which the major part of the three
previous credits was allocated, has suffered serious delays. Slow implemen-
tation was caused initially by difficulties in developing the master plans;
subsequently, construction was hampered by administrative shortcomings; and
more recently, because the necessary rupee funds were not made available to
the project authorities as and when required. The shortage of rupee funds
appears to have been alleviated, but extensions of the closing dates of all
three credits will be necessary.
3.        The educational system of Pakistan has not kept pace with changing
requirements. In recognition of existing shortcomings, the Government of
Pakistan in July, 1969, published a proposal for a new education policy,
which was adopted in March of this year. The new policy calls for a massive
shift towards technical and vocational education. A major objective is the
improvement in the skills of engineering personnel, which is required to
help bring about an improvement and expansion of its export-oriented and



- 2 -
capital goods industries. The proposed project is designed primarily to
help improve the quality of instruction provided by two of West Pakistan's
largest institutions for engineering education.
4.        A large UNESCO mission is presently in West and East Pakistan to
undertake a comprehensive review ofthe entire education system, including
an analysis and evaluation of the new education policy. We expect that
the report of the UNESCO mission will also identify a number of priority
projects, some of which might be suitable for further Bank Group lending
during the next few years.
5.        The proposed project was appraised in November/December 1969.
Negotiations were held in Washing-ton from May 19 to 28, 1970. Dr. Z.A.
Hashmi, Secretary of Education of the Government of Pakistan, and Mr. A.R.
Bashir, Economic Minister to the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, repre-
sented the Government of Pakistan and the Province of West Pakistan.
Professor Abdul Hameed Khan, Principal of N.E.D. Government Engineering
College, Karachi, and Mr. Wahid Ali Khan, Project Director of the West
Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, also participated.
6.        A summary statement of IDA credits and Bank loans in Pakistan as
of April 30, 1970, together with a statement on disbursements and current
operations of the Bank Group, is contained in my Report and Recommendation
on a proposed loan to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (dated June 3,
1970, circulated to the Executive Directors as R70-104).
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.        Borrower:                Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiary:             The West Pakistan University of Engineer-
ing and Technology in Lahore and the N.E.D.
Government Engineering College in Karachi.
Amount:                  The equivalent in various currencies of
US $8 million.
Purpose:                 To help finance the construction of, and
purchase of equipment for, academic buildings,
communal facilities, student hostels and
staff houses, and the provision of fellow-
ships and technical assistance.
Amortization:            In 50 years including 10 years grace, through
semi-annual installments of 1½ of 1% from
October 1, 1980 through April 1, 1990 and
14 from October 1, 1990 through April 1,
2020.
Service Charge:          3/4 of 1% per annum.



3 -
Relending Terms:         The Islamic Republic of Pakistan will
relend the proceeds to the new Province
of the Punjab and the new Province of
Sind on the same financial terms as
those of the Credit, except that relend-
ing shall be in the currency of the
Borrower.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A report entitled "Appraisal of an Engineering Education Project in
West Pakistan" (No. PE-16a, dated June 3, 1970) is attached.
9.        The proposed project comprises the construction of academic and
communal buildings, hostels and staff houses, and the provision of instruc-
tional equipment and technical assistance at the West Pakistan University of
Engineering and Technology in Lahore and at the N.E.D. Government Engineering
College in Karachi. This would allow an increase of about 650 (from the
present 3,300 students) in the combined undergraduate enrollment, the initia-
tion of a full-time Master of Science-Engineering program at the Lahore
Engineering University with a planned enrollment of 420 students, and a sub-
stantial improvement in the quality of instruction of both institutions.
Although a modest increase in undergraduate enrollment would be provided
under the project, the emphasis is on improving the quality of graduate
engineers and to develop a small corps of engineers with postgraduate training.
10.       At the Lahore Engineering University, new buildings would be provided
for the two departments of civil and electrical engineering, plus administra-
tive and communal buildings and hostels.  In addition, the project would in-
clude the rehabilitation of some of the existing buildings. New equipment
would be installed in the laboratories, workshops and teaching spaces of the
five engineering departments, and books and journals would be purchased for
the library. Because the University draws its students from the whole country and
there is a severe shortage of appropriate accommodation in Lahore, hostels
would be provided for an additional 500 students to increase the boarding
capacity to 1300 students (about b6 percent of the total planned enrollment of
2850).
11.       The teaching staff at the Lahore Engineering University is well
qualified and competent for teaching to degree level; the proposed Credit
would provide funds to enable selected members of the staff to receive further
overseas training to meet the needs for postgraduate and research work.
12.       The Karachi Engineering College, which at present is located in the
heart of Karachi, is overcrowded, has no room for expansion, and will be re-
located on a site adjacent to the University of Karachi. A new complex of
buildings would be-constructed, and additional equipment and books provided.
As the new site lies about 14 miles outside the Karachi urban area, boarding
accommodation for two-thirds of the planned enrollment of 1500 students and
about 70 staff houses would have to be provided. Some of the boarding accom-
modation (for 50C students) are already under construction and will not be
financed from the Credit.



13.       An essential element in improving the quality of education at the
College will be the development of a properly qualified teaching staff, since
at present the staff is inadequate both in number and in qualifications. To
meet the needs of the College, the teaching staff would be increased to
nearly double the present number, particularly in the senior grades, and an
intensive training program would be introduced to upgrade the qualifications
of both new and existing staff.
14.       In view of delays in the provision of rupee funds which held up
the existing three education projects considerably, specific assurances have
been obtained which are designed to avoid similar difficulties with the
proposed project. Two special revolving funds would be established, to be
used exclusively to make payments for the cost of goods and services required
on the part of the respective Provinces to carry out the project. These
revolving funds are to be replenished quarterly to the amount estimated to
be required during the forthcoming three months. The establishment of these
revolving funds and the payment of the initial deposit are a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
15.       Planning, design and construction of buildings, and the provision
of equipment and books at both institutions will take about four years; the
staff training programs will take about six years to complete. Project units,
headed by a Project Director and staffed by a Project Architect, a Project
Accountant and a Project Procurement Officer, will be established for each
institution to coordinate, administer and supervise execution of the Project.
The appointment of the Project Directors and the Project Architects as well
as of consultant architects are conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
Credit; both Project Directors have already been appointed.
16.       All contracts for civil works and for the supply of equipment and
books would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
(except for the procurement of some urgently needed equipment with a value,
for each institution, of up to US $10,000 per annum and US $40,000 in the
aggregate). Pakistani manufacturers of equipment would be allowed to compete
against foreign suppliers with a margin of preference of 15 percent, or the
prevailing costoms duty, whichever is less. It is expected that all contracts
for civil works will be won by Pakistani firms.
17.       The total costs of the project, including contingencies but exclud-
ing furniture which will be provided by the provincial governments from in-
digenous sources, are estimated at US $12.8 million, almost equally divided
between the two institutions. The proposed Credit of US $8 million equivalent
would provide approximately 60 percent of the estimated total costs. If, as
indicated in the preceding paragraph, civil works contracts are awarded to
Pakistani bidders, the direct foreign exchange expenditures under this project
would amount to US $4 million, about 30 percent of total project costs. It
is estimated that the contracts expected to be won by Pakistani firms with a
total value of about US $8.3 million would have a foreign exchange component
of approximately US $2.4 million (about 30 percent). Consequently, 80 percent
of the proposed Credit would be employed to cover foreign exchange require-
ments. For essentially the same reasons as set forth in my Report and



- 5 -
Recommendation on the Credit for the Chandpur II Irrigation Project, dated
April 2, 1970 (IDA/R 70-12), I consider it justified for the Association to
make a modest contribution to the local expenditure financing of the pro-
posed project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, a draft Project Agreement between the Pro-
vince of the Punjab and the Association and a draft Project Agreement between
the Province of Sind and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement follows the usual pattern of
credit agreements for projects of this type. Both the Lahore Engineering
University and the Karachi Engineering College are now under the jurisdiction
of the Province of West Pakistan. On July 1, 1970 the Province of West Pakistan
will be dissolved and succeeded by four new provinces. Project Agreements would
therefore be entered into by the Association with two of the new provinces, i.e.,
with the Province of the Punjab with regard to the Lahore Engineering University,
and with the Province of Sind with regard to the Karachi Engineering College.
While the Development Credit Agreement would be expected to be signed before
the end of June, 1970, the two Project Agreements would be signed after July 1,
1970. The execution of the two Project Agreements would be an additional con-
dition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       A statement on the economy of Pakistan is included in my Report and
Recommendation on a proposed loan to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, dated
June 3, 1970 (R70-104). A Basic Data Sheet is attached as an Annex.
21.       The proposed project meets a high priority need, and the economic
position and prospects of Pakistan justify continued assistance on concessional
terms such as those provided by the Association.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATICN
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
