Turkey were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; the\n            risk to development outcome was low or negligible; the\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory; and the borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: analyze and put in place critical program level\n            conditions and design elements for success when designing\n            and implementing programmatic operations. Creating a formal\n            project identity for regional engagements will enhance\n            visibility and accountability within the bank for operations\n            involving complex regional dialogue and structures.\n            Opportunities for enhanced coordination between electricity\n            market actors in Turkey remain and should be exploited. In\n            order to maximize the benefits provided by the flexibility\n            of the APL instrument, define clear criteria for\n            subprojects, ensure sufficient size of individual loan installments."}, "docdt": "2011-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
