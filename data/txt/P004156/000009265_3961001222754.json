Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Project\n            supports the government's 1990-96 National Wastewater\n            Treatment Plan to improve the water quality in Korea's\n            rivers and coastal waters by, among other things,\n            constructing sewage treatment plants in two of the largest\n            municipalities.  Under the project, sewage treatment plants\n            will be constructed or expanded in Pusan and Taejon,\n            Korea's second and sixth largest cities.  The project\n            will include construction of:  (a) the first phase of Yongho\n            sewage treatment plant in Pusan, with a daily maximum\n            capacity of 340,000 cubic meters per second, a sewage\n            pumping station and about 11.4 km of interceptors to carry\n            sewage to the plant; and (b) the second phase of Wonchon\n            Dong treatment plant in Taejon and 11.9 km of interceptors,\n            to double existing capacity on completion.  Technical\n            assistance will also be provided to:  (i) help supervise\n            treatment plant construction; and (ii) update the\n            cities' Sewerage Master Plans (SMPs), including a\n            review of policies and management systems for sewerage\n            activities and design of a program to convert the sewer\n            systems from combined-type systems, carrying both stormwater\n            and wastewater, to hygienically superior separate systems\n            which carry wastewater in sanitary sewers and stormwater in\n            storm sewers."}, "docdt": "1992-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
