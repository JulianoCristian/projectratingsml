PROJECT DESCRIPTION:        The three-year project would finance master plan
studies to determine the optimum long-term
program for water supply and sewerage/sanitation
development in Lilongwe and identify a water
supply project that would form the program's
first phase. The latter project would be the
subject of a feasibility study, detailed
engineering design and the preparation of
contract documents. The engineering project
would strengthen the management of Lilongwe
Water Board and finance studies of the water
supply sector's organizational and training
needs. A pilot project to demonstrate low-cost
sanitation would be included. There are no
unusual risks.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR A LILONGWE WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi for SDR 3.6 million (US$4.0 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a Lilongwe Water Supply
Engineering Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled Malawi: Growth and Structural Change, A Basic
Report (Report No. 3082a-MAI) dated February 8, 1982, was recently circu-
lated to the Executive Directors. Annexes to the report were distributed
on June 26, 1981. Annex I contains the basic country data.
3.        Malawi is a small (118,500 sq kI), densely-populated (about six
million people in 1980) landlocked country in southeastern Africa. Its
main assets are moderately fertile soils, good water resources and a cli-
mate favorable to crop production. Unlike its neighbors, Malawi has no
known substantial mineral resources.
4.        Although Malawi has a GNP per capita of only US$230.0 and has
been identified by the United Nations as one of the world's poorest coun-
tries, its progress since independence, measured against its natural
resources, has been significant. GDP at constant prices grew at an average
annual rate of 6 percent between 1964 and 1979. During the same period,
real growth of estate agriculture and manufacturing exceeded 10 percent per
annum and export volume grew at 4.5 percent per annum. A steadily increas-
ing investment rate (rising from 9 percent of GDP at independence to
33 percent in 1979) has been supported by heavy inflows of official and
private external capital as well as by a significant increase in domestic
savings (from virtually nil in 1964 to 14 percent of GDP in 1979).
5.        Malawi's development success has been due largely to the realis-
tic and purposeful policies of the Government.  Public investment has been
intended primarily to support private initiative in the directly productive
sectors by providing infrastructure, public utilities and support ser-
vices. The Government has emphasized smallholder agriculture, as about
90 percent of the population lives in the rural areas and depends on agri-
culture for its livelihood. The Government has thus undertaken a number of
integrated rural development projects, and, more recently, has embarked on
the National Rural Development Program (NRDP), an ambitious 20-year program
for extending services to smallholders countrywide. The Government-s de-
cision to emphasize directly productive sectors and infrastructure has
resulted in slower development of social services.



- 2 -
6.        Under the Government's current five-year investment program,
22 percent of total public investment has been allocated for agriculture,
36 percent for transport, 10 percent for educationa, 11 percent for water
and health, and 22 percent for miscellaneous investments. These alloca-
tions reflect the Government's continued emphasis on smallholder develop-
ment and transport, and the increased importance of manpower development.
7.        The 1977 population census revealed that population grew at
2.9 percent per annum during the previous 10 years. Projecting the same
growth rate for the remainder of the century, Mal,awi's population would al-
most double by the year 2000. This high rate has important implications
for the labor/land ratio, as Malawi's population density, about 140 persons
per sq km of agricultural land, already is among the highest in Africa and,
by the year 2000, will rise to 265 persons per sq km. Only 35 percent of
land area is suitable for cultivation and the avaLlable arable land is al-
most fully utilized.
8.        The Government opposes active populationl control measures but
permits contraceptives to be distributed at physi,-ian-attended facilities
on demand. Only about 9 or 10 percent of the total population lives in ur-
ban areas. However, with the diversification of the economy, urban popula-
tion is increasing by more than seven percent per annum, in line with the
expansion of wage employment opportunities in the non-agricultural sec-
tors. The population growth issue has been pursued in discussions with the
Government on the recomaendations of the Basic Economic Report and, where
appropriate, through the Bank's sector work and lending operations.
9.        Despite Malaw:L's impressive economic performance during the past
15 years, its economy is heavily dependent on three primary commodity
exports (tea, sugar and tobacco) and is highly vu:Lnerable to international
price fluctuations. Since 1974, the country has experienced periodic
balance of payments problems of increasing severity due primarily to (a)
rapid escalation in import prices, particularly of fuel and intermediate
and capital goods; (b) cyclical swings in export prices of tobacco and tea;
and (c) significantly h:igher costs of transport for exports and imports
owing to rising ocean freight charges, port congestion in Mozambique, and
disruptions of overland transport.
10.       While the Government successfully steered the economy through ba-
lance of payments crises in the past, the deterioration in the balance of
payments since 1978 has been less manageable, primarily due to a 40 percent
fall in the terms of trade between 1977 and 1980, when export prices fell
16 percent (due mainly to declines in tea and tobacco prices) and import
prices rose by about 39 percent. The petroleum import bill more than
doubled between 1977 and 1980. The growing trade deficit was exacerbated
by a doubling of the negative balance for non-factor services, due mainly
to rising transport cost:s. Malawi's current accovnt deficit rose from an
annual average of about 8-9 percent of GDP to about 18 percent in 1978 and
24 percent in 1979, before falling to 18 percent in 1980 and an estimated
12 percent in 1981. Because capital inflows have not covered the current



account deficirs, MIaawi has experienced a drop in forei0n exchange re-
serves, which fell from the equivalent of over five months to less than two
mornths of imports between 1977 and 1981.
11.       Malawi's fiscal position has also seriously deteriorated.  From
independence through 1977/78, government expenditures and revrenues expanded
roughly in 'ine w ith the increases in GDP, and defiLcits1 rarely exceeded 8-9
percent of GDP.  Tin the past fonr years, expenditure growth has outstripped
the increase In revenues and the share of government defici ts in GDP
averaged 14.2 percent in 1978/79-1981/82.  With the increased deficits came
an increased reliance on domestic borrowing mainly from the monetary
system, and on foreign borrowing, partly on commercial ter'ms.  At the same
time, inflationary pressures grew and tne balance of pay-yents position
deteriorated.  Prices rose at an average rate of almost 14 percent per
annum between 1979 and 1981.
12.       In 1979, the Government initiated a series of short-term correc-
tive measures resulting irn a two and a half year stand-Thy arrangement with
the TMF.  This agreement was terminated and replaced by a two-year
arrangement for US$64?8 millioII (SDR 49.9 million), which was approved in
May 1980. The program, coinciding with Mslawi's fiscal years 1981 and
1982, aimed at constraining demand a-nd limiting the balance of payments
current account deficit.
13.       The Government experienced budgetary difficulties in 1980/81 and
had to be granted a waiver on its domestic borrowing ceiling. Again in
1981/82, the Government exceeded its domestic borrowing ceiling and
drawings under the standby were suspended in early 1932. The Government
and the IMF are now discussing a new program beginning in 1982/83. As part
of that program, the Government devalued the Kwacha against the SDR by 15
percent in April 1982.
14.       A structurai adiustment loan, approved by the Executive Directors
in June 1981, supports the Government's program to diversify the export
base, encourage efficient import substitution, adjust incentives and in-
comes policies imDrove the publiLc sector's financial performance and
strengthen economic planning and monitoring. The loan finances essential
imports and the counterpart funds are allocated to development in the
government budget.  The first tranche of US$25.0 million has been! fully
disbursed, but the second was released only in Apri'l 19823 because of
difficulties in implementing parts of the program.  TInese were: (i) a sharp
deterioraticn in the budget situation; (ii) a rapid increase in the level
of external debt and the burden of debt service payments; (iii) a large
increase in the price of maize without corresponding increases in export
crop prices: and (iv) delays in the implementation of a number of studies
called for in the loan agreement.  The Government has now addressed all of
these problers, and the structural adjustment program is agair making good
progress.



-s 4 -
15.       Because of the Government's limited ability to mobilize re-
sources  the appreciable expansion of Malawi's development program over the
past decade has been largely assisted by increased public capital inflows.
The net contribution from foreign official sources to the financing of pub-
lic investment increased from US$17.0 million in FY68, to about
US$10500 million in FY82, of which about US$48.0 million were grants.  How-
ever, borrowing on commercial terms has increased to about half of the
total, causing a pronounced effect on debt servicing.
16.       By the end of 1981, Malawi's external pulic debt totalled US$863
million, of which US$682 million had been disbursed.  Debt service in 1981
amounted to US880 million, equivalent to about 23 percent of exports of
goods and non-factor services.  There has been considerable hardening of
the average terms of lending in the past few years; the average grant
element of official assistance fell from the 80 percent level of 1971-75,
to 48 per-cent in 1978., 42.5 percent in 1979, and 40.7 percent in 1980.  On
the basis of loans committed by the middle of 1981, and of additional
capital requirements for the period 1982-85, Malawi's debt service ratio is
projected to reach 28 percent in 1982, and then decline to 24 percent in
1985 (as compared with 8 percent in 1978, and 12 percent in 1979). The
domestic share of deve'Lopment expendituires amounted to 27 percent in FY82,
and this share is unlikely to rise in the near future, as the need for
recurrent expenditures for operations and maintenance will absorb the bulk
of additional tax revenues. Hence, external financing must cover a
substantial portion of total project costs, inc:Luding some local financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAWI
17.       Over the pasi: 16 years, Malawi has received 24 IDA credits total-
ling US$271.0 million and 6 Bank loans totalling US$75.0 million, of which
2 were on Third Window terms. Of the Bank Group assistance, some US$105.5
million (31 percent) wats for agriculture, US$45..0 million (13 percent) for
structural adjustment, US$38.0 million (11 percent) for power development,
US$73.5 million (22 percent) for education, US$65.0 million (19 percent)
for roads, US$3.0 million (1 percent) for a development finance company
(INDEBANK), and the balance of US$9.0 million (3 percent) for water supply,
technical assistance and to finance feasibility studies for an agro-
industrial project at liphya. The first Bank loan to Malawi was made on
Third Window terms in June 1976, and the first standard Bank loan in April
1977.  The most recent operation, a US$7.3 mill:Lon credit for Phase III of
the National Rural Development Program, was approved on October 13, 1981,
and was due to become effective by June 10, 1982:7



-5-
18.       IFC's investments in Malawi consist of a loan of US$6.0 million
for a textile mill, another of US$9.9 million for a sugar mill, a
US$0.6 million equity investment in INDEBANK, and a US$2.0 million loan to
Malawi Hotels Limited for tourism. A US$262,000 equity investment and a
loan of US$1.7 million for the production of ethanol from molasses were ap-
proved in July 1980. A summary statement of Bank Group operations and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects are provided in Annex II. Proj-
ect implementation has been generally satisfactory, although disbursement
of the second tranche of the structural loan was delayed pending sufficient
progress in program implementation.
19.       During the next five years, Bank Group assistance to Malawi will
help Malawi restructure its economy, especially to improve agricultural
productivity.  Further investments in the National Rural Development
Program, water supply, education, health and agro-industry are
contemplated. The Bank Group's economic and sector work will focus on such
key areas as: budget management, industrial incentives, the performance of
parastatals and the widely-diversified Press Holdings, Ltd., agricultural
diversification and pricing, livestock and tobacco, the most cost-effective
approaches to providing social services, and energy investment
opportunities.
20.       At the end of 1981, the Bank accounted for 7.6 percent and IDA
and the Bank combined for 28.9 percent of Malawi-s disbursed medium- and
long-term public debt. Service on the Bank Group debt accounted for 5.0
percent of the total debt service. Major creditors, in addition to the
Bank Group, were the United Kingdom, the African Development Fund,
syndicated groups of commercial banks and South African suppliers.
Bilateral lending has mainly been from Canada, the Federal Republic of
Germany and the United States. In 1985, the IDA Bank share is projected to
be about 15 percent of the total debt service.
Disbursements
21.       Disbursements of Bank Group loans and credits in Malawi
generally keep close to schedule. As of March 31, 1982, disbursed funds
equalled about 40 percent of the total amount of effective loans and
credits. Ten of the 13 Bank and IDA-financed projects yet to be completed
were within 6 months of achieving the disbursement levels scheduled at
appraisal and a decision was made in April to release the second and final
tranche of the Structural Adjustment Loan. Of the three remaining
projects, only one -- the US$7.0 million Blantyre Water Supply Project --
is likely to remain appreciably behind schedule.  As of March 31, 1982,
disbursements under this project totalled US$3.6 million compared with
virtual completion of disbursement scheduled at appraisal for this time.
However, there has been a notable improvement in the past several months in
the rate of disbursement for the project, and this is likely to be
sustained now that all the contracts being financed by IDA have been
awarded.



PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Water Resources
22.       Malawi has an area of some 118,000 sq km, about a quarter of
which is covered by lakes, by far the largest being Lake Malawi. Most of
the country drains to Lake Malawi or the Shire River, which is the lake's
only outlet. Average annual rainfall is about 1,000 mm. Three seasons are
evident: rains from November to April, dry and cool from May to August, and
dry and hot from September to November. Because of the considerable varia-
tion in ground elevation (from about 200 m to about 2,500 m above sea
level), and the influence of Lake Malawi, there is a wide variation in
climate; annual rainfall, for example, ranges from about 600 mm to about
3,000 mm.
23.       Malawis water resources are substantial, although not fully ex-
plored. Surface water, mainly in Lake Malawi, its principal tributaries
(the Rukuru, Dwangwa, Bua, Lilongwe and Linthipi) and the Shire River, is
the most significant source of supply.  Except for the Shire River, stream
flow is seasonal and generally not dependable the year round.
24.       Groundwater iEs widely available from dug wells and boreholes in
three hydrogeological zones: Plateau-Highland, Escarpment and Rift Valley.
There is good potential for groundwater, although, because of limited
yields from the individual sources, it is normally, suitable only for rural
supply. An investigation of Malawi's water resources, under way since the
mid-1960s, has concentrated mainly on groundwater.
Water Supply and Sewerage Systems
25.       Population Growth.  Between the census of 1966 and 1977, Malawi-s
population grew at 2.9 percent a year to 5.5 million, and is now estimated
to be more than 6 million. Between 1966 and 1977, urban population more
than doubled, increasing by 7.6 percent a year to constitute about 9 or
10 percent of Malawi's total population.
26.       Despite this, only Blantyre and Lilongwe have significant urban
populations. Lilongwe, in particular, has experienced rapid growth, from
about 19,000 in 1966 to an estimated 130,000 in 1.980, caused mainly by mi-
gration to Lilongwe because of its status as the new administrative capital
of Malawi and as a foca'L point for the region's accelerated development in
agriculture, commerce and industry. By the end of the century Lilongwe's
population is projected to expand to about 500,000.
27.       Urban Water Stipply.  About 70 percent of the urban population has
access to safe water.  In Blantyre, the Blantyre Water Board (BWB) serves
about 180,000 people, or1 about two-thirds of the city's total population,
through some 12,000 connections, including about 10,700 residential connec-
tions and 50 kiosks. The ongoing US$19.0 million Blantyre Water Supply



- 7 -
Project, assisted by an IDA credit of US$7.0 mi'lion, is designed to in-
crease supply capacity from about 45,000 cu m per day to 60,000 cu m per
day and, through extension of the distrlbution system, provide improved
water service to a population of 360,000 in the mid-1980s.  The project is
also providing overseas training for engineering and accounting staff.
During negotiations for the Banks Structural Adjustment Loan, BWB reasses-
sed its financial position with the help of tbhe Bank, and tariffs were in-
creased by 10 percerit to provide enotugh income for 1.981. The Bank and
Government are now discussing a possible relaxation of BWB-s rates of re-
turn as covenanted under the project because of less-than-anticipated
demand and other factors.  Blantyre's water supply will require additional
investments) already identified, of US$36.0 million. by around the end of
the decade.
28.       Nearly all of Lilongwe's population is served by the Lilongwe
Water Board (LWB) throtgh about 5,000 connectioons, including 100 kiosks.
Present supply capaciLty of about 21,000 cu m per day closely matches de-
mand but) partly because of industrial and commercial development, demand
is increasing at a much higner rate than population.  Distribution system
additions, costing about US$2,9 million and funded by the European Develop-
ment Fund, were completed in 1981.  An ongoing (Phase II) emergency proj-
ect, costing about US$5.4 million and financed by the Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of India, is expected to increase supply and treatment capacity
to about 31,000 Cu m per day, which should suffice until the mid-1980s.
29.       A recently-completed District Water Supplies Project, partly
funded by a US$5.9 million loarn from the African Development Fund, will ex-
tend water service in 52 smaller urban centers and meet demand through
1985.  An Urban Centers Water Supply Project, costing about US$23.0
milliorn, would be required by the mid-1980s.
30.       Rural Water_Suppl  and Self-Help.  About a thlird of the rural
population, estimated at 5.4 million, had access to safe water in 1980 from
piped gravity systems, boreholes and dug wells, and private or institution-
al supplies.  The remainder of the rural population carries water over a
considerable distance from natural sources, which are often polluted, in-
sufficient or unreliable,  The proportion of rural population with access
to safe water increased by about 10 percent between 1977 and 1980, self-
help schlemes making a significant contribution.  District development com-
mittees, established in 1-966, initiate a variety of small-scale projects,
including wells and gravity systems.  While the committees rely on govern-
ment for equipment and technical services, the key to the success of the
projects has been the provision of free labor by the community, which al-
locates responsibilities among vill-ages4  Such projects have attracted sub-
stantial exteral supuport from botn govertments and volunteer agencies.
Nine low-cost rural water supply projects, with a total cost of about
US$19.0 million, are proposed to be constru6cted by 1986.  They include
projects for piped and grouandwater supplies, catcnment protection and
borehole maintenance, for which finance is being sought from UNDP, UNICEF,
the Uni ted States Agency for Internati onal Development (USAID) and others.

31.        Such efforts have been complemented by the extension of rural
water supply through most of the 11 agriculturaL and rural development
projects financed by the Bank Group in Mzlawi since 1968.  These include
the series of intensive area development projecl:s for Shire Valley,
Lilongwe and Karonga-Cllitipa and the projects supporting the National Rural
Development Program. Water development under the Bank's rural development
projects has mainly concentrated on borehole development for domestic as
well as agricultural or livestock use. In addition, the Dowa West Rural
Development Project (IFAD loan no. 70/MW), a cooperative project of the In-
ternational Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Bank, will sup-
port a pilot program for rehabilitating and extenlding rural water supply
and improving maintenance.  The unlt costs of boreholes in many of the
Bank-financed rural development projects has been high and cost recovery
unsatisfactory.  The Government's efforts to intiroduce low-cost construc-
tion and simplified designs and to improve mainitenance are intended to
address this problem.
32.       Cost Recoverv.  In Blantyre and Lilongwe, the water supply sys-
tems are self-supportinag, including recovery of capital.  The Blantyre
Water Board has agreed to charge its users enough to generate sufficient
funds for operations, debt service, rnormal capital expenditure and working
capital. Small town systems operated at a smalL collective deficit until
April 1982, when water supply tariffs were increased for these centers by
an average of about 35 percent. The recovery of construction and recurrent
costs in the rural areals has usually been limited to the provision of
self-help labor. To imaprove cost recovery for groundwater, the Government
is modifying design and construction standards to minimize investment and
maintenance costs, supported by several externa'L'Ly-financed projects,
including the Bank executed UNDP-financed Handpinip Test Project
(INT/81/026). Cost recovery for sewerage and sanitation is limited to
Blantyre, Lilongwe, Liwonde and Zomba, where costs are partially covered by
direct charges on households.  Only Blantyre achieves full recovery of
cost.
33.       Urban Sanitation and Sewerage.  About 15 percent of the urban
population was connected to communi ty waste water systems in 1980, the re-
mainder generally using septic tanks or pit latr:ines. The Federal Republic
of Germany has helped finance Phase I and II of the Blantyre Sewerage
Project.  A Phase III project, costing about US, C1.6 million, (also for
consideration by the Federal Republic of Germany) would be required by the
mid-1980s.  In general. expansion of sewerage facilities has not kept pace
with urban development in Malawi, nor have alternlative, low-cost sanitation
technologies been considered (a low-cost demonsitiration project is included
in the proposed project; para. 46 (e)).
34.       Public Health.  After an outbreak of cholera in 1973 (its first
recorded occurrence in Malawi) more attention has been paid to water supply
and sanitation. Many -rural homes now have pit :Litrines as a result of
health education, and health inspectors investigate sanitation hazards,



- 9 -
especially in urban areas. Confirmed cases of cholera declined from 1,870
in 1974 to 186 in 1978. Good progress has also been made in water supply
protection and sanitation by the volunteer village health committees, which
work with the district teams of the Ministry of Health.
Sector Institutions
35.       The principal organizations in the sector are the Department of
Lands, Valuation and Water (DLVW), under the Office of the President and
Cabinet (OPC), and the water boards in Blantyre and Lilongwe.  DLVW, estab-
lished in 1979, has assumed many of the responsibilities for rural and
urban water supply formerly held by a number of ministries. DLVW plans
and implements rural and urban water supply projects and, excluding
Blantyre and Lilongwe, operates water systems in over 30 urban centers.
DLVW also is responsible for water resource planning and water pollution
control, and provides technical assistance for the latter to Lilongwe Town
Council. DLVW uses its own staff to plan and implement water supply proj-
ects in the smaller towns and the rural areas, but needs to retain consul-
tants to do this work in the larger towns. DLVW works closely with the 24
District Development Committees in Malawi in rural water supply schemes.
36.       Blantyre and Lilongwe are served by Water Boards.  Blantyre Water
Board (BWB), which is autonomous and has a reputation for good management,
uses local staff, with expatriate managers, to plan, design and supervise
minor construction and operate and maintain a large and fairly sophisti-
cated system. For large works, BWB appoints consultants for engineering
design and supervision of construction and awards contracts for plant and
civil works. BWB is responsible to DLVW for the technical review of de-
velopment plans and to the Comptroller of Statutory Bodies in the Office of
the President and Cabinet for the review of financial planning, budgets and
control of expenditures.
37.       LWB operates Lilongwe's water supply system but depends upon DLVW
for technical planning, design and construction management. Until re-
cently, the Lilongwe Town Council served as the Lilongwe Water Board; but,
to ensure LWB's autonomy, the Government recently established a new and in-
dependent Board whose members are drawn from Government, the private sector
and the parastatals. The Boards present Engineer will assist the
Engineer/Manager who would be appointed under the project (para. 53). LWB
is responsible to DLVW for technical matters and depends on the Town
Council for administration and budgetary control.
38.       The town councils of Blantyre and Lilongwe are responsible for
providing sewer service to their populations. Blantyre has retained engin-
eering consultants for sewerage and sanitation development, which in
Lilongwe would be assisted by the proposed project.



- 10 -
39.        Manpower and Coordination.  Considerable water supply and
sanitation and sewerage development in Malawi is scheduled during the
1980s.  Such expansion  Lncreasingly will strain the administrative and
technical capabilities of the DLVW, the water boards and district units,
most of which are heavilLy dependent on senior expatriate staff and
consultants. The coordinating functions and roles of DLVW and the
Comptroller of Statutory bodies, who has special responsibilities for the
water boards, have not been adequately defined. With increasing
investments through a variety of channels, including rural development,
improved coordination will be essential.  While the DLVW is drawing up an
inventory of available water supplies, it does not have the planning
capability to develop a comprehensive national water supply investment
plan. A proposal for consolidating the water boa rds under a national water
authority, which would serve mainly urban areas, has not been fully
considered by the Government.
Government/Bank Strategy in the Water Supply Secltor
40.        The Government has accepted the Internattional Drinking Water
Supply and Sanitation Decade's goal of universal safe water by 1990.  Cur-
rent developments are expected to extend water supply to nearly all the
population of Blantyre and Lilongwe by about 1986--87, but because of pop-
ulation growth new investment will be required in the late 1980s.
Recently-completed and proposed water supply projects will serve most of
the population of the sraaller urban centers by theB early 1990s. While it
will be more difficult to provide safe water in a:Ll the rural areas by the
end of the decade the development momentum of recent years is expected to
continue.  Continued progress will depend on adequate external financing
and the ability of the Government to allocate sufficient funds for
recurrent expenditure. In spite of serious budget: constraints, the
Government intends to insure that essential services are funded.
41.        The Bank will provide financial assistance for high-priority,
long-term water supply projects, while increasing its support for institu-
tional development and for initiatives in low-cost, low-maintenance tech-
nology. A Phase III water supply project to meet the long-term needs of
Lilongwe is included in the five-year lending program for IDA. Assistance
for institution building, which began with the ongoing IDA-financed
Blantyre Water Supply Project, will be extended iTI future Bank Group opera-
tions, emphasizing manpower development and training and improvement in
administrative and financial management. The Bank will continue to
encourage the authorities to focus on cost-recovery issues.
42.        The Bank will support any realistic measures of the Government
to formulate a national plan for water supply investment. An important ob-
jective of such a plan would be to determine to what extent the



- ll -
Government's plans for rural water supply under the International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade are realistic and cost-effective. It is
expected that the main sectoral issues will be more clearly identified as a
result of the proposed organizational study (para. 49). In the absence of
a national investment plan for the sector, the Bank will support rural
water supply through the rural development projects it finances.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
43.       Malawi has made substantial progress since independence in the
provision of safe water, but has given priority to Blantyre, smaller urban
areas, and to rural locations. The need for additional water for Lilongwe
was first identified in 1978 through the Bank's Cooperative Program with
WHO and a Cooperative Project of the Swedish International Development Au-
thority (SIDA) and WHO. As a result, a number of short-term water supply
operations were implemented (para. 28), while the Government began to ex-
plore means of meeting Lilongwe's longer-range needs. Under the aegis of
the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, the UNDP
agreed in 1980 to provide finance for DLVW to carry out prefeasibility
studies for the long-range development of Lilongwe's water supply system
and prepare draft terms of reference for associated water supply master
plan and feasibility studies. The Government was unable to secure donor
financing for the master plan and feasibility studies.
44.       During a Bank mission to Malawi in September 1981, agreement was
reached with the Government on an engineering project to prepare a program
for meeting Lilongwe's long-range water needs that IDA would consider fin-
ancing. Information obtained by the mission at that time was considered
suitable for appraising the engineering project. The Government subse-
quently agreed to include studies of the manpower, training and organiza-
tional needs of the sector as a whole. Negotiations took place in
Washington between May 24 and 26. The Government delegation was led by
Mr. J.R. Phiri, Under-Secretary, Ministry of Finance. Annex III contains
supplementary project data.
Project Objectives
45.       The project would enable the Government and LWB to formulate
long-range water supply, sewerage and sanitation programs for Lilongwe, a
task to which the Government assigns high priority. The Lilongwe Water
Board (LWB) would be strengthened through improved management, financial
control and cost recovery. In addition, the project would help the Govern-
ment develop appropriate technologies for sewerage and sanitation and
assess the sector's organizational, manpower and training needs.



- 12 -
Project Description
46.       The project would finance:
(a)  Master plans for the long-range development of water supply
and sewerage and sanitat'on in Li]Longwe;
(b) A feasibility study, including field investigation, engin-
eering design and contract documents for the next phase
(Phase III) of Lilongwe's water supply development;
(c)  An Engineer/Manager and a Chief Accountant for LWB and man-
agement support for other activities in the sector;
(d)  A pilot project to demonstrate low-cost, appropriate sanita-
tion in Lilongwe;
(e)  Procurement of equipment and supplies essential for prepara-
tion of the Lilongwe (Phase III) Water Supply Project and
support of the pilot, low-cost sanitation component;
(f) Assessment of the sector's manpower and training needs, in-
cluding recommendations for a training program; and
(g) A study of the sector's organization and, if necessary, as-
sistance to Government to develop and review proposals for
reorganization or improved coordination within the sector.
Detailed Features
47.       The master plan studies would assess Lilongwe's water supply and
sewerage and sanitation requirements up to the year 2005. They would com-
pare costs and benefits of alternative approaches and recommend the optimum
long-term program for water supply. A similar program would be recommended
for sewerage and sanitation, closely linked to the proposed pilot project
for low-cost sanitation. The latter would be supported by the
UNDP-financed Inter-Regional Project executed by The World Bank, and would
have application to other urban areas of Malawi. The studies would also
identify a project which would constitute the next phase (Phase III) in
Lilongwe's water supply development (Phase II and previous developments are
described in para. 28). The engineering credit would finance a feasibility
study of the project idientified (including recommendations for LWB's
financial performance, e.g., rate of return and tariff provisions) as well
as the engineering design.
48.       An additional study would recommend a program for manpower devel-
opment and training in the sector. It would review data from ongoing and
proposed manpower studies financed by SIDA, WHO and UNDP, and assess the
potential of Malawi's educational system to providle training. The study



- 13 -
would recommend, with estimated costs: (a) measures to be implemented
under the Lilongwe (Phase III) Water Supply Project, possibly with bilater-
al donor assistance, to meet short-term sector manpower and training needs
of key staff at all levels, and (b) a strategy for the longer-term phased
development of a sector-wide training system. The Government and IDA would
approve the study's findings and recommendations (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.06).
49.       The organizational study would investigate the roles and inter-
relationships of the various authorities and entities concerned with water
supply; appraise the implications of the Government's objectives under the
International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, especially rural
supply; and assess the feasibility of proposals for a comprehensive nation-
al water supply investment plan and a national urban water authority.  The
study would also recommend immediate steps to improve coordination in the
sector. Bank staff would assist in reviewing the findings and Government
and Bank would agree on the measures to be taken (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.06).
Project Cost and Financing
50.       The engineering project is estimated to cost US$4.7 million, of
which the proposed credit of SDR 3.6 million (US$4.0 million equivalent)
would cover the foreign exchange cost. Local costs (US$0.75 million) would
be shared by LWB and DLVW. (A summary of the project cost estimates is
shown in the Credit and Project Summary.)
51.       As project expenditures would not be subject to local taxes,
these are not provided for in the estimated cost. Base costs are estimated
at mid-1982 prices. They allow for consultancy services as follows: mas-
ter plan studies, 80 man-months; feasibility study (excluding site investi-
gations), 30 man-months; engineering design, 100 man-months; training needs
study, 6 man-months; and organizational study, 4 man-months. Consultants'
charges, which include salary, fees, international travel and local subsis-
tence, and are likely to be time-based, are estimated to average about
US$9,300 per man-month for engineering and about US$9,800 per man-month for
remaining technical assistance. These charges are representative of cur-
rent charges for similar services in Malawi. Physical contingencies are
calculated at 10 percent of base costs for all project components with the
exception of the feasibility study and the low-cost sanitation component,
which are calculated at 20 percent. Price contingencies have been calcu-
lated on the assumption of an annual inflation rate of 8 percent in 1982
for foreign currency payments, declining to 7.5 percent and 7 percent in
1984 and 1985 respectively; and 12 percent annually for local expenditure.
52.       The portion of the IDA credit (about US$3.5 million) to be used
for development of Lilongwe's water supply would be onlent by the Govern-
ment to LWB at an interest rate of 12 percent for a term of 20 years, in-
cluding five years' grace (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section



- 14 -
3.01). The proposed rate of interest is about esqual to the estimated rate
of local inflation during the project period. Although higher than the
8-9 percent interest rate normally charged by Government for similar loans
to the Blantyre Water Board, it is the same as the interest charged to in-
dustry and commerce by INDEBANK,. the development finance company, for
foreign exchange loans. Interest charged to LWB would be capitalized dur-
ing the grace period. The Government is expected to retain the option in
the subsidiary loan agreement to refinance its :Loan to LWB under the
subsequent (Phase III) construction project, which the Association is
prepared to consider financing.
Project Implementation
53.       LWB would be responsible overall for project implementation, ex-
cept for the sector-wide manpower and organization studies and low-cost
sanitation pilot project, and would supervise consultants in preparing the
master plan and feasibility studies. An Engineer/Manager and a Chief Ac-
countant for LWB would be financed under the project. The Engineer/Manager
would consult with DLVW and coordinate implementation of the sewerage and
sanitation components with the city engineer and the city health officer.
54.       LWB would be expected to appoint an E]ngineer/Manager and a Chief
Accountant satisfactory to the Association by December 31, 1982 (draft
Project Agreement, Section 3.01). Recruitment began recently for these
positions.
55.       Engineering consultants, whose selectiLon, qualifications, experi-
ence and terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the Associ-
ation, would be retained to carry out the master plan, feasibility studies
and engineering designs.  The consultants' reports on studies, designs and
tender documents would be submitted in draft for review and approval by the
Government, LWB and the Bank.  In particular, the interim master plan
studies for Lilongwe would be reviewed before detailed site investigations
began for a water supply project (draft Development Credit Agreement,
Section 2.05a). The t:erms of reference for the master plan and feasibility
studies have been prepared by DLVW with UNDP and World Bank assistance, and
are acceptable to the Association. Government and Bank staff have agreed
on an implementation schedule that requires cornsultants proposals for the
master plan and feasibility studies to be invited in June 1982, and
contracts signed in February 1983, on terms acceptable to the Association.
Completion of detailecl engineering design for the water supply project is
scheduled for June 30, 1985.   The sector-wide components of the project
would be implemented by DLVW in consultation with the water boards, the
Comptroller of Statutory Bodies and ministries and district authorities
involved in water supply and training. Consultants for the organizational
review would be employed by March 31,1983, on terms acceptable to the
Association, and their studies and recommendations completed by October
1983 (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.02).  Support for the



- 15 -
low-cost sanitation component, including assistance in the recruitment of
an adviser on low-cost sanitation who would be retained for 24 man-months,
would be provided by the UNDP Inter-Regional Project (para. 47). The
execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and LWB
would be a condition of credit effectiveness (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 5.01).
Procurement and Disbursement
56.       The project would finance several minor contracts not exceeding
US$50,000, whose total value would not be more than US$400,000, for ve-
hicles, flow metering equipment, and miscellaneous equipment and supplies
procured through limited international bidding. Such items are not manu-
factured in Malawi and would be imported. Site investigations and
construction of individual waste disposal units included in the low-cost
sanitation component would be carried out by force account under DLVW.
Construction materials, costing about US$70,000, that cannot be purchased
as stock items from the Ministry of Works and Supply would be procured
under local procedures acceptable to the Association. Consultants would be
engaged in accordance with the Association-s guidelines. The credit would
be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 90 percent of local
expenditures for vehicles, equipment, supplies and construc-
tion materials; and
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the services of ad-
visors, consultants, and management experts.
The proposed closing date for the credit would be June 30, 1986.
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting
57.       LWB follows accounting procedures of local government institu-
tions, under which fixed assets are not depreciated and repayments
of long-term loans are charged as revenue expenditure. LWB has recently
prepared its accounts for its fiscal years 1979 and 1980 (ending March 31)
and plans to complete accounts for 1981 and 1982 about mid-1982.  Audit of
LWB's accounts has been completed to 1978, and audits up to 1982 are expec-
ted to be completed in August 1982. LWB's accounts show that it has gener-
ated sufficient revenues to cover operations, debt service, minor capital
expenditure and working capital. A 16 percent tariff increase on August 1,
1981 is expected to be sufficient to meet operational and other immediate
requirements for 1982. LWB's accounts are audited by the international
firm Coopers and Lybrand, which is acceptable to the Association.
Tariffs
58.       The basic water tariff in Lilongwe and a water rate levied as a
percentage of property value together average about US$0.31 equivalent per



- 16 -
cu m, and are adjusted to provide sufficient revenues to cover LWB's opera-
ting expenses (excluding depreciation), debt service and minor capital
expenditure.
Project Justification and Risks
59.       The proposed engineering project is essential for preparing a
Lilongwe (Phase III) Water Supply Project, which has been assigned high
priority by the Government and would meet the increasing domestic, commer-
cial and industrial needs for water and sanitation in Lilongwe until the
mid-1990s. The engineering project would also assess the manpower, train-
ing and organizational needs of the sector at a time of considerable devel-
opment activity.  It would take immediate steps to strengthen the manage-
ment of LWB and provide for longer-term improvement in the Board's manage-
ment and technical capability to enable it to implement the subsequent con-
struction project. The engineering credit would also help develop
technologies and an institutional framework for low-cost sanitation. The
risks are minimal.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
60.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associ-
ation and the Lilongwe Water Board and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
61.        Special conditions of the Credit are ]LiLsted in Annex III of this
report.
62.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit: would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
63.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

Fe2bruary 241976; ClosinDate:  December31  1981
The project hasE been completed and processing of final disbursements is
underway. The project provided for 22 model primary schools for a rural
education program.   It established a new primary teacher college and added
practical subjects in selected secondary schools with emphasis on facilities to
increase female enrollment.   As costs permitted. the project scope was enlarged
to include computer facilities for the Malawi Certificate Examination and Testing
Board and additional staff housing.  The project was effectively implemented and
achieved its educational objectives of expanding teacher educatio. and introducing
practical subjects to secondary schools.  The primary schools have large student
enrollments but minimum utilization by adults.

Detailed engineering is complete and awards have been made on all the  contracts
being financed by the Association.   However, due to the initial delay, the Bank
has agreed to a postponement of the closing date to September 30. 1983.   BWB has
also, with the help of the Bank, reassessed its financial position with a view to
revision of the covenanted rates of return because of slower-than-anticipated
growth in water demand, a reduced need for debt service, and higher rates of
revaluation of fixed assets than used at appraisal. Bank/Government discussions
are proceeding on the rate of return issue.
Credit No. 758-MAI            Third Highway Project; US$10.5 Million Credit of
