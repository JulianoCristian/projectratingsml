past would be difficult. Measures include macroeconomic\n            stabilization and the improvement of resource allocation\n            through reform of taxes, public expenditure, public\n            enterprises, competition and industrial incentives, and\n            agricultural pricing and credit. The program is also being\n            supported by an arrangement under the International Monetary\n            Fund's (IMF) Structural Adjustment Facility."}, "docdt": "1987-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
