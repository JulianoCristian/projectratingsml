No audit is planned. The loan was approved by the\n            Board on May 23, 1985, signed on May 29, 1985, and made\n            effective on September 17, 1985. At the request of the\n            Government, the project was cancelled on August 4, 1986.\n            Start-up of the project was stalled due to disagreements\n            between the Turkish Pulp and Paper Enterprise (SEKA) and the\n            Bank on the selection of consultants for the preparation of\n            detailed engineering design and project management. A number\n            of potential bidders claimed to the Bank that they had been\n            accorded unequal treatment. The Bank advised the Government\n            and SEKA to cancel the selection process and invite new\n            proposals. Ultimately, this issue could not be resolved and\n            the Government requested the Bank to cancel the undisbursed\n            amount. The Government agreed to pre-pay the outstanding\n            balance, consisting of disbursements for a project\n            preparation facility and the interest and commitment\n            charges. At the time of cancellation, work had already begun\n            on the Pulp and Paper Subsector Study. As the Government\n            deemed the study important, financing was made available\n            under a separate Technical Assistance for State Economic\n            Enterprises Project. The report states that the Bank doubted\n            the Government's cited reasons of the consultant\n            selection process and the possibility of privatization of\n            SEKA as rationales for cancellation. Rather, it may well\n            have been a reassessment on the part of the Government of\n            the need for further investments in SEKA that precipitated\n            the cancellation decision. As a result, the Bank's\n            decision to accede to the Government's request was appropriate."}, "docdt": "1993-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
