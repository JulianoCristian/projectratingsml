TURKEY
PULP AND PAPER REHABILITATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Government of Turkey
Beneficiary:       SEKA, the State Economic Enterprise for Pulp and Paper,
and the Government of Turkey
A.ount:           US$55.1 million equivalent
Terms:            Currently applicable variable Bank rate for a term of 17
years including 4 years of grace.
Project
Description:    The project would be the first phase of a continuing
restructuring and rehabilitation program for Turkey's
pulp and paper industry. Technical assistance (TA) would
be provided to the Government and to SEKA, and physical
rehabilitation would be undertaken in several of SEKA's
existing plants. The TA to the Government would provide
a comprehensive review of the pulp and paper subsector
including ar. in-depth study of the potential for
selective privatization of SEKA facilities.  The TA to
SEKA would involve a wide-ranging program of management
and operational improvement, including study of the wood
supply, and help to develop a medium-term strategy for
SEKA. Physical rehabilitation in three of SEKA's mills
would provide for increased production, improved quality,
and cost reduction. Critical spare parts would be
purchased, and energy-saving improvJements made in all of
SEKA's mills.
Benefits
and Risks:      The TA to Government is expected to have a significant
impact on policies related to the pulp and paper
subsector and its future development, including important
steps toward the privatization of SEKA. The TA to SEKA
will provide substantial improvement in the management
and operation of SEKA with resulting improvement in
profitability. The physical rehabilitation will provide
significant economic and financial benefits with
relatively small capital investment. The economic and
before-tax financial rates of return for the project as a
whole are 41% and 34%, respectively. There are no
significant risks associated with the physical
rehabilitation components of the pro,4ct. In the case of
TA to SEKA, there is a risk that recommended improvements
in management and operating procedures might be perceived
as threats by certain levels of SEKA's staff and lesd to
lack of cooperation and reduction of expected benefits.
To avoid this risk and to maximize the benefits, SEA' s



- v -
own management and staff will play an active role in
diagnosis of problems, and the planning and
implementation of the program. A second risk is that
prices would be lower and input costs higher than
projected. Effective implementation of SEKA's pricing
policy, which allows a wide latitude and freedom to
maintain market-oriented prices, plus the arrangements
for wood supply, should minimize these risks.

PULP AND PAPER REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Turkey (GOT) has requested a
Bank loan of US$55.1 million equivalent to finance the foreign exchange
costs of a project to begin the restructuring and rehabilitation of its
pulp and paper industry.
1.02      The project would be undertaken by Turkiye Seluloz ve Kagit
Fabrikalari Genel Mudurlugu (SEKA), the State Economic Enterprise (SEE),
which owns and operates eight pulp and paper mills currently producing some
70% of the country's pulp and paper requirements (Map IBRD No. 18435). The
proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government who would on-lend
US$54.8 million equivalent to SEKA to cover about 63% of the total amount
(US$86.8 million equivalent) required to finance the Droject and 100% of
the foreign exchange requirements. The Government would utilize
US$0.3 million for Technical Assistance.
1.03      The project would be the first step towards restructuring and
rehabilitation of Turkey's pulp and paper industry. A significant
component of the project would be Technical Assistance (TA) to the
Government and to SEKA. The TA program to the Government would include a
comprehensive study of the pulp and paper subsector to develop subsector
objectives and strategies, including an appropriate structure for the
subsector, forest management and wood supply, and an in-depth review of the
possibilities for privatization of SERA, including assisting SEKA and the
Government to identify suitable arrangements that could interest local
private sector and/or international pulp and paper companies to invest in
SEKA's operations. The TA to SEKA would involve a program of operational
and maintenance training, study and recommendations for improvement of
environmental protection, improvements to organization, manpower,
financial/accounting and management information systems.  Rehabilitation
work would be carried out in three of SEKA's mills which would benefit from
increased production and improved product quality. In addition, the
project would provide funds for the import of critical spare parts and for
the implementation of certain energy-savifng improvements in all SEKA mills.
1.04      The project evolved from several government policies:
(i) concentrating industrial invesLMent in the rehabilitation of existing
industrial capacity rather than building new plants; (ii) improving the
efficiency of SEEs; and (iii) selective privatization of SEEs. The project
was identified by the Industrial Projects Identification Mission to Turkey
in July 1980, and was prepared by the US consulting firm Rust Overseas
incorporated (RUST) who were hired by SEKA using an advance from the Bank's
Project Preparation Facility. The project was appraised in October 1983,
and M4ay 1984, by Messrs. Chalk, Crookes, and Zamani, of the Industry
Department.

II. THE TURKISH PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY
A. Economic Background
2.01      The Turkish economy, having grown at 6% annually between 1967 and
1978 has undergone a marked transformation over the last decade, with the
share of industry in GDP rising to 23% in 1978 and to about 32% at
present. The economic progress was, however, punctuated by severe balance
of payments crises in 1970 and 1977, mainly because of the country's
overemphasis on import substitution and inability to develop a strong
export base, coupled with heavy debt service on foreign borrowings. The
economic crisis in 1977 was a particularly serious one, following which
real GDP increased by only 2.8% in 1978, and decreased by 0.9% in 1979, and
by 0.7% in 1980. Real GDP, after falling for two consecutive years,
expanded by 4.1% and 4.6% in 1981 and 1982, respectively. In 1983, GDP
growth slowed to about 3.2% due in large part to the effect of adverse
weather conditions on agricultural production. Industrial value added
increased by an estimated 6.6%.
2.02      Turkey's development strategy prior to 1980 had given high
priority to industrialization based mainly on import substitution and the
development of the regions outside the major urban centers. The Government
has generally been involved in basic industries where private capital has
hesitated to enter because of long gestation periods, heavy capital
requirements or high risks. Consequently the public sector and the SEEs
have played an important role in industrialization. The present
Government's program for restructuring the economy seeks to replace an
industrialization strategy based on import substitution with one by an
outward orientation and with more involvement of the private sector.
Measures designed to stabilize the economy include, among others, a
realistic and flexible exchange rate, control of inflation, deregulation of
interest rates to encourage private savings, and rationalization of public
investments.
B. The SEE System
2.03      The SEEs in Turkey were established 50 years ago.  The SEEs
currently account for about 32% of total fixed investment, and about 11% of
non-agricultural employment. In industry, SEEs have a virtual monopoly in
petroleum refining and basic metals, and have a large share in steel,
fertilizers, pulp and paper, cement, coal, sugar, machinery and chemicals.
Supervision of SEE operations was the general responsibility of the related
Ministry and the specific responsibility of the High Control Board, an
auditing organization which reported directly to Parliament. The
Government provided the SEEs with the credit and capital needed to sustain
operations and to make new investments, within the framework of the
Five-Year Plan and the Annual Programs. The majority of the problems
afflicting the SEEs have arisen from the fact that while the enterprises
have formally been organized as economic entities with the objectives of
efficiency, productivity and profitability, they have in the past been



- 3 -
subject to constant intervention by the Government in pursuit of different
and often conflicting objectives. The causes of poor performance have
included price controls, lack of autonomy, low operational efficiency,
frequent changes of management, inadequate salaries for managerial and
technical staff, internal organizational problems, and a confusion between
economic, social and political goals.
2.04      Reform of the SEEs has been a major goal of the Government's
structural adjustment program. The SEE reform Law 2929 of October 1983,
and a later Decree of June 1984 (Decree 233 which is due to become law
shortly)1/ signal the importance the Government attaches to bringing about
greater efficiency in SEE performance through decentralization of
responsibility, greater management autonomy, and competition. SEE reform
has also been supported by the Bank through its structural adjustment loans
as well as through ceveral ongoing Bank-assisted projects which include
components that address specific organizational restructuring and
management improvement issues. In the short run, there is considerable
scope for strengthening the management and improving the operational
efficiency of SEEs. The Government considers the time opportune,
therefore, to shift from a broad approach of SEE reform to a more
differentiated one concentrating on individual enterprises. The proposed
project builds on this objective and focusses on SEKA, whose poor financial
performance has placed substantial burdens on the budget. The project
would assist the Government to explore ways to privatize SEKA and would
address a number of serious problems in SEKA including weak organization
and management as well as inefficient operating and maintenance practices.
In addition, the project would focus on physical rehabilitation of existing
mills rather than on investment in new facilities. This is consistent with
the country's policy of limiting public sector investment in manufacturing
to permit concentration of public investment on high priority
infrastructure projects. Nevertheless, some manufacturing investment to
rehabilitate existing productive facilities still has priority to enable
the SEEs involved to earn reasonable returns on past investments.
C. Performance of the Industry
2.05      In 1983, the private and public sectors of the pulp and paper
industry, with output valued at approximately TL 80,000 million, accounted
for around 2.5% of industrial output, and its 16,000 workers accounted for
about 2% of total industrial employment. The industry has made significant
progress since 1970, attaining close to full domestic self-sufficiency in
the production of paper and paperboard. In 1970, domestic production of
paper and paperboard accounted for only 56% of consumption of paper
products. In contrast, by 1983, domestic production of 568,000 tons
accounted for more than 90X of consumption. Newsprint and sack kraft have
1/   As an indicator of the importance the Government attaches to SEE
improvements, the new Decree 233 places most of the manufacturing
SEEs, including SEKA, under the Office of the Prime Ministry rather
than the Ministry of Industry and Trade. A State Minister is directly
responsible for the SEEs.

been imported in varying quantities over the past few years, but such
imports will be substantially reduced as production in recently
commissioned mills increases (Chapter IV). In other grades in which
domestic self sufficiency has been attained, e.g. hygienic papers and some
coated boards, there has recently been some measure of success in
exporting, amounting to about 5% of total domestic production of these
grades.
D. Historical Development
2.06      Turkev's first paper mill was established by the SEE, Sumerbank,
at Izmit in 1934. Responsibility for this plant together with all public
sector participation in the pulp and paper industry was transferred to the
separately constituted SEE, SEKA, in 1955. This original mill underwent a
series of expansions and production rose from an initial 9,000 tons in 1934
to more than 130,000 tons by 1970. Turkey, however, remained a substantial
and growing importer of paper products, in particular, newsprint. To
address this problem, the Government undertook a series of ambitious
integrated pulp and paper mill investments starting In the early 1970s.
Also, private investors were actively expanding existing operations and
building new mills. These investments, together with substantial tariff
protection, rapid industrial growth, urbanization, and increasing literacy,
provided the framework within which domestic paper production grew from
151,000 tons in 1970 to 568,000 tons in 1983.
E. Structure of the Industry
2.07      The pulp and paper industry has evolved over the last 25 years
into two distinct sectors, public and private, with characteristic
differences in grade mix, raw material requirements, and the degree of
vertical integratUon.  Production trends in the two sectors are illustrated

2.08      The private pulp and paper sector is based primarily on waste
paper, straw, and some imported pulp, and mainly produces hygienic Paper,
wrapping paper, and paperboard. The private sector made significant
advances in the 1970s, and now accounts for about one third of the
country's production. There are 36 mills in the private sector. In
general, these private mills are quite small with an average capacity of
about 5,000 tpy, but five are of moderate size, 20,000 tpy or larger. On
the other hand, SEKA's mills have an average installed capacity of about
90,000 tpy which, overall, are of a size comparable to mills in
industrialized countries.
2.09      SEKA currently has eight pulp/paper mills in operation which
account for some two thirds of the country's total output of paper and
paperboard. SEKA will continue to dominate the industry in the medium
term, particularly in the production of chemical and mechanical pulps from
*vood and the conversion of these pulps to paper in integrated mills.
SEKA's production is based primarily on the extensive natural coniferous
forests of the Black Sea, Marmara, Aegean, and Mediterranean Regions
although some straw, reed and hemp are also used, as well as imported pulp.
F. Fibrous Raw Material Resoutrces
1. Total Fiber Consumption
2.10      Wcod is SEKE's most important fibrous raw material, supporting
about 80% of SEKA's pulp production. In the private sector, waste paper is
the predominant fiber soerce. Ogerall, in 1983, production of paper from
the various raw raaterials was approximately as follows: wood 53%, waste
paper 28%, straw and reeds 10X, and imported pulp 9%7. Cor.sumption of
fibrous raw materials for the past four years is summarized in the
following tab'e.

_. 'Wood
2.11      Turkey has extensive natural fcrests iir the mour.tainous areas of
the Black Sea, Marmara, Aegean and Mediterranean regions, which are the
largest forest tesources in the Middle East. Virtually all of .he
ceuntry's forest resources are vested in .he state. Approximately
20 million ha -.re classifi.ed as forested area aid over the past 5 years



total production of roundwood has averaged 7.5 million m3/yr or about
0.4 m3fha. By comparison, wood production in Scandinavia is more than
1.5 m3/ha. The lower utilization figure for Turkey reflects a more
conservative forest management policy providing for lower annual allowable
cut, less developed forest infrastructure, and less extensive wood-using
industries. Notwithstanding these factors, the current attainable economic
output is estimated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry at
12 million m3/yr and a level of up to 16 million m3/yr is considered
feasible with expansion of the forest road network.
2.12      The paper industry's wood purchases over a recent 4-year period
have varied from 1.0 million m3/yr to 1.5 million m3/yr and, as the table
below indicates, have comprised between 12% and 21Z of industrial roundwood
production.

2.13      SEKA's current and prospective maximum annual pulp production
capacity requires some 2.3 million m3/yr of wood, or only about 20% of the
currently attainable industrial wood production. The availability of logs
for SEKA is reasonably secure, particularly as SEEs are given priority.
However, delays sometimes occur due to the production and storage system
where logs may be stored for long periods in forest depots. SEKA is
responsible for log transport from the forest depot to its mills, and
delays in finalizing trucking contracts can cause further delays in wood
delivery. However, in the past year SEKA has had considerable success in
improving the delivery and other arrangements for wood supply at one mill,
and expects to extend these arrangements to other mills (para 5.14). Under
the Bank-financed Mlorthern Forestry Project (Loan 1585-TU), industrial
roundwood production in 1984 was limited to some 53% of the appraisal
estimate due to problems of regenerating cut-over forests and encroachment
and illegal fellings by forest villagers. These difficulties are to be
studied in depth by the mid-term project review initiated in March 1985.
Moreover, these issues will be addressed on a national scale under the TA
component of the proposed project (para 5.11).



- 7 -
2.14      Wood Prices.  The price of sawlogs to SEKA is based on the
average actual open market auction price for the previous six months.
Pulpwood price on the other hand is negotiated annually by SEKA and the
General Directorate of Forests to cover the cost of replacing wood that is
consumed by the industry, plus the cost of managing and protecting such
forests and an appropriate return on the invested forestry capital. The
price currently paid by SEKA is substantially in line with international
prices. Provision is made in the TA component of the project (para 5.11)
to review the whole process of setting wood prices.
2.15      Privatization of Forest Management.  In view of the Government's
privatization policy and successful examples around the world of private
forest industries managing their own wood resources (Canada, Sweden, USA,
Chile, Swaziland, etc.) the possibility of doing this in Turkey will be
reviewed under the project (para 5.11). In other countries, harvesting
licenses or other forms of concessions have been granted to integrated
forest industries companies so that they can manage their own wood supply
in accordance with sound forest management and silvicultural practices.
The company benefits by having direct control over the harvesting and
delivery of its main raw material, while the Government benefits because
private industry becomes more encouraged to invest in forest industry and
the cost of forest management passes to the entity concerned. Government
retains all its power to assure that the resource is managed efficiently on
a sustained yield basis.
3. Waste Paper
2.16      Waste paper usage constitutes about 30% of Turkish paper and
paperboard consumption and about 28% of the subsector's fibrous raw
material supply. The usage of waste paper is low in relation to its use in
Europe where it accounts for about 40Z of paper products consumption. The
availability of this material depends on the collection system, and this is
rather poorly organized. However, in recent years a company has been
formed which deals specifically in the collection and sale of waste paper,
and, furthermore, the association of Turkish pulp and paper manufacturers
has since formed an industry working group to study ways of improving the
collection system even further.
4. Straw/Reed
2.17      These materials are used by SEKA to produce short-fiber bleached
chemical pulp which basically substitutes for imported hardwood pulp.
Although the physical properties of this raw material result in a pulp
slightly inferior to imported hardwood, the quality is fully acceptable for
the limited number of grades of paper in which it is used. SEKA and the
private sector also use straw to produce a relatively high yield
chemi-mechanical pulp which is used for corrugating medium and other types
of lower-quality boards. An estimated 10-15 million tons of straw is
generated in Turkish agriculture each year. This material is mostly used
in animal husbandry. The requirements for pulping, about 100,000 tons per
year, represent less than 1% of the amount generated. Although the



- 8 -
abundance of straw makes it a relatively cheap material to purchase, the
costs of c-llection, baling, and transportation are significant, and reduce
the comparative cost advantage over wood to only about 30%: typically in
SEKA's mills fibrous raw material cost to produce I ton of bleached pulp
will be about USS100 when using straw compared with US$150 for wood. Reeds
are used only in the Afyon pulpmill (para 5.07). SEKA has contracts with
local peop'le who manually harvest reeds from a nearbv lake and deliver them
to the mill at a fixed price. As is the case for straw, the high cost of
collecting and delivering reeds reduces the comparative advantage over wood
such that fiber cost per ton of pulp is only 25% lower than when pulping
wood.
C. Government Policies in the Subsector
2.18      The expansion of the pulp and paper industry during the !960s and
1970s was inspired principally by the desire to attain domesti-c
self-sufficiency in paper produlcts in line with the dominant theme in
Turkish industrial policy  of import-substitution in that period. The state
played a major role in this process.
2.19      The Government had to finance all the large-sca'le integrated
wood-pulp and paper mills because of the capital intensive, long gestation
nature of the projects and the private sector did not have the required
financial resources. M,oreover, these investments -were concentrated in the
paper grades that were of key importance to the state's policy in promoting
education and industry, namely, newsprint, printing/writing paper and sack
kraft. As domestic output of these grades started to expand, the pursuit
of these objectives was reinforced with formal price controls on
printing/writir-g paper and newsprint. In addition, within the framework of
the policy of self-sufficiency, the expansion of output in these grades
prov-ded a domestic source of waste paper, a key raw material for the
private sector.
2.20      Furthermore, in the 1970s, the Government provided a highly
protective cariff structure within which domestic output could expand.  The
high nomii.ai tariff was also reinforc-ed by restrictions on imports under a
foreign exchange allocation system. However, over the past few years, SEKA
was under political pressure to limit price increases and prices did not
keep pace witth domestic inflation. By the end of 1983, SEKA's average
sales price was about 20% below the comparable import parity price. The
Goverrnment has recently adopted new industrial and trade policies, the
thrust of which is to open up the Turkish economy to more competition from
abroad, through import liberalization measures and lower tariffs and import
duties.  Under the new policies, since the beginning of 1984, controls over
importation of paper and paper products have been relaxed and nominal
tariff rates have been significantly reduced, i.e., for newsprtnz from 23%
to '5;O  for printing and writing paper trom 60% to 25%, for kraft sack and
wrapping paper from 50% to 3O%   However, the Government has recently



levied a temporary surcharge 2/ to soften the impact of trade
liberalization and the reduction in tariffs on the existing mills and to
safeguard the industry from dumping practices. Further progress in
rationalization of the tariff structure and other trade policies are being
monitored under the Fifth Structural Adjustment Loan (2441-TU).
2.21      Since 1980, the Government has focused on strengthening the
SEEs, and has undertaken several measures to make their economic
environment more competitive (para 2.04). As a result, SEKA has benefited
from greater managerial autonomy with continuity of senior management and
stability of policies. Since the passage of the SEE Reform Law in October
1983, the Government has encouraged SEKA to excercise its freedom to set
its own prices in the light of market conditions (para 3.19). Since early
1984, the Government also has focused on SEKA's (and other SEEs') capital
structure and significant outstanding debts of SEKA have been consolidated
and converted to equity (para 3.16). Moreover, the Government intends to
strengthen management and operational efficiency of SEKA through a
rehabilitation program, and explore opportunities for privatization of
SEKA. Even though the Bank, through its previous lending in the
sub-sector, has acquirea considerable knowledge of the pulp and paper
industry in Turkey, as part of the proposed project the Government will
undertake a comprehensive sector study, under which it will: review the
problems and prospects of the pulp and paper industry; develop subsector
objectives and develop targets for the next decade; formulate industry
strategies which would be most effective in achieving the objectives; and
establish a pulp and paper industry development program, including
investment plan, necessary policy reform, and other appropriate
adjustments. The study will also include identifying pulp and paper
rehabilitation projects in the private sector and an in-depth review of the
possibilities for privatization of SEKA including suitable packaging that
could interest local private sector firms and/or international pulp and
paper companies to participate in privatization of SEICA. The draft Terms
of Reference for the proposed study, which have been discussed and agreed
upon with the Treasury and State Planning Organization (SPO), are included
as Annex 2-1. SPO, on behalf of the Government, will undertake the study,
assisted by consultants, and with the support of Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma
Bankasi (TSKB) and SEKA. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Government that the study will be completed by September 30, 1986, and
be made available to the Bank for review and comment.
2/   The amounts vary by grade of paper and are stated in US$ but payable
in TL. The amounts are, per ton: newsprint $70, printing and writing
$125, kraft paper $25, coated board $100. According to SEKA, Swedish
export prices for certain grades of kraft paper, newsprint, and
printing papers are 5-15% lower on average than if these products were
purchased locally in Sweden. Swedish newsprint can be landed in
Istanbul at $340/ton cif. A similar situation exists with Romanian
paper imports.



- 10 -
H. Privatization
2.22      The Government's objective is to improve the efficiency of
manufacturing SEEs to develop their competitive position domestically and
internationally. Privatization is considered a useful mechanism to
accelerate the process. At this stage the Government is considering
various privatization alternatives including divestiture, sale of shares to
the public, leasing, management contracts, etc. However, the Government
has no preconceived ideas regarding privatization of specific sectors and
believes that all related aspects should be studied before a definite
strategy is adopted. In the case of SEKA specifically, the Government view
is that SEKA must first be put on a sound footing, both financially and
operationally, so that it may attract sufficient interest from the private
sector and also provide to t'e Government an appropriate and reasonable
value for its assets. In preparation for this, the Government has agreed
with the Bank to include in the project a TA program which would, in part,
examine appropriate industry structure and privatization possibilities.
This approach is prudent. It is also pertinent to point out that previous
Government policies have enabled private sector participation in some
sections of the pulp and paper industry and in fact about one third of the
country's production of paper and paperboard currently comes from private
sector enterprises. There are, however, a number of factors which have
discouraged private sector investments in large integrated mills such as
are owned and operated by SEKA. These are: (a) high capital investment
and long implementation period; (b) main raw material (wood) is uader
government control; and (c) a major portion of the output is sold to a
limited number of powerful buyers -- in the case of newsprint, newspaper
publishers and in the case of kraft paper, cement companies and sack
manufacturers -- and prices have been kept too low in the past to realize a
satisfactory return on investment.
2.23      In spite of these and other difficulties, there are certain
components of SEKA which may be suitable for spinning off, as a short-term
first step towards full privatization of SEKA, including the following
units: (a) Akdeniz sawmill; (b) Balikesir sawmill; (c) Akdeniz Tug and
Barge facilities; and (d) Bolu fiberboard plant. The above units are
considered as suitable possibilities because capital costs are relatively
low (US$5-15 million), there is good potential for profit, and although in
most cases the units are integrated with SEKA mills they can still be
operated as independent units. As a first step, and following up on the
Bank's suggestion during appraisal of the project, SEKA has decided that
their Bolu fiberboard plant is a suitable candidate for immediate
privatization, and has already made such a recommendation to the High
Economic Council. The Government has confirmed that a few individual cases
such as this should be pursued even before the strategic studies are
completed. During negotiations, agreement was reached with SEKA that they
would consult with the Bank prior to divesting any of their major assets if
such action would significantly affect their financial position.



- 11 -
2.24      In the longer term, larger scale privatization possibilities,
short of complete sale of SEKA, might logically be concentrated on certain
product lines which could be attractive to private investors, both foreign
and local. Specifically, newsprint and bleach kraft pulp operations and
their expansions could be considered. Newsprint requires coniferous wood
(e.g. pine), and in contrast to other countries in the Middle East, Turkey
is well endowed with this resource. Also it has a relatively good position
with regard to electric power supply in those regions where EFKA's mills
are located. Furthermore, projection of Turkey's domestic demand for
newsprint (para 4.07) indicates that construction of a third newsprint mill
should start in about 1987. A new private or joint ventL.re company might
be formed to take over SEKA's two existing newsprint operations (Aksu and
Balikesir) and build the third mill. Such a proposal might be attractive
to a foreign newsprint producer as a means of gaining access to Turkey's
large domestic market and other Middle East markets. Bleached kraft pulp
production by local private sector paper producers could be achieved
through sale of SEKA's Afyon pulp mill. This mill produces short fiber
pulp, partly to replace imports, from wheat straw and reeds, which are
obtained from farmers and local villagers. Thus the major impediment of
government control of the main raw material, wood (para 2.22), would not be
a factor.  Also, SEKA's long proposed Karadeniz project to produce long
fiber bleach kraft pulp makes technical and commercial sense and lacks only
a guaranteed wood supply and financing. A private group operating Afyon
might logically expand their interest to the Karadeniz project which would
have an assured domestic market and would provide a controlled source of
high-quality long fiber pulp for their non-integrated paper mills.
I. Bank Role in the Subsector
2.25      Bank participation in the subsector began in 1974 with a loan to
the Government of US$40 million for the Antalya Forest Utilization Project
(Loan 957-TU), of which US$35.5 million was onlent to SEKA for the Akdeniz
integrated pulp and paper and sawmills and the remaining US$4.5 million was
for modernization of forestry operations. There were delays in the
implementation of the Akdeniz component, primarily due to initial changes
in the site location. The mill was commissioned in late 1983 and is now
exceeding the production rates estimated at the time of appraisal. The
Bank also provided a loan of US$70 million to SEKA for the Balikesir
Newsprint Project (Loan 1258-TU) which was signed in 1976. The objective
of the loan was to finance construction of a newsprint paper and sawmill,
as well as pollution abatement facilities. Implementation was delayed on
account of a shortage of materials and domestic financing during a period
of general economic crisis in Turkey. The facilities were commissioned in
1981. After initial technical difficulties, production performance is
currently at 80% of design capacity, which is close to appraisa'l
estimates. The experience gained from these projects has been taken into
account in the design of the proposed project, which provides for a
comprehensive technical assistance program aimed at strengthening SEKA's
management structure and improving operation and maintenance procedures.
The Bank also made a US$86 million loan for the Northern Forestry Project
(Loan 1585-TU) signed in 1978 and currently under implementation. The



- 12 -
project has sought to improve the Government's forest management planning
and operations as well as to increase industrial roundwood production.
Industrial roundvood production is below project estimates due to
difficulties experienced in regenerating cut-over forest areas and
adherence to outdated and conservative forest management practices.
Nonetheless, efforts are continuing on introducing more modern forestry
practices.
2.26      In addition to these direct loans, about US$7 million in proceeds
from the DYB I and DYB II Projects (Loans 1024-TU and 1379-TU) were
utilized to finance partially investments designed to balance production
facilities at the Dalaman and Caycuma mill. The Project Completion Report
of February 10, 1984 for DYB I (Loan 1024-TU) and the Bank report entitled,
Sector Operations Revilew: The Industries and DFCs Program in Turkey
(No. 3077-TU), dated July 18, 1980 concluded that a major lesson learned
from the Bank's experience with DYB is that improvements in SEE performance
can be better achieved through direct loans and industrial sector policy
dialogue. Both of these recommendations have been taken into account in
designing the proposed project.
2.27      Through TSKB, the Bank is also indirectly involved (Loan 2093-TU)
in the expansion of the private sector with Kartonsan, a company which
produces coated board and is currently increasing its production to
85,000 tpy. IFC has been actively involved in the private sector and
currently holds equity in Viking Pulp and Paper Company, one of the larger
private sector mills producing about 12,000 tpy of wrapping paper.
III.  THE COMPANY
A. Background and Organization
3.01      SEKA was established in 1955 as the SEE in charge of public
sector operations in the pulp and paper sector. Until the 1960s, Izmit was
the only SEKA plant. However, since then, SEKA has gone through a major
expansion program involving the construction of seven mills. Each of these
mills is a separate legal entity, incorporated as a company under Turkish
laws. However, autonomy is limited to general and routine operational
matters, and in practice they operate as divisions of SEKA. SEKA's
authorized capital, fully Government owned, as of the end of 1983 was
TL 70,000 million. SEKA has about 11,000 employees in headquarters and
operating mills.
3.02      Since April 1983, as a part of the SEE reorganization and
reforms, an additional company, Bolu fiberboard plant, has been added to
SEKA's operation, bringing the total number of companies under SEKA to
nine. SEKA's total installed annual capacity as of the end of 1983 amounts
to over 500,000 tons of pulp, paper and paperboard, 275,000 m3 of sawnwood,
and 6 million m2 of fiberboard and laminated board.



- 13 -
3.03      As per the new SEE decree (para 2.04), SEKA's Board of Directors
is now composed of six members, a chairman, who is also General Director,
and five directors. Two of the directors are drawn from the Assistant
General Directors of the Enterprise. All board members are appointed by
the Government for three-year terms. The Board of Directors concentrates
on policy issues, leaving executive powers to the General Director. The
General Director is assisted by a Technical Assistant General Director, and
an Administrative Assistant General Director.
3.04      At the mill level, the organizational structure is similar to
that of SEKA's headquarters, but overall mill management autonomy is
limited and confined to undertaking instructions from headquarters. Each
mill has a management committee consisting cf a chairman and four members.
The duty of the management committee is to reach and implement decisions
regarding the management of the mill in accordance with predetermined
operating targets, plans and budgets.
3.05      The management committee members are nominated from among the
higher level mill managers. The chairman of the management committee is
the Mill Manager, who is aided by two assistants, one in charge of
technical matters and the other in charge of administration. Both are
members of the management committee. The Technical Assistant Mill Manager
is responsible for day-to-day manufacturing, including quality control and
production record keeping. The Administration Assistant Mill Manager is
responsible for accounting, personnel functions, security, welfare and
sales.
3.06      the lack of continuity and motivation of management have been
major problems confronting SEKA. Historically, most senior management
appointments have been politically motivated, subjecting the day-to-day
operations of the enterprise to a political process which in turn has
prodlced several undesirable results, including lack of continuity in
policies and practices, insecurity for professional staff, low morale, and
inappropriate investment decisions. As in all SEEs, low salary structure
has been a major deterrent for attracting and holding competent mangers.
In recent years, the situation in SEKA has improved. Since 1982, the
enterprise has benefitted by the appointment of a General Director who is a
professional manager with an engineering background and more than 25 years
of experience in industrial management and administration. Since his
appointment he has launched at least two major developments in SEKA.
First, he has given more autonomy to mill managers and made them more
accountable for operational performance. Second, he has created a
"Department of Management and Methods", headed by a professional recruited
from outside SEKA. This department has already initiated a Job Evaluation
Program in the Izmit mill, with the objective of linking salaries to
performance. The program will be extended to all SEKA mills in due
course. While SEKA has enjoyed for the past three years continuity of
management, relative freedom from political interference, and more autonomy
for mill mangers who are therefore better motivated, the major issue of low
pay and other benefits for management and professional staff remains
outstanding, and can only be addressed in the context of reform of the
overall SEE system, which is currently under way.

B. Management Information System
3.07      SEKA's present management information system, similar to that of
other SEEs in Turkey is designed for general purpose requirements and
without due consideration for the special features and characteristics of
the industry it serves. The system does not provide an adequate basis for
planning and control and requires major review and upgrading. SEKA's
reporting requirements from its mills is extensive and involves substantial
clerical work and bookkeeping often with delays. Under the present system,
headquarters is kept informed daily on such items as production figures and
cash position. There are weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual reports.
SEKA in turn consolidates these reports and submits them to the
Government. However, at SEKA's headquarters, data collected are often
insufficiently focused on relevant aspects and data are not processed
adequately, partly because it is overly voluminous. Upgrading of the
management information system and computerization of the system is included
in SEKA's rehabilitation program.
C. Production Performance

Source: SEKA.
With a few exceptions, SEKA's capacity utilization is low in comparison
with similar mills in North America and Scandinavia where utilization of at
least 90% is normal. In the past year SEKA, including the Afyon mill,



- 15 -
averaged only about 75Z. The production of Izmit has been relatively
stable with minor fluctuations between 118,000 to 13X,000 tons per year.
The production at Caycuma has fluctuated significantly, between a peak of
65,000 tons in 1977 (87% of the design capacity), to a low of 43,000 tons
in 1980 (57% of the design capacity). The low production level in 1979 and
1980 was mainly the result of general material shortages during those
years, and poor maintenance practices and frequent unscheduled downtime.
Another major factor affecting Caycuma's operations is the significant
imbalance between the pulp mill and the paper mill. The principal
bottleneck is the chemical recovery boiler which can only support
45,000 tons of pulp production per year. Actual production is maintained
at a higher level by purchasing additional pulping chemicals and wasting
the spent chemicals, an expensive and environmentally harmful practice.
Production at Aksu has been low, averaging only 75% of design capacity over
the past five years, and fluctuating between a high of 71,000 tons (87% of
the design capacity), in 1977, to a low of 56,000 tons (68% of the design
capacity) in 1978. This has been mainly due to poor maintenance practices
exacerbated by shortages of spare parts, power interruptions, and frequent
unscheduled downtime. For example during 1981, the Aksu plant experienced
188 incidents of power disturbances, which caused over 5,000 tons of lost
paper production. Since this time, the Turkish Electric Authority has made
significant improvements to the system and power interruptions are no
longer considered a serious problem. Production at Dalaman has been
relatively stable, with capacity utilization close to 100%. The Dalaman
mill is well maintained and well managed. Afyon performance has been poor
since its commissioning in 1980, although the production level has improved
somewhat in 1983, and actual production for the year was 20,000 tons of
pulp, about 40% of its rated capacity. The low capacity utilization at
Afyon has been in the past mainly due to technical problems in the mill
design. Balikesir was commissioned in 1981 and production build-up has
been satisfactory and is expected to reach design level before 1986.
D. Reforms of Personnel Policy
3.09      Overstaffing has been a major problem confronting SEKA's
management. In line with the SEE policy reform, since 1980, SEKA has taken
specific measures to address the issue of the overstaffing. These measures
were: freezing the number and structure of job positions for existing
operations at the level of November 1980; canceling 50% of job positions
becoming vacant through resignation, retirement or death; and allocating
priority to staffing new mills with existing manpower. As a result, during
1980-83 some 1,382 positions representing 10% of total job positions in
SEKA were eliminated, of which 913 positions were related to Izmit, 158 to
Afyon, 110 to Caycuma, 94 to Aksu, 67 to Dalaman and 40 positions were
related to SEKA Headquarters. During the same period, some 197 additional
hirings took place to cover the needs of the Balikesir mill which was
coming to full production. The net impact of these measures which amounts
to 36% higher productivity for SEKA's employees is shown in Annex 3-1 and
is summarized in the following table:

SEKA, have a broad mix of pulp and paper grades, ranges typically from
50 to 100 tpy/employee.

- 17 -
3.11      The deteriorating financial situation of SEKA over the period
1977-83 can clearly be seen from the above figures. Although total sales
revenue has increased consistently over this period both as a consequence
of increasing production volumes and prices, costs have been increasing at
a more rapid rate, resulting in gross profit margin (net sales minus cost
of goods sold) which has been erratic between 1977-1980, and gradually
declining in 1981-83. For the period as a whole, gross profit margin as a
percentage of sales averaged about 10X. However, for 1982 and 1983, it
averaged about 5%. The poor gross profit margin record is largely the
consequence of the slow and partial adjustment of product prices to
increasing input and conversion costs (paras 3.17 to 3.18), as well as low
capacity utilization and low operating efficiency.
3.12      SEKA had accumulated losses of about TL 30,515 million by the end
of 1983, largely as a result of price restraints, high financial charges
(representing 48% of the total loss in 1983) and other expenses such as
depreciation. The long-term debt to equity ratio improved from 98:2 in
1977 to 47:53 in 1983 largely as a result of the injection of additional
equity for the establishment of new mills and the revaluation of assets to
the extent of TL 28,409 million in 1983. The current ratio stayed
consistently below one over the period 1977-83 in spite of relatively
extensive restructuring and funding of liabilities undertaken by the
Government over the years. In summary, SEKA's financial position at the
end of 1983 was weak and unless effective measures were taken to result in
adequate profits and satisfactory financial ratios, the situation would
have deteriorated further.
F. Financial Restructuring
3.13      Without major restructuring, the decline of SEKA would continue
at an accelerating rate as current liabilities increase to cover the
operating deficit. Financial projections have been prepared on this basis
(Annexes 3-3 through 3-5), and are summarized in the following table:

a/ Numbers may not add due to rounding.
3.14      These projections indicate that without financial restructuring,
short-term borrowings over the next five years of about US$100 million
equivalent would be required to cover projected cash deficits, even though
the production from the new mills (Balikesir, Akdeniz and Kastamonu) would
be increasing.  Under these circumstances, debt-service coverage and the
current ratio would be inadequate, and the equity base would be eroded to
zero. Even with price increases (para 3.19), without major financial
restructuring, SEKA's financial position would remain unacceptable (e.g.
current ratio below 1.0).
3.15      In early 1983 the Government realized that largely due to past
controls on pricing, SEKA was in a serious financial situation, and
recognized that unless some major financial restructuring was undertaken,
SEKA's financial situation would quickly deteriorate, and SEKA's operations
could come to a stop. As a result, and as part of an overall
rehabilitation program for SEKA to make the Enterprise more competitive
both domestically and internationally, the Government had drawn up a
financial assistance plan involving a subscription to about
TL 12,000 million of SEKA's new equity through various measures of cash
injection and capitalization of outstanding treasury short term debts in
1983, and capitalization of some additional TL 835 million of long term
debt in 1984, along with provisions for revaluation of assets. In October
1983, the Bank's appraisal mission discussed the scope and impact of these



- 19 -
measures with the Government and estimated that SEKA needed about
US$100 million equivalent additional financial restructuring over and above
that already provided to restore an adequate level of liquidity. The
Government at that time acknowledged the need for additional restructuring
but no decision was made.
3.16      The present Government also recognized the gravity of SEKA's
financial situation and the need for additional financial restructuring,
and included SEKA in its plan for the restructuring of selected SEEs.
Under this plan, initiated in January 1984, as a decree law, certain debts
of selected SEEs to each other, to the Treasury and to the Central Bank are
to be consolidated and taken over by the Central Bank. This plan affected
significant portions of SEKA's debts, and some TL 39,195 million of SEKA's
debt in different categories was consolidated to a single liability and
converted to equity capital (or equivalent) from the Central Bank in
SEKA.31
G. SEKA's Prices and Pricing Policy
3.17      After 1980, Government control of SEE's selling prices was
discontinued except for certain basic necessities, which in SEKA's case
includes newsprint. Theoretically, SEKA has been free to set prices for
all other paper products. However, in spite of its semi-autonomy in
setting prices, SEKA has not had a well-defined pricing policy. SEKA's
stated practice has been that prices be set to recover manufacturing costs
plus a margin of about 2-10%, depending on the product, with due
consideration of CIF prices. Although stated by SEKA, this general rule,
in the past has not been applied consistently, as shown in Annex 3-6.
3.18      One of the serious difficulties with SEKA's price setting in the
past has been that increases have often been implemented with too large a
time lag and been insufficient to keep up with domestic inflation. To
illustrate, the recent price trends for three of SEKA' s main grades are
tabulated below.
31   The conversion amounts to about US$121 million of new equity by
reducing debts to trade creditors (US$28.8 million), treasury
(US$54.7 million), central bank (US$37.0 million), and other
short-term creditors (US$0.4 million).

a/  Source:  International Financial Statistics, IMF.
The table shows that, in spite of significant price increases In cur-rent
terms, for all three grades, there has been a steady decline of prices in
real terms for rnewsprint and sack paper of 11.2% and 8.2Z, respectively,
between July 1982 and July 1983, and of 10.5% for all grades between July
1983 and January 1984. Considering that the selected grades make up about
70% of SEKA's total output in 1983, the financial impact of the decline in
real prices is severe. Also, as illustrated in Annex 3-6 for the selected
grades, a decline in equivalent current prices in US dollar terms, as a
result of the declining value of the Turkish lira, has occurred during a
perLod when international paper prices, in current terms, have held steady
or Lacreased.
3.19      Clearly, SEKA's pricing policy has been a major issue affecting
both its short- and long-term viability. In early 1984, the Government
reaffirmed its policy to allow SEKA to set its own prices freely for all
the grades according to market conditions. The Government policy towards
SEEs is stated in Decree Law 233 (June 1984). However, in the Decree Law,
there is provision for Government intervention in price setting. In such
situations, the Decree Law stipulates that if the administered prices are
below cost, then the loss as well as unrealized profit will be compensated
through budgetary transfer, and the amount of unrealized profit will be set
by computing a 10% profit on the cost of goods sold. It is this Decree Law
that sets the broad outline of SEKA's new pricing policy. As a result, in
the first four months of 1984, SEKA has increased its prices by more than
40% across the board in two steps - 10% in January 1984 and 30% in April
1984. While new prices are well above those of December 1983, on average
they are substantially equal to import parity prices, but well below the
landed cost after addition of applicable duty and levies. Recently, as
protection against dumping, the Government has levied a new tax on various
imports in the form of a lump sum amount per ton, stated in dollars but
payable in local currenc_ (para 2.20).  In case of paper and paperboard
these amounts per ton are: newsprint US$70, sackpaper US$25, and printing
and writing US$125. The following table illustrates this comparison:

3.20      During negotiations SEKA's pricing policy was thoroughly
discussed and the following policies were enunciated by SEKA:  (i) SEKA's
prices are set in accordance with the provisions of Decree No. 233 of June
1984; and (ii) it is SERA's objective to produce efficiently, so as to be
in a position to set prices at levels which do not depend on protection
measures and are not increased unduly to cover high costs caused by
inefficient operations. It was agreed that the Bank and SEKA shall from
time to time, at the request of either party, exchange views with regard to
operational and pricing policies and measures to be taken for their
implementation. These arrangements provide a satisfactory basis for
guiding SEKA's pricing strategy.
3.21      The measures regarding financial restructuring and price
increases stated above have the effect of stabilizing the present financial
situation, and providing some assurance that future levels of profitability
will be satisfactory. Financial projections prepared on this basis
(without the proposed rehabilitation project) are contained in Annexes 3-7
through 3-9 and summarized in the following table:

add due to rounding.
3.22      While there remains a need for modest short-term borrowing in
1984, no further borrowing is required, and from 1985, debt-service
coverage and current ratios would exceed 1.5. Thus, SEKA would be in a
reasonable financial position and able to undertake the proposed
rehabilitation project.
