rehabilitate existing capacity in manufacturing enterprises\n            and explore the potential for selective privatization of\n            SEEs. The project would provide for rehabilitation of Aksu,\n            Dalaman and Afyon mills, as well as imported spare parts and\n            energy saving improvements for all of SEKA's (Turkish\n            Pulp and Paper Enterprise) mills. It would furthermore\n            strengthen SEKA's management structure and improve\n            operation and maintenance procedures through the provision\n            of technical assistance to SEKA. A review of the pulp and\n            paper subsector including a study of privatization\n            possibilities for SEKA would also be undertaken."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
