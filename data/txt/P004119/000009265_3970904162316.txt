METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT I/
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:       Republic of Korea
Beneficiary:    Industrial Sites and Water Resources Development Corporation
(ISWACO).
Amount:         $95.0 million equivalent, including the capitalized front-end
fee.
Terms:          Repayable in 15 years with 3 years of grace, at the standard
variable rate. ISWACO would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Projecc
Description:  The proposed project would provide 1.3 million metric tons per
day (mtpd) of water to 25 munici alities around Seoul City and
within the Metropolitan Region. 'This would improve water
service to about 5 million persons and provide the capacity to
serve 1.1 million additional persons by 1991.
The project would extract water from the Han river, upstream
of Seoul, to be treated in three treatment plants before
distribution to the municipalities. The project includes two
water intakes, three booster pumping stations, two treatment
plants, some 175 km of pipes (1,000 to 2,400 mm in diameter)
and 14 km of tunnels, and construction supervision. Studies
would be carried out to improve the organization of water and
sewerage services in the MetropoLitan Region, to establish
corporate planning within ISWACO and to set policies for bulk
water tariffs at a national level.
On completion of the project, assets and debt service
liabilities, plus a service charge of 0.05% p.a. would be
transferred to ISWACO.
Risks:          There are no special risks in the project.   The Government
has provided assurances that complementary works necessary to
utilize the water produced by the project would be completed
before the project is commissioned in 1988.
1/   The MetropoLitan Region includes the capitaL city of Seoul, the special
city of Incheon, and 38 other cities and towns, and many villages in the
Gyeonggi Province.

I. WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Korea's population in 1983 was 40 million.  Its population density
of almost 400 persons/sq km is one of the highest in the world; it is also one
of the most urbanized of the developing countries. The overall population
growth rate has decreased from 3% in 1960 to about 1.5% at present. The urban
population in the 187 largest municipalities, which represents 60% of the
total, has been increasing by 5% p.a. or about three times the estimated
growth rate of the total population. By the end of the century, the popula-
tion living in municipalities of more than 50,000 inhabitants is expected to
include about 80% of the total population. This rapid urbanization, equiva-
lent to doubling the urban population every 14 years, has stretched all urban
services, especially water supply. Coupled with accelerated industrial growth
and the relatively low priority given to the sector earlier, this has resulted
in a decline in the quality of the environment and water shortages with
rationing in many cities. Since the 1970s, the Government has given increased
priority to social services. which has resulted in significant improvements in
the water supply and sanitation sectors and contributed to improvements in
public health. Waterborne diseases have declined steadily since 1971. The
crude death rate declined from 13 to 7 per thousand persons between 1960-81,
while life expectancy increased from 53 to 66 years in this period.
Sector Organization
1.02      There is no single agency in charge of overall planning and
programming of che sector. At the Central Government level, four Ministries
are directly invoLved in the sector with some overlapping responsibilities
(Chart 1). The Ministry of Construction (MOC), the main agency for the
sector, through its Water Resources and Urban Planning Bureaus, is responsible
for the planning, design and construction of major water and sewerage works
and for collecting hydrological data, issuing licenses for abstraction of
water from the major rivers and planning multipurpose dams. The Industrial
Sites and Water Resources Development Corporation (ISWACO), a semi-autonomous
public corporation under MOC, is responsible for the operation of buLk water
systems serving groups of municipalities and for the development of multi-
purpose dams. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), through its Local Finance
Bureau, oversees the operation of municipal Water Bureaus (WBs), including the
approval of bonds, loans and tariffs and the expansion of distribution and
storage facilities. The WBs are semi-autonomous organizations, responsible
for the design, construction and operation cf water works under the municipal
governments. They maintain separate budgets and accounts of revenues and
expenditures. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) is responsi-
ble for setting standards, and controlling the quality of drinking water and
for implementing rural water supply programs. The Office of che Environment
(OOE), under MOHSA, sets standards for pollution control and regulates and
coordinates pollution control activities. The OOE aLso has to approve, under
powers vested in it by the Environmental Preservation Law, projects which have
an important impact on the environment. Finally, the Economic Planning Board
(EPB) sets guidelines for tariff increases through its Price Policy Bureau and
allocates counterpart funds for MOC's foreign funded projects.



-2-
Sector Financing and Tariffs
1.03      Investments in production and distribution of bulk water supplies to
municipalities under regional arrangements are financed by MOC budgets and
foreign loans. Such projects after completion are handed o-zer to ISWACO for
operation and maintenance and ISWACO also assumes debt service liabilities.
ISWACO bulk water tariffs are approved by MOC and EPB and are the same
country-wide. About 25-40% of the investments by municipal WBs are financed
by funds budgeted by MOC, and provided to the WBs as loans, at commercial
rates, through the Korea Development Bank (KDB).  The balance of investment
funds required is provided by the WBs' internal generation (15-35%), by sales
of municipal bonds (20-40%), and foreign loans. EPB provides guidelines for
maximum annual tariff increases which reflect macroeconomic policies, and MOHA
approves the water tariffs set by the municipalities. Although there is not
an explicit tariff policy, water tariffs have generally been sufficient to
cover operation, maintenance, debt service and some contribution to capital
investments. In the rural sector, a successful rural water supply program,
scheduled for completion in 1986, is being implemented with the provincial
governments, the villages and MOHSA each financing one third of the costs.
Sewerage is financed from municipal revenues and Government and foreign
loans. Sewerage tariffs are presently levied in the three largest cities,
with all cities scheduled to start levying sewerage tariffs, varying from 20-
50% of water tariffs, from 1985.
Service Levels
1.04      About 55% of Korea's population was served by piped water in 1980,
compared with 17% in 1960 and 33% in 1970. Service levels are better (83%) in
larger cities, where high population densities and polluted aquifers leave no
alternative to publicly supplied water. However, many municipalities suffer
from restricted supply, water rationing and frequent low pressure. The
quality of treated water is uneven. Water produced by municipal systems
averages about 260 liters per capita per day (lpcd), of which about half is
for industrial, commercial and government consumption. However, 20-50% of the
water produced is unaccounted-for, with leakage being a major factor. In an
effort to reduce water losses, many municipalities are now implementing leak
detection and control programs, including rehabilitation of older distribution
networks supported through two ongoing Bank-financed projects, (para. 1.09).
1.05      Only 8% of the dwellings use sewerage systems, the rest use septic
tanks, privies and night soil collection systems.  Mos. of the wastewater from
residential and in.ustrial premises is discharged untreated or partiaLly
treated into street drains. This, combined with high leakage and the possi-
bility of infiltration, exposes distribution systems to the risk of contamina-
tion. Increased emphasis is now being given to sewerage and waste disposal
(para. 1.06) which is resulting in some improvements. Seoul and Busan, the
two largest cities, and several other municipalities have established combined
sewerage systems and night soil treatment plants serving about one third of
their populations. The OOE and the municipalities are also enforcing
pollution control measures on industry and commerce in an effort to improve
the quality of receiving waters and to clean up the environment.



-3-
Sector Development
1.06      Sector investments in 1983 prices increased from $218 million in the
Third Plan (1972-76), to $530 million in the Fourth Plan (1977-81) and is
forecast to reach $1,442 million for the Fifth Plan (1982-86), with about half
being Government expenditures. Government objectives during the Fifth Plan
include preservation of water quality, replacement of obsolete equipment, and
expansion and construction of new sewerage and water supply systems and treat-
ment plants. The target for 1986 is to increase the population served by
piped water from 55% to 70%. Given the high rate of urban population growth,
maintaining even the present coverage requires substantial investments. The
Fifth Plan provides for a number of environmental pollution abatement measures
including an Environmental Master Plan Study of the Han River Basin (completed
in 1984), expansion of combined sewerage systems and the building of night
soil and sewage treatment plants in some 100 cities and towns. Government
plans to increase the percentage of population served by sewage treatment
plants from 6% to 35% and sewage treatment capacity from 0.5 million metric
tons per day (mtpd) to 8 million mtpd during the period 1980-1991. Sanitation
investments in the Fifth Plan are estimated at $800 million in 1982 prices.
Sectoral Issues and Constraints
1.07      The main sectoral issues, on which a dialogue has been established
with the Government through the first two water supply projects (Loans 2072-KO
and 2350-K0), approved in 1981 and 1983 respectively, are summarized below:
(a) Financial. At present Korea does not have a well-developed system
for mobilizing and allocating resources to the sector. Although water supply
projects require lengthy construction periods and do not reach their full
capacity until several years after commissioning, the investment funds avail-
able to most municipalities are short-term bonds, internal cash generation and
annually approved Government contributions. This results in project invest-
ments with relatively short design horizons being favored, while high priority
and more cost-effective, but longer-term investments are delayed for many
years. This could be improved with the establishment of financial mechanisms
(para. 1.09) that would give water bureaus access to long-term finance. The
lack of financial criteria for setting WBs' tariffs and ISWACO's bulk water
tariffs also creates uncertainty about their capacity to assume debt service
liabilities and finance long-term project investments. On the other hand,
some projects are financed by grants from Covernment even when they could
generate sufficient revenues to service debts. ISWACO's bulk water tariffs
for treated and raw water have a national impact and affect many municipal-
ities. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that a country-wide study
of the bulk water tariff policy for raw and treated water would be undertaken
by ISWAGO, in consultation with the Bank, and presented to the Bank for
comments not later than June 30, 1986. This study would be implemented and
financed by ISWACO in coordination with EPB and MOC.
(b)  Deficient Organization of Interurban Areas.  The WBs are generally
well operated and maintained. However, municipal water systems are indepen-
dently planned and operated even after growth has resulted in several
contiguous municipaLities becoming physically integrated. The main problem in



-4-
this regard is in the Metropolitan Region (para. 2.01). The Bank has advo-
cated the establishment of a better organization (for example a Water Autho-
rity), for the MetropoLitan Region. This would increase service efficiency,
eliminate unfairness in the access to water or sewerage services, eliminate
duplication of investments and reduce dependence on Government grants. An
initiative has already been taken by MOHA which has engaged the Korea Public
Administration Research Institute to prepare a feasibility study of the organ-
ization of water supply services country-wide, including the Metropolitan
Region. This study would review the feasibility of establishing a Water
Authority for this Region. After the feasibility study is completed in 1984,
it would be submitLed to the concerned Ministries and the Bank for
discussion. The reorganization of water and sewerage services is a sensitive
political issue, particularly for the largest municipalities in the Region.
Quick decisions and changes should not therefore be expected. MOHA would,
after consensus has been reached, have to undertake a detailed study to
implement the conclusions of the feasibility study for the Metropolitan
Region. Terms of Reference for these studies have been discussed with the
Bank (details in Project File) and assurances have been obtained that these
studies would be completed and would be made available to the Bank for
comments not later than December 31, 1986.
(c) Fragmentation of Responsibilities. The fragmentation of responsi-
bilities among four Ministries (Chart 1) has resulted in a lack of coordina-
tion in sector planning, leading to a duplication of efforts in certain areas
and the neglect of other activities. This also results in difficulties in
preparing or financing projects, and in imbalances between the expansion of
production capacity and the construction of distribution facilities. An
Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) was established under Loan 2072-KO to dis-
cuss these problems and improve coordination gradually (para. 1.10). It is
expected that the work of IMC will be strengthened after the recent decision
to include EPB in its deliberations.
(d) Scarce Water Resources. A major difference between Korea and many
other countries is the lack of adequate water sources. Per capita surface
water runoff is only about 1,700 cu m or about 40% and 12% of the respective
values in Japan and the United States. Since two thirds of the annual pre-
cipitation of 1,160 mm occurs during the rainy season from July to September,
increased water demand requires the construction of multipurpose dams to store
water and regionaL water transmission systems. These regional systems require
long transmission pipelines and expensive pumping. The cost of these regional
systems is also increasing rapidly due to the shortage of suitable dam sites,
increasing land compensation costs, and long transmission pipelines. It is
now very important, therefore, to improve the planning and utilization of
water resources, especially for the four largest rivers - Han, Nagdong, Geum
and Yongsan - the basins of which contain 70% of the industry and urban popu-
lation of Korea. These plans wouLd include the implementation of water con-
servation programs in the municipalities, master plans for and controls over
the allocation and use of water in the rivers and adequate pricing policies,
close to the marginal cost, to discourage water wastage and help curtail water
demand.



5-
(e) Independent Water and Sewerage Organizations. Both at the central
level in MOC, and at the municipal level, the responsibitliry for water and
sewerage rests with two separate Bureaus. Increasing urban population and
density, higher water consumption, and industrialization now require a large
effort to improve sewerage services and reduce pollution. A better integra-
tion and planning of the two services has been recommended by the Bank to the
IMC. Specific proposals by MOC and MOHA to achieve this are presently under
consideration by Government.
(f) Air and Water Pollution. High population density, increased owner-
ship of vehicles, the use of coal for heating and especially the wasces gener-
ated by Korea's rapid industrialization, result in a deterioration of air and
water quality. The Government enacted the Environmental Preservation Law in
1981 and the OOE and the municipalities are starting coi'ntrywide programs for
sewage treatment and control of industrial air and water pollution.
Bank Objectives and Lending in the Sector
1.08      The Bank's objectives in the sector are to:  (a) promote adequate
and reliable water and sanitation services and improved environmental condi-
tions; (b) ensure that the benefits of water and sanitation reach the poor, by
the extension of the coverage for these services and the implementation of
affordable tariffs; (c) help strengthen sector institutions and improve their
coordination; (d) develop a solid financial basis for the sector, including
cost recovery through better pricing policies and access to long-term financ-
ing; and (e) optimize and improve the efficiency of the use of water resour-
ces. The Bank liaises closely with other international agencies supporting
this sector, in particular with ADB (which is financing several sewerage works
and some water supply works); OECF (which is financing severaL sewage treat-
ment plants); and WNDP (which is assisting in pollution control programs).
1.09      Direct Bank involvement with the water supply sector in Korea is
very recent. The First Water Supply Project (Loan 2072-KO, approved in 1981),
is financing the expansion of the water supply systems in five cities (Daegu,
Gwangju, Masan, Changweon and Jinhae). The project is being executed
smoothly, and four cities have already completed their works. MOC has, based
on information available on manpower in the water sector and on training
needs, prepared a training program to be implemented in 1985-86 under this
project. Additional training programs for the sector will be based on further
studies envisaged under the current, ADB financed, Small Towns Water Supply
Project. The Second Water Supply Project. (Loan 2350-KO, approved in October
1983), is aimed at increasing water availability for municipalities in the
Nagdong basin and is progressing satisfactorily. Both of these projects have
contributed significantly to strengthening sector institutions and addressing
some of the key constraints to sector deveLopment discussed in the previous
paragraph. Programs to introduce accrual accounting using microcomputers, and
to apply appropriate leakage control technology for WBs are being implemented
under Loan 2350-KO. A study for the establishment of an Urban Fund to finance
urban development including municipal water supply projects is being prepared
under the Jeonju Regional Project (Loan 2388-KO approved in 1984).

1.10      As part of the sector .dialogue and at the request of the Government,
the Bank prepared, in late 1983, a paper analyzing recomnuendations to improve
sector coordination which is being discussed by the IMC established under the
First Water SuppLy Project. This is a complex issue that will take time to
resolve. MOC and EPB have, during discussions on this project, agreed to play
a more active roLe in the IMC, which would now be chaired by MOC's Director
General of Water Resources. ihe proposed projecc would also allow the
continuation of this dialogue with Government and the main sector institutions
and the gradual implementation of sector reforms as explained in para. 1.07.
r1. THE WATER DEMAND
The MetropoLitan Region
2.01      The proposed project would provide raw and treated water in bulk to
25 municipalities in the Metropolitan Region situated in the northwest part of
the country (Map IBRD 18420). The Metropolitan Region has an area of about
3,000 sq km, and includes che capital city of Seoul, the special city of
Incheon (the first and fourth largest cities in Korea), and 38 other cities
and towns, and many villages in the Gyeonggi Province. The population of the
region was 15 million in 1983, or about 37Z of the country's population
(compared with 21% in 1960, Graph 2.1) of whom about 9.2 million lived in
Seoul City. The povulation growth in the Region has been extremely high (4.9Z
p.a.) during the last 20 years, compared with the growth rate of 2.1% for the
whole country with some cities growing at up to 20% p.a. (TabLe 2.1). The
economy of the Metropolitan Region has grown very rapidly, with the gross
regional product increasing by almost 13Z p.a. in the 1970s. This was the
result of the rapid growth of the industrial and mining sectors, and the
expansion of services associated with the Central Gcvernment. The Government
is making efforts to curtail rapid growth, especially in Seoul City, through
inter alia fiscal incentives for decentralization and zoning limitations.
Seoul City's growth has slowed down to 3% p.a., and other satellite munici-
palities, which are the focus of the Project, have been developed. The popu-
lation of the 25 municipalities included in the proposed project (Annex 3)
grew at 7.1Z p.a. during the last 10 years, with four municipalities recording
annual growth rates of over 1OZ.
2.02      The appraisal projections assume that Government's plans to slow
down the growth of Seoul and of some cities in the Metropolitan Region would
be achieved gradually, (see detailed population and demand projections in
Annex 3). The population growth of the 27 municipalities, served by the pro-
posed Project and the two existing regional water supply systems, which had a
population of 12.9 million persons in 1983, is projected to slow down from
4.7Z p.a. during the last 10 years to 3.1% between 1983-88, and 2.3% p.a.
between 1989-96. Under alternative projections the Metropolitan Region could
become one of the largest metropolises in the worLd with the population
reaching 18 to 21 million by the end of the centuey.

Levels of Service
2.03      Access co water services in the Metropolitan Region is uneven, with
96Z of Seoul City but only 74Z of the population in the other 39 cities and
towns having house connections. Moreover, there are several towns and
villages without piped water supply. The proposed project focuses on the
municipalities around Seoul City    w which are less developed and poorer.
Existing facilities and water supply statistics for 1981 and 1983 (water
connections, volume produced and sold, distribution networks, tariffs and
costs) for 40 cities and towns in the region are presented in Annex 1, with
details in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
2.04      Water production in the Metropolitan Region in 1983 reached
1,361 million metric tons (mt). The population served was 12 million persons
(89%). MOC and MOHA plan to increase the population served in the 25 project
municipalities from 77% in 1983 to 92Z by 1991 (Annex 3, Table 2). During the
1/   Seoul can extract additional water directly from the Han River upstream
of the city. Seoul is building additional intake and treatment facili-
ties for 1.3 million mtpd, to cover, from this source, its water demand
until the mid-1990s.

last few years, demand exceeded the water production capacity, resulting in
water rationing and low pressures. This has been a cause of serious conflict
among the various cities served by the two existing regional systems. Given
the rapid population and industrial growth of the region, these water short-
ages would continue to increase until the proposed Project is completed. This
explains the priority given to the Project by Governmenc, and the efforts to
have the propo;ed Project completed before end-1988.
Regional Water Supply Systems
2.05      The Han river provides 98Z of the water used in the Metropolitan
Region. Most of this water (60% or 2.6 million mtpd) is provided by the two
regional water supply systems constructed by MOC between 1978 and 1981. The
first system was financed by ADB and the second by the Government. These
regional systems, which basically consist of transmission pipelines
(Map IBRD 18420), extract good quality water at Paldang Dam, upstream of Seoul
on the Han River, and distributes it in bulk to the municipalities. This
water is needed, even by municipalities near the Han River, because of the
poor river water quality downstream of Seoul (Annex 2, Table 1). These two
systems are operated by ISWACO and provide bulk raw water to Seoul, Incheon
and another six municipalities, and treated water to the industrial city of
Banweol. The proposed project is the third of these regional systems and
would provide bulk water to 25 municipalities which lack other satisfactory
water sources.
Sanitation Services
2.06      The Metropolitan Region is satisfaccorily served by nightsoil
collection services and treatment plants, septic tanks and individual sewage
treatment facilities for newer development areas, and combined storm and waste
water drains (Annex 2, Table 2 shows details of existing facilities).
Sanitary sewers and sewage treatment facilities serve only about 20% of the
population of Seoul City. Garbage collection and disposal facilities operated
by the municipalities are also satisfactory. The project municipalities
maintain a high standard of public sanitation in their areas.
Water Consumption
2.07      The total water consumption in 1982 was 752 milLion mt or about 47
cu m per month per connection. The main demand is domestic (55Z), followed by
commercial and industrial (35%) and public and others (1O%). The total per
capita water consumption for the Metropolitan Region has doubled in the last
13 years and averages 173 lpcd, but the domestic consumption (100 Ipcd) is low
compared with cities of similar size or income. The feasibility study for the
Project assumes that per capita water consumption would go up to 280 lpcd by
1996 to meet: (a) present unsatisfied demand due to rationing; (b) increases
in demand due to rising standards of living, e.g. more extensive use of flush
toilets (presently used by only 42% of the population), private baths (public
baths are presently used by 70Z of the population), and water consuming
appliances like dish and clothes washing machines; and (c) increasing indus-
trial and commerciaL demand. The appraisal demand projections are more
conservative (Annex 3, Tables I to 6) and assume a gradual increase in water

demand, with a maximum of 230 Lpcd in the larger cities and 180 lpcd in the
other municipalities by 1996. A fourth regional system (with a capacity
similar to the proposed project) would, under these projections, be needed by
1994 (rather that by 1992, as projected in the feasibility report).
2.08      Unaccounted-for water at 48% is a major problem for Seoul City,
which has many old pipelines, some dating from 1908. Seoul is now starting to
implement leak detection and rehabilitation programs. Bucheon and Incheon,
(financed by the Second Water Supply Project, Loan 2350-KO), are in the pro-
cess of selecting consultants to correct this problem; they have targeted
reduction of unaccounted-for water from about 35% to less than 30Z by 1987.
The unaccounted-for wacer for the 25 municipalities included-in the proposed
Project is reported at 31%, but production metering is not reliable, and the
unaccounted-for water may be higher. Bank experience shows that the reduction
in unaccounted-for water is a slow and difficult process. Under the appraisal
projections, the unaccounted-for water for the municipalities included in the
project would average 30Z by 1988, and would stabilize at about 27%
thereafter.
Production Capacity
2.09      Under the appraisal projections, the total water needed by the
Project's municipaLities would go from 674,000 mtpd in 1983 to 1.235 million
mtpd by 1988 and 1.687 million mtpd by 1991 (Annex 3, Table 3). These projec-
tions include the water demand of three special industrial development zones
(Incheon, Banweol and Pyeongtaek) which have a high priority in Government
development pLans. About 20% of the project capacity would be needed in these
areas by 1996. These areas are being promoted under the Basic Development
Plan for the Metropolitan Region (available in the project file), approved by
the Cabinet on June 23, 1984.  The development of water supply, as provided by
the Project, is essential to the success of the Government's plans, which seek
to channel the Region's growth to designated areas in the Metropolitan
Region. These areas, in addition to the three industrial zones, include the
cities of Songtan and Banweol (served by the Project) and three districts,
(Pyeongtaek, Hwasung and Anseong).
2.10      Some of the project municipalities are developing additional produc-
tion facilities for about 230,000 mtpd which would avoid major water shortaRes
until the the Project enters into operation by end-1988. The project capacity
of 1.3 mtpd is based on peak water demand in 1994, excluding existing or
planned water production capacity at that time. The water allocated to each
municipality, based on these projections, would be contracted with ISWACO.
Since 84% of the water supplied by the Project would be treated, the system
would be able to accommodate variations in the demand between municipalities
by diverting supplies where needed, without unused treatment capacity in
individual plants. Pumping capacity would be staged and additional units
would be added when needed. The population, water demand and capacity provi-
ded by the project are shown in Annex 3, Table 4 to 6, and in Graphs 2.1 and
2.2, and are summarized in Table 2.2 for the year 1991:

III. THE PROJECT
Project Origin and Formulation
3.01      The proposed project is an important part of Government plans to
upgrade and expand water services. The project was first identified in 1981
during che preparation of the First Water Supply Project (Ln. 2072-KO). The
feasibiLity study was financed by this loan, and carried out by a consultant
joint venture between Nihon Suido (Japan) and Korea Engineering Consultants
Corporation (KECC). The study, completed in 1983, recommended the construc-
tion of a raw water transmission system with individual municipalities con-
structing and operating their own treatment facilities. This followed tradi-
tional practices adopted for the two previous bulk water systems in the
Region. The Bank, however, recommended the construction of a mainly treated
water system, with only three jointly operated treatment plants, providing
water to groups of municipalities because such a system would be more
economical to build and operate, and would lay the foundation for development
of an integrated regional water system. After extensive discussions, the
Government accepted the Bank's recommendations, which now form the basis for
the proposed project. The initial feasibility report included 0.5 million
mtpd for SeouL City. However, the Han River Development Project and recent
improvements in river water quality (Annex 2) now provide a more economic
source and routing for Seoul's water needs. Therefore, the project excludes
Seoul City, which is constructing additional water systems for 1.3 million
mtpd, which would satisfy economically its water demand until the mid-1990s.
The Project was appraised in June-July 1984.



- 12 -
Project Objectives
3.02      The project is an integrated solution for the water needs of
municipalities within the Region which do not have other water sources. The
objectives of the project are to:
(a)  reLieve water shortages and expand the water supply to satisfy the
residential and industria1 needs of 25 municipalities in the Metro-
politan Region, thus improving services to 5 million persons and
providing bulk water for 1.1 million additional persons by 1991;
(b)  establish the basis for an integrated treated water system;
(c)  improve the efficiency of water services in the Metropolitan Region;
and
(d)  strengthen the organization of ISWACO, and provide a more rational
poLicy and criteria for nationwide tariffs for raw and Ereated bulk
water supply.
Bank involvement in this project has already resulted in the adoption of a
more economic and better technical alternative for a major capital invest-
ment. The project would lay the physical and institutional basis for develop-
ing an integrated metropolitan system. It would also provide a vehicle for
continued dialogue with key Ministries (paras. 1.08-1.10) to improve sector
coordination and efficiency.
Project Description
3.03      The proposed project, the third bulk water supply system in the
Metropolitan Region, would extract water from the Han River, which would, upon
completion in 1985 of the Chungju Dam, have sufficient water to satisfy demand
at least up to the year 2000. The proposed project would provide 1.3 million
mcpd of water to 25 municipalities around Seoul City and within the Metropo-
litan Region (Map IBRD 18420). The Project (see details in Annex 4) includes
the constructing and equipping of:
(a)  a main water intake and booster pumping station for 1,200,000 mtpd
at Paldang, water transmission pipelines about 11 km long and
2,200 mm in diameter and three tunnels 6.5 km long and 3,800 mm in
diameter, delivering water to three water systems described in (b),
(c) and (d) below;
(b)  the Incheon water system serving five municipalities to the west and
including a booster pumping station 560,000 mtpd capacity and water
transmission pipelines 29 km long and 2,400 mm to 1,650 mm in
diameter, and three tunnels 6.5 km long and 3,000 mm in diameter
(the treatment plant for this system would be built, owned and
operated by these municipalities);



- 13 -
(c) the Seongnam treated water system serving ten municipalities to the
south and including a water treatment plant of 425,000 mtpd
capacity, a booster pump station, and a treated water transmission
pipeline about 48 km long and 1,800 mm to 1,350 mm in diameter;
(d) about 215,000 mcpd raw water supply to three municipalities and the
new Banweol development area;
(e) the Euijeongbu treated water system serving six municipalities to
the north and including an independent water intake from the Han
River, a water treatment plant of 100,000 mtpd capacity, a booster
pumping station; a treated water transmission pipeline about 24 km
long and 1,100 mm to 900 mm in diameter and a tunnel 1.0 km long and
2,200 mm in diameter; and
(f) technical assistance for Project construction, design, supervision
and management.
3.04      During project execution, studies would be carried out to:
(a) improve the organization of water and sewerage services in the
Metropolitan Region; (b) establish corporate planning within ISWACO; and
Cc) set policies for bulk water tariffs at a national level (see Annex 13).
Complementary Works
3.05      Six large project cities, (Incheon, Seongnam, Suweon, Banweol,
Bucheon and Gwangmyeong), and the Pyeongtaek development area would use about
80% of the water supplied by the Project. These cities, with consultant
supporc, are preparing Master Plans and staged programs for improvements and
expansions c  existing distribution systems.  Incheon, Bucheon and Gwangmyeong
would construct a jointly owned treatment plant with ADB financing. Other
beneficiary municipalities in the Region have also prepared feasibility
studies to utilize the water supplied by the project. These expansion
programs, which are part of each municipality's own development plan are
adequate, are being coordinated by MO{A and are planned for implementation
between 1985 and 1988 (Annex 7). Implementation would cost about W95 billion
and would be financed from internal revenues, bonds and loans. The project
municipalities would increase their coverage from 77% in 1983 to about 92% by
1991 with the population connected rising from 2.8 million to 5.2 million
persons in the same period. Distribution expansions and treatment plants have
been implemented satisfactorily in the previous two bulk water supply systems,
with the water capacity provided being fully utilized in less than four years.
Assurances were obtained from the Government during loan negotiations that not
later than December 31, 1988: (a) Incheon, Bucheon and Gwangmyeong would
complete the construction of a jointly owned treatment plant; and (b) all
project municipalities, coordinated by MOHA, would expand their distribution
systems, to use the water supplied by the project.

Project Cost
3.06      The cost of the project, including physical and price contingencies,
is estimated at W 191.2 billion ($252.1 million) of which W 78.0 billion
($103.2 million) or about 41Z is the foreign exchange component. Taxes and
duties are estimated at about $11.5 million equivalent. The base cost is
expressed in January 1985 prices. The Project is in an advanced stage of
detai'ed engineering and cost estimates are based on detailed designs, MOC's
annually updated rates and prices for estimating similar works and the award
for the first civil works contract. Physical contingencies have been
estimated at 1OX of total base cost. The studies on Bulk Water Tariffs and
the organization of the Metropolitan water supply systems are being financed
locally. Expected price increases over the project period amount to about 17%
of total base costs pLus physical contingencies. Price increases for foreign
costs were estimated at 8% for 1985 and 9% for 1986-88. Government efforts to
curtail inflation are likely to hold local inflation somehow below these
levels, and price increases for local costs were estimated at 2.Z) for 1985
and 5.5% for 1986-88. For the calculation of price contingencies, it is
assumed that exhange rate adjustments will, on the average, be made to
maintain "purchasing power parity" during the project implementation period.
The Project Cost Summary is shown in Table 3.1 and detailed project cost
estimates in Annex 5.
Financing Plan
3.07      The proposed Bank loan of $95.0 million, including the capitalized
front-end fee of $0.2 million, would finance 39.5% of total project costs
excluding taxes, or about 35.7% of the gross costs of $266.3 million,
including interest during construction ($14.2 million). Government equity
would finance $171.3 million (64.3Z). The financing plan was reviewed during
loan negotiations and Government contributions were confirmed, including W 20
billion for 1985. On project completion, assets and debt service liabilities
would be transferred to ISWACO.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.08      Procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in
Table 3.2. All civil works are grouped in four contract packages (ranging
from $13 million to $50 million) to be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) after prequalification. Due to the highly competi-
tive construction industry in Korea, local contractors are expected to win
most of the civil works contracts. All equipment and materials procurements
(pipes and fittings, pumps and motors, and treatment plant, electrical,
control and ancillary equipment) would be packaged into about seven contracts
(ranging from $2 million to $30 million) to be awarded through ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. However, a provision has been made that
urgently needed goods, as agreed with the Bank, estimated to cost the
equivalent of $0.25 million per contract, and aggregating not more than the
equivaLent of $5 million, may be procured by local competitive bidding, in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank. A preference margin of
the lowest of import taxes or 15% of the c.i.f. zalue, in accordance with Bank
guidelines, would be granted to domestic manufacturers in bid evaluation.

100% of value of civil works and over 93% of value of materials and equipment
contracts will be subject to prior Bank review. Advance contracting would be
allowed because of the need to start construction of the water intake during
the 1984 dry season to avoid delay in project completion. The Bank has made
it clear that advance contracting would be undertaken at Government's risk and
Bank financing would be contingent on the Board's approval of the project.
Consultants for project supervision have been selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines.

/a   Figures in parentheses are respective amounts financed by Bank loan.
3.09      The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 40% of
civil works contracts; (b) 100% of ex-factory local expenditures and 100% of
foreign expenditures for materiaLs and equipment; and (c) 55Z of cost of
consulting services. Disbursements under contracts for equipment and
materials costing $100,000 equivalent or less each will be made on the basis
of statements of expenditure. Documentation will be retained by the Project
Unit and reviewed by Bank s5-&- sion missions.  All other disbursements will
be fully documented.  A SpeLt   Account of $1.5 million will be established to
facilitate loan disbursements against eligible expenditures incurred. Given
the advanced stage of project preparation and scheduling of civil works
contracts, including advance contracting, and Government priority to complete
the project before end-1988, disbursements of the proposed loan are expected
to take four and a half years, somewhat faster than the average time indicated
by the country disbursement profile, but in line with the experience of the
First Water SuppLy Project. The estimated disbursement profile is shown in
Annex 6. The closing date for the loan would be December 31, 1989.

Project Implementation
3.10      The project would be impLemented by a Project Unit designated for
this purpose under MOC's Seoul Regional Construction and Management Agency
(RCMA). The Project Unit in Seoul would be managed by a Director and two
Assistant Directors. The Project Unit has already been designated and the
Director and key staff are in place (para. 4.04). The project would be
coordinated by MOC's Director-General Water Resources, who would also provide
close liaison with the Bank (Chart 1). Consultants would assist the Project
Unit in construction supervision. MOC has considerable experience in
implementing large foreign assisted projects (para. 4.03).
3.11      The project is in an advanced stage of preparation, final design for
two of the four civil works contracts have been completed and the remainder
would be completed before June 1985. The project would be implemented between
August 1984 and December 1988 (Chart 3). The first contract, for which
bidding documents were reviewed by the Bank, was awarded in November 1984,
following ICB procedures. The project cost was revised in accordance with the
results of this bid. Land acquisition and compensation for the project,
involving acquisition of some 90 ha of right-of-way, is proceeding
satisfactorily. The responsibility for land acquisition, engineering, bid
evaluation, and construction supervision would rest with the Project Unit ard
the consultants. Bidding and contract award would be the responsibility of
the Office of Supply (OSROK), the main Government procurement agency which has
wide experience in both LCB and ICB procurement. The buLk water tariff study
and ISWACO's financial management study would be financed and implemented by
ISWACO through local consultants. The study of the organization of water and
sewerage services in the Metropolitan Region is being financed and implemented
by MOHA with the assistance of the Korea Public Administration Research
Institute. The municipalities would implement the complementary works (Annex
7) with the assistance of local consultants. MOHA's Local Finance Division
would coordinate, arrange financing and provide support for these municipal
programs (para. 3.05).
Consulting Services
3.12      Consulting services for feasibility studies and final design were
financed from Loan 2072-KO (First Water Supply Project).  KECC, with support
from Nihon Suido (Japan), was selected in accordance with Bank procedures.
They have extensive domestic and international experience in water supply
works.  KECC would provide abouc 30 man-months of foreign consultants, and
about 520 man-months of local consultants which would be needed for the
construction supervision. MOC appointed an expert Design Review Panel (DRP),
consisting of two water supply specialists, to advise on technical problems
encountered in the project. The DRP has reviewed the feasibility studies and
preliminary designs. Their racommendations have been incorporated in the
final designs. ISWACO will participate in the review of the final design and
operation arrangements.

Operation and Maintenance
3.13      The Project facilities, other than the treatment plants which may be
operated by the municipalities, would be operated and maintained by ISWACO.
ISWACO has considerable experience in the operation and maintenance of bulk
water supply systems. Besides the two existing bulk water systems in the
Metropolitan Region, ISWACO also operates and maintains seven other regional
systems in the country (para. 4.05).
Environmental Aspects
3.14      The Project serves the main conurbation in Korea and would improve
the environment and living conditions of the population. About 92% of the
population is served satisfactorily by septic tanks and nightsoil disposal
systems and combined waste and storm water drains. Annex 2, Table 2, gives
details of sanitation facilities in the Metropolitan Region. Presently the
project municipalities have a higher level of sanitation than those of
comparable size in other developing countries. The Government has also
started implementing programs to deal with sewerage, sewage and nightsoil
treatment and pollution control based on the Environmental Master Plan Study
of the Han River Basin, completed by consultants in 1984. MOHA has prepared a
master investment plan for providing interceptor sewers and treatment facili-
ties in all 49 cities (except Seoul) and 187 towns in the country, to be
implemented between 1984-91. This plan, costed at W 243 billion, will be
financed out of sewerage tariffs (to be levied in these municipalities
starting in 1985) and government and foreign loans. Nineteen of the project
municipalities would be included in and benefit from this program. Four of
the largest cities, Incheon, Bucheon, Anyang and Gwangmyeong, bordering Seoul
City, would also benefit from the large scale improvement works under the
comprehensive Han River Development Project being implemented by Seoul City.
These include the training and deepening of the main river (which will have an
additionaL dry weather flow of about 100 cu m per sec after completion of the
Chungju Dam in 1985) and construction of about 200 km of interceptor sewers
along both banks of the Han River and its main tributaries. This project,
estimated to cost over $600 million, would be completed by 1986. Four sewage
treatment plants are also planned (two are under construction) for completion
in stages by 1996, to provide adequate treatment for dry weather flows from
these interceptors before discharge into the Han River. When completed in
1986, the sewer interceptors will contribute to reducing the pollution of the
main water courses draining the densely populated project areas to the south
of the Han River. Garbage collection and disposal services are satisfac-
tory. OOE has also started programs to control industrial waste pollution of
the waterways and atmosphere by establishment of effluent and emission
standards and monitoring systems and an Environmental Fund (Annex 2). All
these measures would result in a gradual improvement of the environmental
conditions in the project area.

IV. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
The Borrower
4.01      The Project would be implemented by MOC.  After completion, project
assets and liabilities would be transferred te ISWACO. However, during
project construction, the Government would analyze the benefits of transfer-
ring the operation, together with the assets and liabilities, of the two
treatment plants to be built under the Project, to a joint organization of the
benefi:iary municipalities. Organization arrangements for joint ownership and
operation under the municipalities could be the same as for the treatment
plant serving Incheon, Bucheon and Gwangmyeong. Organization for the latter
has been studied by consultants under a technical assistance grant from ADB.
In any case however, ISWACO would own and operate the main bulk water system
and transmission pipelines, which represents 93% of the project cost.
4.02      The borrower would be the Government which would relend the Bank
loan to ISWACO. Assurances were obtained that a Transfer and Operations
Agreement, a draft of which will be presented to the Bank for comments by
December l, 1987, would be signed with ISWACO prior to completion of
proJectL.-   Relending terms and conditions would be the same as for the Bank
loan plus a 0.05% p.a. handling charge. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by ISWACO. A Project Agreement for the operation, maintenance and
financial covenants would be executed with ISWACO.
Implementing Agency: Ministry of Construction
4.03      The Regional Construction and Management Agencies (RCMA) under MOC
are responsible for the implementation of MOC's projects. There are five
RCMAs in Korea - Seoul, Weonju, Daejeon, Iri and Busan. Seoul is the largest
RCMA, and is implementing 30 projects, including four road subprojects
financed by the Bank and the sewage treatment plant for Banweol being financed
by ADB. The previous two regional systems were also implemented by Seoul
RCMA. MOC has implemented satisfactorily several projects financed by the
Bank and other international agencies.
4.04      The RCMAs are managed by a Director General, and have the following
divisions: General Services, Roads, Rivers' Improvement, Labordtory, and spe-
cial construction offices. A Project Unit has been established for the
project, under Seoul's RCMA Director General, in coordination with the
Director General of the Water Resources Bureau (Chart 1). The Project Unit is
responsible for supervision under the Director, Rivers Improvement Division,
with two Assistant Directors (planning and construction), and 13 engineers.
2/   If the beneficiary municipalities would own the two treatment plants
(estimated to have loan-financing of about $5 million) another Transfer
and Operations Agreement for this purpose would be signed with MOHA,
representing the municipalities.



- 20 -
The consuLtants preparing the final design have been instructed to assist in
the project supervision. Before their present contract ends by April 30, 1985
an additional contract for the supervision of the project would be signed.
The draft terms and conditions of this contract have been reviewed by the Bank
and are satisfactory. These project supervision arrangements are
satisfactory. MOC's accounting department would be responsible for project
cost accounting. MOC's accounts are audited internally by the Inspector-
General's Office of MOC and are also independently audited by the Board of
Audit. Assurances were also obtained that within six months of che end of
each fiscal year MOC would send to the Bank a summary of the proiect cost
accounts, as audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Tne Operating Agency: ISWACO
4.05      ISWACO would be responsible for the operation, maintenance and debt
service of the project. ISWACO is operating satisfactorily the two existing
metropolitan systems, which provide bulk raw water to Seoul City and seven
other municipalities in the Metropolitan Region and treated water to the city
of Banweol. In addition to these two metropolitan systems, ISWACO also
operates seven other regional systems (Ulsan, Pohang, Majin, Yeocheon, Daedug,
Geoje and Gumi). ISWACO is also the borrower for two previous Bank loans:
The Chungju Multipurpose Dam Project (Loan 1666-KO), scheduled for completion
by mid-1985, and the Second Water Supply Project (Nagdong Barrage, Loan
2350-KO), effective in January 1984, both of which are being executed
satisfactorily.
4.06      ISWACO was established in 1974, for the purpose of promoting indus-
trial sites and water resources development, and: (a) undertakes the develop-
ment of industrial sites and special areas; (b) constructs, operates and main-
tains multipurpose dams for water supply, irrigation, flood control and power
generation; and (c) operates regional water supply systems which provide raw
or treated bulk water for municipal and industrial use. ISWACO has planned
and constructed nine industrial estates and aew cities, five multi-purpose
dams, and operates nine regional water supply systems. ISWACO's investments
in new projects are considerable. and about $360 million would be invested
this year by its Dams Division alone. The largest dams under construction are
Chungju (financed by Loan 1666-KO), Hapcheon (financed by OECF), the Nagdong
Barrage (financed by L.oan 2350-KO), the Juam Dam (also financed by OECF) and
the Imha Dam scheduled to start construction in 1985. Feasibility studies are
being prepared by consultants for another five multipurpose dams which are
expected to be built within the next ten years.
4.07      ISWACO is managed by a Board of Direccors consisting of a Chairman,
the President of ISWACO, MOC's Director General of Water Resources, the
Manager for Government Invested Corporations, and two other persons appointed
by MOC. ISWACO's President is appointed by the President of Korea. ISWACO
also has a Vice President and four Directors (Administration, Industrial
Sices, Water Rcsources and Public Utilities), and an Auditor (Chart 2). The
Auditor is appointed by MOC for a period of two years. The Vice President and
Directors are appointed by MOC for a period of three years. ISWACO has
developed into a large and competent organization with 15 departments,
18 local offices and 1,278 employees, 42Z of whom are in Daejeon at head-



- 21 -
quarters and the others in local offices or construction sites. Many of
ISWACO's 500 engineers have been trained abroad and, working together with
foreign consultants, have acquired considerable experience in the design, con-
struction, operation and maintenance of many large projects. Any loans
applied for by ISWACO have to be approved by MOC. ISWACO has insurance
against fire, as well as for vehicles, and is self-insured against other
risks. ISWACO's financial statements are being satisfactorily audited by
independent private auditors. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that ISWACO's financial statements would continue to be independently audited,
and that a copy of the auditor's report would be sent to the Bank by July 1,
six months after the end of each fiscal year.
ISIACO's Operations
4.08      ISWACO's operation is efficient, with administrative expenses repre-
senting less than 5% of the operational expenses. Public enterprises are
often affected by low efficiency, deficient budgetary controls, excessive
staff, limited colleccion of revenues, etc. In May 1984, the Government, as
part of its Structural Adjustment policy, enacted the Public Enterprise Reform
law which provides more autonomy to public enterprises, but also creates
mechanisms to improve their efficiency. Under this law, Boards of Directors
are established to approve the budget, set policies and medium- and long-term
objectives. Each of the 25 public enterprises are evaluated annually follow-
ing clear guidelines (available in Project File). The criteria used include
quantifiable results (profits, net sales, percentage of management expenses,
etc.), and nonquantifiable variables (long-term planning, research, promotion
of advanced technology, etc.). Enterprises are ranked, and the normal end of
year bonus for all employees is then awarded based on such rankings.
Employees in enterprises ranked "A" receive up to six months salaries as an
annual bonus, and those :n the lowest rank "D" receive three months salary
bonus. This system is creating changes in management attitudes (for example
ISWACO now refuses to undertake unprofitable projects) and in the motivation
of managers and employees. ISWACO's management is consequently very receptive
to new ideas co improve itself. While ISWACO has shown continuing improve-
ments in its financial performance, it still does not have adequate long-term
corporate financial planning in its organization. Strengthening in this area
is needed, to consolidate its financial sections now dispersed in several
divisions, to prepare long-term financial projections and introduce an
improved management information system. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that ISWACO would carry out and send to the Bank for comments not
later than December 31, 1986, a study to make recommendations to strengthen
its financial managemenL and corporate planning.
4.09      ISWACO's water operations are well run, telemetering is used to
control and measure the water being provided to each city, bulk water is
measured at pumping stations and at users' intakes, statistical information is
adequate, water services are reliable, reported unaccounted-for water is less
than 5%, and accounts receivable are less than 30 days. Meters are calibrated
regularLy and there are meter shops at different locations. However, the
long-term planning for maintenance of the water pipelines, their corrosion
protection and monitoring, the optimization of the efficiency of pumping to
adjust for daily variations of water demand require improvements. Assurances

were obtained during negotiations that a suitable maintenance and inspection
program for che Metropolitan systems including corrosion protection and
monitoring, would be sent by ISWACO to the Bank for review and comments not
later than December 31, 1986.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
ISWACO - Financial Performance
5.01      ISWACO is a corpocation owned by the Government (95X) and the Korea
Development Bank (5%). Its authorized capital is W 500 billion', ($625 mil-
lion) of which W 280 billion was paid in as of December 31, 1982. ISWACO has
been growing rapidly and its fixed assets increased 3.7 times in the last four
years.  ISWACO's main sources of funds h ave been Government equity contribu-
tions, loans from KDB and the Oil Fund,3 foreign loans and internal cash
generation.
5.02      ISWACO's financial performance between 1978-83 has been generally
satisfactory with a debt/(debt plus equity) ratio of 54% and a current ratio
of 1.4. However, ISWACO's net income has only been 2% of its equity, and its
operating ratio was aLmost 100%, primarily due to the effect of the Industrial
Sites Division (para. 5.03). ISWACO's financial statements are shown in
Annex 10, and a summary is presented in Table 5.1. ISWACO's corporate finan-
cial planning has been hindered by the Lack of clear Government policies for
its rates and tariffs. Under the Project, financial targets for the Water and
Dams Divisions would be implemented (para. 5.07), and tariff studies (para.
1.07) and a study to strengthen ISWACO's financial management (para. 4.08)
would be carried out.
Industrial Sites
5.03      ISWACO's main activity at its inception in 1974 was in the water
sector, but during subsequent years its main activity has been the construc-
tion of industrial sites and new towns. Industrial sites and new towns are
financed by Government equity contributions and long-term loans from KDB.
After construction these industrial sites, together with related loan obliga-
tions, are sold at cost. With the completion of many of these projects,
ISWACO's revenues and expenses from these activities have been declining.
This explains the decrease -if revenues from W 151 billion in 1979 to W 73 bil-
lion in 1982, with a corresponding reduction in operating expenses from
W 150 to W 71 billion during this period. Therefore the net income and cash
generation now depend on the other ISWACO activities, namely those of the Dams
and Water Supply Divisions. The financial analysis for ISWACO is centered on
these divisions.

Water Division
5.04      MOC finances all production and transmission systems for bulk and
created water supplies (regionaL systems) for groups of municipalities and
industrial zones; these systems are operated by the Water Division. 92Z of
its revenue is from the sale of raw water, while treated water provides the
remaining 8%. Presently ISWACO provides water to nine regional systems
including the two existing Metropolitan regional systems (para. 4.05). MOC
has prepared feasibility studies for three other regional systems, including
the proposed project, to serve some 50 municipalities. Partly due to the
project, ISWACO's raw water sales are expected to increase from 1,120 to
1,520 million tons per year, and its sales of treated water from 56 to
300 million tons per year, between 1984-90 (Annex 8). During the 1982
drought, ISWACO's sales of hydro-generated power were reduced from 988 to
614 CWh resulting in a deficit of W 1,662 million in the Dams Division
(Table 5.2), while the Water Division increased its revenues by 60%, and had a
profit of over W 7,000 million.

5.05      ISWACO's nationwide tariffs for raw and treated water include fixed
charges for the basic contracted quantity, metered charges varying with the
volume used and surcharges for volumes used in excess of the contracted supply
(Table 5.3). The criteria to set these tariffs, the ratio between fixed
charges (for volume contracted with each city), and metered charges for the
water used and the need to have surcharges in places where water is very
expensive would be studied under the project (para. 1.07, and Annex 13).

Dams Division
5.06      The Dams Division operates five dams (Andong, Soyang, Daecheong, Nam
and Seonjin), and is constructing three additional dams and the Nagdong
Barrage (Chart 2). Its main source of revenue is the sale of bulk power to
the Korea Electric Power Company (KEPCO). These revenues represented 84% of
the total in 1983 and are expected to increase to 86% by 1986 (Annex 9).
ISWACO's power generation would increase 138% between 1984-86 upon completion
of the Chungju Dam. The other 16X of the Division's revenues in 1983 were
water rights charges levied on municipalities and industries which use water
from rivers regulated by ISWACO. The volume of such water billed (including
the Nagdong Barrage) would double by 1988, from 1,048 to 2,160 million tons.
The cost of each dam is allocated to power, water, irrigation, land reclama-
tion, flood control, etc., in proportion to their respective benefits or
alternative costs. ISWACO's efforts to collect agricultural water charges, to
recover a portion (30Z) of the cost allocated to irrigation, have been
strongly opposed by farmers and the Ministry of Agriculture, which wants to
subsidize food production. ISWACO expects to increase the irrigated area
paying charges (of around $25 per ha per year) from 190 ha in 1983 to 8,500 ha
by 1988, but this would still include only a fraction of the total irrigated
land served by ISWACO. ISWACO's revenues from this source would, however,
increase from the present W 13 million to W 227 million by 1988. Cash
operational expenses, including taxes, were 34% of the Division's revenues in
1983, and under the proposed rate of return covenant (para. 5.07) are expected
to represent only 12% of the revenues by 1988, with depreciation representing
332 and the return on investment the other 55% of its revenues.
Financial Covenants
5.07      As in the Second Water Supply Project, agreement was reached during
negotiations that ISWACO's minimum rates of return for its Water and Dams
Divisions would be 4% in 1985 and 5Z thereafter. These rates of return
provide a satisfactory financial performance and are reasonable in view of:
(a) for the Dams Division - the lumpiness of the dams investments, and the
provision of.services which are not fully recuperable from users (like water
taken from the rivers for irrigation and expenses in flood controL); and (b)
for the Water Division - the provision of satisfactory water services to the



- 26 -
poorest regions at a reasonable price, promoting an equitable development of
the country. These rates of return would allow ISWACO to pay its operationaL
expenses, depreciation and debt service, and internally finance 15% of the
large planned investments in dams between 1984-88 ($1,080 million), which
represent 3.2 times its net fixed assets in 1983 (Annex 9). Compliance with
this covenant would produce a satisfactory cash balance, but requires consid-
erable efforts. In the Dams Division power charges wouLd need to be increased
115% (38% between 1984-88) and the charges for water rights increased by 180%
in real terms between 1982-88 (26% between 1985-88). Ir the Water Division,
tariffs would have to be adjusted about 15% in real terms between 1984-88.
ISWACO's power tariffs are negotiated with KEPCO in consultation with EPB and
the Ministry of Energy. ISWACO's water charges are approved by MOC in
consultation with EPB.
5.08      These rates of return would be based on fully revaLued assets.
Fixed assets were revalued in 1983 for the Dams Division, and are being
revalued for the Water Division. Korea's Assets Revaluation Law allows the
revaluation of fixed assets when their estimated value exceeds 25% of the book
value. Assets revaluation is detailed, complicated and requires the approval
of Government's Board of Audit and Inspection. Agreement was also reached
that for rate analysis, the value of these fixed assets would be adjusted
periodically until the next formal revaluation, using 85% of the annual
increase of the wholesale price index as a conservative proxy for the increase
in value of these assets. This system is used in the financial projections.
5.09      ISWACO's rates of return in 1984 are projected to be about 2.7%,
which is short of the covenanted 4%. This lower than expected performance is
mainly the result of: (a) for the Dams Division - the assets revaluation
which doubled value of fixed assets at end of 1983, and (b) for the Water
Division - price increases which doubled the charges for the water used from
rivers, and increases of 9% in power costs (which represent half of its
expenses). ISWACO has made a considerable effort to comply with the covenant
under Loan 2350-KO. Between 1982 and 1984 its power rates were increased from
W 13.8/Kwh to W 23.7/Kwh (58Z in real terms), and water rights charges were
increased from W 1.9 per ton to W 3.7 per ton (78% in real terms). Although
Government has a major policy effort to stabilize prices and control infla-
tion, ISWACO's water rates were i..creased by 10% before Board presentation.
This would ensure compliance in 1985 with the rate covcaant of the Water
Division. Since the power generated and sold to KEPCO by ISWACO would
increase by 71% in 1985, and 138% in 1986 (upon completion of Chungju Dam),
the financial performance of the Dams Division would depend mainly on the
power tariffs set for Chungju. The tariff study prepared by ISWACO's
consultants recommends a power rate for Chungju Dam of W33.6 per Kwh. This
study uses standard methods followed in Korea for ISWACO's rates. Chungju
power rates would be implemented before this dam enters into operation by mid-
1985, allowing compliance with the covenanted rate of return for the Dams
Division in 1985 and 1986.



- 27 -
Future Financial Performance
5.10      Under the proposed covenant (para. 5.07), the financial position of
the Dams Division would be satisfactory (Annex 9): its working ratio would
average 13%, its debt service ratio would average 1.5, and its debt/debt plus
equity would be below 39%. After 1988, annual investments of about $60
million would be internally financed, and additional cash would be available
to contribute to the construction of the other dams being planned by MOC. The
Water Division would also have a satisfactory financial performance (Annex 8),
with its working ratio averaging 67%, its debt service ratio 4.5, and its
debt/debt plus equity would be lower than 15%. After completion of the
proposed project, this Division would rapidly accumulate cash that would allow
ISWACO to make internal contributions to the construction of other regional
projects being planned, and to the next stage for the Metropolitan Region
water system. Additional investments and their financing could affect
ISWACO's financial position. Assurances were obtained during loan negotia-
tions that ISWACO would not incur any additional Long-term debt without prior
Bank concurrence, unless its debt service coverage exceeds 1.3 in any calendar
year. Financial highlights of the Water and Dams Divisions are presented in
Tables 5.4 and 5.5 respectively. Consolidated financial statements for ISWACO
are shown in Annex 10.
5.11      Under the new Public Enterprise Law (para. 4.08) ISWACO is making a
serious effort to increase its management efficiency and profitability.
Because of the above concerns ISWACO has reservations about undertaking the
operation of the Geum Gang regional system, expected to be completed by the
beginning of 1985, since projected initial revenues may not cover even power
charges (partLy because of over-design). ISWACO has also had to take respon-
sibility for operating at least one other bulk water supply system in the past
which was not financially viable due to overdesign.  ISWACO has *hired the
Korean Industrial Development Institute to study this problem and recommend
conditions, tariffs and/or subsidies under which the Geum Gang system could be
administered by the beneficiary cities or by ISWACO. If ISWACO takes over the
operation of this system, the Bank would consider how the assets and
liabilities of this particuLar system (for which present projections are only
rough estimates) would be taken into consideration in the rate of return
caLculation (Annex 12).

Reporting Requirements - Monitoring Indicators
5.12      In order to permit the satisfactory monitoring of the investment
program and financing plans, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that:
(a)  ISWACO would send to mthe Bank five-year financial projections for
the Water and Dams Divisions before August 31 of each year. The
projections would include an income statement, statement of cash
flow, balance sheet with details of water and power demand,
programmed investments and financing resources;
(b)  ISWACO would send to the Bank not later than August 31 and
February 28 of each year semiannual information on monitoring
indicators (Tables 5, Annexes 8 and 9) and the compliance with loan
covenants; and
(c)  MOC would send to the Bank semiannuaL reports of project execution
and cost and would prepare a project completion report satisfactory
to the Bank, not later than six months after the loan closing date.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
6.01      The proposed project meets urgent water needs for 25 municipalities
in the Metropolitan Region. This Region is the administrative, political and
economic center of Korea, with 37Z of the population and almost half of the
industrial employment and GNP. Rapid population and industrial growth has
outpaced the provision of water services. The project would provide the water
needed for the Region's sustained development.
Project Benefits
6.02      Upon completion of the project, 5 million persons in 25 municipa-
lities would have an improved water supply, be free of rationing and low water
pressures, and would be able to increase their usage of water for residential,
commercial and industrial purposes. After completion of expansions to the
distribution networks (para. 3.05), the project would make water available to
1.1 million additional persons by 1991 and 2.3 million persons by 1996. It is
estimated that about 26% of the incremental population to be served with water
are beloy the relative urban poverty threshold. This would mean that by 1991
the number of poor with house connections would more than double. Since most
of the urban poor now ace either unserved, or have less reliable or convenient
service (standpipes, low pressure, water rationing, etc.) they would be bene-
fitted by the expansion of water supply, the improvement of service and the
increase in coverage (from 77% in 1983 to 87% by 1988 and 92% by 1991), with
practically everybody being served by house connections in the main project
cities (Annex 3, Table 2). Financial projections for a sample of the benefi-
ciary municipalities, available in the Project File, show that no major tariff



- 30 -
increases are expected at the consumer level as a result of the project.
Water charges are affordable to the whole population. This is because tariffs
are progressive, with large residentiaL consumption being charged at up to six
times the minimum rate. Water charges of up to 5Z of the household income are
normally considered affordable. In the Metropolitan Region, water charges for
a minimum consumption of 10 to 15 tons per family are about W 600 per month
($0.75). This represents less than 1% of the monthly household income of the
lowest percentile (Annex 11, Graph 2).
6.03      The project would also have significant benefits through institution
buiLding and sector policy development. These include: (a) the provision of
centrally treated water to all but four of the 25 municipalities included in
the Project, in contrast to the two existing Metropolitan Region systems,
which provide raw water, requiring each beneficiary municipaLity to build
independent water treatment plants; (b) agreement with the Government to
study: (i) the policies and tariff levels Eor bulk water, which would have a
national impact and affect the large number of municipalities served by the
nine existing regional systems operated. by ISWACO and the new regional systems
being built by MOC; (ii) improvement of ISWACO's financial management; and
(iii) improvements to the organization of water and sewerage services in the
Metropolitan Region, which are expected to result in the establishment of a
'gater Authority, and which would increase efficiency, reduce cost, equalize
retail tariffs and eliminate unfairness in the provision of these services.
The establishment oF bulk treated water supply systems under this Project is
an important step towards an integrated organization which may be advanced
further by the joint ownership and operation of treatment plants by the
municipalities.
Least-Cost Solution
6.04      The selection of the least-cost solution was a major issue during
project preparation (Annex 1). The proposed treated water system selected
(para. 3.01) is the least cost soLution for the whole region, and is consider-
ably less expensive and more efficient than the raw water systems built under
the two existing regional projects. The route selected for the pipelines is
also the least expensive, avoiding as much as possible crossing the more
densely popuLated areas in the Region (Annex 11, para. 1).
Rate of Return
6.05      The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the Project, based on existing
water tariffs and the total cost of providing water to the households served
by the Project, is estimated at 14% (Annex 11, Table 3). Sensitivity analysis
shows that a 10% increase in the investment cost, or a two year delay in com-
pleting the Project would reduce the ERR to 13%, and that the ERR would be 11%
even if the investment and operational expenses were increased by 15%. The
Project would, for the first time, provide water to extensive areas within the
Metropolitan Region, allowing residential, industrial and commercial develop-
ment. The ERR, including the project benefits expected to be reflected in
real estate values, is estimated at 19%. The internal rate of return, based
on ISWACO's charges for treated water to the municipalities is 10X, indicating
that bulk water tariffs are somewhat lower than the marginal cost of water.



- 31 -
These rates of return underestimate the economic benefits of the project
because: (a) they are based on the average charges for treated water, which
only partially represent the consumer willingness to pay for water (as
evidenced by excess consumption charges up to three times higher than the
average tariff); and (b) they exclude other important benefits which are
difficult to quantify, like the provision of better services to present
consumers, the improvement of living standards and the health and general
welfare of the population. The water provided by the project is the only
water source for most municipalities and is therefore essential for the
Region's development.
Marginal Cost
6.06      The marginal cost for the treated water is W 89 per ton in 1985
prices (US$0.11 per cubic meter) for a discount rate of 10Z, (Annex 11,
Table 2). Present bulk water tariffs for treated water are 8% lower (W 82 per
ton), which is the marginal cost for a discount rate of 9%. This indicates
that present rates are close to the optimal marginal cost pricing. Tariff
studies under the project (para. 1.07) would further review and propose
improvements on these tariffs. Retuil water tariffs are affordable, represen-
ting less than 1% of the household income even for the lowest 10% percentile
(para. 6.02).
Project Risks
6.07      There are no special risks in the Project.  However, given MOC's
large investment needs, Government's tight budget controls could reduce annual
budgetary allocations and slow down project implementation. This is not
likeLy given the priority accorded to the Project and the Government's deter-
mination to complete it before end-1988. The Government has also given
assurances that it will furnish sufficient and timely counterpart funding. In
addition, there are risks that the municipalities may not build the necessary
distribution works in time and that project benefits would be delayed. This
has not been a problem ifi the two existing systems in the Region, where the
system capacity, normally designed for a 7 to 10 year horizon, was fully used
within four years. The Government, however, provided assurances that the
necessary complementary works would be completed by December 31, 1988
(para. 3.05). Sewerage and sewage treatment works, and other pollution
control measures are being undertaken that would ensure that the additional
wastewater resulting from the project would not result in environmental
deterioration (para. 3.13 and Annex 2).

METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Water Supply - Existing Facilities and Proposed Improvement
Population and Demand
1.        The Metropolitan Region, incLuding Seoul City, had a population in
1981 of some 12.4 million persons in 40 municipalities (Table 1). In 1983,
the population in the 25 project municipalities was 3.7 million. The average
growth rate in the project municipalities has been about 7.3% (1981-83) and is
expected to decline gradually to about 3.7% (1991-96). Overall, about 86% of
the population in the region had access to piped water in 1981, including
Seoul City. In the project municipalities, coverage varied from 92% in
Incheon to 11% in Yongin. Three of the smaller municipalities had no piped
water service at all in 1981, although by 1983 all but one had started piped
water services from local sources. Water consumption in 1981 varied from a
high of 242 liters per capita per day (lcpd) and 195 lcpd in Banweol and
Incheon respectively (both cities with very high induscrial demand) to
165 lcpd in Seoul City and about 100 Lcpd in the average small municipality in
the project area (Table 2). Unaccounted-for water was highest in Seoul City
at 48% and averaged about 35% in the project municipalities, with about 20X in
the smaller municipalities. These statistics are, however, not reliable for
the smaller municipalities, because of the lack of adequate production
metering facilities.
Water Sources
2.        The municipalities involved in the project have no direct access to
the Han River (except Incheon, Gwangmyeong and Bucheon downstream from Seoul
City) and many are at considerable distances (30-60 km) from this only
reliable source (Map 1). Local water sources, including groundwater, are no
longer adequate to meet present demand. Eight of the project cities are also
served by the two existing regional water supply systems, which are now
operated almost at their full capacity of 2.6 mtpd.
Complementary Works
3.        The five main project cities of Incheon, Bucheon, Gwangmyeong,
Anyang and Suweon would use about 60X of the project's water with about
abother 20Z being earmarked for new development areas around Pyeongtaek and
Banweol. The five cities all have Master Plans for water supply development
in their areas, and the Ministry of Construction (HOC) recently published a
Basic Development Plan for the Metropolitan Region, approved by the Govern-
ment, which inter alia provides for the development of the Pyeongtaek/Banwoel
areas for decentralization of industry from Seoul and other densely populated
cities. The smaller municipalities are undertaking feasibility studies for
planned improvements to their water supply systems to cope with increasing
demand and utilize the additional water allocated to each of them from this
project. Annex 7 gives details of additional treatment plants, transmission
and distribution expansion, and new service reservoirs expected to be



-35-                                 ANNEX 1
Page 2
constructed by each of the cities before the proposed project comes into
operation in 1988. These plans are being coordinated by MOHA which will also
assist the cities to finance these investments by approving bonds and
arranging local or foreign loans to supplement each municipality's internal
contribution and investments. MOHA has scarted discussions to obtain a sector
type loan for this purpose. Since these complementary works, necessary to
utilize the project water, are relatively straightforward and MOHA has under-
taken to coordinate and assist in financing them, no major problems are
envisaged in their implementation between 1985 and 1988. About 30% of these
investments have already been appraised for financing by ADB. It is expected
that when the complementary works are completed in 1988, the project cities
will have a service coverage of about 87% compared to the 77Z coverage in
1983, and the smaller municipalities a coverage of about 80% compared to the
50% in 1983.
Treated Water Supply
4.        The two existing regional systems supply raw water to eight munici-
palities. This water is treated by the cities in seven treatment plants, six
of which are owned and operated bv each of the municipalities concerned, while
the seventh is owned and operated by ISWACO. Under the Project an improved
system would be constructed which will supply raw water to three jointly owned
treatment plants. One new treatment plant would serve six municipalities to
the north, a second, ten municipalities to the south and the third (not finan-
ced under the projecc) five municipalities to the west. The other four muni-
cipalities will continue to be supplied with raw water due to their location,
needs of industry or need to utilize the full capacity of their existing
treatment plants. This constitutes a major improvement not only resulting in
substantially lower capital and operational costs but also paving the way for
similar future expansions and for establishing a better organization for the
management of an integrated water supply system for the Metropolitan Region.

METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Sanitation and Pollution Control - Existing Facilities
and Proposed Improvements
1.        About 92X of the population of all municipalities in the Region are
served with septic tank and night soil collection facilities. This is the
main method of dealing with human wastes and is likely to remain so for some
years. Only Seoul City has waterborne sewerage for one densely developed
area, with two treatment plants of 360,000 mtpd capacity capable of serving
about 25X of its population. Generally, all waste water (except night soil
which is collected individually from premises), including septic tank effluent
and untreated or partially treated industriaL and commercial wastes, is dis-
charged into street drains and water courses. These in turn drain into the
Han River, the Anseong River or the sea to the west. Although night soil
collection and treatment before disposal is systematic and efficient and all
new developmencs are provided with individual septic tanks or treatment facil-
ities, continuous discharge of partially treated wastes into water courses has
seriously impaired water quality in the main water courses. Table 1 shows
indicators -if -water quality in the Han River in 1983 at eight locations down-
stream of Paldang and indicates a deteriorating situation as the river flows
chrough the main city areas below Dugdo (Map IBRD 18420). The main
cributaries draining the developed areas (including Suweon and Anyang, Bucheon
and Gwangmyeong), are in poor condition, being practically anaerobic during
the dry season (September to July). The situation in the small towns draining
into the Anseong River is not so serious, as they are relatively less densely
populated. Environmental conditions in neighborhoods are also affected by the
scarcity of adequate quantities of water to flush out house and street drains
and transfer wastes away from them and into the main water courses.
2.        The municipalities maintain fairly extensive systems of street
drains, covered and lined main drains and natural water courses to serve as
combined sewers. Night soil collection services and treatment plants are also
a municipal responsibility. Table 2 gives details of these services in the 40
municipalities in the Region. Garbage collection and disposal services in
most municipalities are effectively managed and operated, with landfill and
composting being the main disposal methods. Since the outlying areas of the
Region are largely agricultural, there is a ready demand for compost and
digested nightsoil for application in the fields. Generally, most munici-
palities maintain a very high standard of neighborhood sanitation compared to
similar cities in other developing countries.
3.        Air pollution is not a major problem in the smaller municipalities,
but Seoul City, Incheon and some of the other cities in the Region are
increasingly being affected by atmospheric pollution caused by increasing
vehicle use and the lack of emission controls. The traditional use of low
grade coal briquettes for heating systems also contributes to this problem.

Sulphur dioxide levels in the main areas of Seoul City have been measured at
0.07 parts per million (ppm) in 1983 and 0.08 ppm in 1984. Although these
figures are considerably better than the 0.14 ppm recorded in 1981, and the
improvement is attributable to the obLigatory use of low sulphur light oil by
vehicles in Seoul, they are still in excess of the acceptable standard of
0.05 ppm.
4.        Since the estalishment of the Office of the Environment (OOE) in
1980 and the enactment of the Environment Preservation Law in 1981, the OOE
and the municipalities have mounted a concerted effort to reduce environmental
pollution to acceptable levels and gradually improve the quality of the urban
environments which have, over the three previous decades, been impaired by the
rapid industrial and population growth. OOE has set and the municipaLities
are enforcing effluent quality standards for domestic and industrial wastes.
5.        The Government has started implementing satisfactory programs to
deal with liquid wastes and pollution control based on the Environmental
Master Plan Study of the Han River Basin, completed by consultants in 1983.
OHA has prepared a master investment plan for providing interceptor sewers
and treatment facilities between 1984 and 1991 in all 49 cities (except Seoul)
and 187 towns in the country. This plan, costed at W 243 billion, will be
financed out of sewerage tariffs (to be levied in these cities and towns
starting in 1985) and government and foreign loans. Nineteen of the project
cities and towns will be included in and benefit from this program. Four of
the largest cities, Incheon, Bucheon, Anyang and Gwangmyeong, bordering Seoul
City, will also benefit from the large-scale improvement works on the Han
River being implemented by Seoul City since 1983. These include the training
and deepening of the main river and the construction of about 330 km of inter-
ceptor sewer along both banks of the river and its main tributaries. This
project, estimated to cost over W 500 billion (and financed mainly from
revenues from sale of dredging rights), will be completed by 1986. Four
sewage treatment plants are also planned (two under construction) for comple-
tion in stages by 1996, to provide adequate treatment for dry weather flows
from these interceptors before discharge into the Han River. When completed
in 1986 the sewer interceptors will contribute to reducing the waste water
pollution of the main water courses draining the densely populated project
areas to the south of the Han River.  OOE is planning to establish a central
garbage disposal landfill site to serve the densely populated cities in the
project. In addition, OOE has also started programs to control industrial
waste pollution of the waterways and atmosphere by establishing effluent and
emission standards and monitoring systems and a system of collecting pollution
charges. All these measures would result in a gradual improvement of environ-
mental conditions in the project area.

METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Description
General
1.        The project is the third bulk water supply system in the
Metropolitan Region. The two existing systems, completed in 1978 and 1981
respectively, supply bulk raw water to Seoul and seven other cities in the
Region (Map IBRD 18420).
2.        The Project consists of:
(a) a main raw water transmission system extracting water from the
existing Paldang reservoir on the Han River upstream of Seoul City
and transmitting through pipelines, tunnels and pumping stations 9
supply (i) raw water for two new treated water systems of 560,000-
and 425,000 metric tons per day (mtpd) capacity each, designed to
serve (a) the five western regional cities of Incheon (fourth
largest city in Korea), Bucheon and Gwangmyeong and the towns of
Sorae and Gimpo; and (b) the ten southern municipalities including

METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Economic Analysis
Least-Cost Solution
1.        The selection of the least-cost solution was a major issue during
project preparation, The proposed treated bulk water system finally selected,
is less expensive and more efficient than the raw bulk water systems built
previously, but the municipalities initially preferred to have raw bulk water
supplies with their own independent treatment plants. This was because: (a)
they were familiar with raw bulk water systems, and (b) of differentials
between treated and raw water tariffs. ISWACO's nationwide tariff for treated
water is more than twice its raw water tariff; while water treatment in the
Metropolitan area, because of the good quality of the raw water, adds only
about 30% to the cost of raw water. Tariff studies under the project (para.
1.07) would improve the tariff structure and avoid this problem in future
projects. The alternative of a bulk raw water system with several independent
treatment plants vs one large treatment plant with a bulk treated water system
was compared. After taking into consideration the special needs of Seoul
(para. 3) which will build a separate treated water system with the trunk main
laid on reclaimed land beside the Han River, the project as now designed with
three treatment plants, is the least-cost solution for the whole Metropolitan
Region and for the project. It is at least 20% less expensive at discount
rates between 5% and 15% than the alternative of a raw water system with about
20 individual treatment plants. Also because of the dispersed nature of the
larger population concentrations, and the special needs of raw water for
industry, the facilities to be built under the project could be easily
integrated with any future proposals for a Metropolitan Water Authority,
including Seoul.
2.        Three treatment plants would be provided, instead of one,for the
following reasons: (a) the Euijeongbu system is on the northern side of the
Han River, and would require an expensive bridge to carry the treated water
from Paldang accross the river -- an independent river intake and treatment
plant with a treated water trunk main was therefore selected for this compo-
nent; (b) the other two treatment plants each with a capacity of over 400,000
mtpd were located near Incheon and Seongnam with approximately 40 km raw water
trunk main, because of raw water supply en route to large industries which do
not require treated water. The route selected for the pipelines is also the
least expensive, avoiding as much as possible crossing the more densely
populated areas. The optimal Location of the treatment plant for Incheon and
the neighboring municipalities was selected by consultants under an ADB
technical assistance grant. The overall project design and routing was
reviewed by the Design Review Panel convened by MOC, and their comments have
been incorporated in the final design.

Page 2
3.        The appraisal analysis indicated that a proposed 500,000 mtpd
allocation to Seoul City at the feasibility stage would not be needed because
of expansion to its existing Cueui Treatment Plant (from 830,000 mtpd to
1,130,000 mtpd completed in 1984) and the construction in stages of a new
treatment plant (Aamsa) with acapacity of 1,000,000 mtpd, both drawing water
directly from the Han River.  Under these conditions Seoul would not need
water from the project until after 1995. The approximately 40 km of raw water
trunk main was therefore redesigned by lowering transmission capacity by
500,000 mtpd and a separate connection to Seoul eliminated. This is
justifiable, since improvemencs in the river water quality and the Han River
Development Project (Annex 2) now provide a more economic source and routing
for Seoul's water supply.
Project Costs and Benefits
4.        The operation of the facilicies included in the project requires
about 160 employees. The number of employees, and operational expenditures
for each system (personnel, power, chemicals, materials and maintenance, and
others) together with the main assumptions are presented in Table l.
5.        The main cost in the project is its capitaL expenditures.  Given the
large economies of scale and the physical constraints, the two water intakes
and seven tunnels included in the project lave to be designed for the year
2000 (12 years after project completion).,' Therefore, the Project includes
substantial costs which do not produce benefits during this first stage. Half
the cost of the tunnels and intake (16Z of the project cost) are a minimum
estimate of the cost reduction which would result at the time of construction
of the next stage (1991-92). The project cost also includes an integrated
system for telemetering and remote control for all three regional systems to
be centered at Paldang. Since this system (W 6.3 billion in 1985 prices)
would benefit not only this project but the first two regional systems as
well, only half of these costs are relevant for the project. All other
components have been included in the analysis and are sized for a design
horizon of six years, which is satisfactory.
Rate of Return
6.        The internal rate of return (IRR) for the project, based on existing
tariffs for treated water (W 82 per ton) is estimated at 10Z (Table 2). The
capital and operating expenses of the two project treatment plants (for
Euijeongbu and Seongnam systems), as well as the estimated cost for the
Incheon plant (W 26,000 million), and the individual plants for Anyang, Dongbu
and Banweol (W 11,000 million) are also included. This allows the total
demand to be analyzed as treated water. Sensitivity anaLysis shows that the
IRR would be 9% if the investments and operating expenses were increased by
10% or the benefits were reduced by 10% or there was a two year delay in
construction. The economic rate of return (Table 3) has been estimated adding
to the bulk water costs the investment and operating costs required to provide
1/ Minimum tunnel diameter for economical construction is between 2 and 3 m.

water to the individual househoLds. The cost of distribution works for the
incremental population are based on Annex 7, excluding the treatment pLants
(already included in the bulk water cost), and the imprcvements for existing
consumers. The per capita investment in distribution works is about $55.
which is reasonable. Operating expenses are based on data for Seoul, Incheon
and Euijeongbu, but exclude thE cost of chemicals, which is already incLuded
in the cost of the bulk treated water, and the purchase of bulk water from
ISWACO. Future power expenses for the municipaLities are expected to be Lower
than at present, since the hydraulic gradient in the project pipelines wouLd
allow service by gravity to most municipalities. Benefits are estimated based
on the present tariffs for Incheon and Bucheon, the two main users of water
under the project. Further details on the analysis are given in the footnotes
to the Table 3. The economic rate of return is estimated at 14%. The pro-
vision of water services is expected to increase the value of reaL estate
values of the additional househoLds served by the project. The present value
in each year as a minimum proxy for chis benefit is W 400,000 for each or the
new households served (4% increase in the value of property to the lowest
income households). IncLuding these benefits, the economic rate of return is
estimated at 19%.
Marginal Cost
7.        The marginal cost for the treated water is W89 per metric ton in
1985 prices, ($0.11 per metric ton) for a discount rate of 10%. Present bulk
water tariffs for treated water are only 8% lower (W82 per metric ton), which
is the marginal cost for a discount rate of 9Z (Table 2). This indicates that
tariffs are satisfactorily close to the optimal marginal cost pricing. Tariff
studies under the Project (para. 1.07) would further review and propose
improvements on these tariffs.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
Inflation
1.        Project cost tables assume that foreign price increases would be 8%
p.a. in 1985, and 9Z p.a. between 1986 and 1988. Local inflation in 1983 and
1984 has been only about 3%. Government efforts to curtail inflation are
likely to hold inflation at these levels, in which case exchange rate
adjustments may be used to, on the average, maintain the "purchasing power
parity" with international prices. The projections assume that the local
inflation would be about 2.5% in 1985 and 5.5% thereafter. The exchange rate
for 1985 is assumed at W 800 per US dollar.
Financial Projections
2.        The financial projections use a computer program developed by the
appraisal team using Lotus 1-2-3. Only the main financial statements (Table 1
- Income, Table 2 - Flow of Funds, Table 3 - Balance, Table 4 - Financial Plan
and Table 5 - Monitoring Indicators) are included in this report (Annex 8 for
the Water Division and Annex 9 for the Dams Division). Additional tables
(available in the Project File) provide detaiLs on all the assumptions and
intermediate results regarding demand, fixed assets and revaluation, debt
service, operational expenses, tariffs and revenues, etc. Therefore only the
main assumptions are explained here.
Assets Revaluation
3.        Korean regulations allow for the revaluation of fixed assets when
their estimated value exceeds the book value by 25% or more. Under the Second
Water Supply Project, ISWACO's Water and Dams assets should be revaLued before
December 31, 1984, and be revalued annually until the next formal revaluation,
using 85% of the wholesale price increases as a conservative proxy for the
price increase of fixed assets. The fixed assets of the Dams Division were
revalued in 1983, doubling their book value. The assets of the Water Division
are also being revalued, but their revaluation would be only about 20%, since
most of these assets have been in operation for only a few years. The first
two metropolitan svstems (which represent 85% of the value of the fixed assets
of this Division), were completed in 1979 and 1981 and the Gumi system in
1983, and inflation in Korea has been low during recent years. The financial
projections use these revalued or estimated revalued fixed assets and
depreciation. In 1985 Chungju Dam would only be partially in operation (6
months). Furthermore, since the reservoir would not be full, and water levels
would be low, power generated is expected to be less than half the installed
capacity. Under these conditions it would be unfair to ask for a full return
on its assets. Only about 70% of Chungju Dam assets are assumed to enter into
operation in 1985, with the remaining entering in 1986.

Geum Gang System
8.        Under the new Public Enterprise Law (para. 4.08), ISWACO is makine
an effort to increase its management efficiency and profitability. Because of
the above concerns ISWACO does not want to take over the operation of the Geum
Gang regional system, which is expected to be completed by January 1985.
Initial revenues may not even cover power expenses (partly because of
overdesign). In the past, MOC has constructed a few water supply projects,
which were not financially viable, and after construction transferred them to
ISWACO for operation. ISWACO has hired the Korean Industrial Development
Institute to study this problem and recommend conditions, tariffs and/or
subsidies under which the Geum Gang could be operated by the beneficiary
cities or by ISWACO. Therefore the projections exclude the Geum Gang system,
although the effect of incluAing it, without any subsidies, is included in
additional financial projections available in the Project File. If ISWACO
operates this system, the Bank should consider how the fixed assets and depre-
ciation of this particular system (for which at present the demand and expend-
itures are only rough estimates) would be included in the rate of return
calculation for purposes of the loan covenant (para. 5.07). Higher general
tariff increases (about 102) or special surcharges on the water sold on this
system may be needed to achieve a 4% rate of return. Since the high cost of
this system is partly due to demand errors the Bank should examine if it is
justifiable for ISWACO to seek a full return on these assets, or only a
partial return until the Geum Gang demand is higher.
Dams Division
9.        The Dams Division includes the total operations of the dams, which
ISWACO analyzes separately for: (a) water rights (water abstracted from
rivers regulated by dams built by ISWACO), both for municipal and industrial
use; (b) power generated by ISWACO and sold in bulk tc KEPCO; and (c) water
used for irrigation. When each dam is completed, a detailed economic analysis
is made to allocate its cost to the beneficiaries (water rights, power, irri-
gation, flood control, traffic or roads, land reclamation, et.).  The cost is
allocated to each component using the lower of the benefits or the alternative
cost for each component. The ccst allocation for flood control and 70% of the
cost allocation for irrigation are financed by Government grants, and are not
included in ISWACO's fixed assets. In practice, ISWACO has not been able to
collect revenues from the farmers (since the Ministry of Agriculture wants to
subsidize food production), and the operational expenses for irrigation and
flood control are now being charged to the other services.
10.       Detailed de-mand projections for the sales of power, water rights and
irrigation water in each dam under operation or construction and their respec-
tive charges and tariffs are presented in Table 10 of the detailed financial
projections for this Division (available in Project File). The Chungju Dam is
expected to start partial generation in June 1985, and by 1986 would increase
by 138% the power presently generated by ISWACO in its other three dams
(Andong, Soyang and Daecheong). The power generated by ISWACO is cheaper than
the cost to KEPCO of its oil, gas or nuclear generation; therefore the full
power capacity would be used as soon as it is available.

Page 4
11.       By 1988 the operating expenses, other than depreciation, represent
only 12% of the revenues of the Dams Division. The remaining 88% of the
revenues cover depreciation (33%), and return on capital (55k).  About 47Z of
the operating expenses are for personnel. These expenses would double upon
the completion of the Chungju Dam. Additional provisions for staff and other
expenses are included upon completion of each of the other dams under con-
struction: Hapcheon and the Nagdong Barrage in 1988 and Juam by 1990. Power
expenses are to pump-back water at Andong during non-peak hours, to be used
for generation during peak hours. Materials costs are f^recast based on the
new assets entering into operation.
Tariffs and Charges
12.       Charges in the Water Division include basic charges for contracted
water, consumption charges for the water used, and excess charges for water
used above the contracted volume. Since the charges for excessive water
consumption are more than four times those for water used, the average rate
fluctuates and may actually be lower when the volume contracted increases
(e.g. between 1983-84).
13.       Power charges in the Dam Division are not for each dam.  Government
assigns a rate of return for the value of assets for power (para. 9) equal to
the weighted average of the interest on the loans used to finance each dam.
For Chungju Dam the rate of return using this system is estimated at 6.3% and
the corresponding power rate at W33.7 per Kwh.
Flow of Funds
i4.       The Dams Division has inrestments of about $1 million per day in
1984, and a total projected inves.ment of $1,080 million during 1984-88
(Annex 9, Table 4). These invescments are financed by several foreign loans
(including Bank Loans 1666-KO and 2350-KO), three loans from OECF, several
loans from KDB and the Oil Fund and Government contributions. These are
summarized in Annex 9, Table 2, and further details on terms and conditions of
these loans are given in Table 8 of the financial projections for this Divi-
sion (available in Project File). The investments, Loans and contributions
included are based on loans already signed or financial plans approved by the
Government. Land reclaimed by the Nagdong Barrage Project would be sold
between 1987 and 1989 and would largely improve the cash flow of this Divi-
sion. MOC is doing feasibility studies for the construction of another five
dams. However, no priorities or schedules have been approved, and detailed
cost estimates are not available. ISWACO is now looking very critically at
these new projects, requiring them to have a rate of return of at least 10% to
be accepted. Tentative investments of $115 million, fully internally gene-
rated, have been included between 1989 and 1991 as a contingency for some of
these projects.
15.       Accounts receivable are about one month of the amounts billed.
Other fixed assets include assets which are not included in the rate o:r return
calculation (para. 9). Amounts payable to contractors represents one twelfth
of the annual capital expenditures.

KOREA
METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
STUDY OF ISWACO'S BULK WATER TARIFFS
Draft Terms of Reference
Background
1.        The Government of Korea has an ambitious program to expand water-
supply and serve the whole population by the year 1990. Ir addition, the
accelerated development of Korea's industrial, manufacturing and agricultural
sectors, coupled with extremely high urbanization and rapid-increases in per
capica incomes, requires substantial increases in there per capita production
of water. Since most of this demand is concentrated in the 50 largest cities,
where the readily available and less costly sources of water have already been
exploited, large and expensive investment programs for expansion of water
supply production and distribution capacity are now being implemented. Even
larger investments would be needed in the future to satisfy the projected
water demands.
2.        At the same time, this accelerated industrial and urban development
has resulted in increased pollution of the main rivers in Korea, making it
more difficult and expensive to use them as sources for potable water. This,
and the exhaustion of the water resources in the vicinities of each
municipality, have created the need to develop regional water supply projects,
operated by the Industrial Sites and Water Development Corporation (ISWACO) to
serve groups of municipalities.  About 10 of these regional schemes are now ia
operation and several more (including river improvement projects) are being
planned. Each regional system provides water in bulk to groups of
municipalities, either raw (untreated) or treated, through long transmission
pipelines and requires expensive pumping. The development of additional
reliable water sources would also require the construction of large dams,
which would store water during the rainy season from July to September (which
accounts for two thirds of the annual precipitation of 1,160mm). Such dams
are becoming increasingly expensive due to the shortage of suitable dam sites,
the flooding of scarce agricultural land, and increasing land and compensation
costs.
3.        The Government has realized that the limited availability of water
resources is becoming a critical constraint for the development of Korea.  In
fact, the surface water runoff in Korea is only about 1,700 cubic meters per
person, or about 40% of the water runoff in a densely populated country like
Japan, and only one tenth of the per capita runoff in the United-States.
Therefore, while plans for construction of additional dams, river improvement.
projects and expensive regional systems are underway, increasing attention is
being given by the Government to the conservation of water resources. This
has resulted in some efforts to coordinate water resource allocation, planning
and conservation, and the implementation of leak detection and control
programs to reduce water lost in the distribution systems.

Page 2
4.        However, conservation programs like leak detection are not a one-
time operation. Unless the municipalities implement and continuously monitor
such programs, misused, unmetered, wasted or leaked water from the
distribution networks could represent up to half of the water suppLied (as is
the case now in Seoul City). Incentives are therefore required for the
municipalities to conserve water and control leakage. One strategy to achieve
this would be provided by setting meaningful levels of bulk water tariffs, as
proposed under this study. These tariffs would in turn be reflected in the
retail water tariffs, providing incentives to each family to reduce water
wastage and unnecessary water consumption, and promote its efficient use.
This is very important considering that under present projections each family
of five persons uses 450 liters per capita per day (including overall
industrial and commercial use, and unaccounted-for-water), and wouLd require,
on the average, 820 metric tons of water per year. The implementation of
appropriate bulk water tariffs would have a large impact on reducing excessive
and wasteful water use, and reduce the need for additional investments. This
could eventually result in lower water tariffs for all.
5.        The actual cost of water can vary widely even between neighboring
municipalities (for example, because of the differences in the pumping energy,
the quality of the water sources, the availability of underground sources,
etc.). Excluding land, water is the only real "local resource", which can
only be imported or exported, at a feasible price, over relatively short
distances. However, the same bulk water tariffs are being applied to all
municipalities in Korea at present. This has some favorable elements: cross
subsidization, administrative simplicity, and political acceptance. However,
since the cost of providing water is extremely high in some areas (for example
in some coastal regions), the subsidy element may be counterproductive, and
could promote excessive industrial, commercial and residential water
consumption in areas where it is too expensive co provide additional supply.
Excessive subsidies in such areas may create development problems in the near
future. The rationale for uniform tariffs or other tariff alternatives needs
to be studied. It is therefore important to analyze the cost of water for
each independent regional project, and provide recommendations on pricing
policies and the advantages or disadvantages of a policy of equal prices, and
of other alternatives, like surcharges in zones where the water is too
expensive, or the provision of basic water needs (perhaps 50 liters per day
multiplied by the total population in each city) at a subsidized rate, with
the additional wacer supply being provided at its real cost.
6.        At present there is no clear analysis of the rationale for the
differential in pricing between raw and treated water. The main cost in some
of the regional systems (Metropolitan Region) is the extensive pipelines and
Large pumping expenditures; generally water is of such good quality that it
requires only very simple treatment or filtering and chlorination. Therefore
the capital and operational expenditures fcr water treatment would only add
about 30% to the cost of raw water. However the present tariffs for bulk
treated water are more than twice the tariffs for bulk raw water. This
creates disincentives for the purchase of treated water by the
municipalities. In this situation municipalities prefer to have their own
treatment plants, which results in duplicated and inefficient investments,
while the capacity of regional systems may not be fully utilized. Therefore,



- 81 -                              ANNEX 13
Page 3
it is important to establish the optimal level for the raw and treated water
charges which would reduce or eliminate these problems. Moreover most of the
present charges are fixed (based on the contracted volume of water), while
actual charges for the water used are small (the fixed charges are almost 10
times the variable charges for treated water). This seems difficult to
justify on economic grounds.
7.        ISWACO has commissioned a tariff study with the Korean Industrial
Development Institute (KID), the main emphasis of which is the financial
impact on ISWACO of the Geum Gang system. These Terms of Reference expand the
scope of the study, and look for a tariff policy that would be acceptable to
the Co,ernment, achieve the social and economic objectives of providing water
serviceis, promote conservation and provide a satisfactory financial situation
for ISWACO.
Objective
8.        The main o'bjaccive is to expand the coverage of the tariff study
being undertaken by KIDi to:
(a)  promote the efficient use and conservation of expensive water
resources through reasonable pricing policies that would reduce
unnecessary demand or wouled help to finance the construction of
additionaL capacity;
(b)  heLp Government to formulate policy, criteria and implementation
guidelines for setting bulk water tariffs both for raw and treated
water;
(c)  promote balanced and sustainable industrial and commercial growth,
based on cost recovery of the water services provided;
(d)  reduce unnecessary or counterproductive subsidies between water
supply systems; and
(e)  improve the tariff structure, achieving a better balance between
fixed and variable charges, and introducing simple criteria that
would allow subsidies or low prices for basic consumption but
discourage water wastage.
Scope of Work and Execution of the Study
9.        The study should analyze the cost of -'lk water provided by ISWACO
in each regional system, and provide recommendaticns for pricing bulk-provided
raw and treated water. It should also analyze the regional differences in the
cost of water supply and provide advice on the advantages or disadvantages of
a uniform pricing policy and alternatives to this policy. The study should
consider: the cost to the economy of meeting the increasing demand for water
(and corresponding sewage disposal), the need to promote a balanced
development of the country, ISWACO's requirements to help finance additional
capacity and to cove. the operation and debt service of existing systems, and
other social and economic considerations. The study should recommend a policy



- 82 -
ANNEX 13
Page 4
and well-defined criteria to set the average water charges (which should be
simple to implement and adapt later to changes in costs, demand or inflation),
and an improved tariff structure that would be acceptable on social and
economic grounds.
10.       The consultant should also use this policy and criteria to recommend
to the Covernment and ISWACO specific levels for raw and treated water
charges. The study would be implemented by ISWACO in coordination with the
Economic Planning (EPB) and the Ministry of Construction (MOC), and a draft
copy of the study would be. presented to the Bank for comments.
11.       The scope of work includes the following activities:
(a) gather data, including the review of-capital and operating expenses,
for raw and treated water in the different regional systems and the
analysis of proposed investment plans in new regional systems;
(b) analyze ISWACO's financial obligations and commitments, and its
present and forecasted financial statements for water services under
the present level of charges;
Cc) analyze policy options regarding the pricing of bulk water services
(including long-term marginal pricing), their advantages or
disadvantages,and their financial, economic and social implications
and consequences;
Cd) make detailed analysis of the policy of uniform charges at the
national level, its advantages or disadvantages, the impact on
balanced development of the country, and the justification and
magnitude of cross-subsidies between water users;
(e) recommend policy options for water pricing which would address the
disadvantages of present policies and would be consistent with
national policies and priorities; and
(f) propose a revised tariff structure for raw and treated water.
12.       The study would be coordinated with EPB's Infrastructure Planning
and Price Divisions. The conclusion of the draft study would be reviewed by
all interested parties (para. 10). Based on comments received, the consultant
should complete the study and provide final recommendations for bulk water
pricing policies. The consultant should then apply the recommended policies
to the specific data of the regional systems, and recommend raw and treated
water charges. Financial alternatives would then be examined to assess the
impact of the recommended charges, not only on ISWACO's financial viability
but also on the affordability of water to end-users, the effect on demand, and
the economic and social implications of the recommended charges.
.13.       The final report should include ISWACO's financial projections
between 1983 and 1992 under the alternative policy options considered, the
impact on water demand and investments, the advantages or disadvantages of all
the options considered, a revised tariff structure, and a clear methodology

that could be used to implement the recommended cariff policy if the demand,
inflation, or investments were changed.
