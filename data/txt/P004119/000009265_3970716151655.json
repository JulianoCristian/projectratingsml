to 25 municipalities around Seoul City and within\n            the Metropolitan Region.  This will improve water service to\n            about 5 million persons and provide the capacity to serve\n            1.1 million additional persons by 1991.  The project will\n            extract water from the Han river, upstream of Seoul, to be\n            treated in three treatment plants before distribution to the\n            municipalities. The project includes two water intakes,\n            three booster pumping stations, two treatment plants, some\n            175 km of pipes (1,000 to 2,400 mm in diameter) and 14 km of\n            tunnels, and construction supervision.  Studies will be\n            carried out to improve the organization of water and\n            sewerage services in the Metropolitan Region, to establish\n            corporate planning within ISWACO and to set policies for\n            bulk water tariffs at a national level."}, "docdt": "1985-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
