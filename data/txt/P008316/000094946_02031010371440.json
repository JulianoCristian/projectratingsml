The improvement in the power system's\n            stability and safety, the turn in Bulgaria's dependence\n            on foreign supplies and reserve capacity, the positive\n            trends in the sector's finances, and the\n            government's continuing commitment to develop the\n            sector indicate that the benefits of the project are\n            sustainable. Both the World Bank's and the\n            Borrower's performances were overall satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: Adhere to long-term\n            development goals. In the case of Bulgaria, the economic\n            crisis and hyperinflation fueled the government with\n            numerous reasons for which they did not want to meet the\n            tariff covenant. The Bank's project team held strong to\n            the commitment to encouraging the government to meet the\n            financial covenants of the loan and showed the government\n            that it could be met and that benefits could be derived. A\n            second lesson is to assess implementation capacity. The\n            national electric company's (NEK) lack of capacity to\n            deal with external financiers such as the Bank could have\n            been addressed through specific technical assistance.\n            Addressing implementation capacity up front may have also\n            mitigated the problem of high staff turnover. A detailed\n            assessment of implementation capacity, including\n            procurement, would have helped to avoid delays. Third,\n            remain flexible to adapt to emerging trends/opportunities.\n            The Bank's flexibility in allowing changes in the\n            project's scope expanded the project's benefits."}, "docdt": "2001-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
