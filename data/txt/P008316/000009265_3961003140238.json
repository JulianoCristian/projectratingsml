thus reducing supply disruptions; (b) improve\n            voltage control and frequency regulation; (c) realign the\n            level and structure of electricity tariffs to the level and\n            structure of electricity tariffs to rationalize consumption\n            of electricity, reduce imports, reduce the pollution\n            associated with electricity generation, and mobilize\n            resources for the Natsionalna Elektricheska Kompania (NEK);\n            (d) improve and depoliticize the tariff setting system; (e)\n            reduce the need for electricity imports or other high cost\n            sources to meet peak demand; (f) reorient the operations of\n            NEK along more commercial lines; and (g) strengthen dam\n            safety at the Belmeken and Chaira dams and associated saddle\n            dam.  The project consists of three components.  First is\n            improvement of the supervisory control and transmission\n            network systems for NEK.  The second is completion of units\n            3 and 4 of the pumped storage project at Chaira, which is\n            owned by NEK.  Third is technical assistance, primarily to\n            help NEK in operating more efficiently and in a more\n            commercial manner."}, "docdt": "1993-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
