MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 24.4 million
(US$35.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed Credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity, to help finance an
Agricultural Support Services Project. Part of the proceeds of the Credit
(SDR 7.08 million) will be relent to farmers at the prevailing market rate
(presently about 16.5% p.a.) via a Foundation to be established by the
Government. The Overseas Development Agency of the United Kingdom (ODA) will
provide about US$14.7 million equivalent to support implementation of the
technology transfer, training, and seed industry development components
through provision of technical assistance, training costs and a small amount
of equipment.
2.        Sector Background.  Bangladesh has a population of about 110
million, growing at an annual rate of about 2.5X. The majority of people
depend on agriculture for a living. Self-sufficiency in foodgrains has been a
central objective of the Government's agricultural strategy since
independence. After a period of strong public sector involvement, the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has recently shifted the emphasis of its sector
strategy towards economic liberalization and is encouraging participation from
the private sector in a range of agricultural support services. Public
expenditures are being reoriented in favor of low-cost irrigation, and flood
control and drainage investments, and GOB is seeking ways to improve the cost-
effectiveness and performance of research, extension and credit services.
Agriculture dominates the economy, generating about 501 of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), employing some 75? of the labor force, and accounting for about
602 of export earnings. Foodgrain crops dominate, with rice covering over
three-fourths of the 9.6 million hectares (ha) cropped area, and crops
contribute about 75? of agricultural GDP, the balance coming from fishery,
forestry and livestock. In this densely populated country there is negligible
scope for increasing the cultivable area. Growth must therefore come from
increasing cropping intensity through continuing expansion of the irrigated
area, and by increasing crop yields. The scope for increased irrigation is
large, and the National Water Plan has estimated that an additional 2.8
million ha could be irrigated through low cost groundwater and surface-water
investments. Aggressive pursuit of irrigation expansion is the pillar of the
Government's agricultural strategy for the next decade, a strategy strongly
endorsed by IDA (para 4).
3.        Full development of the irrigation potential and its continued use
mainly for winter rice, would, at present yields, generate an additional
8-10 million tons of foodgrains.  The potential also exists to raise the
average yield of irrigated winter rice. Currently at 2.4 tons/ha, a figure of
about 3.2 tons/ha could be within the reach of the average farmer provided
adequate inputs and improved varieties were readily available, and better crop
husbandry methods were adopted.  Significant national yield impr., ew.-nts will
become essential for growth as the potential for irrigation appvoache.
saturation. Also as this occurs, and irrigation water becomes izcrea'mngly

scarce, effectiveness of water use will become vital. Alternatives to winter
rice, a heavy water user, will then become more attractive. Supplementary
irrigation to the main flood season rice crop late in the growing season could
raise its low yield from about 1 ton/ha to perhaps 1.5 ton/ha. This would
give a return per unit of water higher than for winter rice. Also, there is a
small but rapidly expanding acreage of maize; and, with farmers achieving
yields of 2-3 tons/ha, this crop has the potential to become a part of the
main cropping system. Furthermore, opportunities exist for extending the use
of supplementary irrigation to non-rice crops. Around Dhaka and other large
towns, vegetable and fruit production is already established. Increased water
use will be instrumental in further developing production and the potential
for generating fresh and processed items. Achievement of the required
increases and improved effectiveness of water use will depend upon better
agricultural support services than currently exist, particularly for extension
and research.
4.        To capitalize on the rich potential in the sector and to achieve
sustainable growth levels that will promote food self-sufficiency and expand
exports, GOB is pursuirng a strategy that would: (a) further liberalize the
sale of minor irrigation equipment; (b, improve and reorient the agricultural
research and extension systems; (c) remove practices that restrict both the
importation of the major crop seeds and the involvement of private seed
companies in their supply; (d) strengthen the agricultural credit system
through policy and institutional reforms; and (e) establish policies that will
encourage private sector development of agro-business export opportunities.
In addition, GOB, in conjunction with the major foodgrain donors, is acting to
ensure that food aid policy is supportive of domestic agricultural growth.
5.        Over the past year, GOB, in close cooperation with IDA and the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), has developed a list of investments and input
requirements linked to an Action Program for Policy and Institutional Reforms
covering minor irrigation equipment and power tillers, complementary inputs,
foodgrain management and institutional reform. ADB is supporting this package
with a quick-disbursing Foodcrops Development Program Loan financing a broad
positive list of agricultural equipment and inputs. IDA plans to support the
reform program through four complementary projects designed to meet its
specific investment needs.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Strengthening support services is
part of IDA's overall strategy to develop the country's agricultural
potential. The strategy comprises interrelated activities in the area of
sector policies, especially in liberalization and deregulation of public
interests in minor irrigation, input supply, credit and support services. The
full success of each of these activities depends on satisfactory performance
of parallel activities. These comprise (a) the joint ADB/IDA Action Program
for Policy and Institutional Reforms and the proposed project which will focus
on improving extension activities and seed supply and on promoting crop
diversification; (b) the proposed Shallow Tubewell and Low Lift Pump
Irrigation Project, which will finance simple, low cost capital investments by
farmers in shallow tubewells, low lift pumps and power tillers, sold "off the
shelfa by private dealers, without any public sector involvement in their
delivery/installation or operation; (c) the proposed National Minor Irrigation
Development Project, which will finance the more expensive and complex deep
tubewells which require organization of farmer groups, technical assistance
and public sector support in the initial stages; and (d) the proposed



- 3 -
Agricultural and Rural Credit Project, which will focus on improving the
performance of agricultural credit institutions and finance institutional
credit for a wide range of agricultural investments. IDA's continued
involvement in support services will also help GOB's decision-making process
in this area, particularly in the restructuring of agricultural extension
service institutions.
7.        Project Objectives.  The project's primary objectives are to
increase agricultural production, especially for foodgrains, and to initiate a
diversification process aimed at introducing of high-value export crops. To
this end, the project will support an institutional reform process aimed at:
(a) making the technology tra:isfer process more responsive to farmer needs and
improving its outreach capability so that all sections of the rural community,
including women, have access to improved technology; (b) upgrading extension
training; (c) increasing the availability of improved seeds to farmers by
ensuring the full participation of private seed companies iin the supply of
both food and cash crop seeds and removing restrictive seed regulations; (d)
improving homestead production through non-governmental organizations (NGO)
experienced in this area; and (e) improving the cost-effectiveness of public
sector services through more efficient outreach activities and rationalization
of staffing structures. Through a pilot component, the project also aims to
promote crop diversification and agro-business opportunities to increase the
production options for farming enterprises.
8.        Project Description.  The project has an estimated total cost of
US$59.4 million, and is designed for implementation over seven years.
Specifically, it would: (a) improve the cost-effectiveness of technology
transfer methods, especially those related to foodgrains by intensified and
broadened outreach techniques (e.g., on-farm demonstrations and field days,
media campaigns, special Upazilla (local government unit) initiatives in
technology development and transfer with matching funds, and transport and
equipment (base cost US$16 million); (b) upgrade training for all Department
of Agricultural Extension's (DAE) staff cadres, particularly in irrigated
agriculture (e.g., local and foreign training, post-graduate facilities,
transport and equipment (US$12 million); (c) expand the breeder seed
operations of the main research institutes and introduce regulatory reforms to
improve seed industry efficiency (US$2.2 million); and (d) intensify
production of homestead crops through contracts with NGOs experienced in this
area (US$4.3 million). The project also includes a pilot component for the
development of horticultural export production by small farmers (US$10.1
million). The project would furthermore provide US$5.1 million in technical
assistance to support the technology transfer, training, and seed industry
components. The project would have national coverage. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (IBRD No. 22658) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR), No. 9071-BD and dated April 9, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
9.        Project Implementation Arrangements.  The Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) would have overall responsibility for project implementation.
Individual components would be implemented by the following agencies:
(a) Technology Transfer, Training and Homestead Production by DAE and MOA's



- 4 -
Project Implementation Wing; (b) Seed Industry Development by the Bangladesh
Agricultural Research Institute, the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, and
the Bangladesh Jute Research Institute; and (c) Agro-business Development by
MOA through the Foundation to be established for the purpose. ODA would
provide technical assistance for execution of the Technology Transfer,
Training, and Seed Industry Development components; and the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) is expected to provide, through a
parallel project, technical assistance for the establishment and operation of
the Foundation.
10.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, agreements were obtained that GOB
would: (a) by December 31, 1991, develop a program acceptable to IDA to
improve the effectiveness of the DAE; (b) engage consultants by
December 1, 1991; (c) by October 31, 1991, take all actions required to
establish the autonomous role and the broader structure of the District
Technical Committees; (d) by March 31, 1992 prepare a detailed training needs
assessment and training action plan and by June 30, 1992 include the action
plan in the National Training Plan; (e) by October 31, 1991 establish a Seed
Wing in MOA; 1f) by June 30, 1992 restrict the Bangladesh Agricultural
Development Corporation (BADC) to the wholesale marketing of its seeds through
private dealers; (g) by June 30, 1992, allow the private and public sectors to
import freely, under normal quarantine controls, all types of crop seeds for
testing; (h) by June 30, 1992 furnish to IDA, for comments, the proposed
amendments to the seed regulations and, promptly thereafter, take all
necessary steps to issue amendments, taking into account the Borrower's Draft
Seed Policy dated July 1990; (i) by October 31, 1991 allow private seed
companies equal access with BADC to breeder and foundation seeds produced by
the research institutes; (j) cause the Foundation to carry out the agro-
business development through a subsidiary agreement whose terms would be
acceptable to IDA; and (k) in consultation with IDA undertake a mid-term
review by June 30, 1994.
11.       As conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Credit, GOB will:
(a) approve the Project Proforma; and (b) make effective the cofinancing
agreement with ODA. Disbursement conditions against expenditures incurred
under the project's agro-business component will be that: (a) the Foundation
has been established and GOB has executed a subsidiary agreement with the
Foundation satisfactory to IDA; and (b) GOB has entered into an agreement with
USAID for the financing of the establishment and operation of the Foundation.
12.       Women in Development.  Women are the main beneficiaries of the
project's homestead production component, which is designed to help women in
increasing agricultural production on the homestead. This will be achieved
through the training of selected extension staff to work as women program
coordinators in each Upazilla, and through designing suitable activities.
Women program coordinators will organize field days, on-farm and homestead
demonstrations, and meetings with NGOs which have been successful in promoting
such activities.
13.       Benefits.  At the farm level, a more responsive extension system
and improvements in the quality and availability of seeds are expected to lead
to better use of resources, especially in irrigated agriculture. This would

reduce production costs and increase yields and income per unit area of
cropped land. Determining a precise level of benefits is not possible because
benefits from extension cannot be isolated from those accruing from increased
input use and other factors.
14.       The expected institutional benefits in extension would include:
(a) improved farmer responsiveness; (b) a broader outreach in the rural
community including the use of NGOs in an effort to better reach women; (c)
better educated staff; and (d) improved cost-effectiveness, which would allow
the service to become fiscally sustainable. As a precedent for deliberate
staff reductions in the public extension service, the project would set the
stage for similar measures of increasing efficiency in other agricultural and
water resources departments and parastatal agencies. For the seed industry,
project benefits would be derived from improving the competitiveness of the
local private sector seed companies and assisting the implementation of GOB's
planned seed industry reforms. These reforms would streamline the importation
of improved crop varieties and ensure the'r rapid availability to farmers,
improve the performance of public sector seed producing entities, and open the
way for multi-national seed companies to invest in Bangladesh. The agro-
business component and channeling project support through a foundation would
constitute an innovative attempt to stimulate the development of private
sector enterprises. It would develop the potential for zepeater operations
both in agriculture and other sectors.
15.       Risks.  First, although extension staff reductions have been agreed
by GOB, such reductions will be politically sensitive. Implementation of the
reduction program is, however, practical because of GOB's strong interest in
increasing efficiency and its commitment to reducing staff through attrition.
Second, there is a possible risk that GOB's local taka allocations made
through the Annual Development Plan may be insufficient to utilize the full
IDA funding as projected in the SAR's implementation schedule. This project
is a part of GOB's core funded development program, and as such will have a
priority ranking for access to local taka resources. Third, any re-
intervention of GOB in agricultural inputs distribution and sale would sharply
increase farmer costs and interfere with the timely availability of inputs.
There is a low probability of this happening given the present scope of
private sector involvement and its operational efficiency. Fourth, farmer
foodgrain prices could come under severe downward pressure if the present
accelerated production trends continue and adjustments are not made in food
aid policies. Food aid donors and GOB are already working on this issue.
Finally, there is a risk that the project's pilot component for agro-business
development may not take shape, since (a) the Foundation has yet to be
established; (b) there may be problems in reaching agreement on a satisfactory
subsidiary agreement between GOB and the Foundation for the channeling of IDA
funds; and/or (c) the agreement between USAID and GOB on financing the
establishment and operations of the Foundation may not be signed. To guard
against this risk, suitable disbursement conditions have been included in the
Development Credit Agreement. An Environmental Assessment was carried out for
the project and the three other agricultural development projects to be
supported by IDA during FY91 (para. 6) and its results were used to design the
environmental features of this project. While Lhe project will not have a
significant negative environmental impact, provisions have been made for
continuous monitoring of environmental aspects.
