          improve the impact of agricultural support services as a\n            means to raising the standard of living in the farming\n            community as a whole.  The needs of women involved in\n            agriculture will be specifically addressed.  Subsidiary\n            objectives are to: (a) make the technology transfer process\n            more responsive to farmer needs; (b) improve the outreach\n            capability of the extension service; (c) encourage the full\n            participation of private sector seed companies in the supply\n            of both food and cash crop seeds; and (d) remove restrictive\n            seed regulations so as to provide farmer access to a\n            complete range of imported improved crop varieties. Through\n            a pilot component the project also aims at promoting\n            agro-business opportunities to increase the production\n            options for farming enterprises.  At the same time the\n            project will support the compatible objective of improving\n            the cost-effectiveness of public sector services.  These\n            objectives will be achieved through:  (a) a program of\n            on-farm demonstrations and farmer field days; (b)\n            farmer-information media campaigns; (c) special Upazilla\n            initiatives in technology development and transfer; (d)\n            upgrading training; (e) expansion of the breeder seed\n            operations and regulatory reform to improve seed industry\n            efficiency; (f) technical assistance and institutional\n            development; and (g) a pilot component for the development\n            of horticultural export production among small farmers."}, "docdt": "1991-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
