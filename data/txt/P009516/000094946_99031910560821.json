The key lessons learned are: a) Institutional\n            reform of this kind of projects can only be achieved when\n            there is a commitment to change by the key stakeholders and\n            when there is a formal policy statement and implementation\n            strategy. b) Innovative components such as Hortex and the\n            homestead improvement programs can only succeed when the\n            officials in charge are committed to the proposed\n            objectives. c) For a project like this, which contains\n            innovative components, very careful and intensive\n            supervision is essential. d) This project's\n            achievements in policy and institutional reform benefited\n            from the services of consultants to assist in developing\n            strategies and addressing specific technical and managerial\n            issues. e) In this project, the shared experiences during\n            the early years of the project in attempting to implement\n            the initially agreed reforms and a successful pilot program\n            under the project helped to create \"ownership\" for\n            the further reforms introduced following the mid-term\n            review. f) In-service training is very beneficial for staff\n            at all levels within a national extension service, and the\n            most effective training is done at the field level. g) When\n            individuals are to pay for equipment themselves, procurement\n            requirements should permit buyer's choice subject to\n            appropriate limitations."}, "docdt": "1998-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
