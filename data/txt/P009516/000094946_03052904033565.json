audit downgrades the Implementation\n            Completion Report's (ICR) assessment of the\n            Agricultural Research Management Project (ARMP) to\n            moderately unsatisfactory project outcomes, to an unlikely\n            sustainability, and with an unsatisfactory Bank performance,\n            though concurs with the ICR on modest institutional\n            development impacts, and satisfactory Borrower performance\n            ratings. Similarly, the audit downgrades the Agricultural\n            Support Services Project (ASSP) ICR's ratings, to\n            moderately satisfactory project outcomes, and considers\n            sustainability as non-evaluable, while concurs with a modest\n            institutional development impact, and satisfactory\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower. The lessons, largely\n            consistent with findings on research, and extension in other\n            countries, suggest the diagnosis of constraints emerging\n            during project preparation, should lead to a set of reforms\n            identifying the minimum for an effective project, clearly\n            articulated, within the evolving Bank management\n            documentation. In addition, the adoption of new unified\n            national extension approaches, should be based on evaluated\n            cost-effectiveness data, though it is important to maintain\n            experimentation with alternative approaches to further\n            pursue cost-effectiveness. While cutting research costs by\n            institutional rationalization (i.e., closing of stations) is\n            politically difficult, it is seldom addressed by neither the\n            Bank, nor the Borrower, yet should be pursued. Therefore, a\n            thorough analysis of project financial sustainability should\n            be considered at appraisal time, rather than focusing mainly\n            on funding during implementation. Other lessons address the\n            need to focus on procurement issues based on intensive early\n            supervision, and, introduction of computerized management\n            systems, should be matched to the level of computer skills,\n            and technical support capacity."}, "docdt": "2003-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
