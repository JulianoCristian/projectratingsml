Assistance\n            (TA) Project for Planning and Economic Management Project\n            for Benin were as follows: the Bank's performance at\n            the project identification, preparation and appraisal stage\n            was unsatisfactory. The Bank's supervision performance\n            was also unsatisfactory. The borrower's performance\n            during project implementation was clearly deficient. The\n            outcome of the TA project is unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: first the project was too large and\n            complicated to be managed by one project coordinator. It had\n            too many components to be managed by one task manager.\n            Secondly, a closer and more coherent monitoring by the Bank\n            of the indicators of success during implementation will be\n            desirable. Also needed is more Bank active participation in\n            preparation of project decisions such as the formulation of\n            training programs and assessment of training impact. It is\n            important to ensure that the conditions of services and\n            administrative procedures on the Borrower's side do not\n            constrain the fulfillment of TA project objectives. In\n            particular, reasonable staff stability, clear indicators of\n            how TA would be integrated into counterparts' work\n            programs and impact their job performance, and a minimal\n            incentive framework that should favor learning on the part\n            of counterparts and facilitate skills transfer on\n            expertise's side should be addressed by both the Bank\n            and the Borrower during TA project design."}, "docdt": "1995-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
