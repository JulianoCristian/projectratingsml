FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
CAMEROONS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION PROJECT
SU?.ARY
i.        The Federal Government of Cameroon has asked the Bank and the
Association to help finance the development program of the Cameroons
Develop.ment Corporation (CAMDEV).
ii.       CAMDEV, a statutory authority of the Government of West
Cameroon has 22,400 hectares of plantations under oil palm, rubber,
bananas, cocoa, tea and pepper, including 5,500 hectares of immature plant-
ings.  The development program, which would expand the total area to about
33,100 hectares by the end of 1974 is concentrated mainly on oil palm.
The total cost of the program from 1967 through 1974, excluding interest,
is about US$25 million, including costs associated with bringing existing
immature plantings into production and the replacement of equipment. An
estimated additional US$4 million will be required to bring immature areas
at the end of 1974 into production and to provide the necessary processing
facilities. Thus the total cost of the program is estimated at US$29
million.
iii.      The project proposed for Bank and IDA financing from 1967 through
1974 comprises the development of approximateiy 11,500 hectares, consisting
of 8,500 hectares of new planting and 3,000 hectares of replanting, bringing
into production the existing 5,500 hectares of immature plantings and the
provision of processing facilities and other equipment. The cost of the
project from 1967 through 1974 is estimated to be US$19 million, and an esti-
mated additional US$3 million will be required to complete the project thus
bringing the estimated total cost to US$22 million.
iv.       CAMDEV's financial history is poor and its position has been
extremely difficult due to low earnings and a high proportion of debt
financing. However, the capital structure has been reorganized and the
Corporation has been placed on a sound basis to carry out its future devel-
opment. The management is good.
v.        CAMDEV's total capital requirements from 1967 through 1974 amount
to US$31 million, including interest financed during this period and in-
creases in working capital. This would be met by the proposed IDA credit
of US$11 million and Bank loan of US$7 million, self-generated funds, and a
loan from the European Economic Community of US$6 million.
vi.       The project is suitable for the proposed Bank/IDA financing. The
IDA credit of US$11 million would be made to the Federal Government which
would contribute the proceeds to the Corporation as equity. The Bank loan
of US$7 million would be made to CAMDEV for a term of 30 years with a grace
period of 8-1/2 years. The Bank loan would be disbursed after the IDA
credit has been fully drawn. Interest and commitment charges would be
financed until the end of the disbursement period. Since any plantation
investment program must be reviewed annually in the light of changing com-
modity prices, agricultural conditions and other factors, disbursement would
be subject to the Bank's approval of annual revised estimates for the com-
plete development program.



FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
CAMEROONS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION PROJECO'C
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In July 1965 the Government of Cameroon applied to the Bank for a
loan to help finance the development program of the Cameroons Development
Corporation (CAMDEV). A mission consisting of Messrs. Darnell, Whyte,
Andreu, Humphrey and Akhurst (FAO Consultant), visited West Cameroon between
November 21 and December 12, 1965, to appraise this project. As a result
of discussions with CAMDEV, which took account of information not available
at the time the application was made, the program was modified to consist
of the planting or replanting between 1967 and 1974 of approximately 12,300
hectares of oil palm, 2,500 hectares of rubber, 1,000 hectares of tea and
70 hectares of pepper. The development program also includes housing for
labor, roads, railways, vehicles and factories required both for existing
areas and the new planting. The European Economic Community (EEC) is ex-
pected to make a loan to cover the costs of a 4,400 hectares block of oil
palm together with processing facilities and the balance of the program
would be covered by Bank/IDA financing and self-generated fùnds. This report
recommends that the Bank/IDA financing should cover CAMDEV's requirements
between 1967 and 1974. Expenditure on the planting programa after 1974 is
assumed to be covered by self-generated funds. In some years between 1967
and 1974, CAMDEV's requirements will exceed the cost of the planting program
mentioned above since there are substantial areas of immature crop which
need funds to enable them to be brought to maturity. This situation was
mainly caused by the fact that CAMDEV became ineligible for an equity con-
tribution of L 2 million from the Colonial Development Corporation (CDC)
when West Cameroon left the British Commonwealth. This contribution was
expected to follow a loan of E 1 million made by CDC in 1960 for the develop-
ment of CAMDEV. Until 1970, CAMDEV's surpluses available for bringing
existing immature areas 'nto production will be insufficient to cover their
requirements. The Bank and IDA will help to finance this gap in addition
to the new program.
2. BACKGROUND
General
2.01      At the end oa the First World War the former German colony of
Kamerun was put under League of Nations mandate. The League gave Great
Britain a mandate to administer the western part, in the form of two trust
territories called Northern Cameroons and Southern Cameroons. France was
given a mandate to administer Eastern Cameroons. The British trust terri-
tories were administered as regions of Nigeria. In 1961 a plebiscite was
held in the British trust territories. The people of Southern Cameroons,
in which all CAMDEV plantations are situated, voted to -loin the newly inde-
pendent republic of East Cameroon to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon,
while those in Northern Cameroons voted to join Nigeria. After unification
Southern Cameroons was renamed West Cameroon. The newly formed Federal
Republic of Cameroon came into existence on October 1, 1961. Tle unifica-
tion of the two parts of the Republic has been slow, but it is likely to



accelerate in the near future. Fiscal harmonization took place during
1966 and at the same time the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa
comprising Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Central African Republic and Congo
(Brazzaville) came into existence. This will progressively create a common
external tariff, with preferences for countries of the European Economic
Community (EEC). The countries of the Customs and Economic Union will enjoy
free entry for most of their products into the EEC under the Association
Convention of Yaounde of 1963.
2.02      The economy of West Cameroon is almost entirely agricultural.
CAMDEV is the largest single enterprise with 75 per cent of the plantation
land and 9 per cent of the total cultivated land, providing 30 per cent of
the region's exports. CAMOEV's development program forms an important part
of the total investment program for the region envisaged in the five-year
development plan 1966-1970 of Cameroon. The Corporation's proposed develop-
ment expenditure between 1966 and 1970 amounts to CFAF 3.6 billion as com-
pared with projected total public investment of CFAF 16 billion and private
investment of CFAF 6 billion in the region. Over two-thirds of CAMDEV's
investment expenditures between 1967 and 1974 will be on the development of
oil palm. This, on present projections, is the most profitable tree crop
that can be grown there under prevailing conditions. It also fits in well
with the government's plans for the development of smallholder production
through nucleus estates.  CAMDEV will have an important role to play both in
the management of such nucleus estates and in the subsequent marketing of the
produce.  The development program of CAMDEV thus makes up an important part
of the development plans for the region as a whole.  It will also make a
substantial contribution to the foreign exchange earnings of Cameroon as a
whole, since CAMDEV provides about 5 per cent of the Federal Republic's
export earnings.
The Corporation
2.03      The Cameroons Development Corporation, established in 1946, is a
statutory authority of the Government of West Cameroon. Its Board is
appointed by the Prime Minister of West Cameroon and the Financial Secre-
tary is an ex officio member. The function of the corporation is to "secure
the development of such lands as the Prime Minister of West Cameroon may
from time to time place under their control and management".
2.04      At the beginning of the Second World War, the British Custodian
of Enemy Property, for the second time in the century, took over the German-
owned plantations in what was then the British Trust Territory of Southern
Cameroon. These plantations lay mainly on the southern and southwestern
slopes of Mt. Cameroon. After the war, CAMDEV was set up as a statutory
body to manage and develop these estates on behalf of the Government.
Throughout its life CAMDEV has been plagued by financial problems. Most
plantations are financed by risk capital. CAMDEV, however, was forced to
finance its development entirely by self-generated funds and sporadic long-
term borrowings. Repeatedly, development programs were started, only to be
eut back through shortages of funds. Considering this hand-to-mouth exis-
tence, CAMDEV managed surprisingly well between 1947 and 1955. In these



- 3 -
years the main emphasis was on bananas with some oil palm, rubber, tea,
cocoa and pepper. lowever, from 1955 onwards the area under bananas began
to decline, largely due to the ravages of Panama disease.
2.05      Until the end of 1958, CAMDEV's expansion was largely limited to
what it could finance out of earnings. However, the year 1959 was a disas-
trous one for the Corporation. Wind and storm losses together with flooding,
pests and a number of diseases had a calamitous effect on the banana crop.
The loss for that year was E 587,000 (CFAF 402 million). It became clear in
1959 that external finance would be needed for future development and nego-
tiations were begun between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the
Government of Southern Cameroons on the one hand and the then Colonial
Development Corporation (CDC) on the other. The outcome was that CDC agreed
to invest E,3 million in CAMDEV, one of the conditions being that CDC became
their Managing Agents. It was also agreed that the area under bananas
would continue to be reduced and emphasis placed on permanent crops. A
loan agreement for E 1 million was signed in 1960 and the amount was drawn
between 1960 and 1962. The provision of the remaining E 2 million was made
conditional on the reconstitution of the Corporation as a joint stock
company. Before the reorganization could take place, the Southern Cameroons
joined the Cameroon Republic. The departure from the Commonwealth precluded
CDC from making further investments, so that the remaining E 2 million was
never committed and the reorganization was not effected. This led to
finencial difficulties, since the deveLopment program started with the ini-
tial loan had to be carried out without the aid of the remaining E 2 million.
However, CDC remained managing agents of CAMDEV.
2.06      CAMDEV has had mixed fortunes in recent years.  This can be seen
from the income statements and balance sheets from '962 to 1966 shown in
Annexes 1 and 2. In 1962 there was a loss of CFAF 219 million, the effect
of which was compounded by the Corporation having to pay its 1961 profit
of CFAF 33 million to the Government.
2.07      There was an improvement in 1963.  Although bananas had their
worst year ever and showed a net deficit on trading, increases in production
of rubber and palm products and the higher selling prices of the latter,
combined with generally lower production costs, resulted in a net profit of
CFAF 25 million. At the end of 1966 this amount was still owed to the
Government.
2.08      There was a setback in 1964 when the loss was CFAF 58.4 million
due to lower production of the three main crops. Bananas suffered from wind-
storm damage, palm products from adverse weather and rubber from a lower in-
tensity tapping system combined vith unofficial strikes. It was fortunate
that the lower production was partly coepensated for by much higher prices
for bananas and palm products. In 1964 an agricultural mission from the
Commonwealth Development Corporation visited West Cameroon to map out a de-
velopment program for CAMDEV.  The report of this mission was adopted by the
CAMDEV Board, and its result embodied in loan applications to the Bank and
EEC. External finance would have been needed to finance even the smallest
of development programs, since the poor earnings over the last five years
resulted in a continual cash shortage. In 1963 CAMDEV had to raise a loan



of CFAF 277 million locally from the Banque Camerounaise de Developpement (BCD)
and between 1963 and 1966, bank overdraft increased from CFAF 80 million to
CFAF 264 million, with a maximum of approximately CFAF 350 million in 1964.
There was no long-term capital available during this period. Capital expend-
iture had to be kept to a minimum, and a policy of "minimum replacement" was
adopted. In addition, some development expenditure on existing immature
acreage had to be neglected.
2.09      1965 was a better year.  With little price change and a much
larger crop, bananas showed a small surplus. The rubber price fell slightly,
but a 25 per cent increase in production produced a considerably higher
profit. The price for palm products continued to rise and profits on this
crop were at record levels. Tea production increased by 50 per cent and for
the first time made a significant contribution to CAMDEV's profits. The
Corporation's net profits for 1965 were CFAF 46.5 million.
2.10      The provisional results for 1966 show that CM4DEV achieved a small
profit of CFAF 17.4 million. As a result of lower sales and a drop in the
price of palm oil, the surplus on palm products fell sharply, but the loss
on bananas was eliminated and tea profits showed a useful increase. The
results on rubber, cocoa and pepper were about the same as in 1965.
2.11      At present, the Corporation's total concession is 88,545 hectares.
Of this, 22,411 are under crops, with 12,361 hectares under rubber, 8,220
hectares under oil palm, 1,014 hectares under bananas, 468 hectares under
cocoa, 321 hectares under tea and 27 hectares under pepper. This makes
CA1EV one of the largest tropical plantation enterprises in Africa.    CAMDEV
pays a rent of CFAF 24 million per year to the West Cameroon Government on
its total concession. At present, the Corporation employs about 12,000
people.  This labor force accounts for more than 20 per cent of the total
number of wage earners in West Cameroon.
2.12      In 1966 CAMDEV produced 12,000 metric tons of bananas, 6,700 metric
tons of rubber, 6,400 metric tons of palm oil, 209 metric tons of cocoa, 428
metric tons of tea, and 39 metric tons of pepper.  All the rubber and pepper,
and most of the palm products are sold on the London market. Bananas are
sold under a contract with Elders and Fyffe's, who guarantee to buy all
CAMDEV's production at a fixed price f.o.b. West Cameroon. At present, most
of the bananas are being exported to France.  Cocoa is sold through a govern-
ment marketing board, while the bulk of tea production is sold on the local
market, much of it being collected by merchants from the factory itself.
3. THE PROJECT
Definition
3.01      The project is part of CAMDEV's development program for the period
1967 to 1974 and consists of the planting or replanting of approximately
11,500 hectares of oil palm, rubber, tea and pepper, the bringing into pro-
duction of approximately 5,500 additional hectares of existing immature



- 5 -
plantings, and the provision of the necessary infrastructure, processing
facilities and other equipment. The project is in the southern part of West
Cameroon on CAMDEV's present concession.
3.02      The development program will be controlled by the General Manager
and management staff of CANLEV. Its main objective is to increase the pro-
duction and efficiency of CAMDEV, thereby making a major contribution to the
economy of the country. By 1984, when all projected plantings are at full
maturity, total annual production should be almost five times present
production.
3.03      In addition to the project, the program includes the planting of
4,380 hectares of oil palms which would be almost wholly financed by a loan
of US$6.4 million from the EEC. This loan bas been under discussion for
some time and is expected to be signed within a few months. The Bank loan
and IDA credit will not be made effective until a resolution of the Commission
of the EEC approving the EEC loan has been adopted.
The Planting Program
3.04      The main planting program will be completed in six years, though
tea planting will continue for eight years. The rubber program consists
mainly of the replanting of existing rubber areas. The oil palm program
consists of some replanting of existing palm area, some new planting on
existing old rubber plantations, on abandoned banana land, on secondary bush
land and on forest land. The tea and pepper development will all be on
abandoned banana land or on land formerly cleared for other crops. The
areas of each crop are shown below.

The detailed planting schedules for estates are shown in Annex 3 and the maps
show the location of the estates.
3.05      The allocation of specific crops to particular areas has been made
with proper consideration for rainfall, altitude, slope of land and soil
properties. In general, the agricultural and climatic conditions have proved



- 7 -
themselves to be excellent for the growing of rubber, oil palm, tea and
pepper. Fertilizers will be used on the basis of experience on different
soil types, fertilizer trials and chemical foliage analysis. There is ade-
quate technical information for the control of the existing major pests and
diseases. It has been decided that banana production is unlikely to be
profitable in the future and it will be phased out during 1968. This will
release 1,014 hectares for other crops.
Research
3.06      CAMDEV have their own research unit located at Ekona headed by a
Senior Research Officer respons-ble to the Agricultural Advisor of CAMDEV.
This unit has done valuable work in the past - much of it on bananas. At
present, the unit benefits considerably by its close association with the
French research institutes which have two staff members resident at Ekona.
These research institutes operate principally in the ex French territories
throughout West Africa and also in the remainder of the world. As a result
of its collaboration with these institutes, CAMDEV has access to comprehen-
sive research studies on related problems throughout the world, as well as
consulting privileges on any specific problems which may arise.
3.07      The CAMDEV research unit maintains a laboratory where soil and
leaf analyses are carried out. The Federal Government, who are responsible
for agricultural research in Cameroon, have agreed to post specialist staff
to Ekona to further strengthen the unit. These arrangements provide CAMDEV
with excellent research facilities which enable their techniques to be
continually improved.
Planting Material
3.08      Planting materials for all crops will be produced on CAMDEV
estates. Sufficient amounts for the program will be available except for
an estimated small deficiency of oil palm seeds in 1967, which can be made
up by purchases from the Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et
Oleaginaux (IRHO). IRHO is the French research institute specializing in
oils and oil seeds and has five experiment stations in West Africa including
one in Cameroon.
3.09      The tea seed garden planted on Tole estate in 1928 is the source
of all West Cameroon tea plants, and the good performance of Tole plantings
justified its use for tea stump planting in the tea extensions. Three
pepper varieties, which are already developing well at Bimbia estate, are to
be used as cuttings for new pepper plantings. Prom the great variety of
modern rubber clones available in West Cameroon, mostly imported from the
Far East, a choice has been made of four to be planted as budded stumps in
the rubber extension. Rubber budwood and stump nurseries have been estab-
lished on all rubber estates and, with annual replacements, ample numbers of
budded stumps are produced.  IRHO is collaborating with CA1DEV in supervising
the oil palm selection and breeding program, and high quality seedlings will
be available from the CAMDEV oil palm nurseries.

3.10      The adoption of new techniques for producing planting materials
for tea and rubber, together with new planting procedures, are likely to
lead to planting cost econormies and to earlier maturity.
Yields
3.11      The future production from the different ages of all plantings of
all the crops has been estimated, after taking account of present yields and
likely increases due to improved planting material, use of fertilizer and
better processing facilities. The yields used are given in Annex 4.
Labor
3.12      Tne peak agricultural labor requirements of the program will in-
crease considerably the current labor force of about 12,000. The Corporation
is confident that it will have no difficulty in recruiting the necessary
labor, some of which will be available locally, the rest being recruited from
the Bamenda area in the north of West Cameroon. In the past, the Corporation
has recruited considerable amounts of labor in the Bamenda area and have had
no difficulty in doing so, so long as potential recruits were satisfied that
they would have security of emuployment. With the training provided on the
estates, the new recruits have no difficulty in carrying out their tasks,
provided they are properly supervised. This supervision is judged to be
adequate.
Field Development Costs
3.13      The unit field development costs for each crop are shown in Annex
5, and total costs in Annex 6. These costs were agreed between the mission
and CAMDEV in the field and are based on CAMDEV's recent experience, and
are also in line with similar field costs for the same crops elsewhere.
They include the rise in basic wage rates averaging ten per cent which took
place in 1966. This rise compensates the labor force for the rise in the
cost of living caused by the fiscal harmonization of West and East Cameroon
taxes and duties, which took place during 1966. The development costs also
include a 15 per cent contingency provision, which should be adequate.
Processing Facilities and Other Fixed Assets
3.14      The additional factory and processing facilities and other fixed
assets which are concomitant with the crop area expansion have been phased
to use present facilities as long as possible.
3.15      The existing palm oil mills are operating well below 50 per cent
capacity. However, the increased production from the new plantings, to-
gether with the regrouping of the oil palm areas will mean that three new
mills will be required, including one for the EEC palm area. As a result of
the regrouping, one of the existing mills (Mpundu), which has outdated
equipment, is to be scrapped. New rubber processing plans require nine more
units by the time full maturity is reached (i.e. one factory per additional
1,000 tons of dry rubber). Because of the rapidly changing new development



- 9 -
in methods of presentation of natural rubber for world markets, final deci-
sion on the type of processing equipment to be installed will be left until
further information on the processes, i.e. dynat, hevea crumb, etc. becomes
available.
3.16      The main new development of tea on Essosong and Tombel estates
will require two new factories, while extensions to the existing Tole factory
will take in the crop from the Bulu planting. No elaborate equipment is
foreseen for pepper treatment at Bimbia, which will be conventionally sun
dried.
3.17      The movement after harvesting of the different crops into the
factories presents few problems. Within the principal estate areas, a
trolley rail system exists which will require some maintenance and replace-
ment expenditure, and extensions of the rail lines in two or three years time.
Use is also made of trucks, oil tankers, tractors and trailers, with some
barge transportation. Generally, this equipment has to be modernized, ex-
panded and some of it replaced. In terrain where mechanized land prepa-
ration is feasible, additional tractors and ancillary equipment are needed
to speed up the work. The schedule of additional fixed assets associated
both with the 1967-1974 planting program and with the increasing production
from present immature areas is shown in Annex 6. The composition, costs and
phasing of these assets are reasonable.
Total Investment Costs
3.18      The following table summarizes the field development costs and
costs of fixed assets during the period of the project (1967 to 1974) to-
gether with the costs after 1974 of bringing immature areas to production
and providing the necessary processing facilities. Total developments costs
of the project are estimated at CFAF 5,492 million (US$22.2 million) and of
the program at CFAF 7,201 million (US$29.1 million).

It is estimated that the foreign exchange costs amount to about 20 per cent
of the development costs and 85 per cent of' the cost of fixed assets - i.e.
about US$9.5 million from 1967 to 1974 or 50 per cent of the project costs
during that period. This figure does not include interest during the
development period.



M4arketinE_and Prices
3.19      The marketing arrangements for each crop and the price assumptions
used in forecasting the future earnings of the Corporation are described in
Annex 7. The present marketing arrangements were described in para. 2.12.
A convention was signed in October 1965 between the Federal Ports Authority
and the Corporation to bring about the transfer of the ports to the Ports
Authority. In August 1967, the quays, buildings and certain fixed assets
will be taken over by the Ports Authority. Stevedoring, lighterage and
allied activities will continue to be run by CAMDEV.
3.20      The unit price assumptions used to forecast CAMDEV's future earn-
ings have been based on IBRD Commodity Division forecasts after consultation
in the field with CAMDEV's staff.  Account has been taken of the harmoniza-
tion of the West and East Cameroon export duties, but no account has been
taken of future preferences which may become established in the countries
of the EEC. It is, of course, impossible to forecast commodity prices with
any degree of confidence, particularly over the 17 years which will elapse
before the final plantings of the new program reaclh full maturity. The
earnings projections have been based on a single price for each commodity
for each future year. However, the program itself does permit some flexi-
bility. Each year it will be revieved and future plantings determined in
the light of new price forecasts and cost estimates. In addition, there is
some flexibility in techniques. For example, rubber tapping techniques can
be varied in accordance with prevailing price levels. These might be adopted
if rubber prices fell to levels lower than those usedlin the projections.
For the purpose of the earnings projections, it has been assumed that all
CAMDEV's rubber, pepper and bananas and most of the palm products will be
exported, while all the tea will be sold on the home market.
4. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Present Financial Position
4.o1      Reference has been made in paragraphs 2.04 to 2.10 to CAMDEV's
continuous financial problems. These have resulted in its present poor
financial position with a heavy burden of indebtedness and no cash working
capital. The Corporation's cash difficulties were to some degree aggra-
vated by the operation of Clause 19 of the former CAMDEV Ordinance which
required the profit in any year to be paid to the West Cameroon Government
vithout any deduction for losses carried forvard or proper provision being
made for development. However, while the profit for 1963 will be paid to
the Government during 1967, assuirances have been received that no further
payments vill be made before December 31, 1975.
4.02      The obligation to pay its annual profits to the Government
encouraged CAMDEV to maximize its transfers to reserves. On the other hand
the Corporation vas unable to write off past losses. As a result the bal-
ance sheet figures given in Annex 2 for reserves, accumulated loss, amorti-
zation and provision for replanting are somewhat artificial. The following
is a summary of the provisional balance sheet at the end of 1966:

4.03      The debt shown in CAMDEV's balance sheét consists of US$7.7 mil-
lion equivalent long-term loans from the Governments of Nigeria and West
Cameroon and CDC, a US$1.1 million equivalent medium-term loan from the
Banque Camerounaise de Developpement (BCD) and of bank overdrafts totalling
US$1.0 million equivalent. The details of the loans are as follows:
Lender                Amount

Government of Federation
of Nigeria                        685            4%           1970 - 1987
Government of West
Cameroon                          519           4%           1970 - 1987
Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC)                 685            7.5%         1970 - 1987
Banque Camerounaise de
Developpement (BCD)               277            5.5%         1967 - 1968
TOTAL                 2 166
4.04      The Government loans arose out of the loans made by the Nigerian
Goverlnment between 1947 and 1956. When West Cameroon joined East Cameroon,
the total amount due to Nigeria was split and E 1,000,000 (US$2.8 million)
is now held by Nigeria and E 750,000 (US$2.1 million) by West Cameroon. The
Nigerian loan and other obligations to Nigeria are disputed by both the
Federal and West Cameroon Governients and no interest has been paid since
March 1964, although it has been accrued in the accounts. Assurances have
been received from the Federal Government that CAIDEV will be held harmless
from any payments on the Nigerian loan and that if payments are resumed by
CAMDEV they will be reimbursed by the West Cameroon Government which will be
issued with stock for a like amount.
4.o5      The BCD loan was made in 1963 at 5.5 per cent interest and is
repayable in 1967 and 1968. The CDC loan was drawn in several tranches at
varying interest rates, the average being 7.5 per cent; it is repayable in 18
annuities from 1970. The CDC loan was originally secured by a first charge
on the fixed assets and a floating charge on the current assets, but CDC has
agreed to give up this security in return for obtaining a guarantee from the
Government.
4.o6      The Corporation's overdraft at the end of 1966 was CFAF 264 mil-
lion. The total overdraft facility available to CAMDEV is CFAF 325 million
made up of CFAF 200 million from the Banque Centrale through the Societe
Camerounaise de Banque (SCB) which is newly established in Victoria and is
owned by the Federal Government and BCD, CFAF 60 million overdraft from
SCB and CFAF 65 million overdraft from Barclays Bank DCO.
Reorganization
4.07      In order to make CAMDEV's financial position less precarious it
was necessary not only to provide new capital on as generous terms as
possible but to undertake a reorganization of the Corporation's existing



- 14 -
capital structu e. In fact, a restructuring of the Corporation vas planned
in 1961 vhen it was anticipated that CDC would contribute equity capital,
but it was not effected.
4.o8      The main purposes of the reorganization, which has been agreed
with the Federal and West Cameroon Governments, are to provide CAMDEV with a
substantial proportion of fixed equity capital and to reduce its indebted-
ness. The following arrangements have been made:
(a) the amount of CFAF 519 million formerly due by
CA1l1DEV to West Cameroon has been converted into
equity capital. This capital is held in the name
of the Marketing Board of West Cameroon.
(b) as explained in paragraph 4.04, CAMDEV will be
held harmless from any payments in respect of the
debt shown as due to the Republic of Nigeria.
(c) the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit will be
contributed to CAMDEV as capital, issued in the
name of the Federal Government.
Accounting System
4.09      The Corporation has a satisfactory accounting organization headed
by a suitably qualified financial controller. As a result of discussions
between the Bank and CAMDEV and recommendations made by the Bank, a form
of accounts has been instituted which will both provide the necessary
costing and financial information to the Corporation's management and the
Bank and enable the goods financed out of the loan and credit to be
identified.
Audit
4.10      The audit is carried out by Akintola Williams & Co., a Nigerian
firm which replaced Peat, Marwick, Casselton Elliott, in 1964. The present
arrangements appear satisfactory and assurances have been received that
CAMDEV shall have its financial statements certified annually by an account-
ant or accounting firm acceptable to the Bank and shall promptly transmit
to the Bank certified copies of the financial statements and auditors report.
Depreciation and Amortization
4.11      The Corporation provides for depreciation on its buildings, instal-
lations and mechanical equipment on a straight-line basis using conservative
lives for each category of asset. Normally the Corporation also provides
annually for amortization of estate development costs but from 1961 through
1964 no provision was made as the accumulated amortization provision was
considered aeequate.
Insurance
4.12      The Corporation's insurance practices are sound and it maintains
adequate coverage against risks and liability.



- 15 -
Taxes and Duty
4.13      CAMDEV is liable to income tax but because of its low profits and
depreciation and investment allowances, no tax has been paid since 1948.
For the same reason CAMDEV is unlikely to incur any tax liability in the
foreseeable future.
4.14      The Corporation is liable for export duty on the value of its
crop proceeds. However, in the case of rubber no duty is payable below a
price of CFAF 120 per kilo and no provision has been made for payment of
export duty on rubber in the attached forecasts. Under the Federal Invest-
ment Code of 1964, undertakings of special importance to the economic devel-
opment of Cameroon can apply for exemption from import duties. Assurances
have been received from the Federal Government that CAMDEV will be exempt
from import duty on all goods imported by the Corporation for the program
until the end of 1975 with the exception of consumer goods for the use of
personnel, goods for resale and petrol, diesel and fuel oils.
Future Earnings
4.15      Estimated income statements for 1967-1982 are given in Annex 8.
They are based on the yield and price assumptions detailed in Annexes 4 and
7. Production costs have been estimated on the basis of historical and
current costs allowing for future wage increases and for improved production
techniques. Depreciation of fixed assets has been calculated on a straight-
line basis for each class of asset; the lives used are conservative. No
provision has been made for amortization of estates or for replanting but
the Corporation will make such annual provision as the directors deem
necessary.
4.16      The results shown by the earnings forecasts are poor until the
program comes into full production after 1977. The estimated fall in com-
modity prices causes a rapid decrease in the profits from rubber and, to a
lesser extent, from palm products. The trading surplus on rubber is esti-
mated to fall from CFAF 235 million in 1967 to about CFAF 103 million in
1975, after which it should remain at a little over this level. The surplus
from oil palms is shown to decrease from CFAF 283 million in 1967 to CFAF 139
million in 1971, but after that it should rise quickly to reach about
CFAF 965 million by 1982. Tea profits are estimated to be negligible for
the first five years and a loss is shown for the next two years, but there-
after tea should make an increasing contribution to overall profit. The
results from bananas, of which production will cease in 1968, and pepper
are not likely to affect future earnings materially.
4.17      After providing for administration expenses and interest, all of
which is charged to income, the statements show annual losses from 1970
through 1974 with a maximum of CFAF 201 million in 1973. After 1975, net
income after interest and dividends (which are assumed start in 1977) is esti-
mated to increase to CFAF 459 million by 1982.
4.18      The income forecasts present a gloomy picture for many years
ahead. However, the forecasts are based on conservative assumptions of
commodity prices and yields and include generous provision for production



- 16 -
costs and depreciation. The actual results may therefore improve consider-
ably on the forecasts, but even if they do not, the long-term prospects of
the Corporation are shown to be good.
Dividends
4.19      Assurances have been received that no dividends will be paid until
after December 31, 1975. Thereafter dividends will be paid by the directors
from the net profit remaining after they have set aside such sums to reserves
as they deem necessary or expedient. The forecasts assume that dividends
would be paid on total share capital as follows:
1977      -        4%
1978      -        5%
1979 and onwards - 6%
This dividend rate could be substantially higher if the results achieved are
in line with or better than the projected income statements.
Financing Plan
4.20      The proposed financing plan for the program, which is shown in the
statement of sources and applications of funds in Annex 9, assumes that the
Corporation's requirements will be met out of earnings and its other cash
receipts, the proposed IDA credit of US$11 million (CFAF 2,717 million), the
proposed Bank loan of US$7 million (CFAF 1,729 million) and the expected
loan from EEC.
4.21      In order to build up the equity capital of CAMDEV as quickly as
possible it is proposed to disburse the IDA credit first and it is estimated
that disbursements will be completed by the end of 1971. It has been ex-
plained in paragraph 4.08 that the proceeds of the credit will be contributed
as capital to the Corporation by the Government and the Government will also
bear the service charge on the credit.
4.22      It is estimated that the Bank loan will be disbursed between 1971
and 1974. It has been assumed that the loan will be at 6% interest with a
commitment charge of 3/8 of 1% and would be for a term of 30 years including
a grace period of 8-1/2 years. Both the interest and commitment charge would
be financed out of the loan during the grace period.
4.23      Since a plantation investment program must be reviewed annually
in the light of changing commodity prices, agricultural conditions and other
factors, it has been agreed that disbursements from the c.cedit and loan will
be determined each year for the following year after the Bank has reviewed
and approved the Corporation's estimates for that year and the remainder of
the program.
4.24      It has been assumed that the EEC loan of US$6.4 million will be
disbursed between 1968 and 1974. Interest would be at 2% with interest
added to principal until the end of 1975, and repayment would be over 12
years commencing in 1974.



- 17 -
4.25.     The remaining sources of funds in addition to cash earnings are
the balance of the proceeds of sale of the port facilities which have been
taken over by the Government. The final instalment of CFAF 104.6 million is
due to be paid to CAMDEV in 1967.
4.26      Total capital expenditure from 1967/1974 is estimated at CFAF 6,205
million.  Details are given in Annex 6.  Of this amount about CFAF 560 mil-
lion would be on development and fixed assets from 1967-1971 in respect of
existing immature areas. It is estimated that the Corporation would be able
to meet this expenditure out of its own resources but after doing so it
would only provide about CFAF 650 million towards the cost of replacement of
fixed assets which are estirmated to require CFAF 745 million in the period.
The balance would be financed by the proposed IDA credit and Bank loan.

4.28      The increase in produce stocks provided for, estimated at around
CFAF 50 million annually, should be adequate. The estimated cash accumulation
of CFAF 628 million by the end of 1974 will amount to a little more than
three months cash revenue expenditures at that time and in view of the
uncertainties in estimating so far ahead, it would be imprudent to allow a
smaller cash margin. Should such cash accumulate in fact, it would be in-
vested in the next phase of CAMDEV's development.  In order to protect the
Corporation's liquidity, assurances have been received that the policy of the
Corporation will be to maintain its cash or undrawn overdraft facilities at
a level equivalent to three months cash revenue expenditures.
Future Financial Position
4.29      Estimated balance sheets are given in Annex 10. They reflect the
deteriorating earnings until 1975. As explained in paras. 4.16 and 4.17
there will be deficits in the years 1970 to 1974, but because of substantial
provisions for depreciation CAMDEV should be able to cover its debt service
obligations with an adequate margin.
4.30      In order to insure that CAMDEV's financial position is safeguarded,
its future borrowing powers have been limited. Assurances have been received
that except as the Bank shall otherwise agree the Corporation shall not incur
any debt before December 31, 1975 without the prior approval of the Bank and
thereaf'ter the Corporation shall not incur any debt if as a result thereof
the total debt of the Corporation shall be greater than its capital and
accumulated surplus. The term "accumulated surplus" is defined as excluding
any surplus arising from a revaluation of assets.
4.31      Estimated Annual Yield on Total Capital Invested is shown in
Annex 11. In calculating the return, the direct payments to Government of
rent and export duty have been added back to the Net Income.  It will be
seen that yields deteriorate until 1973 after which a steady improvement is
shown, and after 1980 the yield is above 10 per cent. This is because
earnings until 1975 are poor and capital expenditure continues to increase
until this time without an immediate corresponding benefit to income.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.32      Procurement of machinery, building materials, and vehicles for
the development program would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Disbursement of the loan and credit would be on identified imports
of goods necessary for the development program and on an agreed percentage
of certified planting expenditure. The detailed list of goods has been
agreed for the first year of the project.
5. MANAGEMENT, ORGANIZATION AND TRAINING
5.01      The Chairman and the Board of the Corporation are appointed by the
Prime Minister of West Cameroon.  CDC has two board members. The Director
of the Banque Centrale in West Cameroon and the Financial Secretary of West
Cameroon are also members. The Board also includes, in addition to the
Chairman, a retired civil servant and a local businessman.



- 19 -
5.02      The Board meets four or five times a year, and is concerned on'ly
with matters of general policy, the day-to-day operations of the Corporation
being the responsibility of the General Manager.
5.03      Considering its financial difficulties, CAMDEV has been well managed
under the Managing Agency Agreement with CDC. Under this agreement, which
expires in 1969, CDC supplies CMIDEV with a General Manager and his personal
assistant, and also assists in recruitment. However, the planting program 
may entail the recruitment of additional expatriates, and CAMDEV will have to
ensure that the salaries offered are high enough to attract staff of sufficient
caliber. Assurances have been received that CAMDEV will employ in all of its
senior management positions, (including those of General Manager, Agricultural
Adviser and Financial Controller) experienced and qualified persons mutually
acceptable to the Bank and the Corporation. The terms and conditions of any
Management Agreement are also required to be satisfactory to the Bank. The
Organization Chart shows the management structure. The four area managers
report directly to the general manager, as does the agrieultural advisor, chief
medical officer, chief engineer and financial controller. Of the top ten posts,
seven are occupied by expatriates, and three by Cameroonians. The total
senior staff of CAMDEV at the end of 1966 numbered 136, 78 Cameroonians, 56
expatriates and 2 Nigerians. The last few years have seen a vigorous imple-
mentation of Cameroonization to reach this position, and CAMDEV is running
a number of training programs to enable this program to be accelerated with-
out loss of efficiency. 27 Cameroonian staff are at present undergoing
further education at CAMDEV's expense in Britain and Nigeria.  In addition,
22 management trainees are studying agriculture or science in Cameroon. CAMDEV
also provides some adult education facilities and runs tapping, palm harvest-
ing, pest and disease control schools on the estates.
6. BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
6.01      Although the present financiaal position of CAMDEV will make it
necessary for part of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan and IDA credit
to be spent on bringing existing immature areas to maturity, the new plant-
ing program, which will absorb mcst of the Bank/IDA funds, is the investment
for which an economic return has been calculated. The return on the invest-
ment in bringing existing immature areas under the same crops into produc-
tion is, of course, much higher since costs already incurred would not be
included in the calculation. Using the yields, development costs and prices
contained in Annexes 4, 5 and 7, together with estimates of unit operating
costs for the production from the area to be planted, the discounted rate
of return to the economy on the new investment in the various crops is as
follows: oil palm 16 per cent, rubber 13 per cent, tea 15 per cent and pepper
21 per cent. The return on the total program is 16 per cent. This assumes a
25 year life for oil palm, 35 for rubber, 50 for tea and 30 for pepper. Labor
has been costed at a rate lower than the wage rate actually to be incurred,
since the wages paid by CAMDEV will be considerably higher than the contribu-
tion that the labor would make to the economy if it were not employed by the
Corporation. An estimate of this "contribution to GDP in alternative employ-
ment" has been made and the labor element of development and operating costs



- 20 -
reduced accordingly to 56 per cent of the labor costs to be incurred. If
full wage coasts are used, the rates of return are oil paln 13 per cent, rubber
6 per cent, tea 7 per cent and pepper 11 per cent, with the return on the
total program 11 per cent.
6.o2      More generally, the project will also yield substantial indirect
benefits. CAMDEV is the largest single enterprise in West Cameroon, with
three-quarters of the total area under plantations, and 9 per cent of the
total cultivated land. It employs at present a labor force of about 12,000
(over 20 per cent of total number oa vage earners in West Cemeroon), for
whom there are feu other enployment opportunities apart frca subsistence
agriculture. It mates substantial contributions to Government revenues,
both directly in the form of export duties and rent and indirectly through
the income taxes oa its employees. In 1966, it is estimated to have supplied
30 per cent of the region's exports. This makes it one of Cameroon's largest
exporters. It is thus important for the economy of the region and for the
foreign exchenge position of Cameroon that the Corporation should be able
to operate profitably in the future and the proposed planting program is the
best way of ensuring this. This program is likely to have a considerable
impact on the future economic vell-being of West Cameroon and vill make a
substantial contribution to the economy of Cameroon as a whole.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMNDATIONS
7.01      CAMDEV's planting program will take place under agricultural and
climatic conditions whieh have proved themselves to be excellent for the
growing of rubber, oil palm, te& and pepper. The management is good and, in
general, there are few agricultural or technical problems. In addition, the
size of CAMDEV in relation to the West Cameroon economy means that a success-
ful planting program with the resulting increase in production will have a
great impact on the economie activity of the whole region as well as making
a substantial contribution to the export earnings of Cameroon as a whole.
7.02      CAMDEV's recent earnings have been poor and its financiel position
has been unsatisfactory with a high proportion of debt. However, the recent
reorganization of CAMDEV's capital structure should place the Corporation on
a sound financial basis. The financing plan for the programn ij satisfactory
and the Corporation should be able to meet its obligations but mainly be-
cause of the expected decline in commodity prices, the Corporation's future
earnings are estimated to be poor until the development program comes into
full production.
7.03      The Bank/IDA financing is proposed to be made avaîlable only aiter
annual review of estimates covering the period of the program. The program
vill be revised periodically to take into account changing trends in commodity
prices and agricultural conditions.

_Recommendations
7.04      The Development Program forms a suitabie basis for an IDA credit
and Bank loan as follows:
(i) An IDA Credit of US$11.0 million to be contributed to
CAMDEV by the Federal Government of West Cameroon in
the form of equityr and disbursed between 1967 and 1971.
(ii) A Bank loan of US$7.0 million for a period of 30 years
including a grace period of 8-1/2 years to be disbursed
between 1971 and 1974.
Disbursements would be subject to annual review of the estimates for the
complete development program.

Price Assunmptions
The assumptions used in the earnings projections for each crop
are given beLow.   The price assumptions have been based on IBRD Commodity
Division forecasts aiter consultation in the field with CAMDEV sta-Xf.
(a) Palm Products.   The bulk of ChMDEV's palm oil and kernels is
exported and sold on the London market, but there are also
at present some local sales.   The local price is at present
high but it is expected that local production, other than by
CAIDEV, will increase to satisfy this demand.   The average
price of oil sales by CAMDEV, consisting of f.o.b Victoria
and local, is high at m78 (US$218) per me-ric ton in 1967,
but is asswaed to fall to .60 (US$168) by 1975, partly as
a result of local sales ceasing in 1970.   The kernel price
has been conservatively put at S42 (US$118) per metric ton
f.o.b. throughout the period.   At present no preference is
enioyed in EEC, since the Common Market in vegetable oils
has not yet been established.   If and when the EEC does
agree to a common market in these products, it may well be
more profitable to sel1 in Eurepo r.ather than in London.
(b) Rubber.  Rubber is also sold through the London market
though it may be shipped elsewhere.    Since the EEC common
external tariff on rubber is zero, there is unlikely to be
any pre°'erence in the future in the EEC.  The basis for
the rubber price assumptions is a 1967 spot New York price
for Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) 1 of 22 U.S. cents per pound
falling to 20 U.S. cents per pound by 1970 and to 18 U.S.
cents per pound by 1975, after which it is assumed to remain
constant.
(c) Tea.  80% of CA1IDEV's present tea production is being sold
on the local market, the rqst is sold in London.   Local
demand is groawing and the qCrporation expects to have no
difficulty in sel].ing ail its tea locally in the future.
Since there is at present only one other tea estate in the
whole of the Central African Customs and Economic Union,
this seens to be a reasonable assumption to make.   At
present, tea is being sold on the local market at CFAF 350
(US$1.42) per kilo.   A price of CFAF 300 (US$1.21) per kilo
has been assumed throughout the period to allow a fall from
this relatively high figure.   At CFAF 300 per kilo, the tea
wculd stili be compatitive with tea bought on the London
market at a low price of 3 shiïlings per pound, even with-
out the tariff protection of from 76% to 90% which domestic
producers of tea enjoy in Cameroon.

(d) Pepper. All the pepper is sold on the London market.
An f.o.b. price of CFAF 154 (62 U.S. cents) per kilo
(equivalent to 2/3d. per pound c.i.f. London) has been
assumed throughout the period.   This is about the price
being obtained at present and is in the lower end of the
range over which pepper prices have been fluctuating in
recent years.
(e) Bananas.   CAMDEV is scheduled to cease production of
bananas in 1968 as present and forecast prices will show
little or no profit.   It has been assumed that the price
obtainable in 1967 and 1968 will be CFAF 15,070 (US$61)
per metric ton.
