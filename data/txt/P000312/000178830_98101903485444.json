The new investment is expected to yield a rate of\n            return of about 11 to 16 percent, depending on the valuation\n            placed on labor costs, as well as substantial indirect\n            benefits. Camdev employs a labor force of about 12,000, for\n            whom there are few other employment opportunities and\n            supplies about 30 percent of West Cameroon's exports.\n            The Agriculture Project will increase employment and, by the\n            late 1970's, will double Camdev's contribution to\n            exports. Its success is therefore crucial for the economy of Cameroon."}, "docdt": "1967-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
