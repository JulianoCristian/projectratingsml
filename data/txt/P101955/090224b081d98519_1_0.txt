                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.       The progress towards achieving the development objectives and implementation progress remain satisfactory, despite some delay of five months to receive the additional
                         finance of $ 1.8 million (Dec. 2012). However, with the good experiences developed within the project team, they were able to move fast on implementing the agreed work plan and
                         catch up with disbursement and procurement timelines.

                         2.        Achievement of Development Objectives: the project has already contributed in achieving the targets for its PDO indicators of increasing average herd size of small
                         ruminants per household in targeted areas and animal traded in the rehabilitated livestock markets. The project met the targets for the direct project beneficiaries (167,970 - target
                         was 166,000), including 35% of them as female. Similarly, most of the targets set in the intermediate results indicators are already met including those on the livestock routes
                         rehabilitation, which are in good progress to be met before the closure of the project.

                         3.        Assessment of Implementation Performance: As of May 31, 2013, the project had disbursed 91% of the MDTF financed $ 8.31 million. The Project Management remains
                         satisfactory and the M&E system has been continuously improving with time.

                         4. There is currently no Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sudan, and an Interim Strategy Note (ISN - FY14-15) is being finalized (ROC Review Meeting organized on June 17,
                         2013). The objectives, the design and implementation of the project remained relevant throughout the project for meeting the country's priorities (as evidenced by the ISN and the
                         Governmentâ€™s IPRSP where agriculture and livestock play a major role for economic diversification and poverty alleviation).
