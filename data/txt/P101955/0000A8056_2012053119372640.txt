                         North Kordofan State (Gebaish, En Nuhood and Abu Zabad localities); (ii) Blue Nile (Damazin locality); (iii) Sinnar (Singa/Abu Hujar locality); and (iv) White Nile State (Al-Gabalain
                         locality). The project is planning for restructuring and seeking additional financing to complete the target number of water points, along the livestock routes, and complete the
                         infrastructure designed for livestock markets and undertake analytical work aiming at analyzing the bottlenecks existing for the livestock sector to fulfill its role as contributor to
                         economic growth and documenting successful activities implemented by the project.

                         2. The PDO for improving livestock production and marketing in those targeted localities, as a pilot, is addressing growth challenges for the livestock sector in the country by
                         contributing to increase livestock numbers and creating better outlets for production through improvement in the marketing infrastructures and negotiation platform. This objective is in
                         line with the CAADP pillars to provide access to reliable water source, increase market access and trade-related activities, strengthen and sustain pastoral livelihood, introduce
                         appropriate technologies in support to livestock productivity and diversify sources of income for the targeted pastoral communities.
