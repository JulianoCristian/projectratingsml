SUMMARY
This is Level 2 restructuring, encompassing an extension of the closing date and revisions to the
results framework of the MDTF-NS project Grant TF090693 for the Sudan’s Improving
Livestock Production and Marketing Project from August 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012.


PROJECT STATUS
The project development objective PDO is to improve livestock production and marketing in
selected rain-fed areas of eastern and central Sudan, and the indicator to measure the outcome
results are: (i) Average herd size of small ruminant per household in targeted areas; where the
project completed to date about 97.2 percent for sheep and 90 percent for goats; (ii) the number
of animals traded in the rehabilitated livestock markets, by type of livestock, where currently the
project achieved 92 percent for sheep, 89.6 percent for goats, 128.6 percent for cattle and 78
percent for camels, and (iii) margin between price for sheep paid in targeted secondary market
and terminal market, reached 18 percent, achieving 72 percent of the target. The project
registered encouraging progress in the milestone to achieve its development objectives, during
the last 6 months and the current ISR rating is satisfactory.

The project has succeeded in rehabilitating 24 water sub-projects supporting livestock-dependent
pastoral communities, rehabilitated/upgraded four livestock markets and supported 48 Village
Development Committees (VDCs), including training and capacity building packages for
pastoral communities and private veterinarians to enable them to access financial resources. To
date, the project benefited more than 72,000 people (30 percent of them are women) in the six
targeted localities of the following four key pastoral states: (i) North Kordofan State (Gebaish,
En Nuhood and Abu Zabad localities); (ii) Blue Nile (Damazin locality); (iii) Sinnar (Singa/Abu
Hujar locality); and (iv) White Nile State (Al-Gabalain locality). The original grant amount was
US$ 4 million and the project received additional funding of US$ 2.51 million from the Multi
Donor Trust Fund for North Sudan (MDTF-NS) on August 30, 2010 and the project objectives
continue to be achievable.


PROPOSED CHANGES
The proposed extension is necessary to complete the remaining rehabilitation of livestock
markets, water points, and livestock investment activities. This extension will also allow needed
time to implement the recommendations proposed by the different technical studies
commissioned under the project, and help draw lessons learned. The additional 10 months
would include detailed analysis of interventions in livestock marketing and privatization of
                                               1
veterinary services, and facilitate sustainability of the rehabilitated basic infrastructure in pastoral
areas. The client has put in place an action plan and approved procurement plans to complete and
deliver the different components of the project. The current disbursement percentage is 74.65
percent.
