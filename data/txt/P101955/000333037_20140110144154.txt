1.   Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.1. Context and Appraisal
1.    Sudan is a country of 26 million people in 2013 that experienced a protracted period of
internal conflict between the North and South over resources and differences in cultural vision.
Decades of conflict and neglect in Sudan made the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA) set high expectations for a quick peace dividend. A World Bank-United Nations (WB-
UN) Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) recognized that the livestock sector would be crucial to
develop rural areas and sustain peace. To coordinate donor funding for Sudan’s reconstruction
and development needs, two Multi Donor Trust Funds – one for the Government of National
Unity of the Republic of the Sudan (GoNS) and one for the Government of South Sudan (GoSS)
– were established. Donors and Government requested the World Bank to administer the two
MDTFs due to the high degree of fiduciary compliance that the Bank’s procedures would bring.
Similarly, the Bank’s support for using Government’s own systems to implement projects was
considered key to help build capacity through learning by doing.
2.    The MDTF for the Republic of the Sudan (MDTF-NS) aimed to consolidate peace by
supporting key CPA commitments, and supporting recovery and development in war-affected
and marginalized areas in the Northern states1. For the last decade, 95 percent of Sudan’s Gross
Domestic Product came from oil revenues, with 75 percent of these oil revenues coming from the
South. The 2011 Self-Determination Referendum and South Sudan’s subsequent independence
resulted in an immediate negative fiscal and balance of payments situation for Sudan.
International development assistance plummeted from about US$ 1.9 billion in 1985 to US$ 50
million by the late 1990s, and donors tended to focus their attention on humanitarian relief. The
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) has guided the GoNS’ 3-year “Crash
Program” (2011-2013) in response to the separation of South Sudan and to cover the loss of oil
revenues in the economy.
3.    To address the tight fiscal situation, the GoNS prioritized the agricultural sector, and in
particular the livestock sector. As the backbone of the Sudanese economy, livestock represents
around half of the agricultural production and about 19.8 percent of the Gross Domestic Project
(GDP). While the domestic market is the main outlet, livestock remains the dominant agriculture
commodity and accounts for a substantial share of exports from North Sudan. Sheep constituted
80 percent of livestock exports; up to 1.5 million head of sheep are exported annually,
principally to Saudi Arabia and Gulf countries.
4.    Livestock plays an important role in food security and rural employment in Sudan. More
than 80 percent of the Sudanese rural population relies on rain-fed traditional farming and
associated livestock rearing for their livelihoods. The rural population is highly vulnerable to
shocks from adverse events and conflicts related to natural resources (land, water). Livestock
represents a substantial source of incomes and helps mitigate hunger in case of crop failure.
Improvement in livestock-dependent livelihoods helps in ensuring a peace dividend, preventing
conflict and improving food security.

 The Northern States covered by the MDTF-NS were Abyei, Blue Nile, South Kordofan, North Kordofan, Red Sea, Sinnar and
White Nile state.

5.    At some level, most conflicts in Sudan have been linked to natural resources, particularly
land and water. Use and management of these resources have traditionally divided farmers and
pastoralists in Sudan. Farmers and pastoralists now compete for resources in the same areas,
while facing severe market constraints, poor access and low prices that discourage
intensification. Whenever conflicts arise from access to water and range, pastoralists negotiated
with the sedentary farmers, as customary owners of the land. Expansion of the area under
cultivation and/or the size of the livestock herd have become alternative strategies. As a
consequence, the balance between resource availability and demand is changing. In North
Kordofan, smallholder farming has expanded into traditional grazing areas and into the stock
routes themselves, encroaching into more land and water, where pastoralists service their
expanding herds.
6.    The governmental attempts to increase agriculture production and modernize public
administration have worsened the resource competition. Mechanized farming has helped increase
production. However, the policy was poorly implemented, with no respect for customary land
claims, often land was leased to inexperienced farmers, without supportive policies and market
infrastructures. Resource competition has in turn become more severe. To modernize
government structures, the government replaced the Native Administration with the appointment
of local administrators. The Native Administration was an appropriate negotiation mechanism
that helped overcome conflicts over access to natural resources. The rural situation has been
made worse, for while the government policy of mechanized farming has exacerbated conflict
between farmers and pastoralists, the policy towards the Native Administration has also reduced
local capacities to manage conflict..


1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
7.    The project’s objective was to improve livestock production and marketing in selected
rainfed areas of Central and Eastern Sudan.
8.     In the body text of the Final Project Proposal (FPP), the key performance indicators (KPIs)
of the project outcomes were: (i) Number of subprojects supporting livestock-dependent
livelihoods; (ii) Number of vaccinations delivered by private veterinarians; (iii) Increase in
animals traded in markets rehabilitated under the project; and (iv) Completion of study on
constraints to natural resource-based conflict mitigation. However, the key indicators in the FPP
Results Framework were different: (i) Livestock productivity enhanced (reduced mortality,
increased weight, and lambing/calving rate); (ii) Increased number of animals traded in target
markets rehabilitated by the project by 20 percent by Year 5; (iii) Approaches to mitigate natural
resource-based conflicts elucidated; (iv) Producer share of final price (domestic or export) for
sheep; and (v) Reliable markets prices available to producers in remote areas. Only the indicator
referred to as animals traded in the rehabilitated markets was consistent in both KPI and Results
Framework sections.

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
     reasons/justification
9.    The PDO was not revised. However, the key indicators were revised several times through
corrective restructurings during the project implementation. Table 1 summarizes the changes in
the KPIs and intermediate outcome indicators.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries
10. As per the FPP, direct project beneficiaries were pastoral communities. Against a target
value of 166,000 direct pastoral households beneficiaries, the Project benefited at completion
170,368 pastoral household beneficiaries, of which 35 percent are females. As a result of the
increased herd size and higher flock productivity and off-take rates, the communities benefited
from higher incomes and enhanced food and nutrition security. Households benefited from the
animal restocking activities, especially women, who benefited from the enhanced and cheaper
water supply for livestock and household consumption. The project created capacities in the
Local Implementation Unit (LIU) to manage projects (especially on procurements, financial
management).

1.5. Original Components
11. The project was to be implemented over a 5-year period, beginning June 2007. Due to the
MDTF-NS budget constraints, the project split in two phases: a first two-year phase followed by
a midterm review for a total of US$7.7 million (MDTF-NS US$4.0 million; GoNS US$3.7
million), and a second three-year phase for US$12.3 million (MDTF-NS US$4.0 million; GoNS
US$8.3 million). As per the FPP, the phased approach aimed to ensure that lessons learned from
the first phase would guide the activities of the second phase. That second phase aimed to scale
up the project activities into the Abu Zabed (North Kordofan) and Gabaleein (White Nile)
localities.
12. Component 1: Livestock Development Investment Fund (LDIF) (US$13.1 million) set
the ‘community-driven actions’ of the project, and aimed to increase livestock productivity and
sales. In the Phase I, this component was allocated US$4.6 million, a 60 percent of Phase I
budget, and would provide matching grants and technical assistance to pastoral communities.
The grants targeted as demand-driven subprojects, that included water point rehabilitation,
restocking, rangeland development, stock route demarcation, livestock fattening, advisory
services for improving herds, etc. The technical assistance aimed to mobilize pastoral
communities, stimulate the formation of self-help groups, and reinforce the existing ones.
Training was also provided to relevant local authorities to support implementation.
13. Component 2: Privatization of Animal Health Services and Markets (US$2.2 million)
aimed at testing two pilot activities – the privatization of animal health services and the
improvement of livestock markets and marketing. Improved services to producers should lead to
bigger incomes. It consisted of two subcomponents.
Subcomponent 2.1 Privatization of Animal Health Services: This pilot program supported the
private-led provision of animal health and vaccination services in all nine localities of North
Kordofan. In addition, the program aimed to enhance the regulatory and supervisory capacity of
the veterinary services at local- and state-level. As a pilot, the privatization process was expected
to be gradual, starting in two or three localities in Phase I. Technical assistance would assess the
prevailing policy and legal framework for animal health service provision, propose necessary
changes, and design a privatization strategy. Registered private veterinarians were to be
contracted to deliver vaccination and other animal health services. Activities included training
the veterinarians and providing business start-up resources, to cover costs such as for transport,
vaccines, drugs, refrigeration etc. State and locality veterinary services would receive training to
monitor the work of the hired veterinarians.


                                                 4
Subcomponent 2.2 Improvement of Livestock Markets and Marketing: The Project was to finance
the rehabilitation of five livestock markets in the four states. Besides civil works and equipment
to improve market physical infrastructures, the activities included technical assistance to the
market-related stakeholders (the private sector, the communities, the state- and local-levels
government staff) as well as the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and the relevant LIUs. Areas
of support were related to procurements, market management, and inspection services. Training
included study tours for locality staff and selected market operators to efficiently manage
markets. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) would be recruited to mobilize livestock
owner/trader groups and train them on market price analysis, group marketing, and animal health
requirements. To disseminate market prices and information, the project would provide basic
communication equipment.
14. Component 3: Project Implementation and Studies (US$4.7 million): Given the pilot
nature of the program and implementation in four states, a PCU would be set up in MARFR in
Khartoum to coordinate all project activities. Two Project Implementation Units (PIUs) were to
be established in the State Ministries of Agriculture, Animal Resources and Irrigation
(SMAARI), one at Sinnar (Sinnar State) and the other at El Obeid (North Kordofan). Technical
assistance and equipment would be provided for the Marketing Department of the MARFR
Directorate of Economics and Planning to develop a market information database easily
accessible to producers and other sector stakeholders. To strengthen and broaden the Livestock
and Marketing Information System funded by the International Fund for Agriculture
Development (IFAD), technical assistance also provided support to undertake studies, including
the preparation of a livestock population census for Sudan (covering Southern Sudan as well).
This component would also fund a study/mapping exercise to assess factors contributing to
conflict among the pastoralists and the sedentary farmers.

1.6. Revised Components
15. New component: rehabilitation of demarcated livestock routes. The study on factors
contributing to conflict between pastoralists and farmers 2 revealed that the lack of clear
demarcation and mapping of livestock routes was a key driver of conflict. The study
recommended providing and enhancing the basic services along stock routes as a measure
towards preventing future conflicts. In August 2010, the MDTF-NS Oversight Committee and
the Bank approved a revision of components, following an additional financing of US$2.51
million from the MDTF-NS. The project set a new component 4 adding activities on livestock
routes demarcation that were included in the component 1 3 . The new component included
services’ packages to develop and sustain the routes. Those basic services included;
   Mobile veterinary services, using different community driven approaches of animal health
    workers and livestock development workers.

  The activities in component 1 were bottom-up actions and community-driven, while the demarcation and rehabilitation works
were top-down activities that required strong coordination at state-level.


                                                             5
    To support the migrant livestock and herders, training on income generating activities (IGA)
     targeting settled members of the pastoral communities (mainly women, elders and children).
     The training would include regeneration of pastures along the routes, production of feed
     concentrates, simple agro-processing technology to open new markets for livestock bi-
     products; private veterinary drugs stores, etc.
    Additional infrastructures along the routes: To improve conditions of resting areas for
     livestock, a socio-economic survey would identify investments needs along the routes. The
     to-date rehabilitated water points prioritized by targeted pastoral communities were located
     adjacent to the route. These investments would be funded through the same matching grant
     arrangement under component 1.

1.7. Other significant changes
16. The project went through five restructurings, following several delays in the
disbursement of the GoNS contribution, as well as two batches of additional funding. Three
restructurings included the extension of the project Closing Date (CD). The ILPM was a pilot
project that tested innovative ways in a fragile setting of delivering services to communities. The
restructurings were meant to adapt the implementation pace to a changing scenario of available
resources, and when possible to scale up activities into new localities and consolidate
investments. During the project timeframe, the GoNS faced a dramatic fiscal situation that was
substantially aggravated by the independence of Southern Sudan. This situation lead to the GoNS
delaying the disbursement of ILPM funding, and finally to disbursing less than one third of the
pledged resources. In addition, MDTF-NS donors disbursed the committed funding in tranches,
not necessarily matching the funding needs of the projects, and adding more uncertainty to the
project implementation. Finally, ILPM was one of the best-performing projects within the
MDTF-NS portfolio. Consequently, the MDTF-NS Steering Committee allocated two batches of
additional funding to ILPM from projects with implementation challenges.
        a. The first restructuring (August 2009) followed the MTR and included fundamental
           changes on the implementation arrangements for the Eastern States, in the Project
           Operation Manual, as well as a revision of the results framework and the M&E roles at
           the four levels of implementation.
        b. The second restructuring (August 2010) included a new component 4 to address the
           rehabilitation of demarcated livestock routes (see section 1.6) and additional activities
           following the first batch of supplementary funding for US$2.5 million4.
        c. The third restructuring (June 2011) included the request of a CD extension (from
           August 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012) to complete the remaining rehabilitation of livestock
           markets, water points, and livestock investment activities. This restructuring also
           included changes in the Results Framework and indicators.




4
 This funding aimed to develop a fast-track program through the LDIF component to enhance 14 additional water points in
hafirs (or artificial ponds), particularly along livestock routes, that were severely affected by the lack of precipitations during the
2009 rainy season. The additional resources also provided for 2 additional livestock markets, start-up funding for 6 additional
private vets, enhanced additional 188 km of rehabilitated routes, and 49 additional non-water sub-projects.


                                                                  6
       d. The fourth restructuring (June 2012) included a request for a second CD extension
          (from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012).
       e. The fifth restructuring (November 2012) followed a reallocation of funding within the
          MDTF-NS portfolio to well-performing projects. As one of the most successful project
          of the MDTF-NS portfolio, ILPM received a second batch of US$1.8 million as
          additional financing for scaling up activities. The restructuring also included a third CD
          extension (from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013).
17. Thorough modification of the indicators framework. The initial set of indicators and the
results framework provided a weak basis for project monitoring. Besides the changes in the PDO
key indicators (see Section 1.3), the indicators and the Results Framework were modified several
times during the project time span5. These modifications were not always consistent or corrected
the shortcomings, to effectively enhance the link of the indicators to the PDO and the project
outcomes6. The MTR review was in the right direction. By the project completion some changes
remain questionable, like dropping the intermediate outcome indicators per component, include
process-oriented indicators (see subcomponent 2.1 on privatization of animal health services), or
letting component 3 without any kind of indicator. The last restructuring in November 2012
helped make the framework leaner, and better focused on the PDO outcomes. Following the
second additional financing, the project was able to scale up some activities. The target values in
the Results Framework was accordingly modified as follows:
       a. Increase by 10 sheep in the average herd size of small ruminants per household in the
          targeted communities
       b. Additional investments in small infrastructure and equipment (shades, provision of
          reliable water sources, electricity supply and fodder lots) for the 6 rehabilitated markets
          were expected to lead to continuous increase of animals sold annually in these markets
          (36,259 sheep, 110 goats, 1,287 cattle and 723 camels).
       c. Increase by 10,000 in the total number of beneficiaries reached.
       d. Demarcation and rehabilitation of 60 additional km of livestock routes, seeding of
          additional 1,400 ha of pasture and 400 km more of fire lines opened.


2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18. The WB engagement was consistent with the existing strategic approach to re-
engaging with Sudan. Bank’s engagement was aligned with the existing approach to the WB’s
strategic role in Sudan. The 2003 Country Re-Engagement Note outlined a four-pronged
approach, which included the engagement in demonstration projects; foresaw the need to

  The Table 2.11 in Annex 2 sets out a detailed sequence of changes in the indicators and results framework, following major
restructuring in the project.
6
  The indicators revision included new indicators to measure the available capacity and extent of the communities and other
stakeholders’ participation in project management and in project-related activities, or to verify the delivered outputs (completion
of community prioritized subprojects, livestock market facilities, and livestock routes facilities). In other cases, the indicators
were not adequately formulated for the intended purpose (improved provision of veterinary services, usage of community
prioritized subprojects, markets or routes).


                                                                7
establish and staff country offices; and raised the possibility of the Bank administering a
reconstruction trust fund, as it later materialized with the MDTF-NS and MDTF-SS. The 2008
ISN aimed to support GoNS and GoSS to sustain peace and reduce conflict by meeting the
commitments contained in the CPA, Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), and Eastern Sudan Peace
Agreement (ESPA) particularly in the areas of governance, basic services, and pro-poor
economic growth--especially in war-affected and marginalized areas. One of the medium-term
country goals was to improve productivity in the rural sector by developing more efficient
markets, strengthening transfer of improved technology through extension services, and
promoting sustainable land and natural resource management.
19. The project design was not particularly complex, and the most challenging aspects,
essentially of institutional nature, were to be closely monitored. The expected project outputs
were concrete and addressed physical investments, community-driven matching grants,
community mobilization, and capacity building activities. The project addressed critical elements
of institutional change in the sector: participation of the private sector in delivering animal health
services; creation and strengthening of multi-stakeholder boards to manage livestock markets,
with a focus on sustainability and increased transparency in market transactions; and creation
and strengthening of Village Development Committees to manage community needs. No
evidence was found suggesting that the project preparation involved consultation with
stakeholders, perhaps as a result of the emergency nature of most of the MDTF-funded
operations. The project required strong coordination among the three administrative levels –
federal, state and locality – and the creation of new institutional arrangements, namely Market
Boards and Village Development Committees. Likewise, the project implementation structure,
set in parallel to the administrative levels (PCU, PIU and LIU), was demanding in terms of
coordination needs and capacity creation, mostly at the sub-federal levels. The FPP did
acknowledge the need to reinforce weak existing capacities for the implementation, especially
with regards to M&E, safeguards, and fiduciary management.
20. The knowledge base in the lessons considered for the project design was limited. The
knowledge base used to draw lessons for the project design on was limited to IFAD projects in
traditional rainfed areas, and to WB-funded livestock projects implemented in the 70’s and 80’s.
At the time of the project design, most of the donors had their operations suspended since the
beginning of the 90’s and the donors’ presence in Sudan was limited to IFAD. However, the
preparation missions identified other relevant projects, implemented by Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and by United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) that could have
been better considered7. With regards to water management, the FPP builds on the potentiality of
the economic return of water supply on stock routes based on the role of a private company
involved in projects in the 70-80’s. The rationale behind matching grants had neither a country
nor a regional basis despite the WB remarkable experience working with community-driven
matching grants. Lessons could have been relevantly included as a basis to design the component
1. The marketing management and the standards on livestock markets were based on the lessons
from Asian markets, with more efficient procedures to trade based on estimated weight.

Spain-funded US$1.6 million for the promotion of rice production in White Nile; EC-funded EUR 20 million on Food Security
Information system (EUR 20 million), and a Sudan Recovery project in the North and South (Euro 80 million). Projects
implemented by UNOPS: IFAD-financed four programs for US$80 million in North and South Kordofan, and in the East with a
focus on credit and agriculture production.

21. The FPP showed adequate awareness and defined measures to mitigate the project
risks, especially with regards to financial and procurement capacities. The FPP identified
weak capacities in the MARFR and SMAARIs, in terms of staff and procedures. The
qualifications of the three to-be-hired Procurement Specialists were set to be satisfactory to the
Bank. Project Procurement Specialists, and designated State and MARFR staff were provided
with early training on WB procurement procedures. Where procurements did not involve
international competition, the WB Procurement Guidelines allowed use of national procedures.
Since the national regulations in Sudan were not detailed enough to ensure economy, efficiency,
transparency and equal opportunity, the Project Operational Manual (POM) made provisions to
modify the relevant regulations. The POM was expected to be “living document” and be
regularly updated with lessons learned from the project practice. Each procurement procedure
was subject to the World Bank’s prior review and approval on a no-objection basis.
22. At the time of project design, no country fiduciary assessment was available in Sudan
and the overall financial management risk was rated as substantial. A Country Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment (CIFA) was underway following the recent Public Expenditure Review
(PER 2006) which revealed that in general, the Public Financial Management (PFM) system was
reasonably well functioning in the North but needed to be substantially revamped and
modernized. At state level, and especially at the decentralized level, the PFM capacities
remained weak. As an OP 8.00 operation, no Financial Management (FM) effectiveness
conditions were considered. Rather, the first supervision mission was expected to monitor some
key mitigation measures 8 . Besides, the FPP established auditing and reporting obligations.
Financial statements were expected to be consistent with the IAS and audited by Auditor
General, and audit reports to be submitted to International Development Association (IDA)
before six months after the end of each fiscal year.

2.2. Implementation
23. The main factors that impacted the project implementation were: (i) the delay in receiving
the GoNS committed funding, in the end less than one third of the pledged amount at the project
design; (ii) the engagement of the project teams, particularly the Project Coordination Unit to
proactively address foreseen implementation constraints; (iii) the occurrence of outbreaks of
conflicts in States targeted by the project (e.g. Blue Nile) that made them not accessible from
time to time; and (iv) even when quickly and substantially improved later during the
implementation, the incomplete supervision and support services delivered by the Bank at the
project start-up. Despite the delayed taking off in the project implementation, the two batches of
additional financing 9 demonstrate the project capacity to overcome constraints and reach a
satisfactory absorptive capacity.
24. Delayed GoNS disbursements affected critically the implementation pace. The
separation of Southern Sudan aggravated the critical fiscal situation in GoNS during the project
implementation. As a consequence, the counterpart contribution was substantially delayed. In
July 2009, almost two years after the project was declared effective, the GoNS had disbursed less


8
  These measures included (i) appointment of Finance Officers, (ii) establishment of manual accounting systems (account books,
forms etc.), (iii) updating the current procedures as part of the POM to reflect the project’s specifics (decentralization, subprojects
etc.), and (iv) timely release of counterpart funds and internal audit work plans.

                                                                  9
than 12 percent of the pledged funding. During the Phase I, some 60 percent of project
expenditures under component one (Livestock Development Investment Fund) and component
three (Project Management and Staffing) were to be funded from the counterpart contributions.
As a result, key project activities in the Eastern Sector covering Blue Nile, White Nile and
Sennar states started late and only in September 2008 and in the Western sector covering North
Kordofan state in October 2008. The actual effective implementation period of the project during
Phase I was not more than six months before the initial Closing Date (August 31, 2011).
25. The project teams at federal, state and locality levels were instrumental to sustain the
project implementation. The ILPM had four-level governance demanding strong coordination
and supervision, especially on the procurements at the community level. The commitment and
engagement of the project teams at the four levels, and especially from the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) in Khartoum, deserve recognition. The PCU provided backstopping support and
responded to capacity shortcomings at the state and locality levels in key areas, such as FM and
procurement. While the PCU-level M&E Officer position was vacant early during
implementation, the PCU, PIUs, and LIUs coordinators took over those roles on an ad hoc and
informal basis. Following the mid-2009 MTR, these roles were formally recognized and
incorporated. The NGOs recruitment process for the LDIF implementation failed. The PCU and
the Bank devised a mechanism to engage PIUs and LIUs staff in community mobilization,
project design and formulation. The MDTF-NS community-based intervention – the Community
Development Fund (CDF) – provided the necessary training for the ILPM staff.
26. Conflict outbreaks in Blue Nile affected the implementation of activities, including
capacity building interventions and water points rehabilitation. Blue Nile, White Nile and
some areas of Sinnar are among the poorest regions in Sudan. Tensions and conflicts were
recurrent, mainly due to allocating land for semi-mechanized farming that is blocking traditional
seasonal migration routes. Sheep and cattle herds have traditionally migrated across these states
from Southern Sudan to terminal livestock markets in Khartoum State. By the end of 2011, the
security situation in Blue Nile deteriorated. This state provides fodder and water for the winter
grazing herds. Herders were reluctant to access the grazing resources in South Sudan due to the
political tensions. As a result, three water point rehabilitation works in that State were halted
during months.
27. Operational support services provided by the WB were incomplete at the beginning
of project implementation, although improved progressively. At the start of the project, the
WB did not have a fully functional country office in Khartoum. Most of the key operational
support services were to be provided by other regional offices, and consultants. This somewhat
impeded the implementation support of all projects under the MDTF-NS portfolio. In the case of
ILPMP, measures were rapidly taken to more closely supervise the project. By the beginning of
2011, the WB Country Office could finally provide country-based technical, especially
operations support staff on safeguards, procurements, FM, and M&E (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2 in
Annex 4). The project staff found the POM to be inconsistent, unclear, and lacking a precise
definition of the implementation roles, especially with regards the decentralized implementation
arrangements for the component 1 LDIF, around a 65 percent of the total project budget. The
2009 MTR reflected these shortcomings conveyed from the project staff and proposed the
necessary corrective measures.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
28. Design: Correlation between the PDO, the outcomes and the results indicators was poorly
formulated at entry. The project activities addressed livestock both as an economic sector, by
creating an enabling environment for market transactions (market and routes rehabilitation,
privatization of animal health services, studies) and as a livelihood, by providing inputs to poor
households (matching grants). The final version of the PDO indicators and the results framework
captured well this dual approach. The PDO was phrased well to cover both aspects, though
referring explicitly the beneficiaries and the livelihoods impact would have made the PDO more
precise.
29. As a pilot project, the FPP acknowledged that the design featured flexibility to achieve the
objectives. The document also set out that the project processes and impact needed a close
monitoring in order to draw lessons for the implementation. However, the set of indicators in the
Results Framework was notably weak. The FPP included an M&E Officer in PCU responsible
for establishing and overseeing the M&E system. To support the M&E activities, the FPP also
included: funds for technical assistance and training on M&E development and management for
the four-implementation levels; the elaboration of a baseline survey; and an impact evaluation by
the end of fourth year, to review the impact of the pilot on privatization of veterinary services.
30. Implementation: Shortcomings in the M&E system at entry were substantially corrected
during the project time frame10. By the project completion some weaknesses remained, though
the M&E system and Results Framework had been definitely made leaner and enhanced. The
available tools and guidelines for M&E implementation were insufficient to help detect
constraints and bottlenecks in project implementation. The baseline study for the results
framework was delivered by the end of 2009. After a failed appointment of the M&E Officer at
the PCU early on, the position was finally covered in July 2009. By mid-2009, the MTR helped
identify that the POM lacked of clear guidelines on roles and responsibilities for the M&E
functions. The PCU, PIU, and LIU coordinators were taking on those roles on an ad hoc basis.
Moreover, the manual did not include monitoring and reporting templates either. The MTR was
instrumental to take corrective measures. The POM was added a one-page matrix describing the
roles and responsibilities, and a format for monitoring and reporting at community level. The
Coordinators and the VDC Secretary were formally appointed to follow up on M&E activities.
The M&E Officer was appointed to guarantee the proper use of formats in the monitoring
progress reports, and for providing M&E/reporting guidance to the relevant staff of the PIUs,
LIUs and communities.
31. The Monitoring Agent (MA) supplemented the M&E-related project capacities. Price
Waterhouse Coopers was hired as MA to cover the whole MDTF-NS program. Per each MTDF-
NS project, the MA responsibilities covered reviewing paperwork on procurement and finances,
monitoring projects through site visits, and reporting on the status, progress and performance
rating of MDTF-NS projects on a quarterly basis. Other than the monitoring services, the MA
also played an important capacity development role, and on-the-job assistance both to PIU staff
and through other World Bank training activities. The MDTF-NS evaluation found that the MA

                                                                  11
played a vital role in supporting the MDTF-NS and PIU operations in the areas of procurement
and financial management11.
32. Utilization: The evidence available suggests that the M&E information was incorporated
in the project operation. The information and recommendations presented in the MA Quarterly
Reports were also to be integrated into project operations. For instance, the 2011 Sustainability
Report concluded that appropriate arrangements were needed to sustain the MDTF-NS project
interventions beyond the program closure date. The report noted that some sub-projects (e.g.
water points, and livestock markets) had significant construction defects or lacked essential
elements (e.g. fences, water points, electricity, incinerators, crushes etc.). These deficiencies
hindered the fully functionality and sustainability of the market infrastructures in the long run.
The 2012 Functionality Assessment Report identified the shortcomings and provided with an
estimated cost of addressing those deficiencies (see the ILPM referred deficiencies in Annex 2,
Tables 2.3 and 2.9). As part of MDTF-NS exit strategy, the facilities needed to be working and
in adequate conditions prior the handover to the beneficiary communities and authorities. As part
of the completion mission, two of the referred markets (El Nuhoud and Tandilti) were visited. El
Nuhoud still had ongoing works. Both markets were operational though not fully functional, and
some equipment and facilities were deteriorating (for details see Table 2.10 in Annex 2).


2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
33. Safeguards: The project complied with the formal requirements on safeguards, though the
implementation offered leeway for improvement. The project was rightly rated as a category ‘B’
project. Two factors were key in the ILPM safeguards management: preparation under the
emergency response guidelines (OP 8.00) and the small-scale impact of the subprojects. As in
other emergency MDTF-NS projects, neither public consultations nor environmental and social
analysis were conducted during the project preparation. Given the small scale of the ILPM
investments, any negative social and environmental impacts were considered unlikely to be
significant, irreversible or large in scale. The 2012 Environmental and Social Safeguards
Performance Review of the MDTF-NS portfolio assessed the ILPM safeguards (SG)
performance as positive, though some weaknesses were remarked (ESMF was not disclosed in
Arabic). Unlike most of the MDTF-NS projects, the ILPM Environmental and Social
Management Frameworks (ESMF) spelled out procedures for grievances in adequate detail, and
included the use of mediation using traditional Sudanese systems of conflict resolution
(ajaweed). The ESMF was considered the appropriate tool. The ILPM screened the sub-projects
using checklist to identify specific risks, but did not use Environmental Impact Assessments,
Environmental Management Plans, Resettlement Action Plans that could help prescribe
mitigation measures to minimize or eliminate such risks.
34. The FPP recognized the need for creating SG capacity, yet the project failed to promptly
staff the implementation units with SG capacities. Once the units had appointed a safeguards
officer, the Bank organized a workshop for national and state-level PIUs in December 2009. As
per the Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports, the weak SG technical capacity – along
with the late project start-up – hindered a timely delivery of the safeguards instruments (the

                                                              12
ESMF, the Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) and Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Policy Framework and Resettlement Action Plan). These tools were legal covenants and should
have been complied with within six months of project effectiveness. They were finally delivered
by May 2010.
35. Fiduciary: There were no serious procurement issues under the project, with any
deficiencies noted being corrected. Financial planning and reporting have been timely and
satisfactory, and no audit reports were overdue. The project was well staffed to manage
procurements (one Procurement Officer at the PCU level, in charge of the whole procurement
activities carried out by the project at the PCU, PIUs and LIUs). The Bank duly attended the
capacity building needs of the project on procurement management. In June 2009 the Bank’s
Country Office procurement staff provided training in contract management. Procurement was
properly staffed in WB supervision missions. The financial management has been consistently
rated in ISRs as Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory.
36. The initially weak FM capacities were substantially improved and the final performance
was rated as Satisfactory. Procurement plans have been regularly updated by the PCU and
cleared by the Bank. Most of the major procurement activities have been concluded to date and
the procurement processes of most of the planned activities, including under additional
financing, were finalized timely. Along the project duration, the project showed a satisfactory
progress in creating capacities. Improvements included moving from using ‘Excel’ spreadsheets
and manual booking, to using specific software for the accounting system. Planning and
reporting were rated Satisfactory. Staff included an experienced FM officer in the PCU, and each
PIU was allocated with accountants. FM was also properly staffed in WB supervision missions.
The financial management has been consistently rated in ISRs as Moderately Satisfactory and
Satisfactory.

2.5. Post-completion Operation / Next Phase
37. IFAD will build on ILPM achievements to continue supporting the livestock sector. IFAD
has included an ILPM follow-up project, the Livestock Production and Marketing Program
(LPMP) in its 2013-2016 Results Based-Country Strategic Opportunities Program (RB-COSOP).
The LPMP development objective is increased livestock productivity, value addition and
marketing. Key outcomes will include: more sustainable management and utilization of natural
resources; improved animal health and access to animal health services; and increased marketing
of primary and secondary livestock products. The total Program costs are estimated at US$50
million over a 7-year implementation period. Field activities will initially focus on states where
ILPMP pilot activities have started (North Kordofan, Blue Nile, White Nile and Sennar), and
will later expand to priority localities in other states to be confirmed.
38. IFAD considers that the ILPM has succeeded in raising awareness about resilience
generation, and providing management models consistent with the Sudanese governance
architecture. For IFAD, the ILPM has developed effective models for community-based natural
resource management and rehabilitation to increase resilience to climate change, stock route
demarcation to reduce conflict, delegation of tasks of public good nature (vaccination) to private
veterinarians to improve animal health and rehabilitation of livestock markets to improve
adherence to quality standards and access to markets. Important lessons have also been learned
regarding ensuring sustainability of interventions, and proper planning and institutional


                                               13
coordination. The pilot phase of the ILPM has been successful in raising these issues in policy
dialogue at state and federal level and in promulgating new legislation that creates an enabling
environment for scaling up these models. It has also established implementing arrangements
appropriate to Sudan’s federal system of governance, and partnerships with the key institutions
involved in the livestock sector. IFAD also valued positive the strong collaboration developed by
the ILPM with ongoing IFAD projects: the Western Sudan Resources Management Project
(WSRMP) in North Kordofan on community mobilization, rangeland protection and
rehabilitation of water points, and with the Small Scale Traditional Producers in Sennar State
Project (SUSTAIN) in Sennar State on destocking, rangeland enclosures, seed propagation, stock
routes, and Natural Resources Management (NRM) policy.
39. GoNS committed to provide additional funding to keep PCU operational until IFAD
provides funding. Following an ILPM wrap-up meeting in April 2013, the MARFR requested the
Ministry of Finance and National Economy bridging funds and extension of the ILPM project
until the end of 2013, to ensure bridging the period for the expected IFAD fund in 2014. The
requested funding amounts for SDG 3.0 million and aims to ensure that the PCU will continue to
work under the policy direction of the Project Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the
Undersecretary of MARFR.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes
3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
40. The current Interim Strategy Note (FY14-15 ISN) acknowledges that in most regions of
Sudan, conflict over access to natural resources between pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and settled
farmers is endemic and also contributes to regional conflict, such as in the Sahel. Agriculture,
including livestock, holds the highest potential for broadly shared growth and poverty reduction
in Sudan. The PDO of the ILPM is deemed consistent with the government priorities and highly
relevant for meeting the country’s priorities. The PDO contributes to increase market access and
trade, strengthen and sustain pastoral livelihoods, and diversify the sources of income for
pastoralists and poor households.
41. The design of the project is also relevant. The expected project continuation by IFAD will
build on successful activities by ILPM and be embedded on national systems at federal and state
level. The components aim to increase livestock production and productivity, including support
for restocking and enhanced access to animal health services through private vets and CAHWs;
improve natural resources management, especially in communities located along traditional
livestock routes; increase value addition to livestock products, which includes matching grants at
the community level for small IGA; and improve markets infrastructure and facilities, and
management systems based on multi-stakeholder market boards.
42. The implementation was challenged by the late disbursement of the counterpart
contribution12, substantially reduced to less than one third of the amount initially pledged; the
need for intensive coordination for the project implementation that involved three levels of
administration, the respective project units and the VDC; and the limited operational capacity of


12
  Having already committed its budget to other MDTF-NS projects (Census and New Currency projects which required
substantial funding), the GoNS was no able to meet all its financial commitments to the project. This slowed progress at the start
and was one of the reasons for the first restructuring.


                                                               14
the staff. This latter was progressively tackled through training and capacity building activities.
With regards to the effective availability of government contributions, the secession of South
Sudan in July 2011 brought about a loss of three-quarters of oil wealth in Sudan causing the
government budget to lose 50 percent of its revenue, followed by a balance of payments shock.
The debt burden keeps constraining the development options. Arrears to the WB and other
development partners limits direct access to concessional financing. Development financing is
limited to humanitarian-related assistance through MDTFs. As for the ILPM, the WB role
remains instrumental in providing services to administer and supervise future sector-related
operations.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives
43. The last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report rated the PDO Achievement as
Satisfactory. By the completion, the project reported the achievement of the PDO indicators
targets (table 3).
      a. The number of animal traded in the rehabilitated livestock markets substantially
         exceeded the target values. By the project completion, the accumulated amount of
         animals traded by the end of June 2013 reached 492,845 sheep, 63,749 goats, 80,525
         cattle, and 26,919 camels. Once rehabilitated, the markets have traded in just half-year
         more than the target value set for the whole year (398,852 sheep, 1,213 goats, 14,161
         cattle, and 7,949 camels). The baseline of May 2009 set that the targeted markets
         traded annually an amount of 299,664 sheep, 912 goats, 10,640 cattle and 5,972
         camels.
      b. The average herd size of small ruminants per household in areas benefitted with the
         livestock restocking activities also exceeded the target value. By the project completion
         in June 2013, the average herd size reached 64 sheep and 10 goats, against a target
         value of 46 sheep and 10 goats. The baseline in May 2009 set an average herd size of
         31 sheep and 7 goats.

      c. In terms of beneficiaries, the project also met the target for the direct project
         beneficiaries, reaching 167,970 beneficiaries, against a value target of 166,000,


                                                         15
         including 35 percent of them as female. As per the baseline of March 2009, the project
         was already reaching a total of 2,959 beneficiaries, of which 29 percent were female.
44. Looking at the results framework and indicators’ target fully reached, the project would
indeed be successful. However the rating should be downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory, due
to the difficulty to fully attribute the values of the PDO indicators to the project interventions.
The project reported that the targets set for the PDO indicators were achieved. But the correlation
of the undertaken activities and the PDO is not direct and clear so as to verify to what extent the
project activities effectively contributed to the PDO. Only one of ‘intermediate outcome’
indicators in the Results Framework (VDCs with at least 100% recovery rate for operation and
maintenance costs of water points) can be considered as such. The rest are outputs indicators.
The PDO reads, “to improve livestock production and marketing in selected rainfed areas of
Central and Eastern Sudan”.
       a. The PDO indicator on the herd size can be taken as indicator of improved livestock
          production, following the activities under component 1. However, the Results
          Framework does not make a clear link between the increase in herd size and the
          component 1 indicators, two of which are indeed output indicators (water point
          rehabilitation, beneficiaries of IGA support) and the other refers to the financial
          sustainability of the infrastructure management (100 percent recovery rate).
       b. The PDO indicator on the animals traded in rehabilitated markets can be taken as
          indicator of improved livestock marketing, following the activities under component
          2. The component 2 intermediate outcome indicators are actually outputs indicators.
          Other than reporting on the private veterinarians and CAHWs operating, and markets
          rehabilitated, these indicators do not explain how the activities were supposed to
          impact on the animals traded in the markets.
       c. Similarly, it is unclear for a non-livestock specialist how the component 4 indicators
          (all three output indicators: demarcated and rehabilitated routes, opened fire lines, and
          planted pasture seeds) are linked to the PDO aspects, either production or marketing.
45. The available Results Framework is not deemed fully functional to make a direct link
between the project activities and the PDO. Following the indications of the ICR Guidance Note,
the discussion elaborates on the project rationale as set out in the FPP and the PAD from June
2010, when the component 4 was added, and using the final values of the indicators (Table 4).
       a. For the component 1: The objective for this component was to increase animal
          productivity through demand-driven initiatives. The investment fund was expected to
          provide matching grants to finance activities and technical assistance demanded by
          pastoral communities to increase productivity and sales of livestock. The LDIF
          improved 34 community water points, against a target of 32, and helped the VDCs in
          reaching at least a 100 percent of recovery rate for operation and maintenance costs of
          the infrastructure. Some VDCs have reported the use of revenues from water fees to
          reinvest in other non-water or livestock-related investments for the community
          benefit. With regards to the support for IGA, the project benefitted 4,647 households,
          against a target value of 4,229 households. The percentage of benefitted female-
          headed households achieved a 45 percent of the total households targeted.
       b. For the component 2: The objective of this component was to test pilot activities in



                                                16
             the privatization of animal health services and improvement of livestock markets.
             Enhanced animal health was expected to increase productivity, and the rehabilitation
             of livestock markets was expected to provide producers and traders with better
             incentives to use the markets to sell and buy animals. The project rehabilitated the
             expected 6 livestock markets, though sustainability and fully functionality was not
             guaranteed by completion; trained 91 CAHWs and helped them liaise with the private
             veterinarians; and sustained 10 private veterinarians operating in the targeted
             localities (over the target of 9). Livestock markets are providing veterinary services
             and marketing opportunities for pastoralists. The 2011 Sustainability Report
             suggested that the average price received by pastoralists in El Nuhoud livestock
             market in North Kordofan had reportedly increased by some 10-20 percent compared
             to prior to the intervention. However attribution of this result to the project’s
             interventions remains to be proved. For the livestock markets, the localities are
             collecting entry and service fees to support operation and maintenance. The states are
             providing veterinarians and paying their salaries. Vaccines against transboundary
             animal diseases are provided free-of-charge while other vaccinations are paid for by
             the pastoralists.

         c. For the component 3: The studies were expected to provide MARFR with the
            capacity to collect data and information to inform policy change. In addition, this
            component was expected to support a livestock census and natural resource-based
            conflict mitigation. Component 3 indicators were dropped following the MTR review.


                                                           17
           Besides the baseline study and the safeguard-related frameworks (ESMF, MWMP,
           and the Resettlement Policy Framework), this component provided the required
           knowledge products for other activities: for the component 1, guidelines to manage
           community investment matching grants; for the component 2, guidelines to privatize
           the animal health services, for the design of the livestock marketing database, and for
           the design and management of livestock market rehabilitation components. The
           innovative study on factors contributing to conflict in pastoral production systems
           backed the decision to create a new component 4. The objective of the study was to
           provide an understanding of the key constraints to “rights-based” access to land and
           equitable sharing of natural resources. The results were disseminated in seminars in
           Khartoum (August 2010) and Nairobi (June 2013).
       d. For the component 4: This component aimed to provide services packages to develop
          and sustain the demarcated livestock routes. Those basic services include
          establishment of Livestock Services Centers and the mobile veterinary services, using
          community driven approaches of animal health workers and livestock development
          workers. The works to improve livestock routes met the expected targets in the
          kilometers of routes demarcated and rehabilitated (346 km) and almost in the fire
          lines opened (achieved 1,082 km against a target of 1,100 km). The final delivered
          pasture area planted with selected seeds (Ha 6,520) fell short behind the expected
          target (Ha 7,920).

3.3. Efficiency
46. The FPP did not include a detailed economic and financial analysis of the overall project.
Since the project was prepared under OP8.00, no net present value (NPV), economic or financial
rate of return were calculated a priori, and no analyses are available. The data on the livestock
sector in Sudan remain scant.
47. The first ILPM outcome was to increase the size of the herd per community household.
Based on information from the ILPM quarterly progress reports and the VDC records, each SDG
invested in the restocking activities yielded by the project completion 2.7 SDG in real terms per
household in the targeted communities. Households have also benefitted from an increased value
of the animals. Once discounted by the GDP deflator, each SDG invested by the project in the
restocking activities, increased 1.3 times the value of each animal. With regards to the water
point investments, the project assumed that enhancing the water availability would increase the
size of the household herd. Compared with the results in communities targeted only with
restocking activities, each additional SDG invested in communities through water point activities
do not show any differential impact on the size of the household herds.
48. With regards to the efficient use of the MDTF funding, the overall sub-utilization
percentage is 7.7 percent. The largest gaps between planned and effective disbursements
correspond to the privatization of animal health services (57.7 percent gap) and the restocking
activities (56.3 percent gap). On the contrary, the project allocated an additional 10.8 percent of
MDTF-NS funds to the rehabilitation of water points. Based on the available evidence on the
returns per each SDG invested, the project should have devoted more efforts to fully utilize the
available resources for the restocking activities, more efficient to increase the number of animals
per herd. The project efficiency is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.


                                                18
49. The evidence is however not conclusive, but merely indicative. Any either/or discussions
between restocking and water point rehabilitation works should be dismissed. Experiences in
neighboring countries show that restocking without better access to water – besides feeding
(pasture), animal health services, and extension/advisory services – leads always to failures, in
terms of death of animals, or drop in the offspring available for restocking.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
50. The project objectives and design were relevant for the Government and the WB priorities
for the sector and the country. By its completion, the project reported an increase in the values
expected for the key PDO indicators. The PDO was phrased well to encompass the outcomes of
the project activities. An explicit reference to the beneficiaries and the impact on livelihoods
would have made the PDO more precise. The results framework was thoroughly revised and
modified during the project implementation, yet it remained weak to explain how the
rehabilitation of the project activities contributed to the achieved values in the PDO indicators.
The activities undertaken by the project contributed to make an appreciable difference in the
livelihoods of the benefitted communities, by enhancing the access to water and increasing the
size of the animal herds. The VDCs have strengthened communities ownership over their
investments, and empowering in their dialogue with administration at the state and locality level.
The rehabilitation of the markets remains incomplete. The market boards in El Nuhoud and
Tendeltin are collecting fees from the users. However, the markets are not fully operational and
some basic sercices are not provided yet. The risk for a steady deterioration of the infrastructures
is high. The overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to the difficulty to fully
attribute the values of the PDO indicators to the project intervention.

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
51. The restocking subprojects have been successful in increasing the herd size of the targeted
pastoralists households, as well as in providing revenues to cover their expenses and basic needs.
The improved access to water points has been reported to reduce the diseases within the
communities. Some communities report using the revenues from the water fees in building and
rehabilitating school facilities, health centers, and mosques; fencing; and building cement rooms
for the community members. The project has boosted the communities ownership over the
rehabilitated and constructed infrastructures, and enhanced their empowerment to maintain
dialogue and demand services from the authorities. The improved livelihoods and assets
availability at the community level has enhanced the collective access to formal financial
services provided by microfinance institutions.
52. The market rehabilitation works and the support to transparency offer good prospects from
the poor pastoralists to increase their revenues from selling animals. Small local businesses are
mushrooming around the market facilities to provide producers and traders with food and
beverages. Suppliers of animal health services (like pharmacies, veterinarians) are also settling
mobile-offices in the surroundings of the market, delivering services during the market days. Yet
transport costs remain high to carry animals from communities to the market place, and



                                                19
frequently traders and middlemen buy the animals directly from the communities. The 2012
Internal Impact Assessment found that pastoralists and other animal producers sell their product
more frequently in local village markets (39.7 percent of the surveyed households) or in satellite
markets (28.6 percent), rather than in the rehabilitated markets (16.4 percent). The main factors
for that remain the distance from their villages, the prices are reasonable in the other markets,
and easy market access. This evidence suggests that pastoralists still face difficulties to make the
most of the opportunities in the rehabilitated markets.
53. ILPM was critical in increasing and improving access to water resources, which has
important implications for women’s and girl’s time, health and security. Women accounted for
45 percent of community members participating in income generating activities and specifically
within the livestock restocking groups. To encourage and ensure female participation,
particularly in community decision-making committees established by the projects, ILPM
required 25-35 percent participations rates of women in ruminant restocking activities, 30
percent participation in VDCs. The project also hired one woman out of every three staff to
improve outreach to female community members.
b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
54. The project staff has developed key capacities in procurement, financial management, and
environmental and social safeguards. The 4-level architecture of the project implementation
arrangements, at the Federal, State, Locality and community level, allows extending the created
capacities not only at the central level, but also at the sub-federal levels. According to the 2012
Internal Impact Assessment, 79 percent of the surveyed households showed appreciation for the
work of the VDCs, and agreed with their effectiveness and continuation. In the context of the
ongoing devolution process, this project outcome is even more remarkable. The experience with
the privatization of animal health services in North Kordofan offers a benchmark and concrete
inputs and steps for other states willing to engage in a similar process. As the Veterinary
Privatization Advisory Committee (VPAC) report in 2011 pointed out, the mobility of private
vets and the CAHWs, and especially the wide spread of illegal drugs for animal health remain
key challenges. The Market Boards offer a new management approach to livestock markets in
Sudan, opening the participation to relevant stakeholders (Locality, Pastoralist and Herders
Unions, private veterinarians) and increasing awareness about the need to collect fees based on
the services delivered, and to ensure the sustainability of the infrastructures. The project has
provided the livestock sector government units at the Federal, State and Locality levels with
methodologies and experiences on mobilizing and engaging communities in managing basic
infrastructures and promoting income generating activities.

55. ILPM was an emergency project implemented under post-conflict setting. The prospects to
guarantee the sustainability of the project outcomes after completion are mixed.
56. The rehabilitated water points have substantially reduced the time needed to access water
(from 7 hours to 1 hour in the Alawanra community). VDC and communities ownership is
strong. VDC overlook water points and collect fees and the revenues being used for maintenance
and operation works, and to improve the living conditions of the community households (in the
Wad Shaifoon community, the revenues allow to provide each household with one cement
room). The risk of changes detrimental to sustainability is low.
57. The restocking activities are fulfilling good expectations. Communities are committed and
concerned with ensuring proper use of the project resources. The collective increase in the
household livelihoods allow to access financial services. Increase in animal heard does not
necessarily help access markets. Transport costs remain high for the poor pastoralists, and
middlemen usually buy animals in situ in the communities. The risk of changes detrimental to
sustainability is moderate. In Sudan rangeland degradation and conflict over land between
pastoral groups and farmers has often followed higher stocking rates. In the long term,
investments are needed in rangeland management, conflict resolution, and in value-added to
livestock production.
58. Full functionality of the 6 rehabilitated markets, and therefore their sustainability, is not
guaranteed. The Market Boards are constituted and operational. As per the field visit during the
completion mission, pastoralists and traders are operating in the market, yet works are not
completed, and some equipment and infrastructures are deteriorating. Evidence on the equipment
used for the Livestock Market Data Base is lacking. Entrance and per transaction fees are duly
collected, where 70 percent of these revenues are assigned to the Locality and the other 30
percent to market management. Some localities have shown delays in paying their contribution,
and in the case of Damazin, the State Ministry of Finance had to intervene and take over the
market management. Markets need to operate autonomously to become self-sustaining.
Discussions about the legal status and ownership are ongoing and involve the Federal Ministry of
Finance, the State Ministries of Livestock, the Localities and the Herders Association. Given the
extent of the institutional changes proposed, the project could have benefitted from paying more
attention to the political economy in the management of livestock markets. The risk of changes
detrimental to sustainability is high.
59. The decision of the Ministry of Finance to finance the continuation of the PCU, following
a request by the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Range is to be welcomed. The project has
created capacities. Likewise, the expected IFAD intervention in continuing and scaling-up some
of the pilot activities initiated by ILPM. Financial constraints remain significant for the
Government of Sudan. The risk of changes detrimental to sustainability is moderate.
60. The livestock route demarcation in the Eastern Sector was satisfactory. It contributed to
prevent conflicts between pastoralists and settled farmers and provided states high-quality inputs.
To strengthen the sustainability of the infrastructures constructed, the PCU signed three
memorandum of understanding with the three-targeted states of the Eastern Sector (Blue Nile,
Sinnar and White Nile states). VDCs are involved in overlooking livestock routes’ service
centers. The risk of changes detrimental to sustainability is moderate.

5.   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1. Bank Performance
a)       Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
61. As per the technical design, the ILPM was not a complex project, a wise approach for such
a fragile and post-conflict setting. The main activities addressed investments in infrastructures,
matching grants, and institutional changes in livestock markets, animal health services, and
community management. The PCU, the PIUs and LIUs were set as parallel structures to
government bodies. The implementation and the multi-level institutional coordination were
expected to be demanding. The FPP implementation arrangements and the identified risks were
appropriate. The WB actively involved in the implementation of mitigating measures, by
committing to provide training and technical assistance to build capacity – especially in sensitive
areas like procurement, financial management and safeguards. The FPP set up the ILPM as a
pilot and with strong country-level limitations. These positive aspects were challenged by: (i) the
WB Country Office was not fully staffed at the project design which moderately impeded the
implementation support of all projects under the MDTF-NS, thereby the M&E and the
supervision aspects should have accordingly been flagged as critical aspects; and (ii) the design
results framework and the relevant indicators remained weak. The POM failed to provide
adequate guidance to the needs of the project teams. Ultimately, the Bank took for granted that
the Government would be in the position to fulfill its pledged funding, even when the country
was facing a dramatic fiscal crisis. This led to the need to restructure the project several times,
explaining the Moderately Unsatisfactory rating.
b)       Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
62. ILPM was a pilot project in a post-conflict setting where the available capacities were
weak. The FPP set the need for close monitoring and supervision as bottom line of the project
implementation. The 2013 MDTF-NS evaluation found that, in the early days, the in-country
staffing was a challenge for the Bank and had decisive impact on the implementation of the
Fund’s projects13. The project was led by four TTLs. Safeguards was one of the areas affected.
Before March 2009, the Khartoum Country Office had not been staffed with a safeguards
specialist. The 2012 MDTF-NS Environmental and Social SG Performance Review concluded
that the Bank might have been late in responding to the ILPM capacity gaps on safeguards. Early
supervision missions should have paid more detailed attention to safeguards, and issues raised in
the ESMF were apparently insufficiently discussed during supervisions (Gross and Kardash,
2012).
63. Notwithstanding the gaps identified at the beginning of the implementation, the remarkable
revamp of the supervision tasks during the second half of the project lifespan deserves
recognition. The referred evaluations also acknowledge that the Bank responded over the project


13
  “The fact that in-country staffing was a challenge for the World Bank in the MDTF-N’s early days had a direct and negative
impact on the implementation of the Fund’s projects; however, the Bank eventually responded to the human resource and
technical support needs and the current capacity of the Technical Secretariat is experienced and adequate for the current level of
operations” (ICF GHK, 2013).


                                                               22
implementation and took corrective measures. The close implementation support and the
proactive role in monitoring led the Bank to take timely measures (extension of closing dates,
additional financing, modification of result frameworks) that redirected the project
implementation. During the project timeframe, the WB provided the project with eight
Implementation Supervision Missions (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2 in Annex 4) and four partial
missions focusing on specific aspects (field visit conducted in January 2013 or M&E specific
mission in August 2011 for instance). WB M&E specialists and safeguards specialists
participated in three missions. Procurement and FM specialists participated in six missions. In
overall, the supervision reports were of good quality and adequately reflected the problems
arising in the project implementation. The main issues encountered during the implementation
were adequately reported to management levels in the ministries. In some instances, the reports
failed to provide an accurate, consistent and updated assessment of the project implementation,
and in some cases, the wording may have been optimistic14. In addition, the supervision rightly
paid more attention to M&E and safeguard issues, as shown in the ISRs and aides memoires.
Despite all this, the project implementation was well advanced as to make the most of those
corrective actions. Therefore given (i) the close implementation support that was given to this
project, (ii) the proactivity that was demonstrated by the timely restructurings of the project , (iii)
the flexibility shown to help the client achieving results in such as complex environment, (iv) the
proper handover process followed during the changes of TTLs, and (v) the fact that the Bank
team cannot be held responsible for the unpredictable financing of the project and that the timely
restructurings (extension of closing dates, AFs) were more the proof of their adaptability, the
Satisfactory rating of the Bank performance for this project is justified.


c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
64. Following the ICR Guidelines (OPCS, 2011), the Overall Bank Performance is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, since the rating of Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is
Moderately Unsatisfactory, the rating of the Quality of the Supervision is Satisfactory, and the
Rating of the Overall Outcome is Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
a)       Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
65. The GoNS has recurrently committed to making the livestock sector a key contributor to
the Sudanese economic growth. However, having already committed its budget to other MDTF-
NS projects (Census and New Currency projects which required substantial funding), the GoNS
was no able to meet all its financial commitments to the project. This slowed progress at the start


14
  Once the safeguards instruments were finally issued, the rating on Safeguards was set as Satisfactory. It was after the 2012
MDTF Safeguards Review highlighted some deficiencies, that the rating was rightly downgraded back to Moderately
Satisfactory. Despite the 2009 MTR had agreed changes in the results framework, the following ISR #05 (12 months after the
MTR) still reported over the earlier set of indicators. The situation was corrected in the following ISR #06. The indicator of
progress towards PDO at MTR was rated as Moderately Satisfactory, when only 18 months were left.


                                                             23
and was one of the reasons for the 1st restructuring. This commitment still needs a more decisive
support and better identify and tackle existing bottlenecks. During project implementation, the
GoNS did not respond in a timely manner to solve out some key implementation issues. The
delayed disbursement of the ILPM funding contribution, the non-materialization of over two
thirds of the initially pledged funds, or the delayed fulfillment in preparing the safeguards
instruments as legal covenants had critical implications for the project management and
implementation. The GoNS has shown interest in building up on the project outcomes; for
instance, approving the legal framework, by-laws and strategy approved by the Federal Minister
of Animal Resources for the privatization of veterinary services, following the pilot activities in
North Kordofan; committing funding to the continuation project by IFAD; or committing
US$0.25 million to fund a bridging period between the ILPMP closure and the arrival of new
donors, in order to retain the experience as well as the technical, managerial and fiduciary skills.
However, by the completion mission the disbursement of the bridge funding was still not
effective.
b)      Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
66. Despite the delayed provision key resources for starting up and the capacity limitations, the
project units at the Federal, State and Locality remained committed and engaged during the
project implementation. Since the beginning of the project, the ISRs have consistently and
adequately rated the overall implementation progress and the project management as Moderately
Satisfactory and Satisfactory. The project was specially demanding in terms of coordinating the
four-level implementation arrangements; and supervising and supporting communities,
especially with regards the procurement management. The PCU needs to be commended for
providing backstopping support and responding to capacity shortcomings at the state and locality
levels in key areas, such as FM and procurement. The unit’s performance in following up the
completion of market rehabilitation works showed some minor shortcomings. Yet the Federal
MARFR have acknowledged the PCU skills and performance by committing resources to cover
operating costs and continue building capacities in the established local units.
c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
67. Following the ICR Guidelines (OPCS, 2011), the Overall Borrower Performance is rated
as Moderately Satisfactory, since the rating of Government Performance is Moderately
Unsatisfactory, the rating of the Implementing Agency Performance is Satisfactory, and the
Rating of the Overall Outcome is Moderately Satisfactory.

6.    Lessons Learned
68.    The lessons learned from the project are five, as discussed below.
69. First, in a post conflict setting, empowering communities through capacity building is
key to development success. This also requires solid M&E systems and results framework
to track and benchmark progress. Because of weak capacities, the project directly engaged
the communities in project implementation and in training activities, which helped build their
capacity, including also in additional monitoring efforts. The communities were strongly
empowered in delivering on activities to build resilience – in restocking, building water points,


                                                 24
and in constituting village development communities. Although the project’s design lacked wide
consultation due to preparation under OP8.00, this was rectified during implementation when
communities were consulted on the activities and they participated effectively; this also helped
to build their capacity and mobilize local resources for implementation. A large majority of the
communities showed appreciation for the VDCs. Supra-community entrenched administrative
levels were reluctant to transfer responsibilities or decision-making power to the communities.
Working through local staff however was more efficient than bringing in external capacity and
this approach became instrumental for building sustainable capacity. A larger engagement of
partners at local level, especially community groups, required additional resources for
community capacity building and training activities. Since the available technical and managerial
skills were weak, the community 'learning-by-doing' approach required putting added emphasis
on setting a robust monitoring and evaluation system for the community to self-monitor and
track progress.
70. Second, working in conflict-affected settings requires proactive supervision and
‘contingent thinking’ during project implementation: In a country affected by conflict,
supervision cannot be limited to routine follow up, but requires heightened proactivity in
anticipating bottlenecks and adjusting accordingly. Initially, the project set to target 34 water
points, of which 6 were in a conflict affected area. Following violent outbreaks, the number of
water points was revised down to 28. Yet this relatively minor change followed a supervision
mission, and required a whole restructuring process, which included drafting the relevant
restructuring paper. For similar cases, a mechanism should be explored to provide project teams
with enough flexibility to evaluate the context and reallocate funding towards more secure and
‘contingent’ areas, in case conflicts arise. This mechanisms would build upon a set of ‘contingent
targeting areas’ to be defined ahead or during project implementation. If necessary, the
reallocation would just need that the government reports to the WB about the change in the
targeted areas. As usual, the WB does not need to approve the areas to be targeted, but should
focus on the country as a whole. In short, working in post-conflict environments like Sudan,
where resources are unpredictable and capacities are weak, it helps to maintain flexibility and
adaptability to get to successful results. Close supervision and interaction with the client and
implementing agency helps in enhancing proactivity and in supporting the client in finding
solutions to implementation challenges and realization of project development objectives.
71. Third, the use of an independent monitoring agent (MA) in fragile-environments is
instrumental to provide monitoring services and on-the-job capacity building. The MA was
a third-party agent hired to monitor the implementation of the MDTF-NS not only the ILPMP.
The MA played an important monitoring and capacity development role, providing training and
on-the-job assistance to PIU staff and through use of other WB training activities. This stype of
additional partner monitoring and implementation support is quite relevant to countries like
Sudan, where fiduciary assessment was lacking during the preparation of the project. If costs
associated with an MA are kept manageable, this modality of third party monitoring can be
designed in a way that generates economies of scale to include other projects.
72. Fourth, community-driven restocking activities proved a success in enhancing
livelihoods and building social capital. The ILPMP set up the implementation of the
community-driven re-stocking activities as a revolving fund. Along with the project matching
grants, the communities contributed at least 20 percent of the subproject costs, in the form of
either cash or in-kind. The implementation mechanism also built on the fee-based Village


                                               25
Development Committees (VDC). Unlike the water rehabilitation activities, the restocking
required additionally of ‘community sub-groups’ (CS) that held each other accountable for the
herds’ care. For most of these communities, fee-based VDCs and CSs were a remarkable
institutional innovation. The project provided the communities with flexibility to decide on the
appropriate governance arrangements, memberships, herds composition, as well as rules of the
revolving fund. Besides the regular follow-up, the project guidance was limited to the technical
aspects. The LIU officers advised the VDC procurement committees at the time of assessing and
picking out the animals, which were more suitable for the communities requests and conditions.
VDCs revenues were reported to be used in rehabilitating school facilities, health centers, and
mosques; fencing; and building cement rooms for the community members. After project
completion, the GoNS committed to continue the training and building of the capacities of the
VDCs through the PCU.
73. Fifth, the experience of privatization of animal health services in North Kordofan set
a nation-wide milestone. Around 70 percent of the Sudanese sheep exports come from North
Kordofan. The bulk of animal health services were already privatized (extension, treatments,
surgeries). Private veterinarians reported that vaccinations remained hard to privatize due to the
strong opposition of vested interests. Yet the decisive political support at locality and state levels
were key in making headway. The challenge was translating the political support into concrete
actions. Following the privatization decree, the policy reform remained critical. A privatization
study and strategy informed the subsequent legal framework that was later endorsed by the State
Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources. Awareness campaigns helped raise interest
among private veterinarians to get engaged in delivering the services. To support the
veterinarians business plans, the ILPMP financed a revolving fund to finance drugs, equipment
and vaccines. Similarly the project made available trained community animal health workers to
better reach out to clients, one of the key constraints. Among the remaining challenges, the
spread of illegal trade of drugs appeared as the major threat to the sustainability of the private
veterinarians’ business.

a)        Project Cost by Component (in US$ Million)

1. At the project appraisal, the total proposed cost was US$ 20 million, of which the
Government would cover US$12 million and the MDTF-NS US$8 million. The project had two
phases, the Phase 1 for US$7.7 million (of which MDTF-NS contributed with US$ 4.0 million)
and the Phase 2 for US$12.30 million. Due to the MDTF’s budget constraints and non-
materialization of a significant part of the GoNS commitment, the project was unable to access
Phase II financial resources and Phase I resources were extended. Following two batches of
additional MDTF-NS financing (US$2.51 million in 2010, US$1.80 million in 2012) the final
project cost totaled US$12.01 million (financed through US$8.31 million from the MDTF-NS
and US$3.70 million from the GoNS)

    Annex 2: Outputs by Component

       Component 1 – Livestock Development Investment Fund (US$ 5.10 million)

The objective for this Component 1 was to increase animal productivity through demand-driven
initiatives. The investment fund was expected to provide matching grants to finance activities
and technical assistance demanded by pastoral communities that are related to increasing
productivity and sales of livestock.

Outputs delivered through the water points sub-component:
a) The LDIF interventions on water points targeted 32 communities in the localities of Abu
   Zabad (5 communities), Gebaish (6), and El Nuhoud (5) in North Kordofan, and in the East
   Sector, in Abuhjar (8), Eljabalain (3), and El Damazine (5).
b) The 32 water points rehabilitated and constructed were directly access and benefited from the
   water for both human and animal consumptions, estimated in 28,097 direct and indirect
   beneficiary households and 537,735 animals in the targeted areas.
c) Over SDG 4,5 million invested in the projects, of which SDG 1,2 million (26.5 percent of the
   total cost) were in-kind and cash contributions by the communities (SDG 0.7 and 0.5 million
   respectively).
d) Out the revenues obtained with the fees, the respective Village Development Committees
   could allocate funding to a variety of activities of benefit for their communities. The most
   common interventions aimed to pay for training and incentives (10 VDCs), school
   maintenance (8VDCs), health center (6 VDCs) and operation and maintenance of the water
   points (4 VDCs).

Outputs delivered through the water points sub-component:
a) The LDIF interventions on livestock restocking targeted 32 communities in the localities of
   Abu Zabad (8 communities), Gebaish (6), and El Nuhoud (9) in North Kordofan, and in the
   East Sector, in Abuhjar (3), Eljabalain (3), and El Damazine (2), and Altadamun (1).
b) The project delivered 3,480 animals in the 23 communities located in North Kordofan. After
   the project intervention, the stock of animals had increased to over 7,890 animals, a 227
   percent of increase in the herd in those communities. In average, and over the 806
   households benefitted by this subcomponent in North Kordofan, the project delivered in
   average
c) In both sectors, the project benefited directly 4,889 households with an investment of SDG
   1.27 million, of which SDG 0.29 million (20.5 percent of the total cost) were in-kind and
   cash contributions by the communities (SDG 0.2 and 0.1 million respectively).
d) To mobilize the communities, the project supported the constitution and support to
   Community Groups. By the project completion, 133 community groups had been formed of
   which 79 (59.4 percent) qualified to receive livestock restocking support.



                                              28
Two NGOs, one per sector, were expected to carry out the community mobilization for the LDIF
implementation. Despite several attempts by the PCU, the process of identifying and recruiting
these NGOs failed. The PCU advertised the consultancy service for the first time on October
2007. Following a review of the procedures by the WB, the service contract was re-advertised
for the second time on July 2008. The call was not simultaneously advertised in the DG market.
The consultancy service was then advertised for the third time on September 2008. The selection
committee was formed on October 13, 2008. On November 8, 2008 the short list of three NGOs
(one international and two nationals) was submitted to the WB approval on a no-objection basis.
However, only one NGO later sent the request for proposal but later did not take up the
assignment.

The PCU and the WB team devised a mechanism to engage project staff at LIU and PIU levels in
carrying out those activities. The PCU and the Community Development Fund (CDF) project
signed a Memorandum of Understanding, by which CDF staff committed to train ILPM staff in
methodologies for community mobilization. The training was undertaken at Al Medani – Al
Kaseh Camp from January 24 to 31 2009. The training targeted 36 ILPM staff: six participants
from each locality including the LIU Coordinator, seconded Veterinarian, Range & Pasture
officer, Animal Production officer, and two partially seconded females from relevant
departments.

Following the training, the LIUs staff with support of PIUs formed a 6-member team at each
locality level. The mobilization process started by selecting 5 villages in the targeted localities,
which resulted in a total of 29 communities and facilitated the selection of 29 community sub-
projects. The selected communities were trained to help them analyze and decide on their
priority development needs. Out of their deliberations, each community came up with a list of
priorities based on the funding opportunities that the project provided. The result of the
deliberations is included in the Appendix (Tables 2.1 and 2.2).

Based on the identified priority needs, the LIU and PIUs staff helped the pastoral communities to
design eligible subprojects. The FPP set the following criteria for the subproject eligibility:
   a) Subprojects will have to demonstrate that they are demand-driven, i.e. prioritized and to
      be implemented by pastoral groups, are economically, socially, technically and
      environmentally sustainable and that they are simple and avoid administrative
      complexity.
   b) Subprojects will have to be livestock improvement-related investments that could among
      others include: provision of water, range and pasture management/improvement and
      other activities such as stock fattening, stall feeding and advisory services.
   c) Subprojects will be financed as matching grants to local communities with typical project
      costs ranging between SDG 40,000-150,000. The fund will finance a maximum of 80
      percent of total subproject cost, with the remaining 20 percent covered by cash or in-kind
      contributions from the beneficiaries, local government counterpart funds or third parties.
      A minimum of 5 percent in cash contribution by the community will be required. Project
      implementation will not exceed 24 months.




                                                29
The LIUs had to review the designed subprojects, after which, endorsed subproject proposals
were to be transmitted to the SSC for approval. The LIUs was also expected to elaborate the
framework agreements (specifying the roles, obligations and responsibilities of parties) for
approved subprojects. The financed projects will be implemented by the communities and
contractors. To facilitate the implementation of these subprojects, a comprehensive guideline on
Matching Grant management was also prepared. By the end of second year, the project was
expected to have 15 water points rehabilitated or constructed managed by the communities, and
20 subprojects supporting livestock production and marketing.

Water points sub-projects

The Rural Water Corporation (RWC) at locality levels engaged in the design of the water points
rehabilitation works and in the setting-up of the matching grants for the targeted communities.
Community contributions were set at least by 20 percent of the total project cost.

The project supported the efforts by the VDC and the RWC to set up a management plan with
water payments covering operational and maintenance costs. Additional saving could be re-
invested by village committees in supporting non-water or livelihood projects. The tripartite
agreements (the project, RWC and VDC) included the following breakdown of revenues: 30
percent as VDC share, 30 percent as RWC share, and 40 percent for the maintenance.

During the preparation of the Functionality Assessment in 2012, the MAs visited the water
points investments. The in-site visits found that 17 water points in the Eastern States (4 in White
Nile, 8 in Sinnar, and 5 in Blue Nile) were on-ground and functional (see results in Appendix,
Table 2.3). Each one of the 11 water points visited in the North Kordofan State was equipped
with a water tank, fence, troughs, clerk room, submersible or reciprocating pump, tabs, pump
house, and one unit diesel generator. The latrines were the only missed element in the
investments. Each latrine cost was estimated in the amount of SDG 8,000 in the Eastern States
communities and SDG 20,000 in North Kordofan.

By the completion, the project has completed 32 water point sub-projects, of which 16 in North
Kordofan (5 in Abu Zabad, 5 in Nuhoud – of which 1 for animals, and 6 in Gebaish – of which 1
in a livestock market and 1 for animals) and 16 in the East Sector (8 in Abuhjar, 3 in Aljabalain,
and 5 in Eldamazine). Sustainability was ensured by building capacity within these VDCs
through regular trainings and cost-recovery mechanisms.

Restocking sub-projects

To work as a revolving fund, the restocking activities required a different implementation
mechanism. The VDC utilized the project funding and the community contributions to purchase
animals from the market and distribute them among the community members. The revolving
mechanism relied on ‘community sub-groups’ (CS) that the community members formed based
on their own personal preferences. The sense of belonging to a particular tribe was a common
criteria to decide what group to join. Usually, the communities have come up with 5-7 CSs, each
with 15 households in average.




                                                30
During an Assembly meeting, the community members raffled the order in which each CS would
benefit from the project. The first sub-group had to pick out the wished number of animals, sheep
and goats. The decision was based on experience, preferences and available resources: sheep are
more demanding – in terms of time and resources – but also more profitable than goats; female
members usually asked for goats, and men for sheep. The VDC procurement committee
purchased the animals from the market. The LIU officers provided the committee support in
deciding the quality of the animals. The re-stocking turnover lasts between 12-16 months, after
which the subgroup members repay their loan to the second group. Borrowers can pay back their
debts either in-kind or cash. Because of inflation, members usually prefer to pay in-kind, using
offsprings and the mature animals.

Vaccinations are part of the subgroup funding contribution. Where available, the CAHWs
provide vaccination services. The costs of lost animals were shared collectively among the
members of the relevant subgroup. Monitoring services is in charge of the relevant subgroup
leader, who had to report to the VDC monthly; the VDC Secretary, and the leader of the
following CS in the queue. During the project implementation, LIUs officers visited each
community weekly or twice a month, to provide extension services, and to monitor subprojects.

By the project completion (see Table 2.5), this LDIF component had implemented 32 restocking
sub-projects, of which 23 in North Kordofan (8 in Abuzabad, 9 in El Nuhoud, 6 in Gebaish) and
3 in the East Sector (3 in Abuhjar, 3 in Aljabalain, 1 in Altadamun, and 2 in Eldamazine).
a) The project had invested SDG 1.27 million for restocking activities in 32 communities. Per
   states, SDG 0.77 million in North Kordofan, covering 23 communities, and SDG 0.5 million
   in the Eastern States, covering 9 communities.
b) With regards the community’s contributions, the communities initially contributed with SDG
   0.29 million (20.5 percent of the project contribution), of which 0.5 million (6.44 percent)
   was in cash, and the rest in-kind. Per states, communities from North Kordofan contributed
   with SDG 0.19 million (24.1 percent of the project contribution), of which 0.07 million were
   cash (8.53 percent). In turn, the communities of the Eastern States provide with SDG 0.1
   million (20.52 percent of the project contribution), of which 0.03 million were cash (6.44
   percent).
c) In terms of beneficiaries, 4,889 households were covered, of which 3,898 were male-headed
   and 991 female-headed households (20.3 percent). Per states, in the Western State of North
   Kordofan the communities targeted 806 households, of which 246 were female-headed
   households (30.5 percent). In the Eastern States, the communities attended 4,083 households,
   of which 745 were headed by females (18.2 percent).
d) The communities had established in total 133 CSs, of which already 79 CSs had been
   covered (59.4 percent of the total CSs). Per community, the mode value of the formed CSs
   was 4 and of CSs already attended during the re-stocking cycle was 3 CSs.
e) The accumulated stock of animals amounted up to 11,410 animals. North Kordofan keeps the
   bulk of the animals, with a total of 7,896, and the rest, 3,514 animals in the Eastern Sector. In




                                                31
       North Kordofan, the restocking activities are having an outstanding impact15. The average
       size of the household herds increased from 13 to 22 animals. This increase includes only the
       households effectively covered by the project completion with the restocking cycle; that is,
       only those households that had thus far directly contributed and benefited from these
       activities. Per locality, the increases are remarkable as well: from 14 to 21 animals per
       household in the communities of the El Nuhoud locality, from 11 to 18 in Gebaish, and from
       14 to 27 in Abuzabad.

This success was possible due to a regular follow up by project and Government advisory staff
that delivered trainings and messages related to animal health, nutrition and improved husbandry
practices. After project closure, the GoNS has committed itself to maintain the PCU and provide
minimum operating costs to continue training and building capacities of the VDCs.

One key factor may have been the training by the project and the MFI Agricultural Bank of
Sudan to the communities in the Western Sector. This training addressed rural microfinance,
financial management, rural finance and management, and also targeted private veterinarians
participating in the component 2. Later, this training was extended to support women groups to
help identify micro-finance opportunities in restocking and agro-processing of dairy products.

            Component 2 – Privatization of animal health services and livestock markets
            (US$1.40 million)

The objective of this component 2 was to test pilot activities in the privatization of animal health
services and improvement of livestock markets. The assumptions to work in this component was
that improving the animal health would increase livestock productivity, and that upgrading
livestock markets would provide producers and traders with better incentives to use the markets
to sell and buy animals. This component comprised two subcomponents: Privatization of animal
health service; and Rehabilitation of livestock markets.

2.1 Privatization of animal health services

This component aimed to support provision of animal health and vaccination services by the
private sector in all nine localities of North Kordofan, and reinforce the regulatory and
supervisory capacity of locality and state veterinary services. Technical assistance was needed to
assess the prevailing policy and legal framework for animal health service provision, propose
changes where necessary, and to design a privatization strategy. Registered private animal health
service providers were to be contracted to deliver vaccination and other animal health services.
The project would support the providers with training and business start-up resources to cover
costs such as for transport, vaccines, drugs, refrigeration etc. State and locality veterinary
services will be provided with training to monitor the work of the private veterinarians service
providers.

     Data on the amount of animals initially contributed by the project to the Eastern Sector states are not available.


                                                                    32
As a result of the work in this component, ten veterinarians were hired by the Veterinary
Privatization Advisory Committee (VPAC) to provide technical services in Elnhoud locality, on
vaccination, treatment, and extension services to pastoralists. Each veterinarian was associated
with four Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs), who were trained by the ILPM and
supervised by the VPAC. In total, 91 CAHWs benefitted from training. Additionally, the project
established a revolving fund to finance the private vets. This fund was set up in the Agricultural
Bank, and was managed by three parties (the DG of Animal Resources, the Head of the
Pastoralist Union, and the Head of VPAC).

This component required on the State Government of North Kordofan to issue a State Decree in
order to legalize the practice of private veterinaries delivering animal health services. Despite the
delays in issuing the decree, the State remained willing to move ahead with the privatization. The
Decree was finally issued in April 16, 2009, and specifically legalized the practice of
vaccinations by private veterinaries and their charging a fee for the service. Vaccines for key
diseases remained free. Other animal health services were already privatized: extension, usually
free-of-charge; treatment, where drugs and a fee per flock – between SDG 50-100 per dose –
were charged; and surgery, with a fee of around SDG 50 for minor surgeries.

Once issued the decree, ILPM supported the government of North Kordofan in drafting a
strategy and implementation plan on Veterinary Services Privatization. ILPM support the
elaboration of the strategy and the plan so as to ensure that framework was in line with the
standards of the World Organization for the Animal Health and remained consistent with the
federal policies. The subsequent legal framework was approved by the Federal Minister of
Animal resources, including by-laws and strategy for privatization of veterinary services using
Public Private Partnership. The framework and the strategy aimed to organize the work of the
private veterinarians, and were subsequently endorsed by the state minister of the Agriculture
and Animal Resources and deposited at the VPAC. As a key actor in following up on the
Privatization Act, the VPAC ensured the publication of the actual Act, and the development of
the regulatory framework.

In parallel, the project carried out activities (mostly workshops) to raise awareness among private
veterinaries interested in the vaccination practice under that new privatized modality, which
included using the services of the Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) to conduct
community outreach. The procedure was as follows:
   Veterinaries had to submit a proposal to the LIU on how they plan to operate and what type
    of resources they will require.
   An agreement followed identifying mechanisms (micro-finance or matching grant) to fund
    start up requirements.
   The selected veterinaries received short training on business management and two training on
    project design and proposal writing.
   Once selected and trained, veterinaries could interview and select the CAHWs to be engaged
    in their practice.




                                                 33
Since the pilot activities started, the practice has offered remarkable lessons about the impact,
and possible way forward. As a lesson for other states, the relevant stakeholders highlight the
need for public sector eager to privatize, without reluctance, that acknowledges that private
operators are more efficient in delivering, and that their engagement does not compete with other
operators. Communities openly welcome the larger engagement of private veterinaries.
Accessibility and ease of delivery has substantially enhanced, and the service delivery is less
bureaucratic and agile: “with just a call, the private veterinaries respond”. Challenges and
constraints also remain.
   Despite the financial support to start their practice, veterinaries still need better access to
    funding, especially to acquire working capital.
   Vaccination supplies need to be more stable. Federal bodies guarantee that stability better
    than state bodies do. Moreover, the privatization should move forward toward engaging
    private retailers, duly authorized by the government, to commercialize the vaccines.
   Privatization should progressively be extended also to the laboratory diagnosis that currently
    is still delivered by the public sector.

2.2 Rehabilitation of livestock markets

Linked to strategy of advancing in privatization animal health services, ILPM initially aimed to
rehabilitate five livestock markets in the four states. The market selection was to be based on
these criteria: (a) markets owned by localities or states (i.e. not to the private sector), (b) markets
with high economic relevance (high number of livestock traded or great potential), (c) localities
or states agreeable to subcontracting market operations and facilitate management by the private
sector.

Project support included civil works and equipment to improve market infrastructure, and
technical assistance to the PCU and the LIUs in the selected localities to prepare tenders for
market management, to private sector and communities to help with bid preparation and
operating/managing markets (market development and management plan), to selected market
operators (including study tours) to efficiently manage markets, and to locality staff to deliver
inspection services. An NGO was expected to mobilize livestock owner/trader groups and
provide training on market price analysis, group marketing, and animal health requirements. The
established livestock marketing groups would be provided with basic communication equipment
to disseminate market prices and information.

As part of the rehabilitation process, the PIUs with support from LIUs in the targeted localities
signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the locality authorities ensuring that the
roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders is clearly highlighted, and that targeted localities
would contribute 20 percent of the rehabilitation cost. PCU also contributed to identify ways to
encourage private operators to delivered services to users of the livestock markets.

The rehabilitation process included the establishment of Livestock Market Boards, composed by
traders, producers and locality representatives. The project included support to build capacity
through study tours, an activity that was not finally executed due to agenda problems. The
markets were also equipped with computers and software to collect and report data for the


                                                  34
Livestock Marketing Database (LMD). The LMD includes a regular reporting system, composed
by monthly reports at LIUs level and aggregated at the PIU level, and the project quarterly
progress reports.

Markets sustainability remains a concern. Discussions between State and localities stakeholders
are still ongoing to negotiate the future of the rehabilitated livestock markets. On the institutional
side, the market boards consolidation and a greater engagement of the communities, building
their capacity and ownership, stand out as priorities. On the financial side, the distribution of
market fees (by which a 70 percent are allocated to the localities for non-market-related
purposes) is being questioned by different stakeholders.

The PCU may still be required to follow up closely on the completion of the pending works.
Following the Functionality Assessment in 2012, the six markets rehabilitated showed
deficiencies and incomplete works. The assessment highlighted investments and improvements,
and quantified the cost of the acquisition and work pending (see Table 2.9). By the completion,
the ISR final reports indicated that the rehabilitation works were completed. However, the field
trip during the completion mission (October 22-23) visited the El Nuhoud and Tendeltin markets.
Based on the assessment included in the Functionality Report, the evidence found indicates that
the rehabilitation works are not completed, and that some equipment is deteriorating. The results
of the visit are included in the table below (see Table 2.10). The two markets are functioning,
pastoralists and traders operate either within the market or in the surroundings. Yet the market
facilities are far from offering conditions expected after the rehabilitation works, especially if the
market users are expected to pay fee for accessing rehabilitated markets.

       Component 3 – Project Implementation and Studies (US$2.8 million)

The objective of this component was to ensure timely implementation of the project, proper
coordination of project activities, and their close monitoring. It would also provide MARFR with
the capacity to collect data and information to inform policy change, including resources for
studies in support of a livestock census and natural resource-based conflict mitigation.

Given the pilot nature of the program and execution in four states, the project financed a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) in MARF, the implementing agency that coordinated project activities;
two PCU-supporting Project Implementation Units (PIUs), established in the State Ministries of
Agriculture, Animal Resources and Irrigation (SMAARI), at Sinnar (in Sinnar State) and El
Obeid (in North Kordofan); and Locality Implementation Units (LIUs) at each locality. Project
availed resources for: close monitoring and impact assessment of project activities under the
supervision of the PCU and PIUs and with the collaboration of implementing partners and
beneficiaries; and conducting a baseline survey and identifying key indicators against which
project progress and impact would be measured.

This arrangement set up two different implementation architectures: the ‘decentralized
arrangement’ for the North Kordofan State, to cover three localities (Gheibeish, En Nuhud and
Abu Zabed) and the ‘centralized arrangement’ for the Eastern States, each one with one locality
(Singa in the Sinnar State, Damazine in the Blue Nile State, and Gabaleein in the White Nile
State). In the former arrangement, the PIU and LIUs were in the same State; in the latter


                                                 35
arrangement, one PIU and LIU were in the same State (Sennar) while the two other LIUs were in
different States. In this ‘decentralized arrangement’, the key aspect was that the arrangement
could also be owned by the two States without PIU. During the MTR, these two States objected
to participate in meetings of the State Steering Committee (SSC) chaired by one State. The
concerns included the attention that the PIU in Sennar could provide to the other two States.
Ideally, a dedicated PIU for each state would be the best solution, which would enhance state
ownership and remove the current irritants in the smooth functioning of the project. Ideally, a
PIU for each state would enhance state ownership. But each State in the Eastern Sector only had
one locality. The solution was to create the position of Deputy Project Coordinator (DPC) in the
PIU to attend the two states of White Nile and Blue Nile, provide the required technical and
operational support to the LIUs of the two states, and represent the PIU coordinator in SSC
meetings of these states. In addition, the LIU coordinators were given more authority to interact
with the SSCs and report to the DPC/PIU Coordinator.

The following key studies have been sponsored by the project. After their completion, they are
reported to have been endorsed by the MARFR.
   Study on factors contributing to conflict in pastoral production system. This innovative and
    comprehensive study shed light on the roots of violent and non-violent conflicts among
    pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and sedentary farmers in Sudan. Discussions during the
    elaboration of the report backed the decision of adding the new component 4 on demarcation
    of livestock routes. The study results were discussed and broadly disseminated through a
    national workshop in Khartoum (August 2010) and a WB-organized Seminar on Conflicts
    and Pastoralism in the Dry Lands in Nairobi (June 2013).
   Study to design livestock marketing database, as part of the efforts to improve available data
    to inform MARF/States policies, based on the rehabilitation of the livestock markets through
    the Component 2.2.
   Study to develop strategy and guidelines for privatization of veterinary services, as an input
    to build on the privatization decree issued by the State Ministry of Animal Resources in
    North Kordofan, as implemented through the Component 2.1
   Study on management of community investment matching grants that served as an input for
    the implementation of LDIF in the Component 1, after the training and the work by the
    communities to select their priorities.
   Study on the design and management of Livestock Market Rehabilitation, as input for the
    work on the Component 2.2 to rehabilitate livestock markets. The proposed ILPM design
    model of livestock markets was finalized and endorsed the Sudan Standards Metrology
    Organization and Engineering Affairs. This office, along with the PCU, also engaged in
    preparing bids for rehabilitation work and closely monitoring the rehabilitation activities.
   Environmental and social management framework and veterinary chemicals waste
    management plan; and a Resettlement policy framework. These studies were part of the legal
    covenants, and expected to be delivered not later than six months after the Effectiveness
    Date. The documents were completed by May 2010.




                                                36
   Base line survey. The baseline survey was carried out in 2009 and provided the baseline data
    for the Eastern and Western States of the project for the indicators in the results framework.
    The Baseline Study was completed in August 2009 and set the data baseline in May 2009.

This component included initially the preparation of a livestock population census for Sudan
(including Southern Sudan). This activity was expected to strengthen and broaden the IFAD-
funded Livestock and Marketing Information System. By the 2009 MTR, the team verified that
progress in the preparation of the census was unsatisfactory. A reliable methodology was still a
priority for the MARFR to ensure that the next livestock census was to be conducted using the
latest technology available. The MTR team recommended to approach and involve the FAO to
take up this task since it has a strong livestock census expertise at the headquarters. The Under-
Secretary of MARFR agreed to contact the FAO’s Sudanese representative in Rome, and to seek
his assistance in contracting FAO team to undertake the study on livestock census methodology.
The PCU would follow-up with the office of the under-secretary and ensure that the suggested
contacts are made with FAO. An MoU was to be signed with FAO and the project to undertake
the census methodology study to be completed by the end of 2009 including the validation of the
draft report by the stakeholders. By the second quarter of 2010, the project had been informed
that the government allocated different resources for that study.

Livestock Market Database

One of the key knowledge-related project outputs of the project is the Livestock Markets
Information System, built on a Livestock Market Database (LMD) and the dissemination of the
data. This system should provide with a communication infrastructure for reporting and
requesting information on livestock sales and prices from a network of key primary, secondary
and terminal markets in the country. The overall LMD management would be the responsibility
of Marketing Department of the Federal MARFR. The project provided technical assistance to
train and equip the MARFR, and counterparts in key Sudanese livestock markets to collect data
on livestock prices and trade flows (domestic and exports), update and analyze.

The project was rightly sensitive to the specific market conditions in Sudan, and specifically, to
the business-as-usual protocols during the negotiation of transactions. Information on quantities
and prices usually remain between seller and buyer. Incentives are not in place to share
information on prices and standards with other parties. The rationale for this LMD activity was
that producers would get involved in providing information based on the following assumptions:
a) The bargaining position of herders with traders improves. Better and broader information
   leads to better decisions about when and where to sell, how to transport, and to whom to sell.
b) Better decisions may lead to a reduction of transaction costs. This may in turn lead to drive
   down prices for consumers, higher prices for producers, and a more competitive position at
   the export markets.
c) Better information reduces uncertainty and marketing risks, which may encourage doubters
   to participate in the market process (it lowers entry barriers). This may in turn lead to a more
   equitable distribution of marketing profits




                                                37
To ensure the sustainability of the activities, the ILPM and the General Administration of
Planning & Livestock Economics of MARFR signed a MoU that identified the roles and
responsibilities to insure appropriate application and functionality of the LMD system as
planned. An additional MoU was signed with the Sudan Integrated Security Information for
Action (SIFSIA) with the purpose of utilizing the SMS Technique used by SIFSIA in ILPM
targeted markets to obtain livestock prices. Each ILPM targeted market is expected to have an
information officer, responsible of the LMD Unit. A web-based database site
(www.ilpmsd.org/lmd) has been established within the project website to be easily accessed by
interested browsers and concerned parties.

The project will also recruit technical consultants to carry out studies that would inform MARFR
and State policies supporting the livestock sector. In view of the current lack of data concerning
livestock population in Sudan, the first consultancy financed by the project will prepare a
detailed proposal to conduct a livestock population estimate for Sudan (North and Southern
Sudan) and corresponding TORs. Another key consultancy to be supported by the project will
study the efficiency of the inspection quarantine system and propose improvements.

         Component 4 – Rehabilitation of demarcated livestock routes (US$0.34 million)

This component was added following discussions around the study on factors contributing to
conflict between pastoralists and farmers 16 . This study recommended the provision and
enhancement of the basic services along stock routes as a measure towards preventing future
conflicts. In August 2010, the Executive Board approved a revision of components, following an
additional financing of US$2.51 million from the MDTF-NS. Initially the activities aimed to
develop through the LDIF (Component 1) a fast-track program of additional water points along
the livestock routes that were affected by the 2009 drought. The restructuring created a new
Component 4 to address the demarcation of livestock routes. The activities in component 1 were
bottom-up actions and community-driven, while the demarcation and rehabilitation works were
top-down activities that required strong coordination at state-level This component aimed to
develop and sustain the demarcated livestock routes with services’ packages, including mobile
veterinary services using community animal health workers (CAHWs).

The project delivered the demarcation of 346 Km of livestock routes through Blue Nile, Sinnar
and While Nile States. The work required to recognize and identify the livestock routes, the
coordinates were specified and demarcated, and satellite digital maps produced, followed by a
socio-economic survey aiming to list the affected areas, schemes, villages and individuals.
Furthermore, the project proceeded to complete a three integrated service centers at Ruru in Blue
Nile State, El Mazmom in Sinnar State, and Um Elgora en White NileState, along the route.

The demarcation of the livestock routes included work at three levels: identification of the routes
through geographical and land use surveys, determining the GPS coordinates for the markers,
and final placement of stones; issuance of a decree to legally re-establishing the routes; and

development and implementation of resettlement action plan covering acquisition of land within
the route boundaries, and compensation.

Based on advanced GIS technology, the project has mapped these routes. This component also
established and equipped three livestock centers along the stock routes, and provided basic
services. However, the existing monitoring system didn’t allow the project to capture the
effective utilization of these services centers.

    Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

The FPP did not include a detailed economic and financial analysis of the overall project. No
NPV, economic or financial rate of return were calculated a priori, and no analyses are available.
The data on the livestock sector in Sudan remain scant. The FPP admitted the need for a detailed
productivity baseline on the different production systems in the targeted localities to identify and
assess changes due to the project and non-project influences.

Baseline is available since 2009, but did not meet the FPP requests. Available data is sourced
from the ILPM quarterly progress reports, VDC records, and the LMD. Given the limited
information available to conduct this analysis, the results provided in this annex cannot be taken
as conclusive, but merely indicative and exploratory.

FPP Assumptions

The FPP presented a description of the types of impacts and beneficiaries due to the project
activities. The ILPM project proposal assumed that supporting production and marketing in
localities of central and eastern Sudan could help identify options to improve livestock
producers’ revenues, and increase supply and competitiveness of livestock on domestic and
international markets. The project activities were expected to impact directly on individuals (e.g.
animal health services), groups of livestock owners and communities (e.g. rangeland
management regimes, water development and market services), and institutions, through
capacity building (e.g. supporting development of conflict resolution strategies, modernizing
livestock marketing processes).
   Community-led investments on water points benefit directly small-scale producers and
    household budgets with better water supplies and reduced costs of water for household use
    and livestock. Before the project intervention, the farthest village in the Alawamra
    community (in Abuzabad) was at distance of 7 hours walking from the water point; now the
    VDC confirmed that they have stable access to water in just 1 hour.
   Community-led investments on non-water subprojects (restocking, rangeland and feed
    resources) help increase herd and flock productivities; higher off-take rates provide the
    selected community households with improved food security and nutrition, and increased
    cash incomes, as well as enhanced collective access to financial services by micro-finance
    institutions.
   The works on the market rehabilitation, and especially the data dissemination from the LMD
    (prices, animals traded in main markets, key national outlets for the livestock sector), aim to
    increase the market transparency, enhance the bargain power of the producers, and make
    better-informed decisions. Prices are expected to increase and consequently provide the
    pastoralists with higher income.

Other assumptions remain debatable however.
   FPP assumed transferring effective control over key resources as water and pastures
    enhances ownership. Besides transferring control, ILPM provides some evidence that


                                                57
    enhanced ownership, and particularly financial sustainability of the water points, are also
    linked to the additional benefits. Communities report using the revenues obtained through the
    water fees in rehabilitating or building school facilities, health centers, and mosques; fencing;
    and building cement rooms for the community members.
   Unlike what FPP EFA section assumed, the larger engagement of communities in water point
    management is not expected to remove the expenses allocation from the RWC or the
    localities budgets. By virtue of the MoU signed between VDC and the RWC in the respective
    locality, the RWC will still have to provide monitoring and technical services to the
    communities in managing their water points.
   In turn, privatization is reported to have a positive impact in the quality of the services that
    the producers receive. Clients value the promptness that private veterinaries show when
    requested to deliver vaccination. Veterinaries report that there is still leeway to improve the
    service, by further limiting the role of the public sector regarding the vaccines availability or
    the laboratory diagnosis.

Efficiency in achieving the outcomes

The first ILPM outcome was to increase the size of the herd per community household. The
project co-financed the purchase and distribution of sheep and goats for the communities. The
funding was used to purchase the animals from the markets, based on the initial requests from
the community subgroups. Each household had to take care of the allocated herd, and assumed
costs as community contributions, paying for vaccinations, feeding, raising and laboring the
animals. At the time of paying back the loan, the households handed over the mature animals and
kept the offspring.

For the sake of simplicity, and following the quarterly reports indications on the first offspring
delivered per localities, the following assessment of efficiency keeps a conservative approach.
Given the delay in starting the LDIF activities, and the lack of detail on the disbursements per
community, initial investments on water rehabilitation are assumed to date from 2010, and on the
restocking activities, from 2010 in the Western Sector communities and 2011 in the Eastern
Sector communities.

Based on information from the ILPM quarterly progress reports and the VDC records, Table 3.1
shows that the restocking activities had a positive impact in the household incomes. Once
discounted the GDP deflator, by the project completion each SDG invested in the restocking
activities yielded 2.7 SDG per household in the targeted communities. In the localities of the
Eastern Sector, these activities returned 3.3 SDG per household, over the 2.4 SDG produced in
the Western Sector localities. Both the prices and the herd composition explain that difference.
The LDM data for 2013 Q2 show that the sheep prices in the Eastern Sector markets (SDG 1,425
in Singa, SDG 767 in Tendelti, and SDG 1,127 in Eldamazine) were higher than those in the
Western Sector markets (SDG 775 in El Nuhoud, SDG 825 in Gebeish, and SDG 725 in
Elkhewie). Moreover, the final composition of the herds in North Kordofan included both sheep
and goats, while only sheep composed the final stock in the communities from Blue Nile, Sinnar
and White State.




                                                 58
Per animal, households have also benefit from an increase in the value of the animals. Once
discounted the GDP deflator, each SDG invested by the project in the restocking activities,
increased the value of each animal 1.3 times. Differences between Western and Eastern Sector
are due to the composition of the herd (sheep and goats in the Western Sector, only sheep in the
Eastern Sector), and the price difference for sheep, where the Eastern Sector markets reported
higher prices than Western. In the Eastern Sector States, the value per animal almost doubled in
real terms: SDG 242 per animal as project investment turned by the end of the project in SDG
464, an increase of 1.9 times. In North Kordofan, the herd barely increased their value.

With regards the water point investments, the project assumed that improvement in the water
availability would lead to an improvement in the household herd. The results from the 2012
Internal Impact Assessment Report show that for the targeted pastoralist households the access to
water was not as critical other factors to explain the increase of the herd size17. Out of the main
project areas, 44.8 percent of the surveyed households indicated the pasture availability and 25.3
percent the grants to buy animals through the restocking activities. Only the 20 percent referred
the water availability.

The communities with ILPM-funded restocking and water point rehabilitation activities do not
offer any conclusive evidence. Only 4 communities received investments through the restocking
activities and the water points: Um Glaingeet (in El Nuhoud locality), Elhamari and Abu
Meraida (in Gebaish locality), and Undresia (in Abuzabad). Table 3.2 shows some selected
indicators from these communities and compares with the average at the respective localities and
the state. In short, the indicators do not show any common and distinctive pattern of change in
these four communities, when compared with their respective localities. In 3 of the 4
communities the incomes of the households more than doubled or tripled after participating in
the restocking activities. Only in Abu Meraida (in Gebeish locality), the household incomes and
the value per animal decrease substantially. This is one of the smallest communities that
participated in the ILPM 18 , where mostly goats compose the herd. Despite being one of the
smallest communities, the initial project contribution was one of the highest 19 , therefore the
relatively high allocation per household (SDG 5,571). The herd size notably increased in
absolute terms in Um Glaingeet and Elhamari. But other communities within their localities
reached a higher stock of animals. Despite these changes, these results are not definitive to
conclude that activities on water rehabilitation had a substantial impact in increasing the size of
the herds for the households.

The second ILPM outcome was to increase the number of animals traded in the rehabilitated
markets: El Nuhoud, Gebeish, and Elkhewie (in North Kordofan State), Singa (Sinnar State),
Tendelti (White Nile State), and Eldamazine (Blue Nile State). Due to successive delays, the
bulk of the rehabilitation works were completed in 2012, just leaving between 12-18 months for
a full operation of the markets. Traders and producers already started using the markets even

  In this community only 14 households were targeted by the restocking activities. In the Gebeish State, the average was 41
households per community, and in the whole program, 29 households per community.
19 That seems to be a sort of a pattern in the project, where communities with less than 15 participating households received over
SDG 60,000 as project contribution for the restocking.




                                                               59
when works were not completed, and services operational. This included the localities handing
over the Livestock Market Database to the Market Boards. This process was completed as the
markets started operating (see Table 3.3).

Based on the information provided by the LMD, the Table 3.3 assesses the efficiency in
increasing the number of animals traded based on the rehabilitation cost for each market and the
difference between the animals traded prior and after the beginning of operations in the markets.
The ratio of investment per new animal traded can only be used with four of the six rehabilitated
markets. The LMD does not provide enough data on Gebeish and Eldamazine for this
calculation. According to this ratio, El Nuhoud was the less efficient market. Each additional
animal traded in the market after the rehabilitation cost US$119.1 each quarter. In Singa and
Tendelti, the ratio amounted US$35.1 and 39.3 per additional animal traded each quarter. As the
most efficient market, in Elkheview each additional animal per quarter cost US$3.8.

The Table 3.4 summarizes the previous calculations to estimate the unit cost of increasing the
herd size per household and the unit cost of additional animals traded in the rehabilitated
markets. The cost for additional animals in the household herd is based on the Table 3.1, if only
considering the restocking activities, and Table 3.2, when also including the subprojects on the
water points. The unit cost is calculated as a ratio of the additional animals per herd and the
invested resources, both from the project and the community. The costs of the water point
rehabilitation are included as well, if necessary. With regards the traded animals, the cost is a
weighed estimation of the US$ invested per traded animals.

Project cost and expenditures by component

Actual expenditures against budgeted costs per component (see Table 3.5) show the extent to
which the project has made efficient use of the resources. Including the MDTF and the GoNS
funding, by its completion the project left around 9 percent of the available funding unutilized.
The component 4 for improving livestock routes left the largest gap between planned and
effective disbursements; almost half of the available funding was not used. By subcomponents,
the activities on the privatization of animal health services (subcomponent 2.1) left 73.2 percent
of the budgeted funds unutilized; followed by the restocking activities (within the component 1),
where the project used less than half of the budgeted funding. Considering only the MDTF
funding, the overall sub-utilization percentage drops to 7.7 percent. The largest gaps between
planned and effective disbursements remain the same, on the privatization of animal health
services (subcomponent 2.1, with a 57.7 percent gap), restocking activities (within component 1,
with a 56.3 percent gap) and improvement of livestock routes (subcomponent 2.1, and a 45.5
percent of undisbursed funds).

Out of the previous calculated ratios, the restocking activities was an efficient activity to increase
the number of animals per herd. From that perspective, the project could have been more
efficient in delivering development outcomes by fully using the resources for the restocking
activities. As per the evidence gathered from the targeted pastoralists, and the outcomes in
communities benefitted with water points, the re-allocation of resources out of the restocking
activities may have deviated resources towards less efficient components.

     Improving Livestock Production and Marketing Project- A Pilot (ILPMP)

                                    Submitted June/24/ 2013


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ILPMP was an MDTF (Annex 1) funded project appraised at US$ 20 million and approved to be
implemented in two phases; however, actual financing was 12.01 by 3.7 from GoS and 8.31 from
MDTF separated by midterm review. Actually, implementation was 1st phase and two extensions. The
project was effective on 08/29/2007 to be originally closed by 06/30/2011; however, actual closing was
on 06/30/2013.

The project development objective was stated as “To improve livestock production and marketing in
selected rain-fed areas of Central and Eastern Sudan”; however, the project was implemented in Sinnar,
BNS, WNS and NKS and six localities, viz, Sinja, Damazine, Jabalain; Gebaish, Abuzabad and
Anuhoud. The project embraced four components, viz, livestock development investment fund (LDIF),
privatization of animal health and livestock markets, management and studies and rehabilitation of
livestock routes. Moreover; the project organized beneficiary communities into VDCs, market boards,
private vet and CAHW networks and formed SSCs, LCCs and initiated participation of civil society
organizations including pastoralists, farmers and women unions in addition to project implementation
structures.

LDIF component had water and IGA subprojects; water projects included rehabilitation or construction
of water points and yards, meanwhile IGA activities were mainly restocking of beneficiaries with sheep
and goats. For conducting those activities, the project offered beneficiaries grants at 80% of the total
cost, meanwhile; beneficiaries contributed by 5% in cash and 15% in kind. As a result 34 water
points/yards were rehabilitated or constructed as per ILPMP specifications and benefited around
170,368 direct and indirect beneficiaries. Moreover, there were 24 VDCs for restocking which
benefited around 4,647 beneficiaries of which 45% were female headed households by implementing
69 subprojects with CGs.

Beneficiaries of all water projects paid a subsidized cost of water for human and animal consumption
and the VDCs divided the net revenue into 30% for RWCs, 40% for maintenance and operation (100%
recovery rate) and 30% for social services and lending community groups to invest in income
generation activities. Grants for restocking were provided to beneficiaries on communal consensus to

                                                  69
select the eligible groups providing contribution in cash and kind as for water subprojects, thereby;
eligible beneficiaries were given between 10 to 15 ewes as a starter flock (occasionally few goats);
however, around 85% of the beneficiaries repaid the loans and were moving ahead with their flocks.

Private vets in Anuhoud, Abuzabad and Gebaish were provided a grant, exempted from contribution
and networked with selected CAHWs and all were trained for privatization of animal health services.
However; three out of five paid the grants 100% and two 81% and 64% and the sixth has started lately,
moreover; five more vets applied for privatization in 2013. They have treated 2,051,832 animals
compared to 12,851 by the public veterinary service, conducted 2,702 operations compared to 1,043,
vaccinated 568,555 animals compared to 951,250; performed 77 lab diagnoses, but, both provided
minimal extension and advisory services to pastoral and rural communities.

Six livestock markets were constructed as per ILPMP specifications in Damazine, Sinja, Tendelti;
Elkhawei, Anuhoud and Gebaish; however; some work was still on. They were administered by trained
market boards and with functioning market information system. The markets generated good revenue
with 100% recovery rate for maintenance and operation and the rest was divided into 30% for the board
and 70% for the locality at best.
Three livestock routes were demarcated and rehabilitated for 346 km in length, rangeland of 7,920
hectare was planted with selected seeds and 1,100 km of fire line opened; moreover, the routes were
provided with integrated service centers.

Moreover, the project managed to complete all ten studies, most of the procurement, one baseline
survey and an internal impact assessment; it met its deadlines and responded efficaciously to the MTR,
all ISM and assessment missions. The project was reputed for complying with all the covenants of the
LGA and satisfactory performance along the various stages of implementation.

LDIF component utilized US$ 3,120,000 of the total budget (30.56%) with 2,520,000 (24.68%) for
water projects and 600,000 (5.88%) for restocking, 220,000 (2.26) for privatization of animal health,
1,605,000 (15.7%) for rehabilitation/construction of livestock markets totaling 1,825,000 (17.87%) and
200,000 (1.96%) for rehabilitation of the stock routes. Project management utilized 2,830,000
(29.04%), 1,550,000 (15.18%) for studies and capacity building, 350,000 (3.43%), for vehicles and
200,000 (1.96%) for office equipment and rehabilitation.

Project management and implementation of its components (Annex 2) were considered cost effective,
except for rehabilitation of the stock routes as it was difficult to evaluate their benefits in monetary
terms, efficiency and efficacy of implementation were satisfactory; impacts were tangible, risks to
development outcomes identified and elements for sustainability highlighted. However; overall rating
of project development objective and outcomes were “satisfactory”, with “moderate” risk to
development outcome; overall Bank performance, ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision
were found “satisfactory”. Moreover; women represented around 35% of project direct beneficiaries by
completion.

The outcomes of LDIF and stock routes components were found “satisfactory” with “high” risk to the
stock routes, “significant” to the development outcome of water projects, but, “low” risk to restocking
projects; meanwhile, the outcome was “moderately satisfactory” for of privatization of animal health
services with “low” risk to the outcome. The outcome of livestock markets was found “highly
satisfactory” with “high” risk to the development outcome.

                         RESULTS FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

   1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN (excerpts)

      1.1. CONTEXT AT APPRAISAL

Sudan is renowned for its vast livestock population which amounted to 136.6 million head in 2005
including cattle (40.5), sheep (49.8), goats (42.2) and camels (3.9) sustaining about 80% of sedentary
and pastoral rural populations with considerable social and economic importance.

As noted by JAM, following signing the CPA, development of the livestock sector was considered
crucial for rural development and sustainability of peace through provision of services that would result
in equitable and sustainable development of the poorest communities in North Sudan. Accordingly, the
country pursued a strategy of decentralization (JAM) vesting greater autonomy over domestic
expenditure in the states and localities in order to address challenges of reconstruction and reduction of
natural resource based conflicts.

The GNU sector objective and strategy for livestock production centered round the interventions and
expected results shown in table (1) below:

                     Table (1) GNU livestock sector strategy and expected results ( FPP)
                        Strategy                                         Expected results
  Improving animal health services                      Higher livestock off take rates
  Improving production techniques                       Reduced environmental degradation and conflicts
  Increasing access to water                            Increased incomes
  Improving market infrastructure and access to market Better integration of livestock and agriculture
  information                                           Increased meat supply for domestic needs
                                                        Improved livestock competitiveness

Based on the GNU sector objective, strategy and expected results (Table 1) and findings of JAM, the
MDTF was approached for financing the project in selected rain-fed areas of Sudan.
The project rationale was demonstrated by piloting the interventions stated below:
    Improving livestock production by studying natural resource based conflicts and mitigation
      approaches attempting to stabilize and secure the productive force in the first place
    Improving livestock production by privatizing animal health services to improve herd health
      and survival
    Improving livestock production by supporting pastoral and rural communities in livestock
      production promoting activities by improving water supply, resources and capacity building
    Improving livestock marketing by investing in market infrastructure, management, market
      information and livestock routes to furnish rewarding herd produce outlets

Two project areas were selected in central and eastern Sudan representative of the diversity of livestock
systems and socio-economic context under rain-fed husbandry systems in four states, namely, BNS,
Sinnar, WNS and NKS, and six localities based on significance of livestock and frequency of conflict
over land and water, namely, Damazine, Sinja, Jabalain and Gebaish, Anuhoud and Abuzabad. Later,
two localities emerged: Abu hojar in Sinnar state and Tadamon in BNS.

On the other hand, despite the tangible potentials of the livestock sector both domestically and
regionally, the sector was indicated to be crippled by a number of constraints including, marketing
                                                         71
inefficiencies, land policy believed not favoring pastoral livestock development and; water scarcity
affecting pastoral livestock, disease burden and old production and marketing data.

   2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

      2.1.PROJECT PREPARATION, DESIGN AND QUALITY AT ENTRY

Past experiences of projects funded by IFAD and WB/MDTF were utilized in improving the design of
the components and implementation of the project as summarized in annex (10). The project learned
lessons from CDF and IFAD projects in BNS and NKS and coordinated focused training on
community mobilization and CDD approaches to PIU and LIU staff including PRA and PLA methods
and a comprehensive guideline on matching grant management was prepared by a consultant to
facilitate implementation of the community sub-projects. Also, the project coordinated training of
CAHWs with FAO with the aim of providing animal health care to their pastoral and rural communities
e.g. BNS and NKS.

The project adopted the CDD approach during the phases of project preparation, design and
implementation at all levels including, villages, cluster of villages, administrative units, localities and
the states e.g. village development committees (VDCs) and other community groupings and
organizations. Also, the beneficiary communities participated in the baseline and other surveys,
workshops, contributed to the technical studies conducted by the project and participated in the field
missions of the MTR, ISMs and other missions.

On the other hand, there were inherent risks working at country, entity and project levels and risk to
secure MDTF funding (annex 11). However, stakeholders managed to work out legal framework
agreements which were used to mitigate risks affecting implementation with regard to privatizing
animal health, taxes and fees levied on water and animals sold in markets and interference of the local
authorities with management, maintenance and ownership of the community sub-projects.

However, institutional reforms were needed to address the issue of contractual linkages of the
rehabilitated markets and the localities owning them regardless of board formation and registration.
Institutional reforms were also needed to address linkage of targeted communities to the rehabilitated
stock routes. For the graveness of the ownership issue, a study was commissioned to draft a livestock
market development strategy to guide the making of a legal framework and also for formalizing the
community ownership of the implemented subprojects.

      2.2.IMPLEMENTATION

The project was declared effective on August/29/2007, however; inherent risks were substantial and the
GNU experienced some difficulties with disbursing its contribution timely in the first two years which
affected implementation of the “LDIF” and “project implementation and studies” components as they
were planned to be funded from GNU counterpart contribution.

Nevertheless, the project formed management and implementation structures at the central, state and
locality levels (annex 9). The structures were supported by administrative, financial, procurement and
safeguards officers at the PCU and PIUs and backed up by steering committees at the central and state
levels and locality coordination committees at the localities. The PIUs were supported by subject
matter specialists (SMSs) and veterinary officers to provide assistance and backstopping.


                                                    72
MAARF had the overall oversight on the project through the PCU for coordinating all the activities
supported by the PSC. Project implementation was the responsibility of the two PIUs of the SMAARIs
based in Sinnar and Elobeid for the eastern and western sectors respectively supported by the SSCs and
VPACs. The LIUs had the responsibility of implementing the LDIF sub-projects by the VDCs at the
locality level supported by the LCCs.

In fact, the first six months were the implementation period in the 1st phase; nevertheless, it was
dedicated to implement key activities in the eastern and western sectors beginning in September and
October 2008 respectively. The PSC, SSCs and LCCs were active and provided guidance and
supported implementation by reviewing and approving work plans, monitoring performance of the
project and addressing implementation constraints. However, the project was challenged by a number
of implementation issues in the first phase as numerous planned activities were not achieved e.g.
livestock census methodology and the fact that establishing a functional institutional and management
structure for a decentralized and CDD approach took a long time as all project attempts to recruit
NGO/MFI organizations were unsuccessful until training lastly was coordinated with CDF.

Thus, staff at PIU and LIU were trained on community mobilization using CDD methods and
communities were trained on microfinance which helped establish the VDCS and engage in
implementing the matching grant. Moreover, GNU disbursement was regained on track after the MTR
in July 2009 and as a result; staffing was completed at the PCU, PIUs and LIUs. Most technical studies
and procurement of office furniture and equipment including computers and vehicles were conducted;
offices were renovated, workshops conducted and training of project staff on implementation including
fiduciary aspects, monitoring and evaluation. It should also be noted that project implementation was
affected by insecurity situations in BNS and Gebaish locality in NKS. However, based on the
encouraging implementation capacity and satisfactory commitment demonstrated at all levels,
implementation of the 1st phase was continued for another two years until June 30/2011.

Institutional and implementation arrangements, procurement and financial arrangements, monitoring
and reporting responsibilities were described for the project as well as the detail of implementation
activities (FPP, annex 6 and attachment 2). Moreover, the supplemental project operations manual
(SPOM) provided detail of implementing the LDIF component and guided the general operations at the
PCU/PIUs and LIUs including planning cycle, preparation of AWP and budget, supervision, MTR,
ICR and completion processes. By the 1st ISM in April 2010, the operations manual was revised and
endorsed by the Bank since; previously, it was unclear to project staff in many areas.

Restructuring of the project for additional financing of the 1st extension took place in June 2010 with
the aim of building on completed and ongoing activities, notably, investment in policy development,
capacity building and veterinary service infrastructure and equipment. Moreover, the recipient, the
project implementing entities and program management team were found compliant with all covenants
specified in the LGA and that there were neither outstanding audits nor interim financial reports. That
was because the project implementing entities have established an acceptable financial, monitoring and
evaluation and reporting systems which were also employed in the extension periods. Principally, the
additional financing was directed towards supporting the originally appraised activities supposedly to
have been implemented in the 2nd phase as scheduled except for few adjustments and up scaling.

The project was restructured for the 2nd extension for additional funding preceded by the 3rd ISM when
implementation was rated “satisfactory”. As a result, ongoing activities were consolidated, the six
livestock markets complemented with equipment, refresher training of VDCs provided and capacity
building was also provided in social mobilization as well as extension and advisory services. Moreover;
                                                  73
successful activities were scaled up e.g. additional water points, restocking subprojects and
rehabilitation of rangeland along stock routes. New small scale activities were introduced by building
capacities for leather and milk processing and rural tanning. However, project implementation
performance was rated “satisfactory” by the 4th ISM in April 2013 despite delays in financing;
moreover, arrangements for closing by June/30/2013 were readied and eventually some conducted.

      2.3.MONITORING          AND      EVALUATION,          DESIGN,      IMPLEMENTATION             AND
          UTILIZATION

Establishment of the M&E unit was delegated to the monitoring officer at the PCU and sufficient funds
were availed for technical assistance to develop the M&E system and training of project staff at the
central, state, locality and community levels.

2.3.1. Design

Monitoring and evaluation was originally designed to assess achieving the PDO at two levels as shown
in the original result framework in annex (4):
     PDO level of 3 indicators to be assessed by 6 measures
     Three intermediate outcomes to be assessed by 3 indicators

Original arrangements for monitoring and evaluation to assess achieving the PDO and intermediate
outcomes are given in annex (5) which included the following indicators:
     Component result indicators
           1. Two indicators for LDIF (component 1)
           2. Two indicators for privatization of animal health services and two for privatization of
              livestock markets (component 2)
           3. Three indicators for component 3 (Project implementation and studies)
     Intermediate outcome indicators
           1. Three indicators to assess herd parameters of composition and productivity
           2. Five indicators for assessing marketing parameters and benefits to livestock producers

The performance indicators were comprehensively revised as reasoned in annexes 6, 7 and 8 until
brought about SMART and could reflect project progress. However, the revised intermediate outcome
indicators were formulated for components 1, 2 and 4, but, there were no indicators given to
component 3 "Project implementation and studies” since it was considered a tool for achieving the
PDO by the CPPR, MTR and 1st ISM; moreover, three new outcome indicators were introduced for the
new livestock routes component.

However, the 3rd ISM in May/2012 classified the performance indicators into output and outcome
indicators for components 1, 2 and 4 about ongoing and the new activities; thus, by this stage, the result
framework for M&E was reformed to have three levels as shown in annex (8);
     One PDO level indicator
     One beneficiaries indicator of two complements (number and % female)
     Intermediate results with thirteen output indicators and six outcome indicators for components
        1, 2 and 4.

The result framework used by the MEU of the project as of July 2010 3rd quarterly report (Table 5)
evolved from the firstly revised result framework (Annex 6, 1st amendment); nonetheless, new


                                                   74
intermediate outcome indicators were introduced, but, instantly dropped in the following quarterly
reports as given below:
     Number of people in rural areas provided with access to improved water sources under the
        project of which % female
     Number of loans given out by VDCs
     Percentage of repayment of IGA loans to VDCs
     Number of producers receiving updated market price information in replacement of the
        “number of rehabilitated markets with functioning boards etc”
     The other intermediate outcome indicators remained without change

However, the indicator “Number of vaccinated livestock by private vets by type of livestock” was
dropped and that by the 4th quarterly report of 2010, the MEU resorted to the secondly revised result
framework (Annex 6, 2nd amendment) intended for the 1st restructuring of the project. However, the 1st
quarterly report of 2011 was amended as follows:
     The PDO level indicator “Margin between sheep price paid in targeted secondary and terminal
        markets” was dropped leaving the PDO with the previous two indicators
     Direct project beneficiaries promoted to act as a second level overall indicator (number and %
        female)
     Indicator indirect project beneficiaries was dropped
     Beneficiary households receiving support for IGA (number and % female) was introduced
     The other intermediate outcome indicators remained without change

The MEU of the project revised the result framework for the 2nd quarterly report of 2011 to be based on
one PDO level indicator, one beneficiary level indicator with two complements and nine intermediate
outcome indicators. However; the PDO was assessed in the succeeding reports until completion with
two indicators i.e. “Average herd size of small ruminants” and “Annual number of animals transacted
in the rehabilitated livestock markets” (Table 2).

2.3.2. Implementation

The MEU of the project started delivering quarterly monitoring and evaluation reports on project
implementation and progress as of July 2010 (Table 2). The reports focused on implementation
activities, performance by the components and financial and procurement performance; performance of
the result framework and compliance with the provisions of the legal grant; however, reporting
continued until the 1st quarter of 2013.

However, it was not possible for the MEU to assess achieving the PDO and implementation
performance using the original result framework except for few indicators and with limited efficiency
and coverage as discussed in section 1.3 and shown in annex (5) due to:
     Irrelevance of the PDO level and intermediate outcomes indicators (section 1.3 for detail) and
       difficulty to collect such indicators
     Lack of clear definition between the PDO level and intermediate outcome indicators,
       component outputs and outcomes
     Lack of constant and independent starter baseline values to use as bench marks
     Instability of the M&E staff at the PCU
     Lack of designated and trained M&E officers at the PIUs and LIUs and at the VDCs levels
     Lack of information management system and reporting format



                                                  75
Moreover, the MTR mission developed monitoring and reporting formats for all implementing levels to
track implementation and the performance indicators, later, the reporting formats were incorporated in
the operations manual. However, the 2nd ISM addressed the difficulty in collecting information about
the indicators at the PIU and LIU levels

However, despite the successive improvements to the result frameworks; assessing implementation
performance and PDO achievement was affected by:
     Lack of a consistent and stable result framework
     Adjustment of baseline and target values from within project implementation, period by period
     Insecurity in some targeted areas e.g. water points/yards in BNS
     Introduction of unplanned activities as support to slaughterhouses and slabs
     Introduction of new output/outcome indicators and lack of baseline values for them
     The short time remaining before project closure did not help using the new indicators

However, it should be noted that the revised result framework was used by the MEU only in 4 quarterly
reports: the 3rd and 4th in 2010 and the1st and 2nd in 2011. Lastly, from the 3rd quarterly report of 2011
until the 1st of 2013, the MEU focused on tracking implementation component by component, but,
ceased to provide a result framework.

2.3.3. Utilization
As indicated in annex (6) of the firstly revised result framework, assessment of project performance
and PDO achievement was done at the MTR and 1st restructuring based on the followings:
      The baseline value used was taken as 2008/2009 with real figures for the assessed PDO level
       indicator and zero values for all the intermediate outcome indicators
      Target values extended from 2007 to 2011 with reported figures for the assessed PDO level
       indicator until 2009 and zero values for the intermediate output/outcome indicators until 2008
       except for the privatization strategy indicator in 2008
      There were no target values given to the PDO level indicators in 2010 and 2011, but, were
       given to the intermediate outcome indicators except for beneficiary households in component
       1, CAHWs in component 2, fire lines and pasture plantation in component 4.

Furthermore, the 3rd ISM in April/2012 updated values for the key performance indicators based on the
following adjustments:
     The baseline for original project start was adjusted to 2009 with values given to the PDO level,
       beneficiaries and animals traded and zero values for the remainder
     Progress taken by December 2011with figures for all indicators
     Cumulative target values taken by 2012 and 2013 with figures for all indicators

An update of the result framework was presented by the 2nd restructuring mission in September 2012
on the following basis:
     The baseline for original project start was 2009 with values for two PDO level indicators,
        beneficiaries indicator and there were no values for the intermediate outcome indicators
     Progress taken by 2012 with figures for the indicators of the three levels
     Original target values for 2012 and new additional funding target values for 2013

Moreover, the 4th ISM in April 2013 indicated that the M&E system has been continuously improving
and an update as of March 2013 was presented in support of the fact that the project has already
contributed to achieving its PDO targets for most indicators or close for the remainder based on the
following basis.
                                                   76
    The baseline for original project start was 2009 with values for the two PDO level indicators,
     beneficiaries indicator and there were no values for the intermediate outcome indicators
    Progress taken by 2013 with figures for the two PDO level and beneficiaries indicators
    Progress by 2012 with figures for the intermediate outcome indicators
    Target values by June 2013 for all indicators in the result framework

It could be said that the result framework for monitoring project performance and assessing
achievement of the development objective was used only occasionally by the MEU of the project and
in the early stages until mid 2011. However, updates were provided by a number of missions each
ending with a revision to the preceding result framework and indicators. Nevertheless; the MEU traced
performance in the remainder of project implementation until 2013 by following the achievements of
the components utilizing the adjusted baseline and indicating progress and target values in line with the
MTR and ISMs.

However, for better utilization of M&E; it could have been very beneficial if M&E aspects were
evaluated during appraisal before approving by the approving authority, especially:
    Revision of the original result framework and the performance indicators and definition of the
       components, outputs and outcomes
    Determination of a starter baseline value for each indicator e.g. data averaged from 2005/2006
       independently of project implementation, in absence, similar operations in the country or a
       neighboring country could have been used.
    Early staffing and training of M&E personnel at PCU, PIUs and LIUs

      2.4.SAFEGUARD AND FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

   2.4.1. Safeguard policy

As for any development project, the Environment Conservation Act (2001) entailed from the project an
environmental impact assessment (EIA) report before embarking on any development activities. Since
the project intended to renovate old offices, additional structures and supplies to market places, water
points/yards and stock routes and range, concern was also triggered with respect to articles OP/BP/GP
4.01 (Environmental Assessment) and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) safeguard policies of the
WB. Moreover, the environmental assessment policy required a plan for management of medical and
veterinary chemical waste as well.

Fulfilling the safeguard requirements was conceived difficult due to limitations of MARFR and the
stated capacity of the project. However, a safeguard management committee (SMC) was created for
training and coordination among the participating ministries under coordination of the Higher Council
for Environment and Natural Resources (HCENR).

Moreover, the project hired a part-time safeguard officer to handle safeguard issues at the PCU which
resulted in creation of an environmental and social management framework (ESMF), resettlement
action plan (RAP) and veterinary chemical waste management plan (VCWMP) in line with the social
and environmental policies prepared for all the MDTF projects. By June 2010, the project fulfilled all
conditions precedent to the first additional financing in June 2010 as per OP 13.2 and there were no
environmental and social or other safeguard issues that were unresolved. Also that, environmental
checklists were prepared for smaller civil works and environmental plans for water points , but, none
of the works required preparation of a RAP. Nevertheless, the last ISM in April 2013 recommended


                                                   77
safeguards analysis for water points, livestock markets and routes just to ensure that project
interventions followed the agreed ESMF, RPF and VCWMP.

However, field findings indicated introduction of technologies facilitating resource conservation and
sanitation e.g. water harvesting techniques at water points/yards, plantation of trees at livestock markets
and water points. Also by expanding water yard catchments, avoidance of human defecation sources
and provision of filtration system, latrines at water points/yards and livestock markets as well as
incinerators at the latter and stock routes; moreover, humans were separated from animals at the water
points and yards. Given the imminent closing date, the project was very careful in limiting assistance to
some slaughterhouses and slabs around the rehabilitated livestock markets to improving processing of
hides and skins without impinging upon institutional rehabilitation which could have substantial
safeguard requirements to meet.

It should be noted that, since appraisal, midterm review and by the 1st and 2nd restructuring, ILPMP
project sustained an environmental rating of category B (partial assessment) with a strong positive
impact and it did not raise any environmental, social or other safeguard concerns, so far. The overall
safeguard compliance was rated “satisfactory” and there were neither significant irreversible
environmental nor social impacts accrued from the conducted project activities.

   2.4.2. Procurement capacity

At appraisal, the procurement capacities of MARFR, the project (PCU, PIUs and LIUs), SMAARI and
the localities were weak in terms of both personnel and ability to use procurement procedures. Since
the risk for procurement management was rated high for the country, the JAM assessment
recommended procurement reforms including capacity building and logistical support for modernizing
the then regulatory system until a more comprehensive legal framework was developed.

Project procurement was centralized by the PIU and arrangements were described (FPP, attachment 8)
with the stated commitment of the project to abide by the WB procurement guidelines e.g. Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, Selection and Employment of Consultants by WB Borrowers and
the provisions stipulated in the Legal Grant Agreement. In assistance, the WB recruited a monitoring
agent for north Sudan to expedite risk mitigation and enhance capacity building.

By 2008, the project recruited three procurement specialists, one at the PCU and two at the PIUs one
each who were then all trained in Khartoum and formally abroad. The CIFA was completed in the
country and the CPPR has identified the main issues affecting public procurement at the federal and
state levels, in addition, PSCAP have already tackled some of them. However, the capacity assessment
mission recommended three annual supervision missions to the field to carry out a review post
procurement actions.

By the MTR in July 2009, all procurement activities involving national competitive bidding (NCB)
were carried out at the state level and that the SBDs were approved by the Bank before advertizing.
Moreover, all contracts involving community contracting were conducted at the LIU level and also that
the revised SPOM contained a section on community contracting.

However, procurement capacity was found good by the 1st and 2nd ISMs and rated “moderately
satisfactory” by the latest procurement mission and the 1st restructuring in June 2010, asserted in the 2nd
in 2012; however, overall risk was rated “substantial” and other weaknesses in procurement capacity


                                                    78
were identified as stated below, accordingly, corrective measures were recommended to include on job
and formal abroad training.
    Lack of experience in procurement of consultants, services
    Lack of familiarity with procurement planning and monitoring systems
    Lack of capacity to meet the Bank procurement reporting requirements

The last ISM in April 2013 rated procurement performance as “satisfactory” and noted that most of the
major procurement activities were concluded and that all those under the additional financing already
started, however, caution was made about procurement not entirely achieved and delivered before the
closing date as to be paid by GoS.

   2.4.3. Financial management

The PFM system in north Sudan was considered reasonably well functioning in general (PER 2006)
excluding the states, nonetheless, there was need to revamp and modernize the system as risk at country
level was rated high and substantial for both entity and project levels (FPP, annex 7). The financial
management and disbursement arrangements of the project were described (FPP, annex 7) and risk
assessment, mitigation measures and status of application are shown in annex (11).

However, the main challenges faced the public financial management (PFM) system were indicated by:
   The entire accounting and financial system was manual
   Budget classification was not in line with international standards
   Limitations of staff capacity, commitment controls, debt management, cash and revenue
     management and reconciliation of accounts
   Limited experience with WB operations

With respect to OP 8.0, there were no conditions for financial management effectiveness considered for
the project and that the first supervision mission was to be dedicated to monitor the application of
mitigation measures with respect to appointment of financial officers, establishment of manual
accounting system and updating the procedures as part of the operations manual.

Moreover, the PCU was required to maintain accounting records and prepare financial statements
according to international accounting and auditing standards. Audit and progress reports were to be
submitted to IDA within the specified timelines.

The financial management and performance were reviewed in the MTR in July 2009 which indicated
that a notable advance was made since the previous mission in November 2008 since an experienced
FM officer was recruited and in place, GNU released the second tranche and external audit conducted.
Coordination with the accountants at the PIUs was in place and periodic reporting and settlement of
advances improved. Nevertheless, two overriding issues were still pending respective of procurement
of an automated accounting software and compensation of the project coordinator. Until then, the
project maintained records on “Excel” along with manual books; however, the project opened an
additional bank account in local currency to separate MDTF funds from GNU funds which was
advantageous to distinguish between sources of funds and bank balances.

Financial management was rated “moderately satisfactory” since latest supervision mission, improved
to “satisfactory” in the 1st restructuring in June 2010, furthermore, there were neither anticipated risks
nor additional financial management arrangements incurred since the financial management staffing at
the PCU and PIUs was complete. As GNU confirmed meeting the expense of taxes and fees in support
                                                   79
of rehabilitation of basic infrastructures in the targeted localities, the additional funding was mainly
MDTF. Moreover, FM performance has been acceptable to the FM mission in November 2009 when
reporting was considered “satisfactory” and coordinator compensation resolved. The project has been
consistently able to produce timely and complete financial reports and there were no outstanding audits
since last in June 2009 or at the 2nd restructuring in 2012. Moreover, implementation of new accounting
software was completed at the PCU to reconcile the previous system and rolled out to both eastern and
western sectors. However, the most recent audit was in July 2012 which was said to have expressed an
unqualified audit opinion.

By the 3rd ISM complete budget and cash forecasts existed, meanwhile, the last ISM in April 2013
rated financial management arrangement as “satisfactory”; however, it indicated that undisbursed
balance could pose a challenge given the remaining project duration unless the recommended
arrangements agreed upon with the Bank were carried out properly.

      2.5.POST COMPLETION OPERATION/NEXT PHASE

The project employed the CDD approach which materialized creation of strongly productive
beneficiary communities as follows:
    Village development committees
    Private vets and CAHWs networks
    Non-water/IGA community groups
    Livestock market management boards
    Stock routes management GoS institutions and communities

This participatory planning process was positive that beneficiary communities were enabled to use
project resources to implement sub-projects of their own choices; as a result, they have acquired varied
technical, managerial and financing capacities and huge resources. Furthermore, the project worked out
draft legislation and contractual linkages, endorsed later for ensuring the communities,
ownership/partnership of their basic infrastructures to sustain availability of the services created during
project implementation.

On the other hand, the project helped creation of supervisory and monitoring bodies such as the SSCs,
LCCs and VPACs/CBO and at the same time reinforced the roles of the pastoralists, farmers and
livestock traders unions, SMDFs and the local financial system. Moreover, there is a treasure of gold
experience from project implementation and competent staff, an amalgam of MDTF funded projects,
IFAD, FAO and CDF projects to learn more from and build on.

In the short run and in order to maintain the thrust of implementation and sustain the services and
impact; arrangements for transition, in addition to gained reforms and institutional capacities, may
include the followings:
     SSCs and LCCs continue in place, reinforced with a clear mandate, supported by legal and
       microfinance advisors and auditors general coupled with MDTF/implementing agent follow up
       e.g. quarterly ISMs
     Project structures, farmers and pastoralists unions, VPACs/CBOs, market boards, livestock
       traders union and women’s association continue in place
     Formalize and authenticate institutional reforms/legal ownership/partnership of community
       projects and assets upon project closure in order to ensure intact and continued community
       management of the operations
     Coordination and harmonization with other projects (a state consortium could be envisioned)
                                                    80
     Community financing from own resources or through the financial system e.g. SMDF of the
      Bank of Sudan, Agricultural bank and other institutions
     Close supervision and monitoring of the integrity, transparency, technical and managerial
      capacities and performance of project components
     Provision of continuous capacity building to beneficiary communities/organizations through
      practical training, study tours, extension and advisory services

However, it is by far and most, imperative to revisit the legal framework and contractual agreements of
these sub-projects and be raised to higher levels in the context of MARFR top priorities for sustainable
legal and institutional reforms.

   3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

      3.1.ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE (excerpts)

In order to achieve its PDO, ILPM project struggled through its implementation by providing sufficient
inputs to assist producing reasonable component outputs that have tangible outcomes, the benefits of
which can be translated into improved and sustained livelihoods of beneficiary communities that:
     Inputs; including cash, materials, equipment and community mobilization and participation;
        capacities built, legal frameworks, contractual agreements and technical, extension and
        advisory assistance were efficiently implemented
     The output of each respective component was evidenced by the fact that communities were
        capacitated to produce subprojects which were “economically, socially, technically and
        environmentally well performing during project implementation”
     The outcomes of the subprojects were evidenced by the fact that communities have “managed,
        gradually owned/shared/hired and been capacitated to finance and sustain those subprojects and
        the benefits at project completion”
     The impacts were evidenced by the fact that “risks to development outcomes were identified
        and mitigated so that the benefits were eventually sustained and utilized to improve the
        livelihoods of beneficiary communities without ILPMP”

Nevertheless, it should be cautioned that true achievement of the PDO is, in fact, a synergy of sectored
and interrelated interventions including institutional/legal reforms and conducive marketing policies;
range management, improved husbandry practices and health programs; improved nutrition and disease
control/management or eradication. On the other hand efficient marketing depends on the presence of a
strongly established, firmly mandated and empowered national marketing body e.g. LMMCO and Gum
Arabic Company.

However, within the context of ILPM as a pilot project (Table 2); achieving the PDO was
“satisfactory” based on assessing the complementary result of the PDO level indicators:
    Average annual herd size of small ruminants per household was set at 31 sheep and 7 goats in
        2009 as a baseline, increased to 35 and 9 in 2011 and progressed to 46 and 10 in 2013 through
        2012
    The total annual number of animals traded in the rehabilitated livestock markets started at
        317,188 for sheep, goats, cattle and camels in 2009 as a baseline, reached 211,477 in 2011
        progressed to 664,038 in 2012 and reached 422,175 in 2013



                                                  81
However, it could have been more capturing to the average herd size if the baseline value was set at the
exact number of sheep and goats granted by ILPMP, followed and bi-annually measured for turn over
including those died, sold and slaughtered; gifted and otherwise. Then the final average annual herd
size was calculated including all values of fluctuation since that was the natural process under the
prevailing rural circumstances of the operations. Also that the total annual number of animals traded in
livestock markets might have been greater than recorded as some markets discounted the sale fee by
reducing the numbers of animals transacted (30%) as an advantage to attract more market dealers as
witnessed at Anuhoud and Elkhawei livestock markets.

    1. Livestock development investment fund (US$ 13.1 million; 1st phase: 4.6, 2nd phase 8.5)
The outcome of water points/yards was “satisfactory” based on achievement of the following targets
(annex 12 is also referenced) and regarding some shortcomings related to the inconsistency of the
percentages among the subprojects and inefficiency of utilization of the VDC share of revenue apart
from social services:
     Cost of construction ranged between 111,000 – 203,173 (185,173 exceeding SPOM ceiling) in
       Umarda and Awamra of the sample. However, revenue from water sale indicated that water
       subprojects were profitable investments (Annexes 13.1-13.7) e.g. 64,903 against 26,599 for
       operation in Awamra and 75,602 against 12,783 for operation in Umarda and that recovery rate
       of 100% was virtually achieved in 2011, 2012 and 2013
     Beneficiaries participated in the selection, design and management of the subprojects, distance
       travelled for fetching water from old sources drastically shortened, time saved for other
       businesses e.g. more time for attending school and conducting homework
     Continuous supply of subsidized clean water through a generator to sustain supply, filtration or
       clean ground water and neighboring pollution sources avoided
     The water points/yards were environmentally safeguarded through fencing, plantation to harvest
       spillage, latrines provided, hygienic design of catchment and humans and animals separated
     The water points/yards were performing well without need for costly maintenance currently,
       generating reasonable revenue and securing recovery for operation and maintenance and VDCs
       were contributing to social services; however, contractual agreements are prone to alterations
       and that future financing is unpredictable

The outcome of restocking was “satisfactory”, based on achievement of the following targets (annex
12 is also referenced) and regarding few shortcomings related to efficiency of the operations:
     The business proved profitable (Annexes 13.8-13.13) e.g. Wad shaaifoon, Wad alfaki (Sinja)
        and Umnamil (BNS), about 85% of CGs repaid the grant, acquired herds of varying sizes with
        best results in Wad shaaifoon in the sample; however, some although managed to repay failed
        to build up a flock taken as a worst case scenario (Wad alfaki)
     Restocking was very hailed by all the beneficiaries because of the sense of ownership, social
        prestige and direct poverty reduction impact; however, external factors were also favorable
        (range conditions and absence of major disease epidemics)
     Beneficiaries provided labor, grazing and additional feeding requirements, good follow up and
        improved animal health practices. However; repayment in cash affected the process in the
        eastern sector
     There were no ill effects on the environment resulted from restocking around the beneficiary
        villages nor pressure on available rangeland nor water resources; conversely grazing is useful
        for improving soil fertility
     Remaining herds were in good health, vaccinated against major diseases, public and private
        veterinary services were handy and some ewes gave birth and currently were supported by the


                                                  82
       rainy season. Also that success stories triggered some VDCs to approach microfinance
       institutions for funding other CGs additionally to ILPM loan

   2. Privatization of animal health services and livestock markets (US$ 2.2 million; 1st phase
      0.7, 2nd phase 1.5)

        2.1.Privatization of animal health services
The outcome of privatization of animal health services was “ moderately satisfactory”, based on
achievement of the following targets (annex 12 is also referenced) and regarding some shortcomings in
the efficiency of operations:
     The business was a profitable investment to private vets (Annexes 13.20-13.21) e.g. some
        generated around SDG 34,792 and is considered an unprecedented success story with respect to
        vaccination which was one of the main obstacles against privatization; however, private vets
        were given 41,715.2 and exempted of the 20% contribution which was eventually encouraging
     The business was beneficial and handy to pastoral and rural communities; however, some
        failures to answer client calls were reported
     There were no complaints by communities about competence and efficiency of the private vets
        and CAHWs; however, extension work and lab diagnosis were reported weak although above
        provided by the public service
     There were no environmental hazards reported with respect to VCWMP
     The business was moving with good progress and more vets applied for contracting to provide
        the service; however, 100% recovery was reported by three out of five vets, the other two were
        overdue for the aforementioned reasons and the sixth was yet due

         2.2.Privatization of livestock markets
Considering the huge investment in the livestock markets coupled with the absence of a designated
national marketing body following dissolution of LMMCO and notwithstanding completion
constraints, the outcome was “highly satisfactory” based on achieving the following targets (annex 12
is also referenced) and regarding some shortcomings:
      Increase in transactions and revenue from livestock markets and future returns (Annexes 13.14-
         13.19) support the fact that livestock marketing was a profitable investment opportunity
      The markets provided comforting services to humans and animals, shade, loading and
         unloading facilities, trucking, electricity and water supplies, fattening facilities and security
         compared to other non targeted markets in the implementing states e.g. estimated main
         beneficiaries around 21,800 and 1,200 additional beneficiaries in NKS at completion
      Efficiency of market operations improved through board capacity, MIS and weighing
         techniques; registered traders, middle men, guarantors and stockbrokers, other dealers; fee
         discount and banking services were also planned etc
      The markets were environmentally safeguarded by providing latrines, plantations, incinerators
         and plans for utilizing animal manure in the future
      They were viable at completion, generating revenue from various sources, securing recovery,
         providing     market      information     to   dealers,   completing      the     remainder    of
         construction/rehabilitation with increasing animal flow and transactions; however, the
         contractual agreements are prone to unfavorable undercurrents


   3. Project implementation and studies (US$ 4.7 million; 1st phase 2.4, 2nd phase 2.3)



                                                   83
The outcome of the component was “satisfactory” based on achieving the following targets and
regarding some shortcomings in the capacities at the beginning of project implementation which were
eventually improved later during implementation:
     The project managed to implement its activities and deliver reasonable outputs
     Financial reports were produced timely and eventually accepted by the Bank and there were
       neither outstanding audits nor interim financial reports
     Fiduciary and procurement processes were conducted as required with some minor
       shortcomings in procurement
     Monitoring and evaluation was performed quarterly as per the result framework and ad hoc
       internal assessments conducted
     The project was able to implement and achieve the grant objective and was compliant with all
       covenants specified in the Legal Grant Agreement

   4. Rehabilitation of demarcated livestock routes

The outcome of rehabilitation of the demarcated stock routes was “satisfactory”, based on
achievement of the following targets (annex 12 is also referenced) and regarding some shortcomings
related to lack of functionality of the planned services:
     There was little evidence to support the fact that stock routes had direct economic returns as a
        result of investing money by ILPM; however, stock routes were very vital and decisive for
        survival of pastoral herds and livelihoods of pastoral communities. Moreover; pastoralists and
        rural herders play a major role in livestock production and marketing in the country and that
        conflicts over land threaten productivity of both. Thus it was imperative to rehabilitate the stock
        routes since they provided the only safer migratory link between summer grazing and the rainy
        season in absence of a serious settlement i.e. ranching strategy, policy and plan in the country.
     Rehabilitation of the routes was very much appreciated by pastoral and rural communities
        exemplified by their active participation in seed collection and broadcasting, opening fire lines
        and demarcation of the routes. Certainly, care after the stock routes imbued pastoral
        communities with a feeling of belonging instead of abandonment and deprivation of rights.
     The methods used in demarcation and rehabilitation of the routes were well designed, utilized
        new techniques, conducted through community mobilization and participation. Building stores
        for seeds and integrated service centers were highly valued as development assets by pastoral
        and rural communities regardless of incompleteness and lack of functionality at present. Also
        that, water points/yards were carefully aligned along the stock routes in the eastern sector
     Environmental and social safeguards were planned such as incineration of dead animals,
        resettlement and compensation of evacuees
     The rehabilitated and demarcated routes were utilizable and of a recognized status so far;
        however, protection by institutional reforms, plans and financing of rehabilitation in the future
        were unpredictable

 3.3. JUSTIFICATION OF OVERALL OUTCOME RATING

 Based on the satisfaction with relevance of the project objective, design and implementation;
 achievement of the development objective and efficacy of project implementation; project efficiency
 was “satisfactory” as could be supported by the cost effectiveness of management and most of
 project operations.

 3.4. OVERARCHING THEMES, OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS


                                                    84
           3.5.1. Poverty impacts, gender aspects and social development

 All restocking beneficiaries managed to repay their loans approximately (85-100%), recovered their
 5% contribution and acquired herds of varying sizes and some already sold some male lambs to
 invest in agriculture in the current season; moreover, some VDCs managed to access the Agricultural
 Bank for funding other CGs apart from ILPM grant. However, approximately 100% of the water
 point/yard VDCs secured between 20-40% of the net revenue for maintenance and paid 30% to
 RWCs and accumulated sufficient funds (30%). Wad alfaki, Wad shaaifoon and Awamra were good
 examples of success, however; there were three trends of investing the revenue at completion by the
 VDCs:
    Some restocking VDCs intend to invest in water points/yards as new herds emerged and
       demand for water increased with the proviso that eligible CGs were completed
    Some water subproject VDCs intend to invest the 30% in restocking since reliable water
       sources were secured and restocking success stories spread in the neighborhood
    Some, both VDCs intend to invest in IGA activities such as fattening or trading in cereals e.g.
       sesame instead of leaving the fund surplus to corrode in the account by time and inflation

Most of the private vets started from scratch with regard to vaccination, field clinical work and
equipment; however, all made good profits, three of them repaid their loans at completion, employed
retired veterinary assistants and networked some CAHWs and opened branch pharmacies at key village
markets. At completion two successful vets even deposited 10,000 at the supervising veterinary service
in advance for procurement of vaccines for the second contract. Affiliated CAHWs generated income
through negotiating due for treatment and vaccination with animal owners subject to approval by the
employing private vet because there were no official employment contracts between the two parties so
far.

The rehabilitated livestock markets provided business and trade opportunities for sundry traders and
service providers by the hundreds e.g. food and beverages sellers, manufacturers of leather work,
farming equipment and husbandry devices, animal traders, butchers, laborers and porters, blacksmiths
and many haberdashers and vendors, transporters and truckers to name just a few. Also that at each
livestock market a cafeteria was built to provide food and refreshments to market goers in addition to
public latrines. Moreover, it was voiced by several inhabitants in the neighborhood of the markets that
security improved and that home prices soared up because of the police presence, water supplied and
that public transport also improved.

Gender has been mainstreamed in the strategies and procedures of the project and the operations
manual, result framework and that M&E arrangements incorporated gender sensitive formats and
indicators integrated in the project implementation and reporting. Moreover, beneficiary women were
included in all training and capacity building conducted during implementation and community
mobilization. Field findings revealed that women composed about 15-25% of the VDCs membership
and were assigned management roles and female headed households utilized the restocking investment
portfolio as satisfactorily as male beneficiaries. However; since animal trading is a male business, few
females were represented in the livestock market boards e.g. Anuhoud livestock market board;
nonetheless, livestock markets provided work opportunities for women as official market employees
and female service providers (food, refreshments and hot beverages).

The VDCs provided social services to their communities from the accumulated share of revenue by
contributing to building of schools, mosques and health centers and supported opening of fire lines.
Some women were trained in midwifery, others provided with tents for social gatherings and gas
                                                  85
cookers on loan basis to reduce dependence on charcoal and firewood as a means contributing to
natural resource conservation.

             3.5.2. Institutional changes/strengthening

There, seems to be little risk to sustain privatization of animal health and non-water projects since the
elements of personal ownership, management and financing through the community organizations and
SMFI were already in place, given that there are no irreversible setbacks to the laid legal framework or
recognition of the considered status of the VDCs and producers, groups developed during
implementation.

On the other hand, risk to sustainability of livestock markets and water projects appears to be
considerable and even inevitable because the current contractual linkages can probably not stand the
test of revenue needs by the implementing states or localities after project closure. Conversely, risk to
sustain the rehabilitated stock routes is mainly due to inability to maintain them at the supposedly right
times as there is no cash revenue that can be accrued from rehabilitation to return at least the cost.

In the long run after the transition period, the plan of development may include the following:
      Presence of strongly mandated oversight state/locality structure assisted by implementation
         supervisory sub-structure composed of the relevant state authorities
      Support to sustain implementation of the components by strengthening the supervising GoS
         and state departments (SMAARI, primarily, Animal Resources and Range, RWC and ministry
         of social welfare) and retention of ILPM created implementation structures as a concrete unit
         with the view to develop into a “pastoral and rural development department” weaned from
         the ministry of finance by linking to microfinance institutions.
      Creation of “end product VDCs” for livestock breeding, fattening, agro-processing and
         marketing societies in addition to the existing CBOs
      Transformation of the livestock markets into a “state public/private partnership companies”

             4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES

Table (3) below identified the key risks associated with development outcomes based on the criteria of
risk, assessment of impact and likelihood of occurrence.

            5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK PERFORMANCE

5.3 Rating and justification of rating of overall bank performance
The Bank performance to ensure quality at entry was “satisfactory” based on the following
observations:
     The Bank examined with positive results the relevance of project context, development
       objective and design for the assistance in terms of its global, regional, country and sector
       strategies
     It stipulated conduction of risk assessment with the aim of drafting a resettlement policy plan,
       environmental and social management framework and veterinary chemical waste management
       plan
     It addressed positively, in line with JAM, the financial, fiduciary, procurement and monitoring
       and evaluation capacities and improved the staff capacities prior to project implementation
     Funding, inputs and supplies; midterm review, implementation processes and performance
       supervision missions were proactively arranged
     It assured that poverty, gender and social development aspects were well included in the
       objectives of the various components of the project

The quality of the Bank supervision was “satisfactory” based on the following observations:
    There was a plan in place for supervising the project implementation, monitoring and
      assessment of the performance including an MTR, four ISMs and other ad hoc missions.
    Supervision was timely and included management, financial, fiduciary and procurement
      performance; implementation of the components at the field level, M&E and meetings with
      high level officials, stakeholders and the beneficiaries
    The various missions followed achieving the project objective by monitoring and improving the
      result framework, outcomes and impact assessment and made recommendations and called for
      actions to address the challenges as aforementioned for each mission and the Bank was quite
      attentive to see those actions applied.
    Restructuring for additional financing from MDTF and GoS disbursements were successful so
      that implementation was expedited in most aspects
    Closing arrangements were described clearly and in ample time including recommendations to
      fill the gap following project closure

Based on the foregoing rating of the Bank in ensuring quality at entry and quality of supervision, the
rating of overall bank performance was “satisfactory”.

5. LESSONS LEARNED
   1. The project could have been designed by focusing implementation in one or two states with a
      control state to assess more approximately the partial contribution of the project in achieving
      the development objective
   2. Institutional reforms and legal frameworks were of paramount importance to sustainability of
      most ILPMP implemented components, particularly, livestock markets, stock routes and water
                                                         87
    projects. Jeopardy to gained outcomes and expected impacts was high unless reforms had been
    enacted and enforced at the federal and state levels as a prerequisite to piloting in the
    implementing states.
3. Avoidance of delays in financial disbursements and early capacity building of the implementing
    staff were expedient factors in implementation
4. LMMCO experience indicated that an efficient approach to privatize livestock markets was
    through transforming them into a public company or corporation, however; as the process might
    take a long time and need for legal reform, the exit strategy could have been aimed at
    transforming each rehabilitated market into “a nucleus of a state livestock marketing
    company” based on public/private partnership. Such a state company can grow rapidly by
    affiliating other branch markets in the state and by its mandate can overcome many of the
    constraints ILPMP experienced
5. Consistency in implementation was important to focus the impact of the interventions e.g.
    repayment of restocking loans and division of the shares of water projects and livestock markets
6. As there were no imminent needs for maintenance presently, the market maintenance share
    could have been directed to complete the unfinished works in addition to available ILPMP
    funds
7. Expanding investment to include agro-processing and fattening could have added more impact
    to LDIF component.
8. Marketing VDCs could have been initiated to help, from within, the producing communities to
    market their animals and byproducts to remove the intervention of middle men
9. Linking IGA VDCs with microfinance institutions provided a great chance to expand
    investment by beneficiaries and must be sustained and propagated
10. Selection of CAHWs by the private vets was a suitable approach to networking based on a
    formal contract or salary as compared to those not
