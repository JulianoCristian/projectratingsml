Some lessons learned included:\n            first, in a post conflict setting, empowering communities\n            through capacity building is a key to development success.\n            This also requires solid M&E systems and results\n            framework to track and benchmark progress. Second, working\n            in conflict-affected settings requires proactive supervision\n            and 'contingent thinking' during project\n            implementation. Third, the use of an independent monitoring\n            agent (MA) in fragile-environments is instrumental to\n            provide monitoring services and on-the-job capacity\n            building. Fourth, community-driven restocking activities\n            proved a success in enhancing livelihoods and building\n            social capital. Finally, fifth, the experience of\n            privatization of animal health services in North Kordofan\n            set a nation-wide milestone."}, "docdt": "2013-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
