SECOND MARADI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT CO1PLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Maradi Rural Development Project in Niger, for which Credit 1026-NIR in the
amount of US$16.7 million was approved on May 20, 1980. The loan was
closed on September 30, 1988, but the Credit account was held open through
May 15, 1990, in order to recover the outstanding balances in two special
accounts (the IDA and IFAD special accounts). These funds have been
recovered, and the outstanding bslance of US$6,187,136.16 was cancelled on
May 15, 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of
the Sahelian Department, Africa Regional Office. On March 29, 199), the
Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III with the request to prepare Part II
by May 31, 1990, but no reply was received.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the final supervision
mission of the project in November 1987, and is based inter alia, on the
Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement, supervision
reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal
Bank memoranda.

SECOND MURADI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT 1026 - NIR
EVAATIO  SRY
Introduction
i)        The Maradi projects were part of Niger's agricultural sector
strategy of exploiting the potential for rainfed crop and livestock
production, and increasing irrigation. Maradi II was a follow-on project
to an initial four-year project that was considered to have demonstrated
viable improved production packages for the area. The second project was
prerared at a time when exploitation of Niger's uranium reserves were
creating an unprecedented economic-boom and budget surplus, and after
several years of relatively good rainfall.
Obiectives
ii)       The project's general objectives wets to increase farm incomes
and improve the welfare and standard of living of the rural population of
Maradi. Specific objectives weres i) to increase the rainfed production and
incomes of 63,000 dvy71and farmers; ii) to increase the production of 2,600
farmers using irrigation; and iii) to strengthen existing project
organisation. Final costs vere approximately US$ 21 million. IDA
disbursements totalled US$ 11.4 million out of a US$ 16.7 million credit.
The project was designed to be implemented in five years.
Imotementation Exzerience
iii)      After delays in effectiveness and start-up, the project made
some satisfactory progress initially. By the end of 1982, however, the
situation had changed. Declining uranium revenues reduced the Governme. _'s
capacity to participate effectively in the project, and poor rainfall
reduced the farmers' willingness and capacity to adopt the high-input
production packages offered. Project costs, particularly for irrigation
development, were much higher than anticipated.
iv)       Following the National Seminar in Zinder in 1982, and the
development of a new national strategy, the project was reoriented in 1983
and 1984 to increase beneficiary participation, pay more attention to
natural resource management issues, reduce capital and recurrent costs and
develop a more integrated approach to development. The option of closing
the project was considered but, for strategic reasons, eventually rejected.
v)        The post-reorientation period was difficult.  Firstly,
disagreement between donors and the government on aspects of the
reorientation delayed essential legal and financial modifications.
Secondly, staff reductions and personnel problems severely affected morale.
Thirdly, many remaining staff were insufficiently prepared to adopt the new
project strategy. Fourthly, the constraints of low, unreliable rainfall and
a national financial crisis continued.



- iv -
vi)       In August 1985, the project was, as an exception, extended by
almost three years.  In 1987, there was a second, minor, reorientation.
This was intended to increase the mobilization of villagers and to create
village development plans. The project was completed in September 1988,
though the credit currently remains open to allow justification of the IDA
and IFAD special accounts established for the project's revolving fund.
Results
viii)     The large-scale irrigation component achieved a distinct local
Impact during dry years, although only 15 X of the appraisal target foc
production was realized. It was expensive to install and costly to run.
Even though cost recovery rates were poor, there was a high level of farner
desertion. Small-scale private irrigation from boreholes was more
efficient and had better cost recovery, but was also very expensive and
unlikely to have been economic.
ix)       In the face of drought and cheap alternative sources from
Nigeria, anticipated demand for the project's chemical fertilizer never
materialized. Incremental dryland crop production only reached 12t of
appraisal targcts. The training and extension programs had limited overall
impact, and th. withdrawal of formally trained extension workers was not
beneficial. Village-level extension workers were generally not effective.
Cost recovery in the credit program was poor.
x)        Certain small rural operations had local impact, while others --
particularly village shops -- provided subsidized competition for existing
private ventures. The planning of these operations was supply-driven (i.e.
by the project) rather than demand-driven (by the villagers). Low levels of
village cash reserves often made dow-m-payments difficult. There was
Insufficient time and preparation to enable this component to succeed.
although good quality technical work wat undertaken in monitoring and
evaluation and applied research, little operational use was made of the
results.
Sustainabilitv
xi)       The Maradi II project, botb as originally conceived and after
reorientation, was not sustainable. It did, however, contain some
potentially sustainable elements.
Findinas Pnd Lessons
xii)      The main lessons learned ares
a) Production packages should not be prepared on the basis of results
from a few good years of rainfall. Long-tenm rainfall patterns, and
the farmers' reaction to drought must be considered.
b) Narrowly focused production projects in dry areas run a very high
risk of failure;



c) Petailed, precise and rigid planning is unrealistic, of little
use, aud even potentially damaging. in varied and changing
environmeni.s;
d) Enclave project unite are expensive and unwieldy, and relate
neither to traditional services nor to local conmimities.
e) Local-level, participative development activities that respond to
specific local needs are difficult to establish. They need time, a
patient approach and considerable staff trailing and orientation.
S) Even if a project fails to achieve its physical goals, it may
still contribute to the development process and give rise to valid
and sustaizable operations. The cost, however, can be very high.



NIGER
SECOND MARADI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1026-NIR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I
Project Background
1.        Niger is a land-locked, resource-poor Sahelian country.  Eighty
percent of the population depend on agriculture and two-thirds of the land
mass is too dry to have any productive significance. At the time of
project preparation Niger was considered to be 'on the threshold of a new
era of economic development* (President's Report for Maradi II, 1980). The
driving force behind the anticipated economic boom was revenue from the
country's natural stocks of uranium. Uranium prices had increased five
times from 1971 to 1978 and Niger had respended with a similar increase in
annual output. Although some decline in uranizm prices was considered
probable, revenues were 'expected to increase substantially over the next
couple of decades at least" (ibid).
2.        Although the power and infrastructure sectors were absorbing
almost half of government development investment, it was acknowledged that
long-term self-sustaining economic growth would need support frum the other
sectors. The short-term economic challenges were seen as strengthening the
country's limited absorptive ca,zacity and assuring a balanced growth.
Social equity and the fate of the rural poor were also matters of concern.
In the agricultural sector, the government's strategy 'Aad two objectives;
to exploit the potential in rainfed crop and livestock production and to
incrtase the area under controlled irrigation.
3.        The goals in the rainfed areas were to be met through regional
*Productivity Projects' in each Departement. The first Maradi project (Cr
608-NIR) was one such project. The three-year USS 10.7 million project was
appraised in 1975 and became operational in the 1977178 season. An
additional, bridging extension phase was financed by the EEC in 1980. The
first project was considered to have yielded good results, especially in
terms of response to the agricultural package. The second Maradi Rural
Development Project was intended to build on these results.
4.        Other relevant IDA funded projects were: the Dosso Rural
Development Project (Cr 967-NIR); the Second Forestry Project (Cr 1226-
NIR); and the Livestock Project (Cr 885-NIR.)
Prolect oblectives
5.        The primary objectives cf Maradi II were to increase farm
incomes and improve the welfare and standard of living of the rural
population of Maradi Province. The specific objectives weret (i) to
increase rainfed production and, hence, the incomes of 63,000 farmers
producing groundauts, cowpeas,and cereals; (ii) to increase the cotton and
vegetable production of 2,600 farmers through the development of large
irrigation systems; (iii) and to strengthen and improve existing project
organisation.



-2-
Initial Proiect DesiRn
6.        The second Haradi Project was prepared against a backdrop of
high uranium prices, several years of good rainfall and a healthy surplus
in the government budget, although their significance was not perceived at
the time of appraisal. The feasibility study was carried out, under Maradi
I funding, by SCET-International (France) and submitted in April 1979.
Project design was based on the experience of the first project. The
project was initially intended to finances i) expansion of lmproved
agricultural practices in rainfed farming areas; ii) training and extension
in line with the Training and Visit System adapted to local conditions;
iii) agricultural credit for the purchase of incremental inputs and farm
equipment; iv) development of 740 ha of irrigation; v)   'natruction and
equipment of an irrigation center, construction of a no* Centre de
promotion rurale (CPR), and additional buildings for the extension of 19
CPRs; vi) applied agricultural research; vii) a seed multiplication
program; viii) development of functional literacy and health programs and
maintenance activities for the wood plantations and livestock programs
financed under the first project; ix) technical assistance to the pioject
management unit; and x) a project monitoring and Evaluation Unit (USE). The
project was also to contribute to financing technical assistauce and
equipment for a Central T'!chnical 4onitoring and E"aluation Unit in Niamey.
7.        Although some activities were delegated to existing Government
services. the project was designed and remained an -enclave' project with a
strong central unit that related neither to in-line Government services nor
to local comunmity structures. This approach was typical at the time,
however. Authority and control rested witht the project unit, and although
this was to change somewhat with the reorientation, Maradi 'l wvs
essentially a top-down operation.
3.        Initial project design was overl, optimistic and too narrowly
focused on production factors. In 1982, the need for a change was
recognized. The changes, which entailed a substantial reorientation of the
project, were designed and discussed during 1983 and eventually implemented
during 1984. While retaining the original objectives of the project, the
reorientation altered the proposed means of achieving them. The Project
Unit was to hand over to in-line government serv-ces the more traditional
development activities, and would itself concentrate on experimental,
innovative components such as applied research, village-based extension,
new methods of farmer training and small rural operations.
9.        The key elements of project design that influenced
implementation weres i) the unwitting use of a technology geared to good
rainfall as the basis of a production package in an area that in fact has
low and erratic rainfall (low rainfall was identified as a risk at
appraisal, but not sufficiently taken into account); ii) the use of an
excessively centralized top-down planning process; and iii) excessive
emphasis on production issues in an area where social and ecological
factors are of crucial importance in project implementation.
10.       The initial project was prepared in great detail.  The timing
and placing of staff, materials, and financial inputs were precisely
specified and very detailed cost estimates were presented. Subsequent



-3
events show that a great deal of this work was useless. Indeed, it could
even be argued that the very detailed, but unrealistically precise, project-
document replaced the initiative, knowledge and sensitivity of those
implementing the project. Precise and rigid planning in a heterogenous and
dynamic environment can be misleading end unproductive.
Protect imylemewtttion
11.       project implementation was hampered by two unavoidable factors;
i) low rainfall (identified, but underestimated, as a risk at appraisal);
and Uii a decline in uranium revenue (unforeseen at *ppraisal, when
increases in uranium revenue had been identified as a potential cost-
escalating risk.)
12.       A mid-course reorientation attempted to provide the greater
flexibility, responsiveness and relevance needed to enable the project to
respond to these changes, and to the farmers' responses to the changes, but
these efforts were not very successful.
13.       Project start-up was slow. Conditions of effectiveness were not
met on Ame, and a 3OZ drop in the price of uranium and a lack of suitably
qualified staff all contributed to initial problems and delays. Once
started, project had some initial, but short lived, success. Deterioration
in ecological and finaucial climates reduced the willingness and capacity
of resource-poor farmers to adopt the high-input production pm.zkages
offered by the project.
14.       The farmers were no longer able to make the investments and take
the risks Implied in the intensive production package. In times of
drought, they understandably returned to their traditional low-input/low-
output/low-risk strategy of extensive production. Under these conditions,
the project was getting a very poor response to offers of plows,
fertilizer, seed, credit and input-intensive extension advice. Communities
and individuals were concentrating on short-term survival and seldom had
the resources to invest elsewhere. The top-heavy, top-down production
project did not respond to their needs.
15.       Maradi was not unique in having sucu troubles.  The Dosso
Project, for instance, was going through an even more serious crisis, which
resulted in the project being closed own in June 1985, with cancellation
of US$ 16.8 million of the US$ 20 million credit. Substantial changes in
national strategy were proposed in 1982 after the Zinder National Seminar
on Rural Development. The new strategy focused on increased farmer
participation, greater attention to sustainable natural resource
management, increased efficiency, and a more integrated and participatory
approach to development.
16.       For Maradi I1, this strategy provided the basis for a
reorientation of the project during 1983 and 1984. Beneficiary
participation had to be increased, project costs reduced and efficiency
increased. Among the more important points of the reorientation were that:
i) farmers would be more closely involved; ii) there would be a more
integrated and r*ttionalized approach to project management; iii) applied
research would receive greater emphasis; iv) alternative training would be



-4
provided for young farmers; v) the cost of extension would be reduced; vi)
0ost recovery would be improved; and vii) there would be improved feedback
from mnitoring end evaluation.
17.            The reorientation meant that, halfway through the second
phase, the main focus of the project was still on research and development.
1I.            Morale of project staff was low after reorientation. Staff
numbers had been significantly, and justifiably, reduced (from 641 in 1982
to 250 in 1985); operational expenditures were cut and many of the
remaining staff, though willing to adapt, were uncertain and doubtful about
the implementation of the reoriented project. There were other serious
post-reoriertation personnel problems, including the jailing of the
project's Director General for misuse of funds and the disappearance of the
expatriate project accountant with a sizeable amount of project funds. (The
project was subsequently reimbursed by the firm that had supplied him.)
19.            These events triggered a much tighter and more centralized
control of the project from Niamey. Although there wa  obviously a need to
mprove project management, the rigid and remote control exercised by the
Ministry significantly reduced the project's ability to respond to local
opportunities. This was exacerhated by the relatively poer state of
communications between the capital and Maradi. The new Director General
was virtually paralysed by controls, checks and an undertLandable
disinclination to shoulder responsibility.
20.       The post-reorientation program was further hampered by serious
delays In finalizing crucial modifications in legal and financial
arrangements.  The government's contribution to the prAject was to be cut
from 252 to 4t. Implementing this and other changes, which required
modifying the Development Credit Agreements and putting in place additional
CCCI 'exceptional aid', did not take place until late 1984. The main
cause for the delay was disagreement between the Government and the do=o:s
on certain aspects of the reorientation. This led to a finAncial cr_sis in
1984 and 1985, during which time the project was desperately short 4f
operating funds.
21.       The project took longer than expected to divest itself of its
more traditional development activities. There was considerable debate on
how fast this should be done, as the in-line Departmental Services were
generr Ay poorly staffed and equipped, and thus had only limited capacity
to accept this additional responsibility.
22.       Slow progress after reorientation led to a decision in August
1985 to extend the project's closing date from Dtzember 31, 1985, to
September 30, 1988, the time estimated as necessary to develop and test the
new approach.
23.       In 1987, there was a second, but smaller, reorientation intended
to further develop the notion of mobilizing village-level resources and,
through meetings and discussion, to produce village action plans. The new
approach was called 'Programme Villageois de Developpement (PVD).'



24.       The last year of the project's life was not very productive. The
government made a number of vigorous, but unsuccessful, attempts to justify
a further extension of the IDA credit. The CCCE, however, decided to
extend its credit to finance the implunentation of the PVD in some 60
villages. The project was completed in September 1988. Total project costs
were approximately US$ 20 million. USS 11.4 million of the original US$
16.7 million IDA credit was disbursed. Sixty-seven per cent of the IAD
funds and 85Z of the CCCE funds were disbursed.
25.       It has been argued that the Bank did not allow enough time for
the reoriented project to prove itself, since such fundamental changes in a
project's strategy and operational focus cannot be achieved quickly or
easily. Furthermore, it is argued, many of the indicators of progress are
slow to emerge, and would only be detectable after three or four years.
26.       Although there is certainly some truth in these arguments, there
was also little indication that the major structural and attitudinal
changes required for success were being made. The heavy project strlcture
remained, and would only collapse if the funds to support it were not
available. Thus, although the general approach of the reoriented phase was
considered appropriate, and there were some localized examples of promising
PVD work, it was clear that the Second Maradi Project was not the most
appropriate vehicule to achieve sustainable village level production,
resource management and development.
Proiect Results
27.       The overall results of the Second Maradi Project were
disappointing. Although a number of important lessons were learned and
some locally important physical development took place, neither initial nor
revised project goals were met. The project did, however, play a
sigaificant part in the development of an approach and methodology for
planning and implementing site-specific village level operations. This has
added to. rather than replaced, the more individually-focused production
operations, and has lent an important new dimension to rural development
activities in Niger.
28.       National and local financial problems, low and erratic rainfall,
a top-heavy, rigid project structure and consistently over-optimistic goal
setting were factors opposed to the success of Maradi II. Project design
was based on good years, but it had to live with bad years. The project was
planned without a long-term, realistic consideration of probable outcomes.
29.       No economic rate of return has been calculated, eithep. for the
project as a whole or for its main production components. Frequent changes
in project design and a lack of reliable data from the crucial early years
make it impossible to make an accurate calculation. Were this possible,
however, it would certainly be negative. The project completely failed to
meet any of its incremental production targets (see paragraphs 32, 37, 51),
yet consumed almost USS 30 million in doing so. Only about 30Z of the IDA
funds were used for investment in development, the remainder was consumed
in staff and operating costs.

30.       Although the project's physical achievements were minimal,
Maradi II has played an important role in improving the awareness and
internal organization of a great mny villages in the project area. This
social benefit is difficult to quantify, but it is increasingly recognized
as an essential precondition to rural change. The project also provided a
clear, though excessively costly, demonstration of the problems,
constraints and potentials of village-level development in eastern Niger.
31.       For the purpose of this report, project activities are grouped
into four categoriess (i) irrigation, (ii) dryland production,
(iii) village development and (iv) 'other'.
(i) Irrigation
32.       Although 70S of the target area was developed, the large-scale
irrigation component achieved only 15 Z of its initial production targets
for food and 50? of the targets for cotton production. The actual cost of
developing the schemes was twice as high as estimated. A supervision
mission ascribed this to *underestimations, omissions and tlaws in
preparation. The rate of initial implementation was conside-ably slowed by
serious land disputes, although considerable effort had been made during
preparation to avoid that problem. The results on the small- cale schemes,
the 'Ruwanas and garden wells, were more positive, but the costs of both
were very high, and farmers were unable to repay their loans.
33.       The hoped-for intensive double cropping (though the risk of
possible failure in this was acknowledged) did not materialize, nor did the
tomato concentrate factory that BDRN was contemplating at the time of
appraisal. It had been hoped that this factory, if constructed, would
provide a market for irrigated crops.
34.       Although water charges were initially below cost, cost recovery
was consistently poor. In 1983, for example, beneficiaries contributed
only half the cost of water and by mid-1984 this had fallen to one third.
Farmer discipline was poor, and it was only in 1986 that 54 defaulting
farmers were finilly expelled for not paying water charges. Cost recovery
was better on the more independent Ruwanas (772).
35.       Later in the project, higher water charges and increased
discipline led 200 farmers to abandon the scheme at Girataoua and to return
to dryland production. By 1987 there was a significantly reduced demdnd
for land and the project was able to consider reallocating land to better
farmers.
36.       Efforts were made to encourage  farmers to grow cotton, in hopes
of increasing margins. Initially, this went well given a buoyant world
market.  Unfortunately, however, t.e market collapsed.  Although the crop
remained profitable to the farmer at the subsidized price of CFAF 130/kg
(later reduced to CFAF 100/kg) seed cotton, the government was losing
between CFAP 200 and 300/kg on cotton fibre.

(iM) Drvland Croo Develogment
37.       According to IFAD estimates, the project achieved an annual
increase in dryland cereal production of approximately 1,500 tons/year, or
only 12Z of the appraisal target of 16,000 tons. The main thrust of this
component was a technical package that included the use of animal traction,
chemical fertilizer and improved seeds, supported by a "Training and Visit'
extension system and agricultural credit. The extension program had a
strong organizational structure, but poor technical support and
supervision, weak researchlextension linkages and little feedback from the
farmers. The full crop production package was developed in farmer training
programs, and the graduating farmers were supplied, on credit, with the
equipment necessary to implement the package. There is no evidence to
suggest that the former trainees are currently farming at a higher standard
than their untrained peers.
38.       Although there was some initial increase in fertilizer use
(2,833 tons in 1981, and 1,531 tons in 1982), it was not sustained once
rainfall declined, reduced subsidies increased fertilizer prices and the
farmers returned to, or continued with, their short-term risk-minimisinp,
tactics of low-input subsistence production.
39.       When better rainfall did return, in 1986 for example, farmers
were still reluctant to use the package even though they were well aware of
the benefits of fertiliser use. This time their reluctance was due to
increasing fertilizer prices and falling food crop prices that made the use
of fertilizer uneconomic. This, in turn, reflected on the farmers'
reluctance to recapitalize the PAIC fertilizer Banks.
40.       Little use was made of IDA funds to purchase fertilizer, even
during the early years of the project when demand was relatively high.
Cheap subsidized supplies were available from Nigeria, and the project made
the logical decision to purchase these rather than use the ICB procedure
required by the Bank. Also, even cheaper sources of fertilizer were
available to farmers on the black market.
41.        Although implicit, and eventually explicit, in the R & D
component, there was little practical work done on improving agropastoral
production and integrating livestock more into the farming system. In 1986,
for instance, supervision missions were still pressing for work to start on
integrating livestock into the crop production system. Unfortunately, no
contact was made with PENCE, the IDA/CCCE-funded livestock project in the
area, until 1987, too late for any impact.
42.       Seed Multiplication.  Before its reorientation, the project
distributed some 2,500 tons of seed, mainly groundauts, each year. In
1983, however, this component was handed over to the in-line government
services, which were required to encourage cooperative village-level seed
multiplication. The results obtained varied enormously and the level of
success was closely correlated with the year's rainfall.  After drought
years, the quality and quantity of seed was cause for concern.
43.       Trainint.  The project had a very active training program that
involved not only farmers (both individuals and young couples), but village



-8-
groups, extension workers, cooperatives, health workers, village midwives,
blacksmiths and fishermen. Training was offered in technical matters,
functional literacy and management. It is estimated that some 5,500
villagers from 300 villages have been trained by the project, a coverage of
one quarter of the villages in the project area.
44.       The training program vas evaluated and reoriented in 1983. As
the use of classic extension workers was being reduced, so was their
training. Consequently, in 1986, the residential training programmes for
extension staff at the Young Farmers' Training Centre (CFJA) were
abandoned, in 1986.
45.       Farmer training was also changed, since the Rural Centers (CPR)
were expensive and their graduates were not having a significant impact.
This was not simply a problem with the training program, since villages
were not selecting good candidates. The trainees, for example, seldom had
an effective position in the village and very few of them became members of
the PIAC management committees.
46.       After reorientation, four types of training program were tested.
The most popular was the low cost village CPR, which was subsequently
adopted by the project.
47.       The Cooperative Training program for the PAIC was effecttie and,
despite the limited scale of operations, had a positive local impait on
rural organization. Unfortunately, there is little information avaJlable
on the quality and results of the other non-agricultural training programs.
48.       There was a serious lack of retraining programs for project
staff after the reorientation. The change in project strategy demanded a
significant change in the approach and skills of those agents who remained.
They were not given the support and guidance necessary for them to learn
and perform their new tasks. It is reported, for instance, that it was
only in 1985 that project staff began to acquire the skills needed to gauge
the needs of the villagers and to understand the social and ecological
complexity of each different village setting.
49.       Extension.  The initial, traditional and structured extension
service was abandoned at reorientation in favor of a village-based system
that made more use of village resources, and of the graduates of the CFJA
and the new village CPR trainees. This was done to reduce project costs
and to increase villagers' involvement in the development process.
50.       The reoriented program was too ambitious and overestimated the
capacity of the trainees to have an impact in their village. The low-key,
almost voluntary, approach to extension developed by the project was
insufficient to produce the required changes in farmers' behavior; the
situation called for a more active and organized system. It also seems
likely that the recruits for the village extension training programs were
not necessarily those best equipped, in terms of technical and leadership
skills and social position, to influence the behavior of others.
Nonetheless, there were reports of villages where this approach to
extension was working.

51.       Agricultural Credit.  The credit program had many serious
problems and was not successful. Not only did the drought reduce the
capacity of farmers and cooperatives to repay their loans, but there were
severe institutional problems -- particularly the replacement of UNCC by
the CNCA, which subsequently went bankrupt and blocked project funds -- and
the project's own financial crisis reduced both the availability of funds
and the project's ability to recover debts. Agricultural credit under
Maradi I1 went through two *phases't the first was up until 1982, using the
UNCC/.ZCA network; the second was the brief period after 1986, using the
cooperative, URC system to supply village fertilizer banks.
52.       Medium-term credit to village groups (GMV) initially did well
(852 repayment in 1983). but a decline set in with the drought.  Credit
recovery has remained a serious issue right up to the end of the project.
Arrangements have recently been made for the cooperative unions (URC and
USRC) to recover outstanding credit. There is, however, no indication of
how successful this will be.
53.       The credit program underlined a problem inherent in semi-arid
area: that of low and variable income. With certain exceptions, farmers
and communities have limited reserves and unstable incomes. Although they
may feel confident enough to take credit during an extended period of
favorable conditions, their basic financial instability works against 'It in
the long term. During years of poor rainfall, the very last thuag they
require in their risk-reducing strategy is the burden of debt repayment.
(iii) Villaae and Cooperative Develovment: Cooeratives. PAIC and PVD
54.       This component yielded some diverse and positive results.
Initial (1980-83) support and training for cooperative leaders went wvll.
By 1983, however, the UNCC crisis, the reduced demand for credit and the
outcome of the Zinder seminar resulted in the abandonment of the GMV
component.
55.       The post-reorientation version of this component was a
collective interest program (PAIC) centered on community and individual
investments that had the capacity to provide economic returns. This
included wells for vegetable gardening, grain mills, input and cereal
banks, pumps and village retail bnops. The program did not reach planned
goals, though some 392 operations were undertaken between 1984 and 1987 in
176 villages. Many of these investments had some positive impact, but only
on a local scale. The PAIC had an additional positive effect in
encouraging improved community organization. More than half the PAIC
investments were wells or pumps for small-scale irrigation. A very
positive element of the program was the development of the concept of
communal responsibility for individual loans.
56.       The PAIC targets were overly optimistic, and insufficient time
was all.owed for the careful groundwork necessary to prepare local-level
participatory initiatives. The sociological aspects of PAIC were
underemphasized, and insufficient attention was given to the need for
social cohesion to support and sustain operations. Local involvement in



- 10 -
the identification and planning of PAIC operations was often insufficient,
as the work was undertaken by project staff in order to speed up
implementation rates. The level of management skills required to sustain
the operations was also underestimated.
57.       A negative part of the PAICs were those investments that
resulted in direct competition with existing private enterprise operations.
The village shops are an example of this.
58.       A lack of both donor coordination and of a clear and consistent
government policy of incentives and credit rules was a problem with the
PAIC.  Different donors pursued different strategies and, unfortunately,
the government could not enforce a common approach. The PAIC did not
provide any insights into how this ubiquitous problem might best be solved,
but it highlighted it as a serious issue.
59.       The second project reorientation in 1987 created the PVD, which
was to try to make multisectoral use of available information and get full
participation at all stages of operation. By the end of the project, some
60 villages were included in this program, and the implementation of plias
is being financed by the CCCE. The PVD approach is a positive progression
from the PAIC operations: villages are much more closely involved in the
planning process. One early problem has been *She obtention of consensus on
priorl.ties within the villages. It was noted that it took considerable
time {or villagers to agree on what particular investment they most needed.
(iv) Other ComDonents
60.       Awnlied Research. MonitorinalEvaluation and Research and
Revelomnent. Initially, the project had classic applied research and
monitoringlevaluation components.  At reorientation, a research and
development component was introduced to impr-ve the practical relevance of
technology development, to involve farmers more in the trial work and to
improve the project's understanding of environmental issues.
61.       These components produced some competent and professional
background work. They collected a great deal of data, undertook some
promising field trials, and established good working relationships with the
test villages. Unfortunately, however, very little of this valuable
knowledge was put to operational use. All too often, the results were
descriptive rather than prescriptive, with little operational focus. These
components had little impact on either project design or implementation,
though the USE was instrumental in the redesign of CPR training.
62.       This problem was due to several factors, some of the most
important being: i) an insufficiently operational focus of both terms of
reference and study output; ii) insufficient communication between
researchers and planning and implementation staff; iii) excessive
complexity of trials, iv) too much focus on short-term, production-related
factors, and not enough on long term environmental and sociological ones;
and v) inadequate capacity of the extension services to absorb and use the
results produced.



63.       Sub.-troiects.  The project had modest forestry, fisheries,
public health and plant protection components.
64.       The forestry component overlapped somewhat, but apparently did
not directly duplicate, the IDA forestry project. The fisheries component
produced some good initial ideas, but follow-up was insufficient and no
lasting impact was achieved. The plant protection and human health
activities were organized fairly efficiently and had a wide geographic
coverage. By 1987, for example, 41S of the villages in the project area
had benefited from the health component.
Finance and Accounts
65.       The project had serious and chronic financial problems. In Lt84,
private firms were refusing to supply goods and services to the project,
and staff could not be paid. The unexpected lack of Government funds
(mainly due to the drop in uranium prices), unexpectedly high costs of the
irrigation schemes, excessively high staffing levels, the bankruptcy of
CNCA, delays in establishing revolving funds in 1984, generally poor levels
of cost recovery, and misappropriation of funds all contributed to the
problem.
66.       The project's exceedingly complex cofinancing arrangements made
it very difficult to incorporate changes into the credit agreements. At
completion, the undisbursed residue of the IDA USS 16.7 million credit was
US$ 5.4 million. The project was not closed on schedule as additional time
was required to justify the remaining balance in the IFAD and IDA advances
to the special account. This process was still underway at the time of
this writing (May, 1989).
67.       Accounts and audits were initially behind schedule. The widely
discussed possibility of long-term embezzlement up to 1984 raises
questions about the effectiveness of the audits and other control
mechanisms. However, there is insufficient information available to make a
judgement.
Proiect Sustainability
68.       The Second Maradi Rural Development Project was not sustainable,
whether in its original form or in its reoriented form. Although
reorientation introduced a number of themes that enhanced the possibility
of sustainability, -- greater beneficiary participation, more concern about
production systems and sustainable natural resource management, etc.-- the
big and cumbetsome project unit was too costly to be supported by either
the benefits of the project or the budget of the state.
69.       Only towards the very end of the project's life did it begin to
respond to the longer-term needs of the population and the harsh physical
environment. Thus, although Maradi II itself was not sustainable, it may
have spawned other smaller, independent and sustainable operations.



^ 12 -
Bank and Borrower Performance
70.       The Aank bears responsibility for the overly optimistic project
goals. At appraisal it was considered that 'there is practically no risk
of the rainfed component's rate of return falling below 102". This has
proven unrealistic. Ths detail and confidence of project plans was not
justified in light of the diverse and heterogeneous agro-ecological and
socia-economic conditions of Maradi.
71.       There were shortcomings in project supervision during the early
years. Supervisors changed frequently before 1983 and there was one large
gap from March 1981 to April 1982 with no supervision at all. For most of
the project, however, there was regular and effective Bank and CtCE
supervision.
72.       The Bank and the CCCE made constant efforts to improve the
project and to make it more relevant to the local conditions. The major
(1983) and minor (1987) reorientations are evidence of this concern. These
changes moved the project in a positive direction. but in the and were not
sufficient to counteract its structural problems.
73.       Should the Bank have closed the project in 1983, rather than
reorient it? Some people believe so. When the decision on Maradi was
being made, however, the closure of Dosso i'roject was also being discussed,
which entailed the cancellation of US$ 16.8 million of the credit. Thus,
there vete strong strategic and political reasons co continue with Maradi
if the Bank wished to maintain any dialogue with the Nigerien government on
the "Zinder Seminar* approach to agricultural production and resource
mnagement.
74.       The Government was slow to apply the results of the Zinder
Seminar. Although it understood the need for decentralization and
increased participation of the rural ;opulation, '.ivil servants and field
staff found it understandably difficult to alter their attitudes and
approach.
75.       The tight control exercised by the Ministry after 1984 was an
understandable, but unfortunate, reaction to the excessively 'freelance"
style of the jailed Director General. It stifled local initiative and made
it very difficult for the project to progress.
76.       Overstaffing was an almost constant problem.  First noted in
1980, it remained an issue until project completion despite the
reorientation which significantly reduced numbers.
77.       Relationships between the Borrowers and the donors were not
good. There was frequent conflict and almost constant mistrust between
supervision missions and project management.
Consulting Services
78.       There were no notable aspects relating to consultant
performance.

6.   Proiect Costs
1.   Initial Project Costs were estimated at US$ 47.5 million of which 44?
for foreign exchange. After reoriuntation, estimated costs t-ere reduced to
USS 29.8 million.
2.   Details of project costs are not available for the period 1981-1985,
though an estimation of total costs at the end of March 1985 indicates that
CFAF 4,413 million had been spent.
3.   Details of expenditures for the latter period are shown belows

4.   Combining the costs of the two project phases produces an estimated
total project cost of CFAF 6,81, or 68.4X of appraisal estimates. This is
the equivalent of US$ 22.7 million at current CPAF values, or US$ 32.5.
million if calculated as a percentage of initial cost estimates. The total
CPAF costs rpresents 68.42 of the appraisal estimates; IDA Credit
disbursements were 67.7? of the total credit.
7.   Proiect Financins
The project had complex and .-requently changing financial
arrangements. Su-maries of aspects of project financing are presented for
four stages of the project: appraisal, negotiations, reorientation and
