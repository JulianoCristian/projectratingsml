NIGER
SECOND MARADI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Prolect Background
1.01      In May 1978, the Government of Niger informed IDA and CCCE of its
interest in obtaining their assistance for financing a follow-up and an
extension of the ongoing Maradi Rural Development Project (Cr. 608-NIR), which
was scheduled to be fully disbursed by the end of 1979. The first project
aimed at improving the productivity of groundnuts, millet and cowpeas grown
over three administrative districts, strengthening the cooperative institu-
tion, expanding educational and training programs, studying the means of
developing the irrigation potential, implementing a pilot irrigation program
and participating in development of feeder roads, fuel wood plantation and
livestock credit for pastoralists. A progress report on Cr. 608-NIR is
at Chapter III. A feasibility study for the follow-up project was financed
under Cr. 608-NIR, carried out by consultants, SCET-International (France),
and submitted to the Government in April 1979. The appraisal mission and CCCE
representatives visited Niger in May 1979. A Special Action Credit of US$2
million has been granted by the EEC to bridge the gap between the end of the
first Maradi Rural Development Project (December 31, 1979) and the scheduled
start of the second phase (July 1980), and to launch the irrigation component
of the proposed second project (see Chapter III, Subdivision C).
B. The Rural Sector
1.02      Human Geography.  Niger has a population of about 5 million, of
whom over 4 million live in rural areas. The country covers 1.3 million
km2, of which 75% is desert, 15% semi-arid, and less than 0L suitable
for crop production, and even this is of limited potential. About half the
people live between the southern border with Nigeria, where annual rainfall
is 700-800 mm, and the 500 mm isohyet. In this area of about 100,000 km2,
population density averages only 20/km2 but exceeds 100/km2 in the more
favorable locations in valleys; the main crops are millet and sorghum,
groundnuts, cowpeas and some cotton. Further north, as rainfall declines and
becomes even more variable, rainfed cropping becomes increasingly precarious
and livestock activities increasingly important.
1.03      Share in GDP and Exports.  In 1970, the rural sector accounted
for about 60% of GDP and 80% of exports; now the sector accounts for about
45% of GDP and 25% of exports. This dramatic change reflects the rapid rise



- 2 -
in uranium production but also slow development of the rural sector. Recent
crop production has been disappointing, particularly groundnuts, for which
production has declined from 200,000 tons (shelled) in 1965 to about 80,000
tons. This decline is attributable to unattractive producer prices, drought,
and subsequent difficulties in reconstituting seed stocks. These difficulties
were reinforced by repeated attacks of groundnut diseases (aphids and rosette
virus). Farmers have switched into grains and cowpeas; the value of crops now
accounts for less than 25% of GDP and 10% of exports. Livestock production was
disrupted by the 1973 drought which, according to Government estimates,
reduced the national herd from 4.2 million cattle to 2.2 million, and from 9
million smallstock to 7 million. Although herd reconstitution has begun,
pre-drought cattle numbers cannot be reached for another decade. Increases in
prices of livestock products have, however, largely offset the reduced volume
of production; livestock now accounts for 20% of GDP, the same percentage as
in 1971, but its share of exports has decreased from 42% to 15%.  The decrease
of the export percentage is explained by the sharp rise of uranium exports.
1.04      Food Balance.  Before 1973, Niger was self-sufficient in basic
foodstuffs in normal years.  Over the three drought years 1973-75 however,
cereal imports averaged about 120,000 tons/year, equivalent to only about
10% of normal annual production but a much higher proportion, perhaps 50%,
of marketed production. This disquieting experience drew increased
attention to cereal production - a hitherto neglected subsector - and this
attention has not waned despite the good harvests in 1976/77 and 1978/79,
which necessitated food imports of only about 2% of total food requirements.
Although some recent projections have suggested that there would likely be
an important millet and sorghum deficit in the years to come, present
indications are that, provided rainfed farming productivity projects are
implemented as envisaged, Niger will continue to be about self-sufficient
in cereals but that production will be vulnerable to the vagaries of
climate. Good-year surpluses will be marketable in Northern Nigeria.
Poor-year deficits will be met by imports, but the probability of a drought
as severe as that of 1973 is low (0.02).
1.05      Institutions.  The Ministry of Rural Development, which has main
but not sole responsibility for the rural sector, is divided into four
Departments: Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Engineering and Forestry; there
is also a small planning unit attached to the Minister's Cabinet. The
Union Nigerienne de Credit et de Cooperation (UNCC), established in 1962,
is responsible for cooperative development, input supply, seasonal and
medium-term credit recovery and primary marketing, as well as the management
of some agricultural projects. In October 1978, the Government adopted new
statutes for the cooperative system, with activity areas to be based on
administrative limit. Moreover, in the long term, UNCC would disappear and
cooperatives would become self-sufficient and ensure their own supply of
inputs, commercialization and extension work. It is unlikely that these
new statutes could be activated quickly. The Caisse Nationale de Credit
Agricole (CNCA), established as an offshoot from UNCC in 1967, is responsible
for provision of funds for agricultural credit, review of loan applications,
and book-keeping for consolidated cooperatives' accounts. The Office National



- 3 -
des Amenagements Hydro-Agricoles (ONAHA), created in December 1978, is respon-
sible for all irrigation projects: running, managing and maintaining the
existing schemes, preparing and regularly updating a survey of the irrigation
projects, and carrying out the extension work in liaison with UNCC. In
secondary marketing and processing of the main crops, parapublic companies
have been set up to compete with the private sector. The Societe Nigerienne
d'Arachide (SONARA) handles both groundnuts and cowpeas: marketing volumes of
these crops have fluctuated widely as a result of weather and erratic pricing;
the cowpeas bought by SONARA declined from 50,000 tons in 1976/77 to 18,000
tons in 1978/79; the groundnut volume, which was regularly over 150,000 tons
(shelled) in the 1960s and early 1970s, has not exceeded 15,000 tons in the
three years through 1978/79. The Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger
(OPVN) handles millet and sorghum, between 10,000 and 60,000 tons/ year
purchased locally, and processed rice, about 3,000 tons/year; OPVN has
also been responsible for internal distribution of food aid. The Societe
Nigerienne des Primeurs (SONIPRIM) commercializes a small amount of fruits
and vegetables in the Niamey area (about 100 tons in 1978/79) and also
exports stringbeans, melons and peppers to the European market (about 1,000
tons in 1978/79).
1.06      Input Pricing.  Governnent pursues a policy of heavy subsidies on
agricultural inputs, and prices to farmers have not been changed for several
years.  With rising costs, the subsidy element has correspondingly increased
and in 1979/80, will reach 50% on fertilizer, about 70% on small animal-drawn
implements, and about 40% on carts. Whereas unit prices for inputs are
decided by the Minister of Rural Development, on the basis of proposals
submitted by UNCC, the amount of money available for input subsidies is fixed
by the Ministry of Planning as part of the annual capital budget. Since the
aggregate amount is usually insufficient to finance acquisition of the input
volumes required by the M.D.R. at the subsidized unit prices, inputs are
necessarily rationed. Moreover, since tenders for supply of inputs are not
issued until the budget allocation is known, a good part of the inputs is
delivered too late. Therefore data on input use - less than 4,000 tons of
fertilizer nationwide for rainfed farming - do not reflect demand but rather
rationed, untimely supply.
1.07      Output Pricing.  Prices paid by the parapublic marketing agencies
for millet, sorghum, groundnuts, cowpeas, cotton and paddy are fixed by a
National Price Committee chaired by the Minister of Economic Affairs.
Prices are announced in October only, i.e. just before the opening of the
primary markets, and therefore are relevant only for the following season's
planting decisions. In the last few years, furthermore, uncertainties have
been exacerbated by (a) a reduction in the producer price for cowpeas in
the 1975/76 season after the markets had opened, and (b) an increase in the
producer price for groundnuts and cowpeas in the 1977/78 season after the
markets had been operating for three months. Prices for the 1978/79 season
all showed a significant increase over the previous year's initial prices,
namely from CFAF 45 to CFAF 50 for groundnuts, from CFAF 30 to CFAF 40 for
millet and sorghum, from CFAF 30 to CFAF 45 for cowpeas, and from CFAF
55 to CFAF 62 for cotton. These prices have been maintained for the
1979/80 season. As a percentage of the economic price, the producer price



- 4 -
is 63% for sorghum, 67% for cowpeas, 74% for millet, 73% for groundnuts, and
87% for cotton. The recent price increases reflect a recognition of the
necessity to compete with the market in Nigeria, where prices are not effec-
tively controlled, and with merchants from both Niger and Nigeria.
C. Sector Strategy and Issues
1.08      Constraints and Challenges.  Apart from uranium, the country's
natural resource endowment is unusually poor. The climate imposes a severe
limit on the area where cultivation is possible, and even in that area,
uncertain rainfall makes farming a hazardous occupation. Soils are generally
poor; and in many areas fertility is declining as fallow periods are being
shortened, reflecting increased pressure on land stemming from population
growth (of about 2.7Z per year). The decline in soil fertility may, in
many areas, have reached a point where it is now worthwhile to intensify
land use. Water, though abundant underground, is found in only a few
valleys and irrigation is costly, with investment costs above US$10,000 ha.
The distances to marketing points, both internal and external, are enormous,
putting Niger at a disadvantage with competitors in export markets (over
US$100/ton to ocean port); yet the country's isolation fails to provide
much inducement for import substitution since natural protection against
imports is offset by diseconomies of scale caused by the limited size of the
local market. Despite the expansion in uranium production and related
activities, productive employment opportunities outside the rural sector
are increasing by only a few thousand per year, while the working age
population increases by 40,000-50,000 each year. Unless income opportuni-
ties can be expanded in the rural sector, present dry-season migration to
neighboring countries will increase and perhaps become permanent.
1.09      Objectives and Strategies.  Government has responded to these
contraints and challenges by selecting a two-fold objective: to exploit
the potential in rainfed crop and livestock production, and to increase the
area under controlled irrigation. In rainfed agriculture, the strategy is
to set up a regional "Productivity Project" in each province whereby improved
extension, input supply, credit and marketing services would be made
available to smallholders. It is Government's intention that such projects
should cover the whole of the cultivable part of the country by 1980. By
1980 such projects, not always covering the whole of a province, were being
implemented in five of the six relevant provinces including the Maradi Pro-
ject, financed under Cr. 608-NIR (US$10.7 million). The existing rainfed-
based projects differ in emphasis, in coverage of subsectors, and also in
administrative structure. In controlled irrigation, Government aims at a
modest rate of development, of about 1,200 ha per year, while building the
institutions that could later manage a more rapid rate of implementing new
perimeters. Government strategy is generally sound. Although it is hesitant
to exclude even the most arid areas from its improvement objectives, this can
hardly be justified in economic and technical terms (para 1.12 below). On
the positive side, the growth of the cooperative movement has facilitated
Government's strategy.



- 5 -
1.10      Policy Issues.  Significant improvements have recently been made
in output pricing, whereby financial prices have been moved closer to economic
prices (para 1.07), and in the cost of agricultural credit, whereby the
interest rate was increased from 6.5% in 1977/78 to 8% in 1978/79 and then to
9.5% for 1979/80. Since average annual inflation over 1975-77 was 22%, and
since it may be somewhat higher over the next three years, the real interest
rate probably has been close to zero. No improvements have been made in input
pricing; in fact, as financial prices have been held constant, they have moved
further away from economic prices (para 1.06); this policy decision reflects
Government's desire to transfer income from uranium to the rural sector.  More
important, input supply continues to be inadequate, irregular and untimely. A
new statute with regard to credit for cooperatives has been decreed, which
took effect in late 1979 and gave cooperatives legal status allowing them to
borrow funds directly from CNCA. It is likely that several years and some
amendments will be necessary before the new system can be fully operational.
A 3- to 4-year program of education and training is being established to make
the cooperatives more autonomous in funds management and accounting. Credit
repayment remains a problem, as the national average repayment rate is only
around 60-70%. The rate does, however, vary considerably between provinces,
depending on the motivation and abilities of local technical services and on
the attitude of local authorities. For the Maradi Project, the repayment rate
is 90% for medium-term and 80% for short-term credit.
1.11      Previous Bank Involvement.  Since 1969, seven credits have been
approved for the agricultural sector. The first, Cr. 207-NIR for US$0.6
million, signed in 1970, was designed to provide smallholders with credit
for seasonal inputs and implements and to strengthen the cooperative movement.
The Completion Report 1/ concludes that "the project was an unfortunate
undertaking" since (a) it concentrated on financial aspects of agricultural
credit without providing for specific structured actions aimed at improving
production technology at the field level; (b) the key agency, UNCC, provided
no extension services to groundnut farmers; (c) the project period, 1971-74,
coincided with severe droughts; and (d) until late 1974, Government adopted a
punitive producer price policy. Instead of a 100% rate of return as estimated
at appraisal, the actual rate of return, not quantified in the Completion
Report, was barely positive. The second, Cr. 441-NIR for US$2 million,
made in 1974, was the Drought Relief Project which financed a variety of
small subprojects; these were generally executed satisfactorily. The third,
Cr. 608-NIR, for US$10.7 million, for the Maradi Rural Development Project, was
approved in December 1975 but did not becone effective until October 1976.
The project has satisfactorily completed two agricultural seasons and is
engaged in its third and final season (Chap. III B below). The fourth,
Cr. 800-NIR for US$4.5 million approved in May 1978, is a Forestry Project
which will primarily finance 400 ha of pilot irrigated tree plantations. The
fifth, Cr. 851-NIR, for US$15 million, approved in September 1978, is the
1/   Niger:  Agricultural Credit Project Completion Report, April 27, 1977.



- 6 -
Namarigoungou Irrigation Project, which will primarily finance a new 1,500 ha
perimeter. The sixth, Cr. 885-NIR, for US$12 million, approved in March
1979, is the Livestock Project, located in the center and east of the country;
it will finance an innovative approach to providing a package of services
to pastoralists in the semi-arid pastoral zone and a series of specific
livestock-related actions in the cropping zone. A seventh approved but
not yet signed, will be a credit for the US$20 million Dosso Agricultural
Development Project, negotiated with Government in September 1979. This
project, which does not include an irrigation component, will cover another of
the six provinces (para 1.09).
1.12      Sector Lending Strategy.  Bank Group investments in the agricul-
tural sector should support Government's generally sound strategy, namely
regional productivity projects, gradual development of the country's
irrigation potential, provision of services to pastoralists, and crop-live-
stock integration. It must be recognized, however, that with present
technical knowledge and the severity of the constraints on agricultural
production, the scope for worthwhile investments in rainfed crop and
livestock production is limited and could be exhausted in the next decade.
Already, there are many areas that are regularly cultivated but in which no
worthwhile investments can be made; the tracing of the demarcation line is
not easy, and Government is understandably concerned to be seen to be doing
something for everyone. Bank Group investments will, nonetheless, have to
trace such a line and, taking due account of the heterogeneity of the
countryside, stay within it.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Physical Features
2.01      Location and Climate.  The project area (see Map 14531) covers
15,944 km2 and four of the six administrative districts of the Maradi
province (38,581 km2). Located in the center south of the country, the
project area is limited to the south by the border with Nigeria, whilst in
the north, the limit is a line roughly parallel to, and 20 km north, of the
national road (RN 1), Guidan-Roumji, Maradi, Aguie, Tessaoua, the four
capitals of the project administrative districts. The province's climate
is sahelian and characterized by a dry season of about eight months.
Annual rainfall at the border with Nigeria is about 750 mm and declines to
the north, to 600 mm at Maradi, and thereafter by about 100 mm for each 50
km of latitude (see Map 14531). The northern limit of the project area
follows roughly the 550 mm isohyet. Interannual variations are high and
distribution is very irregular, in particular at the beginning of the rainy
season, and extremely high variations from the average are recorded.



2.02      Topography and Soils.  The project area, located on the plateau,
is broken by three rivers/valleys flowing east to west, the Goulbi de
Maradi, the Goulbi N'Kaba, and the Goulbi of Tarka. Almost all soils are
of the tropical ferrugineous type of medium fertility and with a phosphorus
deficiency, but they can be easily improved by fertilization. The Goulbi of
Maradi flood plain, based on deposits of silt and lighter materials origina-
ting from granite and crystallophyllienne formations of the river basin
around Kano in Nigeria, has a very heterogeneous texture with layers which
differ greatly.
2.03      Water Resources.  There are no major surface water resources
available for irrigation in the province, excepting the seasonal Goulbi de
Maradi (para 2.04), and outside the flood plain of the Goulbi, there is no
renewable groundwater source permitting significant irrigation development.
Consequently, agricultural production is primarily rainfed, with the intensity
and type of production closely governed by rainfall. Groundwater resources
are adequate for domestic and livestock consumption throughout the province.
2.04      The flood plain of the Goulbi de Maradi is the most prominent
natural feature of the province. Its useful section is approximately 40 km
long and covers about 10,000 ha from the village of Tibiri northwest of
Maradi to the village of Kountoumi in the southeast. The Goulbi de Maradi
is a seasonal river. Over time, the river has built up an alluvial flood
plain and over this plain it spills out from its bed at the time of peak
floods, and its water course shifts fron year to year amidst the alluvial
deposits, which are held between the sharp plateau slopes (Map 14533), and
flows about five months from May to October.  It supplies an aquifer which can
be tapped at depths varying from 1 m to 15 m in the flood plain. This aqui-
fer, which connects with the water table of the "continental intercalaire",
can be mobilized for irrigation by pumping and the groundwater development
program of the project will be based on this method.
B. Socio-Economic Features
2.05      Demography. 1/  The total population of the project area is about
600,000 inhabitants (63% of the province's total population), distributed
over the four districts of Madarounfa (139,600), Aguie (125,100), Tessaoua
(148,500) and Guidan Roumji (141,600). The population of Maradi city, the
third largest city in Niger, is about 46,000. There are seven towns of
more than 3,000 inhabitants, accounting for about 13% of the total project
area population, but the majority of the population lives in amall villages
of about 300 inhabitants. Population growth varies in the range of 2.4-
2.9% per year in the four project districts. The active population il
estimated at about 65% of the total. The population density of the whole
of Maradi province, about 24 inhabitants per km2, is the highest in
Niger. The northern part of the province, outside the project area, is
1/   From 1977 general census provisional data, or from provincial planning
department.



-8-
semi-desertie and sparsely populated; the p9 pulation density within the
project area is about 38 inhabitants per km . The average farm family is
estimated at about 6.7 persons in the Madarounfa district, and 9.3 persons
in the northern districts of Aguie, Tessaoua and Guidan-Roumji.
2.06      The People.  About 90% of the province population are of the
Hausa tribe, which is also the predominant ethnic group of northern Nigeria.
Because of trade movements with Nigeria, north and south, the almost uncon-
trolled crossing of livestock herds on north-south transhumance, and dif-
ficulties in controlling the movement of people and goods across the border,
a strong connection has been maintained between Maradi and the towns and
districts of northern Nigeria. This relationship is and will continue to be
a very important factor in planning for economic development in the province.
Most of the remaining 10% of the population is Fulani, the other being Touareg.
Fulani are divided into small groups with chiefs in Tessaoua, Madarounfa and
Guidan Roumji, and their average family size is about five persons.  In
addition to animal husbandry activities, they cultivate their own fields; only
the youngsters move to pasture with herds. Unlike in other regions, only a
few herdsmen move from the project area to Nigeria.
2.07      Land Tenure.  The basic pattern of land ownership and usage in
the project area is based on Hausa customary law. Traditional leaders are
considered to be the custodians of all land in their areas of jurisdiction
(village) and are empowered to grant usufruct to heads of families. In
addition, they have to arbitrate conflicts between neighbors or heirs; and
they dispose of the right to attribute unallocated fields to foreign
farmers under some conditions and to expropriate land for community needs.
Theoretically, all lands could be repossessed on the death or departure of
the usufructaries; but in practice, lands are inheritable through the
family and the leaders have no authority over ownership rights on reclaimed
and cultivated lands. At family level, the father is the owner of the land
but he cannot dispose of a part of it without approval of the family
members. Ris role is to distribute the family land between the collective
fields (gandu) and individual plots (gamana) for each family member; the
transfer of individual plots to outsiders is strictly forbidden. Collective
lands are usually devoted to staple food, with the obligation for the male
family members to work for five to six days a week and the women for four
days. Rights on the individual plots can vary each year, in location and
size, as decided by the Chief according to various criteria. On the Goulbi
flood plain, these rules do not apply, and land is sometimes distributed by
the administrative authorities to persons unrelated with the traditional
occupancy.
C. Institutions and Infrastructure
2.08      Local Government.  A Governor (Prefet) for each of the seven
provinces is appointed by, and is the direct representative of, the President.
The Governor chairs the Provincial Technical Committee, which includes as



- 9 -
members all provincial heads of government departments, district Sub-Gover-
nors, and representatives of chiefs. This Committee is responsibble
for coordination between government departments but has no budgetary
authority, which is retained by the ministries in Niamey. Committees with
a similar membership exist at the administrative district level; chaired by
the Sub-Governor (Sous Prefet), they are also coordinating bodies but with
some modest budgetary authority arising from power to allocate local tax
revenues. Administrative districts are divided into cantons governed by a
chief, who is elected by the chiefs of the villages concerned and receives
a government allowance; the canton is the point of contact between modern
government and traditional authority. A veakness of the system is that
provincial heads of government departments are subject to directives from
both their technical superiors in their ministry and from their political
and administrative superiors in the Governor's office.
2.09      Agricultural Services.  The Agriculture, Rural Engineering,
Livestock and Forestry Departments of the Ministry of Rural Development are
well represented in the Maradi Province. The Agricultural Research Institute
(INRAN) carries out research on rainfed and irrigated crops at the Tarna
research station located within the project area. Since 1960 the cooperative
development has been carried out by Union Nigerienne de Credit et de
Cooperation (UNCC para 1.05) through 27 cooperative unions (ALC), 109
cooperatives, and 1,175 Mutual Guarantee Groups (GMV) at village level.
2.10      Marketing and Processing.  By law, groundnuts and cereals market-
ing is the monopoly of state companies, but private traders are tolerated
and they even are often used as middlemen. The Office des Produits Vivriers
du Niger (OPVN para 1.05), a state agency, buys millet and sorghum from
private merchants and cooperatives at official producer prices in conjunc-
tion with its management of buffer and security stocks. Its storage
capacity in Maradi is 11,000 tons, plus an additional 13,000 tons in the
rest of the province. In 1978, OPVN bought 6,600 tons of millet and 15,600
tons of sorghum domestically plus an additional 15,000 tons of sorghum in
Kano (Nigeria) for redistribution through the country. In general, OPVN
actions have a mitigating effect on price fluctuations. The Societe
Nigerienne d'Arachide (SONARA para 1.05), a mixed venture with 90% Government
capital and 10% private participation, markets groundnuts and since 1975/76
cowpeas as well. It buys from cooperatives and the merchants who are its
stockholders, and treats and stores the crop until delivery for export or
local processing. SONARA owns about 40% of the shelling and oil extraction
facility (SICONIGER) in Maradi, and has recently installed a shell compacting
plant in Dosso for fuel production.   Cowpeas are being exported to Kano
(Nigeria), where there is an absorption capacity estimated at 60,000 tons.
Marketed groundnut volumes in Maradi province dropped sharply from 15,600
tons in 1974/75 to 800 tons in 1975/76, and have averaged 6,200 tons over
the past three years. Cowpeas marketing is extremely irregular: 20,200
tons in 1976/77, 1,600 tons in 1977/78, and 11,500 tons in 1978/79. Since
there is no private market, all cotton production is purchased by UNCC at
official prices. In 1977/78 cotton production in Maradi province amounted
to only 350 tons of seed cotton or 9% of the national production, which
fluctuated between 3,800 and 11,000 tons over the past years. Ginning is
carried out by the Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres



- 10 -
Textiles (CFDT), a French semipublic company, in three ginning mills, one
of them being located in Maradi; the total ginning capacity of 20,000 tons
(of which 4,000 tons at Maradi) is heavily underutilized. Lint is sold as
first priority to the Societe Nouvelle Nigerienne des Textiles (SONITEXTIL),
the country's sole cotton mill which has an absorption capacity of 2,000
tons/year. Societe Nigerienne de Commercialisation des Primeurs (SONIPRIM
para 1.05) handles all exports of fruits and vegetables from Niger; in
1978, exports amounted to 1,000 tons. SONIPRIM's action remains presently
limited in scope because refrigeration capacity is inadequate, but plans
have been drawn for its expansion. SONIPRDM has also started a program to
manage the production of vegetables through contracts with farmers: the
latter receive one half of the harvest proceeds, the other half being
retained as a recovery premium for the inputs delivered at no charge.
Livestock marketing is managed through a traditional private system
in which herdowners sell stock either directly or through professional
collection agents to large traders. There are 49 livestock markets through-
out the project area, the principal ones being Maradi, Mayahi, Tessaoua and
Aguie.
2.11      Road and Communication.  The city of Maradi is the market center
for central Niger and for trade between Niger and Nigeria (see Map 14531).
Maradi and Kano are linked by a 250 km paved road (the 50 km in Niger
having been improved with Bank Group assistance). The road links with
Niamey, about 665 km, and with Zinder, about 237 km, are paved and in
good condition. Maradi is also linked by air with Niamey, with twice -
weekly flights, and with some of the other main cities, Zinder, Agades, Arlit
and Tahoua. In the project area, Maradi is linked to the four district
capitals, Guidan-Roumji, Madarounfa, Aguie, and Tessaoua, by paved roads
which are usually well maintained. From the principal west-east axis (RNI),
several hundred kilometers of tracks reach most of the main population
centers. Only 224 km are surfaced with laterite, and driving on most of
this network is best done with four-wheel-drive vehicles. However, quite
heavily populated areas may be as far as 50 km or more from a laterite or
paved road. This problem is, however, being dealt with under the Feeder
Roads Project (Cr. 886-NIR).
2.12      Power, Water, Health Services and Schools.  Power is provided to
Maradi City by Societe Nigerienne d'Electricite (NIGELEC), a state-owned
company, through two diesel generators of 1,000 and 1,250 kw capacity; a
third 1,250 kw unit has been ordered. Since the city consumption is
estimated at about 1,000 kw and the project future requirement at about
500 kw, a large security margin would exist. Tessaoua has only a small
diesel generator, and no electrification is planned in the project area,
except for the city of Aguie. As for water supply, Maradi and Tessaoua are
equipped with tubewells and pipe supplies at least to public water fountains.
The medical infrastructure of the project area is poor; one hospital, 14
doctors (12 expatriates), five maternity hospitals, and 17 rural dispensaries.
Only 172 villages, or 16% of the total, benefit from medical help; 136 have
both first-aid volunteers and midwives, 27 midwives only, and nine first-aid
volunteers only. With the help of the first project, about 287 first aid
volunteers and 377 midwives were trained. It is estimated that 8% of the
population is literate and that 15,000 children (18% of the youth population)
attend primary schools. There are three high schools (CEG) in the project



- il -
area with about 1,500 students, and it is planned to have one high school
per district in 1981. Maradi has the only technical high school in the
province. With the participation of the first project (Cr. 608-NIR), an
adult literacy program has been operating satisfactorily for three years
and the number of centers was raised from 77 in 1976 to 180 in 1979. The
number of literates trained by the project increased from 1,133 in 1977 to
3,422 in 1978.
D. Land Use and Farm Income
2.13      Data Base.  Available information on land use, farm sizes and crop
and livestock production is incomplete, sometimes contradictory, and subject
to vide margins of error. One of the functions of the project monitoring
and evaluation unit will be to provide more satisfactory basic information,
and the project would retain sufficient flexibility to take account of such
findings.
2.14      The statistics in Table 2.1 are given primarily as a basis for
comparison of cropping patterns and revenues of the project area districts.
The derived farm sizes could not be retained for the project since they
largely diverge from the 1960 and 1977 agricultural surveys carrîed out by
the Planning Ministry, and from the survey conducted by consultants in
coordination with the project management in early 1979.
2.15      Farm Structure.  Almost all farms in the project area are small
traditional farms in the sense that food for home consumption is the first
priority in farm decision making and nearly all field work is done manually
by family labor.  In the northern part of the project area the average farm
size is 5.44 ha and in the south 5.33 ha. The Hausa farming type (para
2.04) allows women to work both in the family fields and in their own fields.
In the latter, they are responsible for all decisions whilst in the family
fields decisions are made by the family chief. Women usually work only four
days in the family fields and the remaining three days are devoted to domestic
work, fuel wood and water supply, food preparation and work in their own
fields. This priority accorded to family fields makes improvement of the
individual plots difficult because these fields are generally planted too late
and are inadequately maintained. Family holdings are usually fraFmented into
a number of plots; this trend is accelerated by the breaking up of the tradi-
tional Hausa family (domestic group) into nuclear families, which makes it
increasingly difficult to define what constitutes a farming unit.  In this new
situation vomen keep the right to cultivate their own plots. Distribution of
fields causes much loss of time.
2.16      Crop Production.  The main crops are millet, sorghum, cowpeas and
groundnuts. Other rainfed crops include voandzou (voandzeia subterranea a
leguminous crop similar to groundnuts) maize, cassava, sweet potatoes,
sesame and cotton. In addition, vegetables, cotton, lady fingers, tobacco
and fruits are grown in the Goulbi de Maradi flood plain either through
flood recession or bucket irrigation. While the summary production data in
Table 2.1 can only provide a basis for comparing cropping trends, they show
that millet and sorghum cover about 75% of the planted area, but also that

they are often mixed with other crops. Five types of intercropping are
practiced in the project area - millet/cowpeas, millet/sorghum, millet/sor-
ghum/cowpeas, millet/ sorghum/cowpeas/groundnuts, and millet/groundnuts.
Two cultural practices usually observed are the east/west orientation of
planting lines, and ridging at weeding time in order to retain rainwater
and reduce erosion. Since field preparation is limited to a simple clearing
which can be extended over time, the biggest labor constraints are at planting,
weeding and harvesting time. Planting is in holes, is widely spaced,
spread over various plots, and staggered over the planting season. Plant
population in traditional fields is about 4,000 holes/ha, i.e. 40% of the
recommended density by INRAN. Depending on rainfall and early plant growth,
the farmers then choose which field to weed. By harvest time, some fields
vill have been totally abandoned, others will have received only one weeding,
yet others will have been carefully maintained right through the season.
Millet, the basic food, always receives priority at sowing time, the other
crops being sown later. Oxen-drawn cultivation has made slow progress in
the project area where, as yet, about 1,600 equipment sets have been sold. In
spite of the high cost of equipment and oxen and the short reimbursement
period of three years, there is an unsatisfied demand for work oxen, carts and
some animal-drawn implements.
2.17      Livestock Production.  There are about 216,000 cattle, 919,000
small stock and about 70,000 horses, donkeys and camels in the project
area. The cattle are all zebu type, primarily Bororo and Azawak, the latter
being promoted by the Livestock Department because it is well suited for
fattening, milk production and animal traction. Animal health is under
control, as there have been no significant losses from contagious diseases
for many years. A vaccination program against cattle plague, pasteurellosis,
pleuropneumonia and blackleg is successfully carried out by the ongoing
project (Cr. 608-NIR), with about 320,000 vaccinations a year. Although
many crop farmers are also livestock owners, the integration of livestock
and crop farming is still very limited. A modest link is obtained through
agreements between herdsmen and farmers to let animals graze crop residues
and fertilize the fields. The use of crop residue for feeding animals kept
in the farmers' compounds is developing quickly throughout the project
area. The total annual production from cattle and small stock is estimated
at about 4,000 ton liveweight. Eggs and poultry production is widespread
throughout the area, and almost exclusively handled by women; its importance
is not known.
2.18.          Farm Income.  Reflecting as much as possible the farming
pattern of the project area, twn average types of farming have been determined
on the basis of the Ministry of Planning and project management findings.
The net income from rainfed crops is estimated at CFAF 88,000 (US$400) in
the north, for a family of 9.3 persons and CFAF 98,000 (US$445) in the south,
for a family of 6.7 persons. These differences reflect land fertility and
climatic conditions.  Although significant locally, income from the flood
plain fields is a minor determinant of farm income at district or province
level. Income from cattle for slaughter amounts to a total of CFAF 2
billions (US$9.1 million) for the project area and would increase the



- 14 -
family revenue by about 22%, but due to the practice of transhumance this
estimate lacks precision. It is also likely that cattle ownership is
distributed more unevenly than land ownership and small stock ovnership for
which there is no data available.
2.19      TarRet Groups.  The 1980 rural population of the project area in
estimated at 63,500 familles, of which 75% in the northern districts of
Aguie, Tessaoua and Guidan RoumJi and 25% in the southern district of
Madarounfa. There are many similarities in farm size, crops, farming prac-
tices, and income between north and south; but the larger family size and
lover yields in the northern districts create a high discrepancy in net per
capita annual incomes from crop production, decreasing from CFAF 14,600
(US$70) in the south, to CFAF 9,500 (US$45) in the north. To this must be
added income from animal husbandry and from non-agricultural activities.
Together, these activities would increase per capita income from crop produc-
tion by more than 50% in the Maradi province. Cereal production of a northern
farm would ensure only 170 kg per person/year, 23% less than the 220 kg
estimated consumption in the southern district, which, hovever, seems to be an
excessively high estimate. During project implementation, all the rural
population of the project area would have access to extension services, input
supply and credit services.
III. TEE FIRST MARADI RURAL DEVELOPHENT PROJECT (Cr. 608-NIR)
A. Objectives and Design
3.01      The project was designed to implement Government's policy aimed at
making better use of the potential in both rainfed agriculture and livestock
production and at introducing controlled irrigation in the area. The project
vas appraised in 1975, became effective on October 6, 1976, and vas opera-
tional for the 1977/78 growing season, one year later than expected.
3.02      Project Description.  The project comprises:  (a) provision of
production packages--extension, applied research, credit, and input supply--
aimed at the improvement of the productivity of groundnuts, millet and covpeas
grown by about 37,500 farm families. By PY3, it was expected that the project
would have been extended ta about 25% of the balance of about 210,000 ha; (b)
strengthening of cooperative institutions; (c) expansion of educational and
training programs, including the implementation of a Centre de Promotion
Rurale (CPR), in each of the 15 ALCs to train young farmers and a functional
literacy program among the project area community; (d) improvement, expansion
and transformation of the Centre de Formation des Jeunes Agriculteurs (C.F.J.A.)
into a training center for extension agents with a training capacity of 100
trainees and the provision of training scholarships for project personnel; (e)
study of the optimum means of developing the irrigation potential of the
Goulbi de Maradi; (f) pilot development of irrigation in the Goulbi de Maradi
through exploitation of the Goulbi's underground vater resources; (g) construc-
tion of 80 km feeder roads to provide communications vithin a fertile, but
hitherto isolated, sector of the project area; (h) planting of 500 ha of trées
in fuel wood plantations; (i) improvement of livestock services in the project
area and preparation of a livestock development project; (j) provision of
credit for the purchase of livestock by pastoralists who lost their herds during



- 15 -
the sahelian drought; and (k) establishment of a project evaluation unit to
establish and record the economic and social impact of the project.
3.03      The project was carried out over a three-year investment period,
1977-79, by a ProJect Management Unit (PMU) established for this purpose.
During the first year, the project area was limited to the district of
Madarounfa; in PY2, it was extended over two additional districts, those of
Aguie and Tessaoua. It was estimated at appraisal that project activities
would reach 15 "Local Cooperative Associations" (ALC), 150 primary coopera-
tives, 750 villages, and some 37,500 rural families.
3.04      Project Costs.   Project costs, net of import duties and other
clearly identifiable taxes, were estimated at appraisal to total CFAF 2,670
million (US$11.9 million), of which the foreign exchange component would
have been US$5.9 million or 50%. Construction costs of the irrigation
schemes assumed that the labor needed in these operations would be provided
by the prospective users, who would be prepared to work for half the
minimum daily wage for rural areas. Physical and price contingencies
amounted to CFAF 570 million (US$2.5 million) or 24% of base costs including
taxes. An IDA credit of US$10.7 million was concluded to finance 90% of total
project costs excluding import duties and other identifiable taxes.   The
credit was to cover the foreign cost estimated at US$5.9 million, and 81%
of local costs excluding import duties and other identifiable taxes.  The
remaining 10% of project costs, and the taxes estimated at 10% of total
project costs, or a total of US$2.5 million, was to be met by Government.
To ensure the efficient and timely execution of the project, assurances
were obtained from Government that it would deposit an initial amount
of CFAF 125 million into the Project's Bank account, and that it would
replenish the account quarterly. Retroactive financing by IDA of up to
US$0.3 million was approved to finance expansion of the extension workers'
training center and to initiate the seed multiplication program for the
1977 cultivation season.
3.05      Organization and Management.  A Project Management Unit (PMU),
headed by a Project Manager, was to be responsible for day-to-day project
implementation. On the organigram, the Unit reports to the Prefet, who in
turn is accountable to the Conseil National du Developpement (CND). Annual
work programs and budgets are prepared by PMU and approved by the Prefet and
the Minister of Rural Development.  Coordination between PMU and other Gov-
ernmental activities in the Departement de Maradi is assured by the Prefet,
assisted by a committee comprised of all the heads of Government services in
the Departement, including the Project General Manager. Coordination at the
national level is carried out by the Minister of Rural Development.
3.06      As the project is the first phase of a development program for
the Departement, PMU activities initially covered only part of the Departe-
ment's area. Existing services, agricultural and social, continued to be
extended to other parts of the Departement. Consequently, there arose two
distinct services operating in the Departement: the Project Service, under
which project activities have been extended, and the regular Government
services which operate outside the project area.



- 16 -
3.07      PMU was conceived as a four section unit, with section heada
reporting to the Project Manager: (a) the Administrative Section, responsible
for project accounting, staff administration, financial arrangements for
agricultural credit and for crop marketing, and project evaluation; (b) the
Technical Operations Section, responsible for planning and implementing
either directly or indirectly all physical aspects of the project; the
Technical Operations Section comprises five subsections: Rural Engineering,
General Agriculture, Seed Multiplication, Applied Research, Extension Staff
Training and Blacksmith Training; (c) The Cooperative Affaire Section,
responsible for cooperative development, staff secondment to cooperatives,
delivery of inputs, crop marketing, and audit of cooperative accounts;
and (d) the Community Development Section, responsible for all actions
involving the motivation of rural communities to participate in the project,
and training programs for rural people in cooperative activities, functional
literacy, health and mid-wifery.
3.08      The Project's headquarters are at Maradi, with bran$hes in three
of the six districts that comprise the Departement. Each branch is staffed
by a representative of the four Headquarters Sections, one of whom is
appointed by the Project Manager as Branch Manager. The branches are
supposed to liaise closely with the Arrondissement administration to
achieve at this lover level the same type of cooperation and coordination
as provided at the Departement level. The branches are responsible for
assisting and supervising the activities of those of the Departement's 15
ALCs that are located in their Arrondissement. PMU staff representation
at the ALC and individual cooperative levels depends upon the degree of
development of each ALC.
B. Experience of the First Two Years
3.09      As the project had to start from scratch, an entirely new organiza-
tion was created, which, at the beginning, faced problems related to staff
secondment and working relations with the Government agencies and represen-
tatives at province level. After two difficult years, the Project Management
Unit became well established and accepted. The project has been well
managed, accounting has been satisfactory and the financial situation remains
sound.
3.10      After only two years, several targets have been achieved: (a) the
Cooperative Development Program was extended over 812 Mutual Guarantee
Groups (GMV), grouped into 82 cooperatives and 15 Local Cooperative Asso-
ciations (ALC). (b) The training center equipment was improved and buildings
were extended to house 100 extension agent trainees per year. (c) Each of
the 15 ALCs, which were established one year ahead of schedule, was equipped
with a Rural Promotion Center (CPR) for giving a nine-month training course
for selected young farmers and their spouses. For the CPR, results achieved
in two years are highly promising from the viewpoint of both agriculture and
training; yields in the CPRs have almost doubled in two years, thus permitting
a significant increase of seed multiplication production, research plots were



- 1 7 -
successfully carried out, and about 300 young farmers are currently being
trained every year in agriculture with additional training in literacy,
health, nutrition and small farming activities. (d) About 400 demonstration
plots were set up by farmers each year and have confirmed the high response to
the proposed package of improved cultural methods (+95% for millet and +101%
for groundnuts in the first two years). Results were even better in 1979/80
when rain distribution was very favorable (+122% for millet, +158% for ground-
nuts and +219% for cowpeas) and show that an important potential exists for
increasing rainfed production in years of satisfactory rainfall, provided that
an efficient extension and input supply service is established to promote
these methods. (e) The road, health, livestock, research and functional
literacy components were carried out successfully and have met the appraisal
estimates.
3.11      The project also showed some weaknesses:  (a) the extension ser-
vice's achievements were modest, falling short of the appraisal targets.
At the end of the second project year (1978), 231 extension agents were
supervising 7,533 farmers (23 farmers per agent) who grew about 4,536 ha
groundnuts, 2,322 ha-millet/sorghum and 749 ha cowpeas on a total surface of
7,607 ha equal to 21% of their total acreage. Absorbed by the establishment
of the project organization and infrastructure, the PMU did not pay enough
attention to the impact of the extension service, the low efficiency of the
staff at field level, and the understaffing of the extension services at
district and ALC levels. In 1979, management has taken several measures to
remedy the situation, and a 33% increase of the improved acreage has been
attained and the number of farms reached by the extension service exceeds
appraisal estimates. This first experience has demonstrated that, due to the
farm structure and division of cultivated land into collective and individual
plots with autonomous management (para 2.07), it is almost impossible to
obtain introduction of improved cultural practices to more than a fraction of
the cultivated land, at least at this early stage. (b) The extension training
program (para 3.02 - (d)) was too ambitious and led to the recruitment of
low-level trainees; many of them (30%) had to be dismissed after the first
year of employment because of inaptitude or lack of motivation for extension
work. (c) The study of a pilot irrigation project was delayed because
government gave priority to other irrigation studies. As a consequence the
study was submitted in July 1979, too late to allow implementation of the
planned 500 ha irrigation scheme before the project's end on December 31,
1979. (d) The fuel wood plantations were reduced by about 50% due to the lack
of farmers' interest. Because of the reduced acreage grown with the use of
improved cultural practices, short-term credit amounted to 20% of the appraisal
estimates but was progressing by 50% from one year to the other. On the other
hand, medium-term credit is about 20 times higher than expected. The recovery
rate, which was low the first year, has greatly improved in 1979 and amounts
to 90% for medium-term, 80% for short-term, and 70% for groundnut seed for
which the interest rate is 50%. (e) Seed supply and quality - see para 6.02.
3.12      To date, the three-year credit is 87% disbursed; it is expected to
be fully disbursed by the end of June 1980, three years and nine months after
the effectiveness date. At the end of the second year, it appeared that two



- 18 -
credit categories had been greatly underevaluated at appraisal: (1) irrigation
through pumping at a cost of US$1,900/ha, and (2) PMU local staff salaries and
PMU operating costs. The latter costs will double due to two sharp salary
increases throughout the civil service of Niger and the necessity to increase
the number of local staff. A reallocation of credit was requested by Govern-
ment in August 1979 and approved by the Association; savings on several
components and the use of unallocated funds will ensure the normal completion
of the project except for the irrigation component and part of the fuel wood
plantations.
3.13      In retrospect, the three-year First Maradi Rural Development Project
must be considered as a successful pilot project which has laid an effective
institutional foundation, collected necessary basic data for designing the
development of the project area, trained field staff, and tested the proposed
extension themes. It is not surprising that the physical impact is still
modest as it normally takes more than three years for a project starting
from scratch to achieve a notable impact at the farm level.  The encouraging
results obtained in the third year, however, make it possible to foresee a
continuing momentum even in the absence of a follow-up project, and an economic
rate of return of about 16% (see para 8.05).
C. Special Action Credit (EEC)
3.14      The three-year implementation period of the first project ended
in December 1979, and it is expected that the proposed second project will
start in mid-1980. To ensure a smooth transition between the two projects,
Government has decided to extend the first project by six months, to June
1980. This extension will permit the improvement of training for the
extension staff and a start to be made on the irrigation work.
3.15      Financing of this period, which is an extension of the First Maradi
project (Cr. 608 NIR), is assured by both the EEC Special Action Credit and
the Government. The EEC Special Action Credit of US$2.0 million has been made
available to Niger on the same terms and conditions as the Maradi Rural Devel-
opment Credit. It partly finances (i) purchase of earth-moving equipment,
pumps and vehicles (US$0.94 million); (ii) construction of the irrigation net-
work, including on-farm development of a first section of 100 ha and of the
electric line (US$0.66 million); and (iii) services of internationally-
recruited staff for the Project Management Unit (US$0.25 million), including a
foreman and a chief-mechanic to strengthen the irrigation section and a train-
ing specialist to design and launch a new extension staff training program.
An amount of US$0.15 million is unallocated. During the same period (January
1 to June 30, 1980), the Government will finance the project operating costs
estimated at about CFAF 500 million (US$2.4 million). During the intermediate
six-month period, all project activities will continue at the 1979 level.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Summary Description
4.01      The objectives of the proposed project are in accordance with
Government's policies of increasing agricultural production and extending
irrigation to improve farm incomes and the general welfare of the
rural population.  The project will be a follow-up and an extension of the
ongoing Maradi Rural Development Project (para 3.02).  The main specific
objectives are to increase production of cereals, cowpeas and groundnuts
and thereby the income of 63,000 farmers in the rainfed area, to increase
cotton, vegetables and staple production and thereby income security for
2,600 farmers through the development of an irrigation scheme, and to
strengthen and improve the existing project organization. To achieve these
objectives, the project will finance the following items:
(a) expansion of improved cultural practices in rainfed farming areas;
(b) training the extension staff in line with the "Training and Visit
System" adapted to local conditions;
(c) agricultural credit for the purchase of incremental inputs and
farm equipment;
(d) development of 740 ha (net) of irrigation (bringing the total
to 1,000 ha or 840 ha net including the 100 ha developed under
the Special Action Credit);
(e) construction and equipment of an irrigation center, construc-
tion of a new CPR and additional buildings for the extension
of 19 CPRs and the training center;
(f) applied agricultural research;
(g) a seed multiplication program;
(h)  development of functional literacy and health programs and mainte-
nance activities for the wood plantations and livestock programs
financed under Cr. 608-NIR;
(i)  technical assistance to the PMU; and
(j) a project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.
The project will also contribute to the financing of technical assistance
and equipment for a Central Technical Monitoring and Evaluation Unit to be
established at the ministry level in Niamey.
4.02      The project will be implemented over a five-year period from
July 1980 to June 1985.

B. Detailed Features
4.03      Rainfed Farming.  The project intervention would improve the
agricultural practices of approximately 63,000 smallholders, who would
adopt the use of improved and treated seed on about 87,000 ha; of these,
26,000 smallholders would adopt the use of higher density plant populations
and fertilizers on about 45,000 ha. Nearly 10% of the latter will be equipped
with animal-drawn equipment. Details of inputs and estimated yields are given
at Annex 2, Table 1, and the main project inputs are summarized at Table 4.1.
The existing extension staff will continue to be trained using the "Training
and Visit System" adapted to local conditions in the sense that it is difficult
to clearly separate the extension work from input supply. The extension
structure will be reorganized by the strengthening of supervision staff and
the introduction of more efficient working schedules to allow close supervision
of the extension work at all levels. With the extension of the activities
over a fourth district of the Maradi province, the project area vould cover
most of the province's area south of the 550 mm isohyet (Map Slo. 14531). Two
types of farming will be considered according to differences in rainfall and
soil conditions. The establishment of an efficient extension and training
service and of an adequate and timely input supply system will be critical to
the success of the project.
4.04      Training.  For that purpose the project will benefit from the
"Centre de Formation des Jeunes Agriculteurs" (CFJA) and its 120 ha farm which
has been reorganized and improved under Cr. 608-NIR. About 300 extension staff
members will receive an annual three-week retraining course during the dry
season and several short refresher courses (2 days) during the growing period.
The center will also carry out training sessions organized by the cooperative
training division, the seed multiplication service, the evaluation unit,
and other training sessions within the project.   In spite of the low consump-
tion of pesticides in the project area, extension staff will be trained in safe
and effective pest control methods. All training activities will be managed
by the Training Division. Courses will be given by senior agricultural staff
from the project, the Department of Agriculture at Maradi, the research
station of Tarna, the research organizations INRAN-IRAT-IRHO, and by the Kolo
Agricultural Training Institute. During the growing season about 50 boarders
will be trained annually for extension work to meet: (1) irrigation staff
requirements; (2) necessary replacement of extension agents; and (3) the
need for skilled extension agents in the northern districts of the Maradi
province not included in the project area. The admission of new extension
agent trainees to the CFJA will be contingent upon full literacy or an ele-
mentary school education. The admission age will be maintained at 22/25
years in order to recruit more stable trainees with greater experience in
agriculture. The CFJA will also continue to train 30 blacksmiths per year
in its special section (created in 1978). The "Centre de Promotion Rurale"
(CPR) program will be completed with the construction of an additional center
in the Guidan-Roumji district. At Madarounfa the CPR cropping area will be
extended to include an irrigated plot. Each of the 20 CPRs is established on
a 30 ha farm where 20 young farmers are trained with their wives over a
nine-month period. They receive practical training in the fields and attend
evening classes on farming practices, functional literacy, health, nutri-
tion, and small-farm animal raising. At the end of the training period,

the trainees are entitled to apply for a medium-term credit to buy a set of
animal-drawn machinery. They will be integrated into the extension system as
demonstration and "contact" farmers and receive special attention from the
extension staff. All technical and theoretical training programs and all
operating rules will be established by the Training Division.
4.05      Input Supply and Credit.  At Government's request a study is
presently being carried out by French aid to prepare a new and efficient
system of input supply at the national level. To ensure adequate financing for
the project a Farm Supplies Fund (FSF) will be created. The project will
supply inputs and farm equipment through the FSF, administered by CNCA on
behalf of the project. The estimated input requirements over the project life
are: 8,300 tons of triple superphosphate; 4,500 tons of urea; 1.2 million
fungicide packets; 118,000 liters of insecticides; and farm equipment, includ-
ing about 1,500 sprayers and 2,500 animal-drawn sets and oxen. The Project
Management Unit's (PMU) Cooperative Support Division will secure inputs with
funds from the FSF. Inputs and equipment will be distributed on credit in
kind to farmers through their respective Mutual Guarantee Groups (GMV). The
UNCC will, on behalf of CNCA, organize the accounting of the credits granted
to the farmers by the GMV and credit repayments. CNCA will assume credit
risks to GMV with Government guaranty. Credit terms and conditions will be
consistent with those laid down by the Monetary Union of West Africa. The
rate of short-term agricultural credit for seasonal inputs is currently 9.5
percent. Loans for farm equipment will be repayable over four years, also at
9.5 percent a year. Since annual inflation for the last three years was not
less than 15 percent, and it is expected to remain at this level in the near
future, there is consequently an indirect subsidy element in the Government's
rate policy for agricultural credit.
4.06      Irrigation Development.  The project will develop the irrigation
component prepared under Cr. 608-NIR and begun under the Special Action Credit
(para 3.14/3.16). An irrigated area will be developed over 740 ha (net)
through: drilling 54 wells (in addition to the 21 wells to be completed
under that credit); equipping tubewells with electric pumps; reinforcing the
existing electric line, and extending it to cover the whole project area;
constructing irrigation and drainage schemes and "on-farm" works; constructing
access roads to the tubewells as well as tracks for access to farms; construct-
ing a flood protection dike; and constructing offices, houses, workshop and
warehouses. The schedule of operations is shown on Chart 20663. Drilling of
tubewells will be completed in two steps, 20 wells in PY 1 and 34 wells over
PY 2 and 3. Storage basins and pumps will be progressively installed, 16 per
year in PY l and 2 and 17 per year in PY 3 and 4 and'the electric line will be
extended accordingly. The implementation of irrigated plots with irrigation
canals, drainage system and levelling will take place over four years: 180 ha
per year in PY 1 and PY 2, 190 ha per year in PY 3 and PY 4. Because of the
inexperience of local farmers, irrigation will be practiced during daytime
only but pumping will be done 20 hours a day and water will be stored in a
nearby basin. From each basin an irrigation canal (25 lls) 600 m long



- 23 -
will supply an irrigated block of about 13.6 ha gross and 11.2 ha net.
A layout of a typical irrigation block is in the Annexes, Chart no. 20664.
The irrigation canal will be lined and, every 45 m, unlined irrigation ditches
vill distribute water to the fields to limit the length of the furrows to
about 40 m. An irrigation ditch will control a 120 m long by 40 m vide plot
which would be grown under the same crop. The land vill be carefully levelled
using the "piano keys" method. A drainage system will be implemented parallel
to the irrigation system. To ensure all-weather access to the irrigated
scheme, the existing roads, Maradi-CFJA and Djiratawa-RN6, will be rehabili-
tated on about 12.6 km. About 74 km of tracks connecting the tubevells
and the roads vill be constructed. Both the access road and tracks vill be
maintained by the project. The downstream half of the project area vill be
protected from floods by a 3.2 km dike and groynes in gabions and rockfill
ripraps on about 1 km. (See Map 14533). The necessary buildings, including
a house, offices and storage facilities, will be built at Djiratava to house
the management of the irrigation scheme. Except for the drillings, all
works will be done on force account. Test drillings have been made in the
project area, and information about the water supply and drilling cost derived
therefrom is satisfactory. As a trial for a possible further extension of the
irrigated scheme, one well could be equipped with a sprinkler system.
4.07      Irrigated cultivation vill start in PY 1 over 100 ha developed
under the Special Action Credit. The area would be progressively extended
over a total of about 840 ha or about 2,600 farmers. To match the technical
requirements of water distribution, individual plots will have a gross
area of 0.38 ha (190 m by 20m) or 0.32 ha net. Each plot will be divided by
the irrigation ditches into four parts by lines of citrus fruit trees to
ensure easy control of rotation and observance of boundaries. Each 45 m vide
strip will be planted under the same crop by all farmers (see layout of a
typical irrigation block, Chart 20664). Thorny bushes (Euphorbia balsamifera)
will be planted to protect crops from wandering animals.
4.08      Construction.  Since most of the building infrastructure vas
constructed under the first project, buildings vill be limited to one
additional CPR in the Guidan-Roumji district, a shed (90 m2) and a hen
roost at the CFJA and to the irrigation center at Djiratava (para 4.06),
which would include offices (100 m2), a shed (90 m2) and a house (60 m2).
To improve the existing CPR infrastructure, 13 blocks of latrine/showers,
20 cattle sheds and four wells will be built.
4.09      Applied Research.  The project's rainfed farming activities are
based on a few simple agricultural techniques which have been proven success-
ful under the first project (see chapter VI). Nevertheless, there is still a
need for more research to identify further improvements. The applied research
sector will continue to carry out its activities on rainfed farming systems,
fertilization, seed varieties and plant protection. In addition a new
program for irrigated crops vill be conducted at the Tarna (INRAN) research
station located within the project area. It vill cover a selection of varie-
ties adapted to irrigation, fertilization, plant protection, water require-
ments and irrigation timing. The research section of the project will keep
close contact with the Tarna station and maintain research plots at the CPRs



- 24 -
and in farmers' fields according to programs designed in cooperation with the
research station. Moreover, the Tarna station will second to the project
specialized staff to control the seed multiplication program (para 4.10) and
assess the seed quality of groundnuts, millet, sorghum and cowpeas. The
station would also carry out various tests on soil, leaves or chemicals.
The study of two types of farms, one located on the plateau sandy soils and
the other in the Goulbi flood plain, will be carried out by the Tarna station
to determine the efficiency of improved farming techniques, the time devoted
to each cultural practice, and the economic impact of improved cultural
methods. The project will finance allowances and travel expenses for
research specialists and cost of small equipment, analysis and inputs.
4.10      Seed Multiplication.  The project will also finance the costs of
the seed multiplication section (Annex 2, Table 2, page 2). Production will be
controlled by the Tarna research station, which would extend its activities to
cope with the project's increasing demand for improved seeds. During the
growing season, specialists of the Tarna station will control the seed quality
in the fields in coordination with the project multiplication section and
will issue a quality label after harvesting. The seed multiplication produc-
tion vill be based on the needs of the extension development program (Annex
2, Table 5). The section will provide over the project's life about 2,120
tons of improved groundnut seed, 1,340 tons of millet and sorghum, and 160
tons of cowpeas. Multiplication programs will be carried out at CPRs, the
CFJA, and at selected multiplication centers in the project area, some of
vhich are already in operation. The seed multiplication program will cover
between 913 ha to 2,418 ha annually for groundnuts and between 636 ha to
936 ha for millet and sorghum according to the project needs. Cowpea seeds
vill be produced on 107 to 512 ha.
4.11      Functional Literacy Program.  The functional literacy program,
which reaches some of the CFJA trainees and all village level cooperative
staff, vill be extended from 247 to 375 centers over the project life. The
project will finance teachers' compensation costs in the new district of
Guidan-Roumji, the cost of the teachers' refresher courses, the equipment of
the new centers, and class stationery for all centers.
4.12      Health.  The health component, which started on a modest but
realistic scale--reaching 16% of the project area villages--will be further
developed through (a) financing of refresher courses, every two years, for
first-aid volunteers and midwives posted in the villages; (b) annual training
of 80 first-aid volunteers and 80 midwives; and (c) financing of the supervi-
sion costs of the staff at village level.
4.13      Fuel Wood Plantations and Livestock.  In the light of past exper-
ience, promotion of tree plantations will be limited to the maintenance
of the existing village fuel wood plantations over about 120 ha, the creation
of five plantations at the new CPRs in the district of Guidan-Roumji, and the
production and distribution of trees to be planted around houses in the
villages. Since livestock development in the area will be carried out by a
separate Bank-financed project (Cr. 885-NIR), the project will limit its
activities to the promotion of milk production through financing the purchase
of 250 cows on credit over five years.



- 25 -
4.14      Technical Assistance.  Due to the shortage of trained and experi-
enced staff with the ability to initiate and implement a development program
including irrigation works, the project will finance additional technical
assistance. A monitoring and evaluation specialist, a training specialist,
an accountant, a works and equipment section chief, and a chief mechanic will
be recruited to start the initial work and train local staff. In addition
the expatriate staff assisting the first Maradi Project will continue to
be employed: the staff are shown in Table 5.1 (para 507).
4.15      Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.  The project will finance this
Unit. An expatriate will be appointed to manage it until a Nigerien is
trained abroad to take over and would then assist him until the project end.
The staff will be strengthened, trained and reorganized to meet project
needs.
4.16      Central Technical Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.  At the request of
the Ministry of Rural Development the project will participate in financing
the implementation of a Central Technical Monitoring and Evaluation Unit at
the ministry level. The Government considers it essential to implement such a
Unit in order to monitor, evaluate and coordinate all project activities
throughout the country. It will gather data from the project evaluation units
and make parallel surveys and checking through its enumerator staff. The
administrative and financial coordinator for Bank-financed agricultural
projects who was appointed under Cr. 851-NIR has proven useful and his
operating costs will be integrated into the Central Unit. The Association
will participate in financing one technical assistant and the equipment for
the Unit; Government will finance local staff and operating costs; and the
French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) will provide one junior and one
senior evaluation specialist. Terms of reference will be discussed with
Government and other financiers before implementation.
4.17      Implementation Schedule.  Rainfed activities would be a follow up
and an extension of the ongoing project and no critical steps are foreseen.
Critical steps for the irrigation component, contracts for drilling, construc-
tion of the power line and purchase of pumps, will be taken under the Special
Action Credit. The implementation of the irrigation scheme by force account
will require particular attention during supervision, since this is a new
activity for project management.
C. Cost Estimates
4.18      Total project costs for the five-year implementation period mid-
1980-1985 are estimated at CFAF 9.96 billion (US$47.5 million) with a foreign
exchange component of 44% (Table 4.2). Project costs exclude duties and
identifiable taxes, which Government has agreed to waive. Base cost estimates
reflect mid-1980 prices since the expected date of project effectiveness is
July 1980. 1980 prices result in a 11% upward revision of 1979 prices.
Physical contingencies include 14% for the irrigation component, 5% for
vehicles and 10% for all other expenditures, but no provision for staff since
specifications and quantities are clearly established. Expected price
increases amount to 23% of project base costs and are compounded at the
following annual rate: 8% for civil works; 9% for the irrigation component;

8% for vehicles and equipment; 10% for expatriate staff; 15% for local staff
and local expenses in line with inflation rates in recent years; 7% for all
other expenditures. Project costs are summarized at Annex 2, Tables 8 and 9.
Since the total number of project beneficiaries, for both rainfed and irrigated
production, is estimated at 63,000 farm families, the cost of the project per
family will amount to about US$735. The investment of the irrigation component
financed under the project (740 ha) is estimated at US$8 million (without
price increase). A part of the investment (equipment and on-farm works) has
been absorbed, however, under the Special Action Credit; including these
costs, investment per ha without price increases amounts to US$12,000 and
cost per family to US$3,900. For the rainfed component the cost of project
services including incremental inputs is estimated, without price increases,
at US$30.3 million or US$480 per farm family. The total cost of the irriga-
tion component is estimated at US$10.2 million, and the total cost of the
rainfed component at US$36.1 million.
D. Proposed Financing
4.19      It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$16.7 million be made to
Government on standard terms to finance 35% of total project costs. The
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the French Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) will contribute US$12 million
and US$7 million respectively. The terms of IFAD and CCCE loans are to be
agreed between these organizations and the Government. Fulfillment of
conditions preceding initial disbursement of IFAD and CCCE loans will be a
condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit. Total external financing
will be US$35.7 million or 75% of total costs covering 100% of foreign
exchange costs (US$20.8 million) and 56% of local costs (US$14.90 million).
Niger will contribijte 25% of total costs or US$11.8 million,
of which Government would contribute US$10.3 million to finance:
(i) 11% of the investment expenditures including 100% of initial
expenses, wood plantations, animals and working capital
(US$1.25 million);
(ii)  part of the credit for incremental inputs and farm equipment
(US$1.90 million) and all subsidies for incremental inputs
and farm equipment (US$1.85 million);
(iii) 100% of Government-paid civil servants employed by the project
(US$2.6 million) and 23% of local staff hired by the project
(US$1.4 million); and
(iv) 14% of the price contingencies (US$1.3 million).
The CCCE will finance (a) 26% of the investment expenditures i.e. irrigation
works for US$1.9 million (including US$0.8 million for technical assistance)
and vehicles and equipment for US$1.05 million, (b) 14% of the operating



- 28 -
costs (US$2.75 million), including US$1.8 million for expatriate staff, and
(c) 14% of the provision for price increase (US$1.3 million). The cost to be
borne by the CCCE contribution includes the total cost of the Evaluation Unit
in Maradi (US$0.8 million). IFAD will finance the balance of US$28.7 million
of the total project cost pari passu with IDA on a 3-4 ratio. Farmers, as
beneficiaries of the project, will contribute US$1.5 million through (a) cash
payment of agricultural equipment (US$0.05 million), and (b) water charges to
be paid for irrigated production (US$1.45 million). Table 4.3 presents the
uses and sources of funds for the project including the Central Technical
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit. The financing plan is detailed at Annex 2,
Table 10, and sunmmarized below:

4.20      To ensure the efficient and timely implementation of the project,
Government will establish two separate revolving funds to prefinance project
activities as follows: (i) a Farm Supplies Fund with CNCA for prefinancing
procurement of inputs, with an opening line of credit of CFAF 200 million; and
(ii) a Special Project Account with the National Development Bank (BDRN), for
prefinancing all project operating costs with a line of credit of CFAF 150
million. Establishment of these revolving funds with the lines of credit will
be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that:
(a) the Farm Supplies Fund will be augmented by Government with
an additional line of credit of CFAF 220 million before
September 30, 1981; subsidies on inputs for PY 1 and PY 2
are included in these amounts;
(b) subsidies on inputs to be distributed for the agricultural
season of PY 3, 4 and 5 would be paid by Government into the
same Farm Supplies Fund before September 30 of each year
starting with 1982;
(c)  all receipts from farmers' cash purchases, down payments on
items acquired on medium-term credit and all receipts from
short and medium-term loan repayments would be kept in the
Farm Supplies Fund, beginning on September 30, 1980;
(d) any shortfall in seasonal and medium-term loan repayments and
price increases on non-incremental inputs would be paid by
Government into the Farm Supplies Fund by September 30 of each
year, beginning in 1980; and
(e) the Special Project Account (ii) would be replenished as
needed each quarter by an amount sufficient to cover the needs
of the project for the following three month period on the
basis of cash forecasts made by project management.
E. Procurement and Disbursement
4.21      Procurement of equipment, farm implements, inputs and tubewell
drillings amounting to about US$14.3 million will be through international
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines in the case of contracts
over US$100,000, and through competitive bidding in accordance with local
procedures acceptable to IDA, for contracts less than US$100,000 (amounting to
about US$1 million). For contracts of less than US$30,000, competitive
shopping will be employed (approximately US$0.7 million).   Wells would be
drilled and pumps acquired under existing contracts let under the Special
Action Credit and through international competitive bidding procedures (approx-
imately US$2.4 million). The electric power line would be constructed by the
national utility company (NIGELEC) under a negotiated contract satisfactory to
the Association (US$0.7 million).   For civil works (US$0.5 million for
buildings) contracts will be through local competitive bidding. The services



- 31 -
of internationally-recruited staff including the technical assistance for the
irrigation component (estimated costs, US$8.1 million) vill be obtained
following procedures acceptable to IDA. Part of the irrigation vorks (about
US$3.4 million) will be done by force account. Force account will be used for
irrigation development since (1) the EEC Special Action Credit has provided
adequate equipment and staff to extend the works; (2) there are no skilled
local contractors for this type of work; (3) works are impossible to plan
since they depend on vell output and therefore the irrigated area per vell is
unknown.
4.22      Input orders to be procured through the project account vill
include both incremental and non-incremental quantities and vill be subject
to the procurement procedures specified at para 4.21.
4.23      Disbursements of the IDA credit will be against import documenta-
tion and certified records of expenditures. For disbursements made against
certified records of expenditures estimated at about US$3.0 million(category
7), documentation vill not be submitted for review by IDA, but for review by
the financial coordinator for the IDA-financed agricultural projects based in
Niamey (see para 4.24). Once certified by the coordinator, a full copy of
this documentation will be retained at his office for scrutiny by IDA missions.
A schedule of disbursements is at Annex 2, Tables 11 and 12. The,proceeds of
the IDA credit will be disbursed against the following items:
Category 1 - Civil works/buildings, 58% of total expenditures
(US$0.3 million)
Category 2 - Irrigation works, 54% of total expenditures
(US$1.9 million)
Category 3 - Vehicles and equipment, 45% of total expenditures
(US$1.6 million)
Category 4 - Incremental agricultural credit program, 25% of
expenditures (US$1.5 million)
Category 5 - Expatriate staff and technical assistance of the
irrigation component, 30% of total expenditures
(US$1.9 million)
Category 6 - Audit and Surveys, 39% of total expenditures
(US$0.6 million)
Category 7 - PMU local staff and other operating costs, 40%
of total expenditures (US$6.2 million)
Category 8 - Central Technical Monitoring and Evaluation Unit in
Niamey, 58% of total expenditures (US$0.7 million)
Category 9 - Unallocated (US$2.0 million).

F. Accounts and Audit
4.24      The accounts of the project's firet phase are satisfactorily kept
and audited and the project's Administrative, Commercial and Financial Depart-
ment vill continue to be responsible for keeping project records in accor-
dance with sound accounting practices. Audited balance sheets reflecting the
project's operational and financial position vill be submitted to IDA annually.
During negotiations Government gave assurances that: (a) project accounts
vould continue to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (b)
the audit report would be submitted to IDA within four months of the end of the
project financial year; and (c) the report of the auditor would be of such
scope and in such detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a statement
as to whether or not IDA funds had been used for their intended purpose. The
financial coordinator for the IDA-financed agricultural projects, whose salary
18 paid under credit 851-NIR, vill provide technical assistance to the project
in accounting and financial management, coordinate disbursement applications
and monitor financial reporting and auditing.
V.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Prolect Management
5.01      The Project Management Unit (PMU), already in place, has proven its
ability. It will be maintained with some changes, to increase its efficiency,
and its responsibilities will be extended over the district of Guidan-Roumji.
Under the Minister of Rural Development, the Project General Manager will be
responsible for planning, managing and supervising all project activities.
Re vould prepare and forward by May 31 of each year his annual work program
and budget to Government and IDA for approval. The Project General Manager
vill be a member of the Comite Technique Departemental (COTEDEP). Coordina-
tion between PMU and other governmental activities in Maradi province would be
assured by the Governor.
5.02      Activities directly carried out by the PMU vill be organized into
two departments, the structure of which is described in Chart 20666. The
only exception is the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, which will be directly
attached to the General Manager's Office. Project annual and quarterly
progress reports would be regularly forwarded to the Association, and assur-
ances were obtained at negotiations that within six months of the project
closing date, PMU would prepare a project completion report.
5.03      As the project area will cover only four of the six administra-
tive districts of Maradi province, the existing agricultural and social
services vill continue to be extended to other parts of the province.
Consequently, there vill be two distinct services operating in the province,
i.e. the Project Services under which project activities will be extended
(para 4.01), and the regular government services which will operate outside
the project area. To avoid duplication in the project area, the project will



- 33 -
carry out all extension and training activities related to production and for
applied research and seed multiplication, vill coordinate and cooperate vith
the existing government organizations. The Irrigation and Civil Works Division
vill become a branch of the Office National des Amenagements Hydro-Agricoles
(ONARA). Assurances vere obtained at negotiations that the General Manager of
the Maradi Project would be the ONARA representative for Maradi province. The
cooperative division vould pursue its activities and provide additional train-
ing to the existing organization ln cooperation with UNCC. Other subproject
activities, i.e. health, functional literacy, forestry and livestock, will be
carried out by the respective government services operating at the province
level, and the use of funds vill be monitored by the Project General Manager.
5.04      The project'headquarters vill be located at Maradi and will have a
representative in each of the four administrative districts (sous-prefectures)
of the project area. At present, the project's district representatives
coordinate all project activities at the sous-prefecture level and liaise vith
administrative officials; therefore, they have little time left for effective
field work. Assurances vere obtained at negotiations that in the future, they
will be assisted by an extension assistant whose activities would be strictly
limited to assisting and supervising the sector chiefs. Each district extension
assistant will supervise an average of eight sector chiefs. For each ALC, the
sector chiefs will be grouped at the CPR level and will have responsibility
over an average of eight extension agents. The project would also establish
an irrigation subcenter at Djiratawa to assist and supervise all activities in
the irrigation scheme. The center will be managed by an irrigation unit chief
and vill have the same extension structure as rainfed crop production.
5.05      The project cooperative division will also have a representative
in each administrative district responsible for all cooperative activities.
Cooperatives are, in effect, assemblies of Mutual Guarantee Groups (GMV),
and there vill be one or more of these groups in each village involved in
the project. The cooperatives will be assisted by cooperative advisors at
the ALC level. The present cooperative structure lnvolving UNCC will be
maintained at the beginning of the project but is likely to change with
the implementation of the recently approved new statutes (para 1.05). These
statutes provide that the administration of the cooperatives vill be taken
over by the farmers.
5.06      As the CNCA is only represented at the provincial level, credit
administration and recovery will continue to be undertaken on its behalf
by the project cooperative division personnel at the sous-prefecture and
cooperative level.
B.  StaffinR
5.07      Under Cr. 608-NIR, the existing key staff for the project included
the General Manager, the Technical Adviser to the General Manager, the
Director of Administrative, Commercial and Financial Department, the Director
of the Technical Department, the Agriculture Division Chief, the Cooperative
Support Division Chief, and the Irrigation and Civil Works Division Chief.



- 34 -
Of these seven senior positions, four are occupied by Nigerien staff, i.e.
the General Manager, the Director of the Technical Department, the Chief of
the Agricultural Division and the Chief of the Cooperative Support Division,
and three by expatriates, the Technical Adviser to the General Manager, the
Director of the Administrative, Commercial and Financial Department (ACF), and
the Chief of the Irrigation and Civil Works Division. Under the proposed
project, the following three positions would be created: Chief of the Moni-
toring and Evaluation Unit, Chief of the Training Division, and Chief of the
Works and Equipment Section. Because Niger is generally short of trained and
experienced staff, these three positions will be filled by expatriates. To
cope with the extension of the project and the need for strengthening some
divisions, two further expatriates will fill the positions of Assistant
Director of the ACF and chief mechanic, since no adequate local staff could be
found during the first phase of the project. Three of the expatriate advisers
employed under Cr. 608-NIR will be retained in the same positions: the adviser
to the Agriculture Division Chief, the adviser to the Chief of the Cooperative
Support Division, and the blacksmith trainer. The last two expatriates are
provided at no charge to the project by the "Appui Cooperatif aux Projets
d'Aide Alimentaire en Zone Sahelienne" (ACOPAM) for the cooperatives, and by
the French organization "Volontaires du Progres" for the blacksmith. The
remaining nine expatriates totalling 45 man-years (Table 5.1) will be provided
at an average unit cost of US$107,000, based on recent experience in Niger.
Recruitment of expatriates will be the project management's responsibility
through direct contacts with foreign firms or through the Association's APMU.
(Table 5.1).
5.08      Consultants will be recruited to:  (a) assist the Irrigation
and Civil Works Division in implementing the irrigated scheme: they would
supervise the implementation of the drilling program and test the wells,
carry out permeability and compaction tests, prepare topographical surveys,
and check the pumps at the factory and in the fields; (b) carry out a ground-
water study; (c) assist the Chief of the Applied Research Section in setting
up applied research programs and implementing trials, including type of
farming, pest control, variety and fertilizer use; and (d) prepare a possible
follow-up project. The consultants for irrigation development will be provided
by SCET International (France), which carried out the irrigation feasibility
studies. Consultants for research will come from the INRAN station at Tarna.
There will be a total of 54 man-months of consultant services (Table 5.1)
with an average base cost of US$10,300 per man-month, of which US$7,700 for
fees, US$1,550 for allowances and US$1,050 for international travel. The
consultants for the groundwater and follow-up project studies would be inter-
nationally recruited.
5.09      With regard to supply of middle-level staff, few difficulties are
foreseen since most of the staff needed are employed under the ongoing project.
It is expected that the secondment of officers from the Ministry of Rural
Development, to the project, will be facilitated by new regulations issued in
1979, which provide for a new type of secondment (mise a disposition), more
acceptable to the staff than present conditions--ensuring the staff of regular
promotion and benefits during their appointment to autonomous organizations.
Salaries of all civil servants will be paid directly by the State to ensure
post project continuity, with the exception of allowances for local travel.



- 35 -
The Project Manager and the Director of the Technical Department will receive
allowances for representation, through the project account. Assurances vere
obtained at negotiations that (1) Nigerien staff would be appointed for
periods of time adequate to ensure against disruption in continuity; and (2)
all consultants and internationally recruited experts as well as key national
personnel vill have the necessary experience and qualifications. Responsibil-
ities for expatriate staff have been agreed to with Government and are detailed
in Annex 1.

C. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.10      The uncertainty surrounding data on farming in the project area
creates a particular need for an effective Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
(para 4.15). It will provide a dual service to the General Manager as a data
collection, analysis and advisory unit, and to Govertiment and other project
financiers as a source of information for effective project supervision and
assessraent of performance. The Unit will first determine, in cooperation with
project managment, the indicators needed to effectively monitor project
success, and the most cost-effective and rapid means of collecting these
data. Supervision missions will give special attention to the Unit during
the crucial first year after its establishment. The unit will also carry
out specific surveys to ensure smooth implementation of new activities,
particularly in the newly irrigated area. It will survey the farming system
throughout the project life (para 2.15) to provide information on the impact
of extension, identify bottlenecks, and study the income and the financial
situation of the farmers. Additional surveys would be conducted at a later
stage to determine farmers' reaction to extension and the adoption of improved
cultural practices, and to study the efficiency of input supply, credit and
commercialization. The Unit will also be linked to the Evaluation Depart-
ment at the Ministry of Rural Development level through (1) participating
in surveys at the national level; (2) providing annual reports; and (3)
coordinating its work program with the Central Technical Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit.
D. Assistance to Farmers
5.11      Organization of the Extension Service.  The organization of the
extension service will be based on the Training and Visit System adapted
to the conditions prevailing in Niger. At Headquarters level, the exten-
sion service will be under the Agriculture Division Chief's responsibility,
who will be assisted by an Extension Section Chief. Each district (arron-
dissement), will have an extension technical assistant (para 5.04). Each
technical assistant will have a four-wheel-drive vehicle in order to supervise
an average of eight sector chiefs.  He will spend at least one full day per
sector every other week. The technical assistant will be responsible for
reviewing the progress of the sector chiefs, and would brief them and organize
the monthly meeting at the CPR centers. The content of the meeting programs
at all levels will be defined by the training division in cooperation with the
extension service.   According to the area and rural population density, each
administrative district will be divided into a different number of sectors.
This distribution could be modified later on to meet the requirements of the
expected restructuring of the cooperative organization. The sector chiefs
will be based at the CPR centers. Each sector chief will supervise about
eight extension agents and will spend a full day in the fields with them
every other week. He will organize weekly meetings at the CPR to brief the
extension agents, review progress, and prepare the work for the following
week.
5.12      Extension Agents' Responsibilities.  After the training course
held during the dry season, the extension agents will visit their villages
and choose, in cooperation with village authorities, the advanced farners



- 38 -
who will be organized into extension groups of five or six based on affinities
and neighboring fields, in order to ease the promotion of the whole package
of improved cultural practices (Chapter VI). In the meantime, they vill
promote the adoption of treated improved seed among larger groups of farmers
in the community. They will also prepare the input requests and the selection
of one demonstration plot per village. During the growing season, they vill
devote three days a week to visit the group of advanced farmers. Since the
number of the latter will progressively increase throughout the project's
life, the weekly visit to each farmer would become fortnightly in PY 4 and PY
5. One day a week the extension agents will be briefed by the sector chief at
the CFR center. The extension agents will devote a full day to each visited
village. Small villages with less than 100 inhabitants could be grouped
together for extension visit, and the largest one would be divided into
several groups of participating farmers and be visited for more than one day.
Each extension agent will work with about 43 advanced farmers in PY 1; this
number would progressively increase to about 100 in PY 5; at the same time
they will promote the diffusion of treated seed to a further 145 additional
farmers on average. The extension service of the irrigated scheme will be
managed more closely; each well area will be cultivated by an average of 34
farmers, and will be supervised by an extension agent during the first five
years; extension would then be reduced. Since special training courses will
be organized beginning in 1980 under the ongoing project, the new extension
organization could be implemented as early as PY 1. By PY 5, about 63,000
farmers in the rainfed area and 2,600 farmers in the irrigation scheme would
have access to the extension services.
5.13      Input Supply.  Inputs (para 4.05) will be delivered by suppliers
to the district headquarters. Subsequent distribution to the ALC centers,
where farmers would collect their inputs, will be organized by UNCC as at
present. The inputs will be stocked at the ALC's CPR centers, where appro-
priate buildings have been constructed under the first project.
E. Irrigation Development
5.14      Water Availability.  The irrigation scheme will be located in the
Goulbi de Maradi flood plain, upstream of the town Maradi, and water will be
provided through pumping in the underground water table which is fed by
rainfall in the river basin and by the river flow. The river originates
in Nigeria, enters Niger about 50 km upstream of Maradi, and returns to
Nigeria 90 km west of the city (see Map 14532). The irrigation scheme will
not have any repercussion on Nigeria's supplies. Conversely, even if a
storage dam should be constructed in Nigeria, it would not cause a water
shortage because the underground water table at the Goulbi de Maradi, if
reduced by more than 4-6 m as a consequence of pumping or reduced river flows,
would automatically be fed by the huge water reserve of the "Continental
Intercalaire". Though no risks are foreseen for the development of the 840 ha
Maradi irrigation scheme, the Niger Governnent has informed the Nigerian
Government of its irrigation project in Maradi province.



- 39 -
5.15      Land Rights.  The procedures for land allocation in irrigation
schemes are based on Law No. 60-28 of May 25, 1960 which requires: (a)
ascertaining present land use rights through a series of interviews with
the local population; (b) giving priority for land allocation to the
farmers whose rights can be established; (c) selecting farmers according
to a number of criteria including proximity to the schemes, size of the
family, farming experience, and existing assets, including ownership
of bullocks; and (d) allocating no more than 0.25 ha per male adult.
Taking into account the terms of the law, a contract between the Goverrnent
and the farmers (cahier des charges) will clearly define the conditions
of land allocation and obligations of both parties. To ensure that the
irrigated scheme will benefit as many farmers as possible, it is proposed
to distribute one plot of 0.38 ha (0.32 ha net) per family. A condition
of effectiveness would be that the contract documents (cahier des charges)
for land allocations in the Goulbi de Maradi have been cleared and approved at
government level. Assurances were obtained that farmers would be allotted
more than one plot per farming unit only under special conditions to be agreed
upon between Government and the Association. Land allocation will be handled
jointly by the provincial Governor or his representative, the Project General
Manager and the village representatives, in accordance with the "cahier des
charges" specifications, terms of which are being discussed and will be tested
through the first land allocation to be made in 1980 under the extension of
Cr. 608-NIR (para 3.16).
5.16      Implementation and Organization.  Except for wells, which will
be drilled by contractors on the basis of international competitive bidding,
on-farm works would be carried out by force account by the Civil Works and
Irrigation Division. For that purpose, the Division would be strengthened
through the recruitment of a chief of the Works and Equipment Section and a
chief mechanic, and the maintenance equipment would be improved to cope with a
larger work load. Consultants would assist the Division to carry out soil
tests, topographical surveys, and pump control during project implementation.
Maintenance would be carried out by the Irrigation and Civil Works Division.,
For the electric pumps, the supplier selected under the Special Action Credit
-- has agreed to set up a maintenance unit and a stock of spare pumps for
proposed instant replacement. Fruit trees would be provided by the project
as well as "euphorbia balsamifera", for fencing.
5.17      Extension.  The irrigated agriculture production will be managed by
the Agriculture Division through its Irrigated Production Section and an
Irrigation Unit Chief, who would be posted at Djiratawa. At full development,
the extension staff would include 10 sector chiefs and 75 extension agents
specially trained for irrigation at CFJA. A first group of seven extension
agents was trained in 1979 and 15 will be trained in 1980. Each extension
agent will supervise one well area covering about 35 farmers during the first
five years, and then extension would be reduced to one agent for three wells.
Extension agents will also manage water distribution.



- 40 -
5.18      Farmers' participation.  Farmers will be organized into cooperatives,
one per well, and will benefit from credit and input distribution (para 4.05)
under the same conditions as in rainfed agriculture. Farmers will pay for
irrigation, the fees to include: (i) total cost for maintenance and operating
expenses, (ii) a provision for the replacement of the tubewells and pumps, and
(iii) a participation in capital recovery. Water charges are further discussed
at para 7.05. Payments will be made twice a year, in December for the rainy
season and in July for the dry season. Assurances were obtained at nego-
tiations that if farmers did not comply with their financial obligations or
cropping rules (cropping patterns, work quality), their land could be repos-
sessed. The decision would be made by the Project Manager after consultation
with the provincial Governor, the involved cooperative, and the Extension
Section Chief. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that any reduction
of farmers' water charges would be offset by a Government contribution.
VI. TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
A. Rainfed Farming
6.01      Improved Farming Techniques.  Key technical coefficients are
summarized in Table 6.1. They reflect soil conditions, rainfall distribution,
socioeconomic constraints and labor availability. The proposed technology
will involve better seedbed preparation, the use of improved seeds, higher
plant population, appropriate fertilizer use, timely weeding and thinning
for all crops, and pest control on cowpeas. Under the project, the seed
multiplication program will be extended to cope with an expected higher
demand and will be carried out through the CPR farms and seed farmers.
All seed will be treated with fungicides prior to planting.  Millet P3KOLO
would progressively be replaced by the CIVT and in the northern project area
by HAINI KIRE, both better adapted to weather and soil conditions.   Sorghum
a2b2 would progressively be replaced by the a4d4 8.2.3 in sandy soils
and the L30 would continue to be multiplied for the flood plain. The cowpeas
variety TN 88-63 and the groundnuts varieties 55-434 and 4716 would continue
to be multiplied. Introduction of other varieties is not excluded if experi-
mentation proves their superiority. Triple superphosphate will be given as
a base application for groundnuts, cowpeas and cereals. Urea on cereals will
be applied at the appropriate time in the growing cycle. On fields where no
intercropping of cereals and legumes is practiced, a simple rotation of pure
stands of these crops would be promoted.

6.02      At the Tarna research station (INRAN), located within the project
area, good yields have been obtained with the use of the recommended improved
cultural practices, and application of the same methods on farmers' demonstra-
tion plots, the CPRs, and at the CFJA, has confirmed their efficiency.
With the use of the complete package of improved cultural practices, the
average yield increase obtained in the project over two years for groundnuts
attained +95%, and for millet +101% (para 3.10). In 1979/80, due to a favor-
able rainy season, the yield increase was even higher, more than double
that obtained with traditional methods. In spite of a good potential for
yield increases, the results achieved in promoting improved cultural practices
fell short of appraisal targets (para 3.11). One reason is that the effects
of the severe drought in the early 1970's followed by massive pest attacks
on groundnuts, were still being felt by farmers, who have become more prudent
about applying new techniques and have reduced their groundnut acreage. The
present consumption of seasonal inputs is about 570 tons of fertilizer and
about 150 tons of improved seeds (in fact, about 560 tons of seed were distri-
buted, but 70% were of poor quality). These usage rates can be greatly
improved judging from the highly encouraging results obtained on demonstration
plots and on CPRs. About 400 demonstration plots have created a real interest
for improved cultural practices, and a demand exists for improved seeds,
fertilizers and animal-drawn equipment which will be met and developed through
the reorganization and retraining of the extension service.
6.03      The proposed technology is adapted to local conditions and will be
proposed to the farmers in two steps: first, the adoption of improved and
treated seed with better and timely preparation of soil (themes 1 and 2), and
secondly, additional use of fertilizer and higher plant population with timely
weeding (themes 1 to 4). The use of animal-drawn machinery will also be
promoted; but because of its cost and the relatively low income of farmers, it
is expected that only farmers willing to rent their equipment to neighbors, an
established practice in the project area, would acquire a complete set. As the
results of the Project's applied research section become available, crop
recommendations will be modified. Although the project has been calculated
for practical reasons on the basis of simple cropping, this mode cannot be
taken as a final recommendation.   Inter-cropping, which is traditionally
practiced in the project area, could be recommended as soon as agronomic data
from the Project's applied research program becomes available. In this
respect, liaison will be maintained with ICRISAT and INRAN, and the design of
the project has been kept flexible: a cropping pattern, will not be imposed
and project management will be prepared to adjust to changes in cropping
patterns in response to changing crop techniques and prices. As a case in
point, groundnut diseases, which have occurred in recent years, could affect
progress in groundnut cultivation; but this would lead to larger areas grown
under cowpeas or cereals and would not affect project benefits.
6.04      Based on the utilization of inputs shown in Annex 2, Tables l
and 5, the return per hectare and required labor inputs are specified at
Annex 2, Table 2. Returns per farm, per labor day at full development for
adopters of improved manual farming techniques and for traditional cultivation
are shown in Annex 2, Table 3. The total incremental area to be improved
under the project would reach 81,500 ha of cereals; of this total, 60,500 ha

would receive improved and treated seed (themes 1 and 2) and 21,000 ha the
full package of improved methods including higher plant population and fertil-
izers (themes 1 to 4). The total incremental area of groundnuts to be improved
would attain 26,900 ha, of which 16,000 ha would be under themes 1 and 2 and
about 10,900 ha under themes 1 to 4. Improvement of cowpeas cultivation
through the adoption of themes 1 to 4 would be extended to 6,000 ha (Annex 2,
Table 4). On the irrigated scheme, all farmers would adopt the full package
of improved cultural practices on about 1,500 ha at full development - details
are at Annex 2, Table 4. The incremental area cultivated with improved animal
traction techniques would reach 13,600 ha in PY 5. Although the use of animal
traction ensures better and faster work at the appropriate time, it is usually
used by advanced farmers and no yield increases have been attributed to these
improvements.  In the project area it has been observed ttat animal traction
does not cause an extension of the cultivated area. In other words, instead of
being motivated by direct increases to income, most farmers are interested in
animal-drawn machinery because of the possibilities o- r(ducing work time and
of renting the implements to their neighbors. The renting of equipment is very
popular in the project area. In all cases, the production increase would be
obtained in the first year of adoption of the improved cultural practices. Pro-
jected production of rainfed and irrigated crops is shown in Annex 2, Table 6.
6.05      Rate of Adoption of New Techniques.  It is expected that many
farmers would adopt the improved cultural practices, although a large part of
them may not follow all the recommendations of the extension service due to
reasons explained at para 2.15. Since land distribution and cultivation are
complex and since a part of the cereal fields is shared with other farmers, it
is unlikely that improved cultural practices would be applied to the entire
area grown under cereals. Nevertheless, since the average size of fields grown
under groundnuts and cowpeas is small, it is very likely that improved cultural
practices would be applied to entire plots.  Expected increases in improved
areas and production from improved areas are detailed in Annex 2, Tables 4 and
6, with respect to adoption of the basic package (improved seed and seed
treatment) and the full package (pure stands, optimum density, insecticides
and fertilizer). These data are summarized below. Adoption targets seem high
for groundnuts, but it must be taken into account that the basic package
involves only improved and treated seed, which is already used by two
thirds of the farmers on about half of the total groundnut area; it is also
expected that the seed multiplication and quality control program (para 4.10)
will overcome the present constraints on seed supply.  The most ambitious
objective of the program is the introduction of the full technical package in
cereals production.  The target is justified by farmers' interest in improving
cereals production before other crops; the project will remain flexible, however,
with respect to the cropping pattern and follow farmers' preferences, as influ-
enced by changes in relative crop prices. Since the economic value of the
main crops does not differ much, changes in the cropping pattern would not
significantly influence the economics of the project.

6.06      Animal Traction.  Although animal traction is relatively expensive
for most of the farmers, the existing demand could not be met by the first
project. Trainees of the CPR would be given priority to purchase a complete
set including a pair of oxen, a seeder, a tool bar with cultivator and ground-
nut lifter. It is expected that animal-drawn machinery would be mainly
developed in the southern area of the project among farmers working both
rainfed and irrigated land. Introduction of animal traction would permit the
use of the seeder, a pre-condition for planting in rows and achieving correct
density, and would ensure faster work; thus it would eliminate bottlenecks
which occur at planting and weeding time. It is estimated that the number of
farmers using animal-drawn equipment would increase from 4.5% to 7.6% during
the project life. In the irrigation scheme all farmers would use improved
cultural practices on about 1,500 ha at full development.



- 45 -
B. Irrigated Farming
6.07      Irrigated farming is currently practiced in some places of the
Goulbi de Maradi flood plain, on very small hand-irrigated plots, to
produce vegetables for local consumption. Flood recession cultivation
is also practiced along Madarounfa Lake to grow cereals, vegetables and
trees.   UNCC is currently promoting irrigated cotton cultivation through
the use of small pumps, and results are promising. At Tarna station,
successful experiments have been carried out with irrigated cowpeas,
vegetables and forage crops. The Goulbi de Maradi population has shown
great interest in irrigation possibilities and, since it became known
that an irrigation component was to be included in the first project,
many requests have been forwarded to the Project Management to obtain
irrigated land. Farmers will benefit from close supervision (one extension
agent per well or about 35 farmers), and will apply improved cultural
practices on all crops to ensure a maximum return. Special attention will
also be given to ensuring intensive land use in the dry season.
6.08      Since both the alluvial soils of the flood plain and the pumped
water are of good quality, almost all irrigated crops are possible. The
proposed type of rotation would be flexible and adapted to possible changes
to follow market demands. Because of anticipated constraints on demand,
vegetable production would initially be limited to a total of 50 ha; but
the area under vegetables could be substantially increased if a tomato
processing factory now under review were eventually built in Maradi (para
7.01) or if trade to Nigeria increased. The land will be cultivated at a
cropping intensity of 150%, which would progressively be increased to 180% at
full development; the rotation would then include 50% cotton, 25% sorghum, 25%
cowpeas in rainy season, and in dry season 6% vegetable and 45% maize (increas-
ing to 74%). Cotton L299-10 will be sown early, in April-May, after preirroga-
tion to ensure that fields are cleared in time before dry season planting. For
the same reason, the envisaged varieties of sorghum would have a short growing
cycle (100 days). Cowpea seeds adapted for irrigation would be imported from
the IITA station at Ibadan, Nigeria, to be tested at Maradi.   Vegetable
production would be mixed and adapted to the market demand. For tomatoes, the
recommended varieties for consumption are Marmande, Monita (Money Maker) and
Fournaise; for industrial use Rosita and Piacenza; for onions, Violet of
Galmi and White of Soumarana. Cabbages, beans, melons, red peppers, eggplants,
salads and greenpeppers will also be grown. Moreover, in order to add appre-
ciable income with a low labor input and to clearly establish the lines
limiting the different crops, thus ensuring easy control of works, citrus
trees would be planted along the irrigation ditches. Each farmer would own
about 13 trees. Plants would be prepared by the project in cooperation with
the Gabougoura station which would provide stocks and grafts. The trees would
include Pomelo varieties: Marsh seedless or Shombar, Tahiti lime and Orlando
tangelo. They would ensure after the tenth year an increase of about 50% in
the net income from the irrigated plot (Annex 2, Table 3).
6.09      For all crops, the proposed technology will include the use of
improved seeds provided by the local research station or imported, and
the use of fertilizers and pesticides as recommended by researchers. Since
farmers will work both rainfed and irrigated land and will benefit from higher
incomes, it is expected that the use of animal-drawn equipment will increase
more rapidly in the irrigated areas.



- 46 -
6.10      Labor Requirements.  Labor requirements are compatible with the size
of the project families. The average monthly man-day availability is about
150 days in the north and 110 days in the south, sufficient to cope with the
maximum of 100 days/month required at harvest time, in September. The average
requirement from May to August is about 60 days/ month, which leaves an ade-
quate margin to farmers in the Goulbi area cultivating both rainfed and
irrigated fields. Hired laborers will only be required when family size is
substantially below the average.
C. Production
6.11      The total expected production by volume and value is summarized
at Table 6.2. At full development, output of cereals and cowpeas would
both increase by 19%, making available 22,800 tons of millet and sorghum
and 4,400 tons of cowpeas. Groundnut production should benefit from several
favorable factors: (a) good yields in recent years, which demonstrates that,
despite the low yields obtained prior to 1977, satisfactory increases can be
achieved from groundnuts, especially with the use of improved cultural methods;
(b) a regular extension of the groundnut acreage over the past three years,
which suggests that the very low level of production reached in 1976 was below
the minimum defined by farmers' cash needs; and (c) a series of good yields
for cereals, which suggests, if it continues, a relative saturation of demand
and fall in cereal prices would prompt farmers to switch back to groundnut
production. During the project life, the relatively small area devoted to
groundnuts is expected to be extended from 0.40 ha to 0.70 ha per farm in the
south and from 0.25 ha to 0.50 ha in the north. With a larger acreage and
good yields, the incremental production of groundnuts is estimated at 12,300
tons. With the probability of drought estimated at once in five years, the
assumed average increase in yields is well below that obtained in demon-
stration plots over the last three years. For project purposes, the increase
obtained through the use of the whole package of improved cultural methods has
been estimated to vary between 56% and 77% for millet and sorghum, according
to the area, compared to average demonstration-plots' yields varying between
+95% and +122%. For groundnuts, the project estimates are +60% compared with
+101% and +158% obtained in demonstration plots over the last three years.

VII. DEMAND, MARKETING, PRICES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Demand Prospects
7.01      In the years after the 1973-74 drought, Niger imported a small
percentage of its total requirements in foodgrains. Under current prospects,
the country will soon be entirely self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs.
Incremental production in the project area would be used by farmers first to
continue their replenishment of stocks which were exhausted after the drought,
and are still some 50-60% below their normal levels. Once this process is
completed, about one-third of the incremental production would be required to
maintain the per capita grain consumption of the project zone's growing
population. The remainder is expected to be shipped to deficit zones in the
rest of the country, with any surplus going to Nigeria. The latter is a
chronic net food importer, and a number of studies have estimated that her
national food deficit will continue to widen. Disposal of the incremental
cereal production at remunerative prices should therefore be possible.
Cowpeas are traditionally exported to Nigeria, where the market is quite large
relative to project output, and where cowpea prices on the Kano market have
been rising swiftly over the last few years; thus the export potential is far
from saturated. Groundnuts can be exported to the world market, which is, of
course, unlimited relative to Niger's production. In addition, local process-
ing facilities are heavily underutilized and domestic demand for groundnut oil
must presently be satisfied by imports from Nigeria. The fruit and vegetable
production of the irrigated perimeter is intended to satisfy mainly the
local market, with a limited surplus exported to Nigeria. The planned output
level has been determined as a function of these outlets: about 1,500 tons
per year (on 50 ha). A tomato-paste processing plant, which may be located at
Maradi, is under consideration by the Banque de Développement de la Répu-
blique du Niger (BDRN). A financial and economic study, carried out in
January 1979 calls for a factory with an annual output of 1,700 tons of tomato
paste derived from about 6,000 tons of fresh tomatoes. The Government is
presently seeking financing and technical assistance to implement the proposal.
Should the plant be established at Maradi, tomato production within the project
could easily be increased to meet the factory's needs, which would require 200
ha (out of 840 ha to be developed).
B. Marketing and Prices
7.02      The parastatal crop marketing agencies, together with a handful of
licensed traders, are the sole authorized buyers of farmers' products on
the cooperative markets. Nevertheless, throughout the project area, private
buyers with well-established networks are also operative. They provide effec-
tive competition to the parastatal agencies, as the prices they offer farmers
are generally above the official prices. Their existence undoubtedly improves
the efficiency of the market, and is also advantageous to farmers since it
prevents Government from setting official prices too far below market prices.
Still, official prices for 1978/79 were 20-30% below market prices, a fact
which accounts for the falling market share of the parastatal agencies. The
latter trend is expected to continue, especially for groundnuts and cowpeas,
if the increases in official prices of these crops do not at least keep pace



- 49 -
with inflation. Since Government is intent on raising rural income levels,
consideration should be given to raising the support prices for several
crops, in the first place groundnuts and cotton, to the level of their economic
price, i.e. to forego the margin of taxation implicit in their present support
prices. The Central Technical Monitoring and Evaluation Unit in Niamey (para
4.16) will be requested to monitor the relation of support prices and economic
prices and periodically advise Government on the scope for support price
adjustments.
7.03      Official crop prices for the 1979/80 harvest are the same as for
the previous season and represent 65-85% of the economic prices. Market
prices, with the exception of cotton, show the usual seasonal fluctuations.
Economic prices have been based on import parity prices for sorghum and
maize and on export parity prices for groundnuts, cotton (world market) and
cowpeas (Nigeria). As there is no measurable difference in local consumer
preference for either millet or sorghum, the millet economic price (import
parity from world market) is assumed to be the same as sorghum. For tomatoes
and onions the export parity prices are derived from producer prices in Kano
(Nigeria). A comparison with official market and economic prices is shown in
the following table.

C. Financial Implications for Farmers
7.04      Rainfed Farming.  The financial impact of recommended improved cul-
tural practices in rainfed and irrigated farming is detailed in Annex 2, Tables
3 and 7, and summarized at Table 7.1 below. Returns per farm unit, per man-day
and per incremental man-day, refer to the weighted average of improved and
unimproved areas on the average farm. The table shows that, at subsidized input
prices, farm income rises about twice as much in the south as compared to the
north; the difference is even more marked with regard to net income per man-day.
Indeed, even at subsidized input prices, income per man-day rises very little
in the north. It should be noted, however, that these figures refer to the
total farm and include the unimproved areas; for the improved areas, the
increase is about twice the amount shown. Also, estimated increases in yield
and income incorporate the effect of droughts (once every five years), which
means that in years of satisfactory rainfall, income increases will be corre-
spondingly higher. There is no doubt, however, that the income increases to be
expected in the north are very modest and reflect the marginal ecological
conditions of the area. The project's expected beneficial effects are not
so much the increase in returns per man-day as the extension of the period
of gainful employment per farm unit and the increase in cereals production
per family, which in the north presently barely covers subsistence needs.
With unsubsidized input prices, there is little financial incentive to
adopt the full technical package of inputs and improved practices. As agreed
under Cr. 608-NIR, Government and the Association will continue to monitor
the relation of crop and input prices and periodically review input subsidy
policies.

7.05      Irrigated Farming.  It is estimated that farmers will apply improved
cultural practices on the entire plot, i.e. 0.32 ha net. Calculated on the
basis of one plot of 0.32 ha net per family, the net return based on subsidized
inputs will amount to CFAF 48,000 per plot (Annex 2, Table 3); this will
increase their income from improved rainfed cultivation by a further 40%.
After 10 years, when trees reach full production, the net return should again
increase by CFAF 29,000, to reach CFAF 227,000 per farm. Governient's policy
with regard to irrigation projects does not require farmers to pay for exten-
sion services or contribute to the amortization of the investment. Neverthe-
less, assurances were obtained at negotiations that farmers will contribute to
capital recovery to ensure some financial viability of the investment through
water fees of CFAF 104,000/ha on average (US$495/ha). This includes: a) a
flat rate per hectare for maintenance, replacement of equipment and partial
recovery of investment cost; and b) a variable component calculated from the
actual electricity consumption on each well divided by the number of farmers.
The level of water charges is in accordance with that applied in the Namari-
goungou Project (Cr. 851-NIR) and will, in the present case, absorb just over
50% of the economic rent of irrigated land and permit recovery of 43% of
project costs over the project lifetime (Annex II, Table 14). The high rent
recovery index reflects the prominence of relatively low value cereals in the
cropping pattern; expansion of the share of tomatoes would substantially
reduce this percentage. Water charges will be reviewed with the Government
during the course of project implementation to keep them at an acceptable
level for the farmers.
D. Financial Implications for Government
7.06      While cost recovery reaches about 43% in irrigated production
(para 7.05), the project will generate little direct revenue in rainfed
production, the major project component, as (a) a substantial proportion
of incremental production is home consumed; and (b) government agencies must
compete with private traders for the marketed share of incremental production
and can, for this reason, derive only limited revenue from it. There will be
some spin-off of incremental farm income in expanded non-agricultural activi-
ties and increased spending by project beneficiaries on consumer goods subject
to indirect taxation but this will only marginally reduce the structural
deficit of Government, which is shown in Annex 2, Table 13. After the end of
external financing, the cash-flow shortfall would amount to some CFAF 500
million (US$2.4 million) annually (in 1986 prices) and would consist primarily
of input subsidies, staff costs and reneval and maintenance expenditures
not covered by water charges and marketing levies. According to Government's
cooperative policy (para 1.05), the cooperatives in the project area, as
elsewhere in the country, are to become financially autonomous eventually and
would, under this policy, absorb at least the recurrent staff and maintenance
costs. However, it is difficult to foresee a rapid evolution in the sense
desired by Government, both for financial and managerial reasons, and no
account has been taken of this in the cash-flow projection.
7.07      Because of the projected steep increase in Government revenue
from uranium royalties, the shortfall in Government's cash flow does not
raise a financial problem; it is Government's declared policy to transfer part



- 53 -
of these revenues to the rural sector (para 1.10). Since the absorptive
capacity for agricultural investment will remain limited over the medium term,
the use of incremental resources for the subsidization of recurrent project
expenditures is an acceptable policy.
VIII. BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Project Benefits
8.01      Building on the foundations laid by the first Maradi Project, the
project will provide improved inputs to some 63,000 farm families represent-
ing 90% of the rural population in the project area and extension advice to
about 40% of these. Project activities in rainfed agriculture would lead to
incremental production of 22,800 tons of cereals, 12,400 tons of groundnuts
and 4,400 tons of cowpeas; the economic value of this would amount to US$11.7
million annually at full development. Most of the benefits would be reached
by the end of the project period in 1984/1985. The project will also provide
additional income, and employment in the long dry season, through the develop-
ment of an irrigation scheme, which will benefit about 2,600 farm families
in the densely populated Goulbi of Maradi area. Except for the irrigation
component, employment creation is not a primary objective of the project, as
labor supply in the rainy season is already short at planting and weeding;
however, the project would improve the intensity of employment in the rainy
season by raising the number of days of gainful employment; this is reflected
in the increase in family income per year (Table 7.1). There is no available
data on agricultural income distribution in the project area; however, since
almost all farmers are smallholders, income distribution seems relatively
even. Due to low rainfall in the three northern districts of the project area,
Aguie, Tessaoua, and Guidan-Roumji, farmers' income is likely to be lower than
the national average. In the southern district of Madarounfa farmers' income
should be higher than the average but still lower than the estimated national
per capital income.
B. Economic Analysis
8.02      Economic prices of the crops to be grown under the project are
discussed in para 7.03 above; other assumptions used in economic analysis
are:
(a)  without the project, there would be a spin-off from the
extension and input supply capacity built up under
Cr. 608-NIR, which is assumed to lead to further
increases in production of 20%, 15%, 10% and 5% in PYl-
PY4, respectively, and remain stationary thereafter;
(b) although there will be a reduction in extension and
training needs after the project period (or a transfer
of these resources to new developmental tasks), no



- 54 -
allowance has been made for this in the economic cal-
culation as the extent of these cutbacks is difficult
to foresee;
(c) the opportunity cost of incremental farm labor is estimated
at CFAF 700/day (US$3.30/day), but only for the periods of
peak demand in the rainy season (46 man day/ha); this
opportunity cost is in line with observed payments for
hired labor in 1979;
(d) project life-time is 30 years, with a CFAF 80 million
(US$400,000) residual value of irrigation construction
equipment in PY6; and
(e) the standard conversion factor, expressing distortion of
local prices by taxes and subsidies, is 0.92.
8.03      Economic costs and benefits based on these assumptions are presented
in Table 8.1. The economic rate of return of the project is 28%, with rates
of return of the two sub-projects of 36% (rainfed farming) and 14% (irrigation)
(diagram 8.2). At an opportunity cost of capital of 10%, the net present
value of the project is equal to CFAF 6 billion (US$28.6 million).
8.04      As stated in para 7.01, the irrigated area under tomatoes and
onions is scheduled to be only 50 ha as this is expected to cover projected
local demand. If a tomato concentrate plant were to be built in Maradi, the
area under tomatoes could be expanded to 200 ha (with the area under cereals
correspondingly reduced). This would raise the economic rate of return of the
irrigation component from 14% to 22%, and the overall rate of return of the
project to about 31%.
8.05      The satisfactory economic rate of return of the project is attribu-
table to a considerable extent to the fact that the short first Maradi Project
(Cr. 608-NIR) has absorbed the start-up costs, including project buildings,
training of extension staff, irrigation studies and purchase of equipment for
irrigation construction under the EEC Special Action Credit. Although these
costs are sunk by now, it is legitimate to ask what the economic rate of
return of the two projects as a whole would be, assuming for instance that the
project had been conceived as a two-stage project from the beginning. The
economic rate of return for the two projects combined is 23%; and the rate of
return for the first project alone about 16% under the assumption spelt out in
item (a) of para 8.02.
C. Risk and Sensitivity Analysis
8.06      Project risks are discussed separately for the rainfed and the
irrigation component and are summarized in Table 8.1 and Diagrams 8.3. There
is practically no risk of the rainfed component's rate of return falling below
10%. The adoption targets and expected yield increases are conservative (para
6.11); they take into account both the incidence of low rainfall years (about
1 year out of 5) and of groundnut diseases; lags in adoption rates may occur



- 55 -
but would not affect the project seriously (Table 8.1). On the cost side,
steeper than anticipated increases in local cost may occur as a consequence of
the impact of increasing uranium revenues on the domestic price level, but
again the impact of this factor, even if coinciding with a shortfall in
benefits, would be limited (Diagram 8.3).
8.07      The irrigation component has limited risks on the cost side as the
civil works equipment has been procured under the Special Action Credit and
contracts for well-drilling and for pumps (the main capital cost components)
have been concluded under that Credit (para 3.15) and will apply without
change to the follow-up contracts under the proposed project. However, the
irrigation component has substantial risks on the benefit side. A shortfall
may in particular occur if double-cropping targets are not fully achieved. If
double-cropping were less than 30% (instead of the 50-80% envisaged) the
rate of return of the irrigation component would fall below 10%. Special
attention will be paid, therefore, to close supervision of extension work and
appropriate administrative measures will be implemented to withdraw land
titles from farmers unwilling to double-crop (para 5.18). Assurances to that
effect were sought at negotiations. Benefits from the irrigation component
would be significantly higher than stated, on the other hand, if the tomato
concentrate factory materialized. Benefits per farm family could increase by
nearly 50% in this case, which would strengthen the incentive for double
cropping.

8.08      The risk of the project as a whole, results from the analysis of the
two components and is shown in Diagram 8.3. It appears that due to the
dominance of the rainfed component there is no reasonable expectation of the
project falling below a 10% rate of return even if no tomato concentrate
factory is built and the rate of return of the irrigation component remains,
for this reason, precarious. This latter risk must be accepted, however, in
the interest of pioneering irrigation development based on underground water
resources in this arid and resource-poor country.
IX. AGREEMENT TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that:
(i) it would make satisfactory and timely arrangements concerning
the augmentation of the Farm Supplies Fund, for the replenishment
of such Fund with monies on account of input subsidies in PY3,
4 and 5, for the deposit into the Farm Supplies Fund of farmers'
payments and repayments on account of input acquisitions, for the
meeting of any default of farmers' credit repayments, and for the
adequate replenishment of the Special Project Account, including
meeting any shortfall of water charges (para 4.20);
(ii)  it would make satisfactory accounting and auditing arrangements
(para 4.24);
(iii)  the PMU would prepare a project completion report within six months
of the closing date (para 5.02);
(iv)  the project manager would be the ONAHA representative for the
Maradi province (para 5.03);
(v) the four district extension assistants would be seconded to the
project prior to December 1980 (para 5.04);
(vi)  local staff would be appointed for adequate periods of time to
ensure against disruptions in continuity (para 5.09);
(vii)  all consultants and internationally recruited experts as well as
key national personnel will have the necessary experience and quali-
fications (para 5.09);
(viii)  the Association would be consulted when more than one plot (0.38
ha gross surface) is allocated to a family (para 5.15);
(ix)  irrigated land could be repossessed if farmers do not comply with
their financial obligations or cropping rules (para 5.18);
(x) the Government would compensate for any shortfall of farmers'
charges in irrigation (para 5.18);



- 60 -
(xi) farmers on the Maradi irrigation scheme would pay recovery charges
at a level mutually acceptable to Government and IDA and their level
would be reviewed from time to time (para 7.05).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(1) conditions preceding initial disbursement of the CCCE and IFAD loans
have been fulfilled (para 4.19);
(2) Government has (a) opened a line of credit of CFAF 150 million
(US$0.7 million) in the Special Project Account with BDRN for
prefinancing all project operating costs, and (b) has granted a CFAF
200 million (US$1.0 million) line of credit with CNCA for the Farm
Supplies Fund (para 4.20);
(3) The contract documents (cahier des charges) for land allocation in
the Goulbi de Maradi irrigated scheme have been cleared and approved
at Government level (para 5.15).
9.03      With the indicated assurances and conditions, the proposed project
is suitable for a credit on standard terms of US$16.7 million equivalent to
the Government of Niger.
