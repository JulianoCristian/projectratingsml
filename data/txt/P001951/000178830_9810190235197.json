program intended to increase farm incomes and improve the\n            welfare and standard of living of the rural population of\n            Maradi Province and strengthen and improve the existing\n            project organization through: (a) the expansion of improved\n            cultural practices in rainfed farming areas; (b) training\n            the extension staff in the training and visit system; (c)\n            agricultural credit for the purchase of incremental inputs\n            and farm equipment; (d) development of 740 ha of irrigated\n            farming; (e) construction and equipment of an irrigation\n            center; (f) applied agricultural research; (g) a seed\n            multiplication program; (h) development of functional\n            literacy and health programs, and maintenance activities for\n            the wood plantation and livestock programs financed under\n            Credit 608-NIR; (i) technical assistance to the Project\n            Management Unit (PMU); (j) a project Monitoring and\n            Evaluation Unit. The International Fund for Agricultural\n            Development (IFAD) and the French Caisse Centrale de\n            Cooperation Economique (CCCE) would contribute US$12 million\n            and US$7 million respectively. The project would benefit\n            63,000 farm families in rainfed agriculture and 2,600 in\n            irrigation development. Benefits from the irrigation\n            component may be lower than expected."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
