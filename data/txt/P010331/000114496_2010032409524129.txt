On  the  basis  of such request or
requests, the Association shall, on  behalf of the Borrower, with-
draw from the Credit Account  and deposit into the Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
 
(b)  (i)
For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the
Page  11
Borrower shall furnish  to the Association requests
for  deposits  into  the  Special  Account  at such
intervals as the Association shall specify.
 
(ii)
Prior to or at the  time  of each such request, the
Borrower  shall  furnish  to  the  Association  the
documents and other  evidence  required pursuant to
paragraph
4
of  this  Schedule  for  the payment or
payments  in  respect  of  which  replenishment  is
requested.
On the basis  of  each such request, the
Association  shall,  on  behalf  of  the  Borrower,
withdraw from the  Credit  Account and deposit into
the Special  Account  such  amount  as the Borrower
shall have requested and  as  shall have been shown
by said documents and  other  evidence to have been
made out of the Special Account for eligible expen
-
ditures.
All such deposits shall be  withdrawn  by the Association from the
Credit Account under  the  respective  eligible Categories, and in
the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by
said documents and other evidence.

For each payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Association shall
reasonably request, furnish to  the Association such documents and
other evidence showing that such  payment was made exclusively for
eligible expenditures.
 
5.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph
3
of  this
Schedule, the Association shall  not  be  required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
 
(a)
if, at any time,  the  Association shall have determined
that all  further  withdrawals  should  be  made  by  the Borrower
directly from the Credit Account in accordance with the provisions
of Article  V  of  the  General  Conditions  and  paragraph
(a) of
Section
2.02 of this Agreement; or
 
(b)

allocated to  the  eligible  Categories,  less  the  amount of any
outstanding special  commitment  entered  into  by the Association
pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to
the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation.
 
Thereafter, withdrawal from  the  Credit  Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn  amount  of  the  Credit  allocated  to  the  eligible
Categories shall follow such  procedures  as the Association shall
specify by notice to the  Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall
be made only after and  to  the  extent that the Association shall
have been satisfied that all  such amounts remaining on deposit in
the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized
in making payments for eligible expenditures.
 
6.   (a)
If the Association  shall  have  determined  at any time
that any payment out of the  Special  Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount  not  eligible pursuant to paragraph
2
of this Schedule;
(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished
to the Association, the Borrower  shall, promptly upon notice from
the Association: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Asso-
ciation may request; or
(B)
deposit into the Special Account
(or,
if the Association shall so request, refund to the Association)
an
amount equal to the amount of  such payment or the portion thereof
not so eligible or justified.
Unless the Association shall other-
wise agree, no further deposit by the Association into the Special
Account  shall  be  made  until  the  Borrower  has  provided such
Page  12
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be
.
(b)
If the Association  shall  have  determined  at any time
that any amount outstanding  in  the  Special  Account will not be
required to cover further  payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon  notice from the Association, refund
to the Association such outstanding amount.
 
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund
to the Association all or any  portion  of the funds on deposit in
the Special Account.
 
(d)
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs
6
(a), (b) and (c) of this  Schedule shall be credited to the Credit
Account  for  subsequent   withdrawal   or   for  cancellation  in
accordance  with  the  relevant   provisions  of  this  Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
