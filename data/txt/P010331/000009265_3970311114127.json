The project was\n            not implemented, and the credit was kept in abeyance and\n            later canceled. As a result, the project did not achieve any\n            of its objectives. The performance of both the Bank and\n            Borrower was deficient. Several lessons can be learned from\n            this project. First, IDA should avoid self-imposed pressure\n            to accelerate project processing when preparation is not\n            complete. Second, IDA should not ignore the dynamics of the\n            political and economic environment in the country and region\n            where it is located. Third, early recognition and evaluation\n            by IDA of the Arun Access Road Project as a component within\n            a larger hydroelectric project might have avoided later\n            changes in the project's objectives and alignment\n            change. Fourth, IDA should insist on compliance with its\n            policies and operational directives, where they are\n            applicable, even in the case of a project for which\n            implementation of the investment component never began and\n            the credit is kept in abeyance. Finally, IDA should ensure\n            ownership by the borrower of any project it approves."}, "docdt": "1996-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
