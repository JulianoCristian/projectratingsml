Because of the size and\n            complexity of project, the project has implications for the\n            entire country, including significant risks relating to\n            crowding out of high-priority investments in other sectors\n            due to cost overruns, unsatisfactory design and\n            implementation of Environmental Management Plan, and failure\n            of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) to meet its share\n            of the investment. The Requesters feel that the Bank has\n            violated it operational policies regarding the project. The\n            Request also points to several other issues, including\n            involuntary resettlement, effects of the project on\n            indigenous peoples, and further deterioration of natural\n            resources. The Requesters believe that Bank is obligated to\n            justify the achievement of its originally stated goals and\n            objectives, to protect, promote and respect the rights and\n            interests of the country and people and to insure the\n            compliance with its own policies and procedures."}, "docdt": "1994-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
