The Inspectors' findings are reflected in this\n            report. Remedial measures proposed by IDA Management prior\n            to this report are included in Annex 2. The investigation\n            was conducted in two phases. In first phase the Inspectors\n            interviewed staff and consuitants and conducted a desk study\n            in Washington. During the second phase the Inspectors\n            carried out a field inspection in Nepal. The Investigation\n            Report examines the claims made by the Requesters and\n            concludes that the IDA is making strides to comply with all\n            policies and procedures related to this project."}, "docdt": "1995-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
