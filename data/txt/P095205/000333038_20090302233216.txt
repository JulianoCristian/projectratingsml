              conversion options. Front-end fee of 0.25 percent, capitalized under the Loan.
              This is a programmatic series with two plannedoperations: the first loan (US$1.3
Operation     billion) would be disbursedintwo tranches. The first tranche of US$796.75 million
Type          will be disbursedupon effectiveness.The second loan, inthe range of US$700
              million. would be disbursedinone tranche.
              The proposedProgrammatic SustainableEnvironmental ManagementDevelopment
              Policy Loan (SEM DPL) aims to support the GOB'Sefforts to (a) improve the
              effectivenessand efficiency of policies and guidelines of the Brazilian
Main Policy   environmental management system, and (b) further integrate principles of
Areas        environmentally sustainabledevelopment innatural resource management and
             conservation, water resourcemanagement, environmental sanitation, and renewable
             energy. The SEMDPL Iwill also treat climate change concerns at both the inter-
             sectoral level and within the targeted sectors.
             The outcome indicatorsfor the key sectors are:
             Natural resourcemanagement:(i) sustainablenatural forest management area
                                                   the
             i s expandedfrom 2.7 to 5.0 million hectares; (ii) average annual rate of
                                                              the
             deforestation inthe Amazon over 2008-2010 i s reducedby 20 percent from the
             2005-2007 average rate of deforestation (14,800 km2); and, (iii) 500,000 hectares
             are receiving support from the Amazon and Atlantic Forest Funds for activities that
             promote sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity, rehabilitate degraded
             areas, or prevent/combat deforestation.
             Water:there is an increase from 60,000 to at least 90,000 kmof mainrivers

              For ClimateChange,the selected indicator is the increase inthe plannedsigned
              reductions o f 20 million tons o f C 0 2 equivalent/year from: C D M projects, other
              BNDES projects, and other actions monitored underNational Climate Change
              Action Plan (NCCAP).
              The SEM DPL series supports the GOB'S concerted efforts to strengthen
              environmental management, with particular attention to: improvements inthe
Program       overall environmental management system, sustainable management o f agricultural
Development   lands, forests, and water resources; reductiono f deforestation inthe Amazon;
Objective(s)
and           reductiono f the environmental degradation o f land and water resources that are key

Contribution  determinants o f the well being o f the poor; and, promotion o f renewable energy. By

to CPS        focusing on these sectors, the SEM DPL series will support the GOB'Scommitment
              to implement a model o f accelerated competitiveness and growth while assuring
              improved environmental and poverty outcomes, each pillars o f the 2008-201 1 CPS.
Risks and     The first type of risk presentis that the reformagenda is not carried out within
Risk          the agreed scope or expected timeframe by MMA and BNDES (Moderate). This
Mitigation    risk is considered low for reform steps by MMA. Despite strong commitment to the
              reform agenda demonstrated by BNDES in 2006-2008, this reform implementation
              risk is considered moderate to substantial for BNDES primarily because the full
              implementation o f the reform agenda within BNDES involves a challenging change
              in corporate culture regarding environmental and social sustainability. This risk is
              addressed through provision to BNDES o f technical assistance and capacity building
              (through the complementary ENV TAL operation) and by building continual
              progress into the reform agenda with important milestones for each phase.
              Other specific reform execution risks include:
              (a) There i s insufficient inter-agency coordination and institutional capacity to carry
              out the environmental reform agenda by government agencies (Moderate). This risk
              i s partially mitigated by the technical assistance provided under the ENV TAL.
              (b) There are delays in reform implementation resultingfrom changes in leadership
              in government agencies (Moderate).         This risk is being mitigated through: (i)
              elaboration o f the reforms' framework in national policy programs which reflect
              strong inter-ministerial commitments and upstream consultation with civil society;
              and, (ii) a programmatic framework that i s flexible.
              The risks of not achieving impacts are primarily that: (a) There is a delay in
              achieving Climate Change outcomes as the interactive effect between the NCCAP
              and BNDES clean development and carbon fund programs occurs more slowly than
              expected (Moderate to substantial); (b) The fall in deforestation does not reach the
             target reduction of 20 percent (Moderate). This risk i s mitigated by the fact that the
             rate of deforestation for 2007 (publishedin November 2008) shows a reduction that
              i s on track to achieve the 20 percent reduction and by the operation's support for the
              Sustainable Amazon Plan and the Amazon Fund.
             The program'soverall mitigatedrisk is moderateto substantialand depends on
             the speedby which BNDESfully implements the reform agenda. Ifit is successful,
             the potential returns would be substantial.

                             PROGRAM DOCUMENT FORA PROPOSED
   FIRST PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN FOR SUSTAINABLE
                        ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TO BRAZIL




I.INTRODUCTION

 1,    This Program Document proposes                    a Programmatic          Sustainable Environmental
Management Development Policy Loan (SEM DPL I)of US$ 1.3 billion to the Government o f
Brazil (GOB). This development policy loan (DPL) i s the first operation in a series o f two loans
which span the period 2008-2010 and aim to support the GOB's efforts to (i)improve the
effectiveness and efficiency o f policies and guidelines o f the Brazilian environmental
management system, and (ii)further integrate principles o f environmentally sustainable
development in the development agenda o f key sectors. The SEM DPL Iwill also treat climate
change concerns at both the inter-sectoral level and within the targeted sectors (natural resources,
water, sanitation', and energy).

2.     By focusing on these sectors, the SEM DPL series will support the GOB's
commitment to implement a model of accelerated competitiveness and growth while
assuring improved environmental and poverty outcomes, which are pillars o f the 2008-2011
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). In this way, the SEM DPL series supports the GOB's
concerted efforts to promote the sustainable management of agricultural lands, forests, and water
resources; reduction of deforestation in the Amazon; reduction o f the environmental degradation
of land, water, and other resources which are key determinants o f the well-beingof the poor; and,
promotion of renewable energy.

3.     The sectoral focus of the SEM DPL has been chosen to include key sectors in
environmental management which satisfy the following criteria: (i)remove or help clarify
and address critical institutional bottlenecks; (ii)involve policy reform that can serve as a catalyst
for environmentally sustainable investmentsin the public and private sectors; (iii)demonstrate an
ability for economic instrumentsto be applied in order to promote strong environmental benefits;
(iv) demonstrate strong linkages to climate change mitigation and adaptation; and, (v) keep
project complexity manageable.

4.     The SEM DPL builds on selected reform areas previously supported by the First
Programmatic Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability' (ENV PRL I, and                     FY05)
the ongoingprograms supported by Bank operations, policy dialogue, and analyticalwork
of the past four years. The proposed program supports the GOB's sustainable investmentgoal
by emphasizing incentives and economic instruments as integral parts o f the GOB's
environmental management strategy. When combined with a focus on improved policies and


' Sanitationhereafterrefers to water supply, sewage treatment, and solid waste management.
 The achievements under the ENV PRL Iare summarized in Annex 2.

public sector enforcement, incentives through development finance3 and instruments to
internalize environmental externalities can widen and deepen impact in the pursuit o f
environmental sustainability.          Having banks require adherence to environmental law and the
integration o f environmental and social considerations into investment plans ex ante provides a
positive reinforcement to compliance. Inaddition, supporting programs which seek to accelerate
sustainable economic activities and improved environmental outcomes in important areas, such
as in the Amazon region, further contributes to complementing policy reforms with
demonstrations o f better natural resources use and environmental improvement.                         This is
especially important for the poor inthe Amazon, who are often driven to use natural resources in
unsustainable ways intimes o f reduced growth (as i s expected to result in Brazil from the current
international financial crisis and reduced demand from many developed countries experiencing
economic recession).

5.    The proposedSEM DPL Iaims to improvethe environmentalimpact of development
finance through the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES)                               --
Brazil's largest development bank (with a wide network of partner banks)                             --for the
leadership the institution can provide to systemic improvement in how sector investments
address environment and social issues and support expansion o f specific sustainability programs
(such as the Amazon Fund, renewable energy, and others described in Section 111). BNDES, as
described inAnnex 7, i s a key source o f long-term financing for Brazil's economic development.
Wholly owned by the federal government, BNDES' main source o f funding comes from
government taxes4.In2007, BNDES had total assets o f BRL 202 billion (about US$125 billion),
and net income o f BRL 7.3 billion. Roughly two thirds o f its credit operations are through
financial intermediaries.

6.    Since 2005, BNDES has been expanding its capacity to address socio-environmental
issues and BNDES management has clearly indicated its full commitment to social and
environmental sustainability across its broad multi-sectoral portfolio. Over 2002-2006,
lending for infrastructure represented about a third of the overall BNDES portfolio: 12 percent o f
this was lent directly to the public sector (state or municipal governments or decentralized public
enterprises), and the rest to private providers o f infrastructure services for transport, energy
generation and "social and urban" projects. BNDES non-infrastructure lending, including its
recently initiated environmentally and socially sustainable business lines, reaches over 100,000
borrowers annually, mainly medium sized enterprises and small agribusiness companies.

7.    The GOB will seek additionalfinancingfor the existingEnvironmentalSustainability
Agenda TechnicalAssistance project (ENV TAL) to accompany this SEM DPL series. The
ENV TAL will continue to assist the Ministry of Environment (MMA) and its affiliate agencies
in carrying out the technical studies and assessments necessary to draft new policies, prepare
technical guidelines for environmental licensing and design monitoring systems. The project will
also support training o f MMA and its affiliate agencies' staff on these new guidelines and
systems. In addition, the ENV TAL will assist BNDES in carrying out the technical analyses


 InDecember2007, the Federalgovernment issueda decree which requires enterprisesto demonstratecompliance
with environmental law as an eligibility criterionfor loans from bothpublic and private sector banks.
440 percent o fthe Worker Assistance Fund(FAT) is constitutionallymandatedfor use by BNDES.

  necessary to develop its many sectoral environmental and social guidelines, developing an
  overall system to monitor implementation and impact of its portfolio, and training operational
  staff on the application of a new Environmental and Social Institutional Policy and related sub-
  sectoral guidelines.


11. COUNTRY CONTEXT

  A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

  8.    The combination of sound macroeconomic management and the favorable external
   environment of the last years allowed Brazil to sustain robust growth rates and maintain
   inflation under control. Taking advantage of high commodity prices and exchange rate
   flexibility, the country has been able to reduce external debt, accumulate international reserves
   and reduce external vulnerability. In turn, tight fiscal policies and prudent debt management
   resulted in declining indebtedness and a safer debt composition, thereby strengthening fiscal
   sustainability. Undoubtedly, these strong macroeconomic fundamentals will help the country to
   weather the current global financial crisis.

  9.    Between 2004 and 2008, the.economygrew on average 4.8 percent, well above the
   average annual rate of just below 2.5 percent of the previous two decades. The recent
   increase in growth was driven by the increase of domestic consumption and recently by the
   acceleration of capital formation, both fostered by vigorous credit expansion. Growth was still
   accelerating (5.4 percent in 2007 and at a rate above 6 percent during the first three quarters o f
   2008 yoy) when the financial crisis unfolded in September 2008. Despite the strong
   deceleration inthe fourth quarter, market consensus forecasts for growth in 2008 suggest a rate
   5.3 percent.

  10.   The inflation targeting regime has been very successful in anchoring inflation
 expectations. Operationally independent, the Central Bank has been able to control
 inflation and progressively reduce interest rates. Inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 2002 to
 4.3 percent in 2007, while inflation expectations fell from 15 percent in 2002 to 4.5 percent in
 2007. Consistent with this regime, the Central Bank reduced the headline interest rate from a
 peak of 26.5 percent in 2003 to 11-25 percent in 2007. In 2008, faced with buoyant domestic
 demand and external inflationary pressures (mainly commodity price increase), inflation has
 increased to 5.9 percent, above the center of the government inflation target zone of 4.5 but still
 below its upper bound of 6.5 percent, and the Central Bank has been in a tightening cycle that
 moved headline interest ratesto the current level of 13.75 percent.

 11.    Fiscal vulnerability has been decisively reduceddue to the tight fiscal policy based on
 the generationof large primary fiscal surpluses. From 2003 to 2007, the public sector primary
 surplus averaged4 percent of GDP. For 2008, the public sector primary balance should reach 4.5
 percent. As a result, the public debt fell to 36 percent of GDP in2008, from 50.5 percent of GDP
 in2002. Strong primary balancesand declining interest rates and debt ledto the reduction of the
 public sector overall deficit from 4 percent in 2002 to 1.3 percent in 2008. The authorities also
 have improved the composition of public debt. Efforts have concentrated on reducing the


                                                   3

volume of dollar-indexed debt and increasing fixed interest rate debt and price indexed debt. The
return to this strategy is now becoming visible with the exchange rate depreciation promoting a
net public debt reduction.

12. The strong external sector performance has reduced external vulnerability. Exports
more than doubled from 2003 to 2007, and reached US$ 160 billion, benefiting from high
commodity prices. The Brazilian trade surplus grew from US$13 billion in 2002 to US$40
billion in 2007. The strong trade surplus resulted in a decisive improvement of the current
account balance. After more than a decade of deficits, the external current account surplus grew
from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2006 and fell to 0.1 percent in 2007.
In 2008, strong economic activity and the exchange rate appreciation led to a high growth of
imports (annualized rate of 25 percent) and a deceleration of export growth. The trade surplus
reduction to US$25 billion and the increaseof profit remittances should lead to a deterioration of
the current account to a deficit of 1.7percent of GDP.




                                                    4

 13.   The robust external performance led to strong accumulation of international
 reserves, which grew from US$37billion in 2002 to US$180 billion in 2007 and to US$206
 in December 2008, an historic peak. The growing strength o f the Brazil's external position
 allowed the country to make an early repayment o f its entire outstanding obligations to the IMF
 inDecember 2005 and with the Paris Club in2006, as well as the retirement of its Brady Bonds
 in 2006. As a result, Brazilian public sector external net debt is now negative, and Brazil's
 external debt sustainability indicators have improved noticeably. Strong exports reduced the
 interest payments-to-exports from 24 percent in 2002 to 9.5 percent in2007. Similarly, there was
a significant decrease in the debt-to-exports ratio from 350 percent in 2002 to 120 percent in
2007.

 14.   Higher growth and the inception of well targeted social policies resulted in
pronounced poverty and income inequality reductions. The poverty rate dropped to 24.1
percent in 2007 from 26.5 percent in 2006 (and from 32.9 percent in 2003). The drop was due
mainly to higher economic growth and well targeted conditional cash transfer programs (such as
the Bolsa Familia), as well as increases in labor income and a decline in unemployment (from
over 12 percent in 2003 to below 9 percent in 2008). The Gini index also fell to 0.56 in 2007
(from 0.58 in2003).

 15.   Despite these remarkable improvements, the Brazilian economy still faces challenges
delineated by the new external scenario in the short run and for the achievement of a
sustainable growth in the medium and long run. Albeit increasing, capital formation is still
low, at around 20 percent o f GDP, and may be an obstacle to more robust and sustained growth.
In addition, there are increasing concerns regarding the quality of fiscal adjustment.         In fact,
fiscal adjustment has been accomplished through strong revenue increases and curtailing public
investment. The tax burdengrew to over 36 percent in 2008, and federal government investment
representedonly about 0.8 percent o f GDP. The growth o f current expenditures, especially social
security and public sector salaries, represents a main source o f fiscal risks and expenditure
rigidity. Despite social security reforms in 1998, social security deficits and debt remain
persistent, and government announcements indicate that the prospects for substantial reforms are
remote through 2010. High taxation and government consumption and low public investment
limits Brazil's growth potential.

16.   On the external side, while the performance of the external sector has made the
Brazilian economy more resilientto adverse shocks, the fall in commodity prices triggered
by the worldwide financial crisis will curb the current growth cycle. Brazilian exports are
concentrated in commodities such as iron, oil, soybeans and meat, which represent 70 percent o f
exports. The sharp rise o f their prices not only resulted in the growth o f exports but also fostered
large gains in terms o f trade. This improved the purchasing power o f the country and resulted in
the increase o f domestic consumption and investment. Therefore, the current decline in
commodity prices will deteriorate the trade and current account balances (that could be difficult
to finance in the current tight international financial situation), reduce the country's purchasing
capacity, and decelerate domestic demand.




                                                  5

17.    Finally, the recent lack of a robust agenda of structural reforms may cause larger
adjustment costs for the Brazilian economy in dealing with the new and less favorable
external scenario. On the fiscal front, the increasing trends in personnel and social security
expenditures will impose higher costs for the maintenance o f the current prudent fiscal stance.
This may be expressed in lower public investment levels in a context o f declining economic
activity and fiscal revenues. On the external side, despite the increasing participation o f Brazil in
international trade, the country i s still relatively closed. As a result, external adjustments to cope
with the worsening external environment and trade and current account balances would require
larger movements o f the exchange rate, with negative effects on price stability. Labor market
reform and reform to enhance the competitiveness o f the country would alleviate the adverse
shocks that the country will need to weather inthe current international financial crisis scenario.


B. MACRO-ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

18.    Despite its increasedresilience,Brazil has been hit hard by the global financial crisis.
Over September - December 2008, the stock market fell 32 percent, sovereign spreads increased
by 72 percent, and the BRL depreciated by 40 percent. Such movements reflect the relevance of
commodity stocks in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index (IBOVESPA), increasing risk
aversion and the fact that the BRL, i s a commodity currency (correlated with global economic
activity).

19.    The global slowdown has quickly impacted the real sector. Industrial production in
November fell 5.2 percent from the previous month, or 6.2 percent year on year. Leading
indicators suggest a further reduction in December. Retail sales, capacity utilization and
employment also fell. The formal sector lost 655,000 jobs in December (190,000 seasonally
adjusted). Market consensus forecasts for GDP growth in 2009 fell from 2.4 in November to 2
percent in December. Despite this larger and faster than initially expected slowdown, the growth
estimate for 2008 i s being maintained at 5.3 percent.

20.   A significant slowdown is expected in 2009 causing a decelerationthat will interrupt
22 quarters of economic expansion. Current growth rate forecasts vary around 2 percent,
depending on assumptions regarding the speed o f recovery o f credit markets, the depth and
length o f the global slowdown5, and government fiscal and monetary policies. More optimistic
expectations are based on the fact that domestic demand has been the driving force o f the growth
increase o f the last few years and on the possibility that the adverse external shock would be
attenuated by domestic demand growth, especially from an expected government expansionary
stance. Pessimistic views cite the expectation of a strong credit contraction and o f substantial
losses o f terms o f trade due to the fall in commodity prices that would reduce sharply domestic
demand and economic activity.



 The projectionscitedhere and summarized in Table 2 are based on assumptionsof: world economic growth rates
of 1% in 2009 and 3% in 2010 (projectionsfrom Unified Survey FY09); and growth rates oftrade volume of 5% in
2009 and 8.8% in 2010 (projectionsfrom Unified Survey FY09), with commodity prices forecasts from DECPG.



                                                      6

21,    To copewith an expected economic deceleration,the Governmentrecentlyannounced
a reductionof the primary surplus target for 2009 from 4.3 percent to 3.8 percent(and still
forecasts GDP growth in 2009 at 4 percent). The Government has announced its intention to
maintain its ambitious investment plans under the Program for Acceleration o f Growth (PAC).
The reduction in public debt could open space for countercyclical fiscal policies. The fact that
Brazil could find additional fiscal space to smooth the expected economic downturn o f economic
activity i s a novelty. The recent forward-looking debt management policies that have allowed the
public sector to become a net foreign exchange creditor mean that, unlike in the past, a
depreciation o f the BRL i s reducing net public sector debt and turning fiscal policies into a
stabilizing factor amidst the current global crisis.

22.   Nonetheless, the effect of the deceleration in economic activity on revenue collection
would frustrate the adoption of countercyclical fiscal policies and the implementation of
investment plans given strong spending rigidity. In any case, a slight increase in the overall
deficit i s expected from 1.7 percent o f GDP (projected for 2008) to 2.2 percent in2009. With this
overall deficit and the better profile o f debt amortization, there i s a very small probability that



                                                          7

 these public sector financing needs will not be met even in the case o f a deepening o f the
 international financial crisis6.

 23.     In the exercisingof countercyclicalpolicies, and with positive inflationprospects, the
 Central Bank has initiated a cycle of easing monetary policy to avoid a strong slowdown in
 economic activity. Consumer inflation has beenfalling since November, and further deceleration
 o f inflation is expected, with the market forecasting a rate o f 5 percent in 2009. Drawing on the
 credibility it built up in the last decade, the Central Bank reduced interest rates by 100 basis
points inJanuary, from 13.75 percent to 12.75 percent.

24.      Differentlyfrom other external adverse shocks episodes, the present crisis has hit the
 private sector harder. Though the financial sector is solid and Brazil has experienced a strong
private credit expansion in the last few years, a relevant source o f vulnerability for the private
 sector i s the corporate sector's high exposure to exchange rate risk. The recent episodes o f
extreme volatility in stock and foreign exchange markets were triggered by the liquidation o f
corporations' speculative foreign exchange positions, which lowered their borrowing costs by
"betting" on a stable or appreciating BRL.The losses associated with such exposures may induce
corporate distress. They are, however, unlikely to create major problems in the banking system
which, as a whole, is long indollars, well capitalized, and with low leverage.

25.      Even more relevant, the credit crunch has affected Brazilian firms and small banks
that rely in foreign credit lines'. The liquidity squeeze is becoming a serious distress factor
that could deepen the real growth slowdown as well. In addition, the concerns about the fall in
commodity prices and corporate problems regarding exchange rate exposure have led to a sharp
fall in the IBOVESPA. Finally, the corporate sector has a large amount o f debt rollover risk in
the' external market that could generate additional vulnerabilities in a continued high risk
aversion scenario.

26.      One of the transmission mechanisms of international financial turmoil to the
Brazilian economy is private credit. Total credit has been growing at a very high pace, with
annual growth rates superior to 25 percent in the last few years and, as mentioned above, has
been a relevant factor for the growth cycle experienced by the Brazilian economy. Total credit to
GDP reached 40 percent in 2007. More importantly, private credit (excluding directed credit) has
been growing at the faster rate o f 30 percent. Credit to firms has experienced the highest increase,
(44 percent), while consumer and real estate credit also have experienced a strong increase (34
percent). Therefore, due to its increasing importance in the last few years, a reduction o f credit
would have stronger effects in economic activity than inthe past.

27.      To avoid a sharp credit contraction,the Central Bank has also beenvery proactivein
the last months and intervened promptly to prevent bank runs, financial panic and a
domestic credit crunch. It has used a number of different instruments, including lower reserve


  Public debt is basically domestic and the country has a well developed debt market. On the external front, the
Brazilian public sector is a net creditor.

liabilities are in the form of deposits, so they do not need to rely on foreign credit lines.


                                                             8

requirements to inject liquidity, easier access to the discount window, and incentives for larger
banks to accept smaller banks' loans as collateral in the interbank market. In addition, as the
situation deteriorated, the Government issued a decree allowing federal financial institutions
(Banco do Brasil and Caixa EconGmica Federal) to take stakes in private banks in exchange for
liquidity support. Measures have also been undertaken to insure exporters' access to trade credit
lines. Inthe medium term, it i s expected that these measures will continue, as they have through
November, to have the desired liquidity increasing effects.         In similar manner, the aim of
ensuring adequate credit resources to the financial system is a key motivating factor of the
GOB'Srequest for the SEM DPL, as the proposed loan will also contribute to dollar liquidity.

28.   On the external front, opinions diverge on whether Brazil will be able to finance the
(expected) current account deficit in the currently tight internationalfinancial markets. In
2008, the current account deficit reached US$30 billion or 1.7 percent o f GDP. For 2009, an
equivalent level i s forecast. In fact, the effects o f the current worldwide crisis are difficult to
predict given the interaction o f counterbalancing forces. On the one hand, the fall in commodity
prices should reduce Brazilian exports. On the other hand, the exchange rate depreciation and the
slowdown in economic activity should reduce import growth and may benefit export
competitiveness. The net effect on the trade balance i s ambiguous, and this i s reflected in the
expectation o f a current account deficit varying between US$25-30 billion.

29.   The financing of this current account deficit, to a great extent, depends on how FDI
performs. IfFDIfalls from the current level o f US$35 billionto about US$25 billion (as market
expectations currently indicate) the need for adjustment will be minor, with FDIfinancing almost
entirely the current account deficit in2009. IfFDIdecreases further and/or ifthe corporate sector
were to find it difficult to roll-over its foreign currency debt, some additional adjustments may
instead be needed, such as a stronger depreciation o f the exchange rate or a deeper deceleration
o f economic activity.

30.   In summary, Brazil faces an unfavorable external scenario, but the consolidation of
the macroeconomic fundamentals in recent years makes the country able to mitigate the
effects of the current international financial crisis.      These fundamentals and the economic
policy framework based on fiscal discipline, the inflation targeting regime, and the flexible
exchange rate will allow the country to reduce the costs of the crisis. In addition, the downside
risks to the economy are being successfully addressed as the Government has been taking
appropriate measures to stabilize markets. Moreover, on October 29th, the United States Federal
Reserve included Brazil in the limited group of four countries (Mexico, Singapore, and South
Korea beingthe others) for which the central banks will each be provided access o f up to US$ 30
billion. The confidence shown inBrazil through this measure by the Federal Reserve would also

   reinforce the short and medium term soundness o f the country macroeconomic position.
   Furthermore, on January, 6`h, the government successfully issued US$1 billion in 10-years bonds
   with a spread of 370 bps which suggests confidence in a strong Brazilian macroeconomic
   position.

   on a good policy framework but implementation varies by region and on the sectoral type o f
   impact.

   32.   Deforestationin the Amazon has averaged 19,000 km2over the past 30 years. These
   rates result from a combination o f economic forces, poor agricultural practices, weak property
   rights, and poor enforcement o f regulations. Such deforestation is impacting the climate, soil
   erosion, and biodiversity. As a result, 70 percent o f Brazil's COz emissions currently come from
   deforestation and change o f land use. Deforestation also causes social impacts as small farmers
   and forest dwellers are being displaced by land grabbers and the working conditions in informal
   logging and charcoal operations are below standard accepted practices.

   33.   Less than seven percent of the Atlantic Forest, a world biodiversity "hotspot," is left.
   Soil degradation, as a consequence o f agriculture and livestock grazing, i s becoming an
  increasingly serious problem. This changed landscape, with few riparian forests and little
  vegetation around water springs, i s also affecting the availability o f water to the 70 percent o f the
  Brazilian populationthat lives inthe region originally covered by Atlantic Forest.

  34.    BalancingWater Access and Quality. There is more fresh water available per capita
  in Brazil than in other upper-middle income countries, but its distribution is extremely
  uneven. About 70 percent of Brazil's freshwater is concentrated inthe Amazon Basin, whereas
  the semi-arid Northeast region, with 28 percent of the population, has only 5 percent of the
  country's water resources. There are major water stresses in many environmentally sensitive
  federal river basins due to scarcity, and pollution and weak application o f management
  instruments, including water rights (for example Paraiba do Sul, Piracicaba, Capivari, Jundiai -
  PCJ, and S ~ Francisco Rivers). Estimated environmental costs associated with water pollution
                  O
  inseven ofthe largest urban areas amounted to US$300 million per year. The solution involves
  not only significant investments in wastewater collection and treatment but also a major effort to
  promote cooperation among agencies and across the three tiers of government. One o f the key
  issues i s the lack o f reliable information and proper assessments o f water quality in the country,
  which i s essential to guide investment planning as well as policy reforms inthis area.


                                                    10

35.    Addressing Environmental Sanitation. Brazil shares with similar countries the
problems of water pollution, lack of sanitation and improper solid waste collection and
disposal that result from a large concentration of people in metropolitan areas. Problems
with sewerage and solid waste collection services also beset many smaller towns with scant
financial and managerial capacity to address them. Some 57 percent o f urban households are
connected to a sewerage system and 24 percent have septic systems, but the unevenness of
coverage i s even more dramatic for sanitation than for water supply. In addition, little o f the
collected wastewater i s treated. Coverage with sanitation i s highest in the relatively affluent
South and Southeast and lowest in the poorer states o f the North and Northeast. A large part o f
the unserved population lives in peri-urban areas, slums (favelas), and smaller towns, with
mainly lower-income populations.        The situation of solid waste management is even more
dramatic, with the majority o f the waste collected ending up in improperly managed open dumps
rather than in sanitary landfills designed to isolate leachate and capture methane emissions.

36.    Maintainingthe Share of Renewableenergy. The bulk (81 percent)of electric energy
generatedin Brazil is based on hydropower.Less than one third o f overall energy use relies on
traditional fuels, and commercial energy use per capita i s relatively low. Although favored with
a renewable energy matrix, Brazil i s faced with a large expansion o f demand for generation
capacity.   Official projections for the next decade point towards an annual growth rate in
electricity demand o f 4.4 percent, which i s slightly higher than the economy's growth rate (4.2
percent). Electricity consumption in 2015 i s expected to reach an average o f 600 million MWh
and meeting such demand would require an additional 3000 MW per year in firm generation
capacity. While current C02 emissions from electricity generation (about one ton per capita) are
low in comparison to other countries at the same income level, over the past few years most o f
the incrementaldemand has beenmetthrough oil-based thermo-electric plants.

37.   In the transport sector, about one-third of fuel comes from renewable sources
(primarily ethanol). Brazil is a leader in ethanol production with an annual production of 16
billion liters produced in just 6.5 million hectares with a projected demand increase o f 300
percent by 2030. Brazil i s also increasing biodiesel production to supply five percent o f the
domestic market. The challenge in both cases i s to ensure that the increased production comes
from improvement in agricultural practices and not from encroachment on natural habitats.

A.2 EnvironmentalManagementSystem

38.   Brazil has a developed environmental policy framework, to which steady and
significant improvementshave been made over the last three decades. The new Constitution
o f 1988 dedicated a specific chapter to the environment and definedthe broad competence o f the
various levels o f government. It also enshrined the requirement of environmental impact
assessments and the "polluter-pays''     principle, and strengthened conservation by declaring
selected biomes as national heritage, namely the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest, the Pantanal, the
Serra do Mar and the coastal zone.             Other relevant legal bases include the National
Environmental Policy Law (198l),       the Environmental Crimes Law (1998), the Forest Code




                                                  11

(created in 1965, amended in 1996), the Conservation Units National System Law - SNUC
(2000), and the National Water Resources Management System (SINGERH), among others.

39.    The National Environment Council (CONAMA) is responsible for formulating
general guidelines and norms for all environmental aspects, including licensing and control
o f most resource use activities and environmental quality and emission standards. In certain
fields (minerals and mining and indigenous peoples), the federal government has exclusive
competence. States and municipalities are responsible for supplemental legislation more targeted
to the local context, although lower levels can only impose more stringent rules and standards
thanhigher levels.

40.    Environmental management in Brazil is decentralized across the three tiers of
government - federal, state and municipal. Most o f the environmental licensing and
enforcement i s under the responsibility o f municipal and state agencies. The effective
implementation o f the environmental policy framework varies significantly by region and on the
sectoral type o f impact. Compliance with environmental legislation i s best in the most developed
states, notable those inthe Southeast and South regions o f Brazil, which have good state agencies
and where the larger municipalities have municipal environmental agencies. Northern states face
additional challenges in enforcing the law due to the great distance between cities and the
remoteness o f many areas.        In addition, throughout the country, the environmental policy
framework i s enforced much more effectively for urban issues (e.g., air and water pollution) and
point-source pollution (e.g., emission from factories) than for rural issues (e.g., the legal reserve
inprivate land, water use) or large infrastructure(constructionofroads, hydroelectric dams, etc).

41,    Environmental management in Brazil is largely based on command-and-control
instruments.       The three main types of instruments for command and control are: (i)
environmental quality and emission standards; (ii)land use regulations; and, (iii)    environmental
licensing.

42.    Environmental quality and emission standards are defined by CONAMA, although states
can apply more stringent standards. Over the past three years, CONAMA has issued resolutions
for a diverse set o f issues including: by-product discharges in rivers; simplified licensing for
water and sanitation systems; emission standards for air quality; definition o f environmental
impacts for the purpose o f the Forest Code; and, regulation o f the information system regarding
environmental management o f forests.

43.    Landuse regulations include "zoning" and establishment o f protected areas. Urban zoning
i s the responsibility o f municipalities, whereas Ecological Economic Zoning (ZEE) involves the
states, municipalities, private sector and civil society, under guidelines and methodologies issued
by the federal government. The GOB has created an inter-ministerialworking group (Consortium
ZEE Brazil) to develop standards and methodologies and to provide assistance to state ZEE,
which i s now being implemented in several states, especially in the Amazon. However, where
zoning has been completed, it has not been fully implemented because o f a lack of economic
instrumentsthat promote the adoption of the recommended land use by the private sector.




                                                  12

44.   All three levels of government establish public protected areas. In addition, the Forest
Code provides for the maintenanceof natural vegetation cover ineach private rural property as a
"legal reserve" (LR), ranging from as much as 80 percent of properties inthe Amazon rain forest
to 20 percent in other parts of Brazil. In addition, properties must maintain areas of permanent
protection (APPs) that include riverbanks, headwaters, and steep slopes. The property owner can
sustainably manage the natural resources of the LR but not of the APPs.            Several states are
implementing systems to monitor compliance with these requirements, to issue permits for
clearing, and to fine those in non-compliance. This has led to an increase in the use of a type of
legal agreementto reforest the illegally cleared area as defined by the Forest Code.

45.   Environmental licenses are at the core of environmental management. Public and private
projects or activities considered to be potentially polluting (or representing a risk for
environmental degradation or communities) require licenses and (in some cases) broader
environmental impact assessments. Licenses are granted mostly by state environmental agencies.
Municipalities or the federal government may be responsible, depending on the size, nature, and
location of the activity.

46.   The licensing systemis thorough in Brazil, and particularly clear for point source pollution,
as federal, state, and municipal agencies enforce the same standards and guidelines (i.e., those
specified by CONAMA).          However, the licensing process for broader non-point source
environmental impacts (e.g., large infrastructure projects) i s more challenging. First, guidelines
for assessing and mitigating these broader impacts are not comprehensive. Second, the lack of
comprehensive guidelines means that federal and state levels seek to establish such de facto
guidelines separately, causing variability inthe quality of the licensing process.

47.   The quality of environmental outcomes is typically manifest inthe following ways: (i)the
inadequate consideration of cumulative impacts in environmental impact assessments (EIAs),
owing to the lack of clearly phased planning of infrastructure in the federal government's
investment program (e.g., transport, energy, and regional development); (ii)the variable quality
of terms of reference (TORs) issued by IBAMA for EIAs owing to the lack of operational
manuals and multidisciplinary teams; (iii)  the often poor quality of the EIAs submitted by project
proponents and the subsequent uneven evaluation of the EIAs by IBAMA, and, (iv) the
insufficient number and qualifications (areas of expertise) of IBAMA staff to accompany the
process from preparing the TORs to monitoring the implementation of the requirements set forth
inthe approvedEIAs.

48.   Economic (market-based) instruments actually in use are few. Instruments to influence
behavior are rare and only recently employed. The same is true for market creation instruments,
such as tradable permits. Examples of economic instrumentsin use related to forestry include:
(i)areforestationfee chargedonthevolume oftimberexploited, to bepaidinlieuofactual
reforestation by owners (which i s their other option); and, (ii) a forestry tax inthe state of Minas
Gerais, applied on forest products consumed by industry. (This forestry tax finances the state's
forest agency and has created incentives for reforestation and substitution of traditional fuels by
charcoal).




                                                 13

49.   Water charges are an economic instrument recently introduced as part o f the new water
resource management system. The legislation recognizes water as an economic good, to be
charged for in order to achieve efficient allocation and raise resources for basin water resource
management.      River basin committees are free to define prices, but must follow general
principles including investment and rationing targets. The National Water Agency (ANA) is
responsible for federal rivers and can also delegate authority to state agencies and can assign
water charge revenues to basin agencies.

50.   The Role of BNDES in EnvironmentalManagement. BNDES is an emergingactor in
Brazil's environmental management system, and its size and visibility confer BNDES
significant influence in environmentalmanagement in three main ways. First, it promotes
upstream adherence to Brazil's environmental laws and regulations through its internal review
procedures, thereby efficiently supplementing the downstream enforcement role played by
federal, state, and local environmental agencies. Secondly, it helps to reduce the negative impact
o f the lack o f clarity regarding the licensing o f complex non-point source impacts (noted in
paragraph 46 above) by developing more detailed criteria for the evaluation o f environmental and
social impacts o f projects o f this type. Third, it seeks to promote improved environmental and
social outcomes through programs for green investments, adoption o f the principles o f the Green
Protocol, and promotion o f both o f these initiatives with its financial intermediaries.

5 1.  In this first area, with the aim of reducingits risks associated with the environmental
and social impactsof projectsit finances, BNDES enacted in 2005 an EnvironmentalPolicy
establishing broad objectives to adhere to Brazilian environmental legislation and to conduct due
diligence through a dedicated Environmental Department within the Planning Directorate. Since
2006, BNDES has supplemented its verification o f borrowers' compliance with established
regulations with its own sectoral guidelines (Le,, mining, infrastructure, commerce and services,
processing industries, and agribusiness). Currently, BNDES i s enhancing its operational policy
by incorporating good practices for the promotion o f improved social outcomes in these sectors
with the aim of having a new combined Environmental and Social Institutional Policy. This
Policy will consist o f one or several resolutions/decisions o f the BNDES Board, will integrate an
improved version o f the Environmental Policy and the future Social Policy, and will be
supplemented by sub-sectoral guidelines which are the translation o f these policies into
operational procedures. (Annex 8 provides more background on BNDES and the rationale for
further reforms to its environmental and social policy framework.)

52.   Secondly, with an increasing role in infrastructure and agribusiness, BNDES
frequently encounters the shortcomings of the licensing of investmentswith broader non-
point source impacts In response, BNDES is developing detailed sub-sectoral guidelines,
which clarify specific approaches to environmental challenges in over 60 sub-sectors (e.g.,
hydroelectric plants, co-generation using sugar cane bagasse, roads, livestock production, etc.)
These sub-sectoral guidelines will incorporate the guidance on improvements to environmental
and social risk analyses, evaluation, and monitoring embodied in the new Environmental and
Social Institutional Policy. The sub-sectoralguidelineswill enhance the clarity of procedures
(particularly regarding broader non-point source impacts) to enterprises that seek to
comply with public environmental policies and to see the licensing process more
consistently improveenvironmentaland social outcomes. Insome cases, BNDES has already


                                                  14

 gone beyond the legal requirements and adopted criteria to further strengthen the social and
 environmental sustainability o f a given sub-sector. This i s the case o f the forest certification
 requirement for all forest management operations.

 53.     In targeting the third objective of promoting improved environmental and social
 outcomes more broadly, BNDES is also starting to play a more prominent role in green
 lines of business that promote the sustainable use o f natural resources. Planted forests for paper,
 pulp, charcoal, timber, and native forest management for timber and non-timber products, C D M
 projects, and rehabilitation of degraded areas are key areas targeted by BNDES, in addition to
 BNDES' more traditional environmentally related areas of water supply, solid waste
 management, and energy efficiency. In view of its relativesize* and largenumber of financial
 agents, BNDES can also serve as a benchmark for other financial institutions to adopt
 upgraded environmental policies and procedures.                 By phasing in the application o f its
 environmental and social policies, currently applied only to its direct operations, to those which it
 funds through over 70 financial intermediaries, the degree of attention to environmental and
 social sustainability will be substantially raised. Lastly, since BNDES i s a current signatory to
the Green Protocol (GP), the internalization of the GP into BNDES' environmental and social
 guidelines could have a large effect on investments, within both BNDES' direct and indirectly
 financed portfolios.

A.3 Government's OverallProgramand ParticipatoryProcesses

 54.     The GOB approvedits 2008-2011NationalPlan (PPA) in 2007. This PPA is the result
 o f an ample consultation process conducted by the President's office with the direct participation
 o f all ministers. The process included many regional and thematic meetings involving over 2,200
 institutions from the private sector, CSOs, grassroots organizations, and state and municipal
 agencies. The overall goals o f the PPA are to promote development with social inclusion, quality
 education, and care for the environment, which are pursued under eight priority themes, through
 actions to: (i)promote growth and income distribution; (ii)improve education; (iii)            increase
production and competitiveness; (iv) expand consumption; (v) sustainable use o f natural
resources; (vi) improve infrastructure (including urban); (vii) reduce inequality among regions,
 and (viii) strengthen democracy and participation.

55.    The PPA recognizes that environmental preservationand valuation must be present
for all developmentprocesses to be sustainable. This is a "mandatory" agenda for Brazil and
the international community, as Brazil has some o f the most important "natural riches o f the
world". To this end, the PPA presents a series o f programs and plans to ensure that "economic
growth i s conditioned on the sustainable use o f natural resources, without affecting the capacity
o f future generations to use such resources to address their needs."

56.    The environmentally related agenda on which the PPA focuses includes:(i)improving
the licensing system; (ii) decreasing deforestation and desertification and improving biodiversity
conservation inall biomes; (iii)  improving water resources management to increase water quality
and availability for the population, control pollution, and revitalize water basins; (iv) increasing
the contribution of the sustainable use o f natural resources and protected areas to national
development; and, (v) promoting environmental management, sustainable production, and
consumption in rural and urban areas, as well as in areas o f traditional communities and
indigenous peoples.

57.    The GOB is working aggressively to decrease deforestation in the Amazon. It is also
promoting the expansion o f water and sanitation programs, sustainable biofuel production, and
energy efficiency measures. It is also trying to improve the environmental licensing system and
raise the level o f performance requirements in terms o f quality of environmental impacts
assessments. The GOB has also made it clear that an increase of agriculture production should
come from increased productivity inthe already cleared areas to prevent additional deforestation.

58.    In order to advance the environmental policy agenda, the GOB has adopted an
extensive bottom-up participatory process. A 2003 Presidential decree established the
National Environmental Conference as a biennial regional and national consultation process for
the continuous advancement of environmental policies. The GOB defines a guiding theme for
each conference. The first conference focused on strengthening the environmental management
system in all tiers o f government, the second on integrated environmental policies for the
sustainable use o f natural resources, and the third on climate change. The theme i s then discussed
in many municipal meetings, and subsequently in state meetings. The state meetings elect
delegates to participate in the National Conference, which present the conclusions and
recommendations o f the meetings and vote on any resolution proposed during the Conference. A
large part o f the GOB environmental reform agenda to be supported by the SEM DPL was a
result o f these conferences.

59.    The GOB also used participatory processes to design the Sustainable Amazon Plan
(PAS) and the National Water Resources Plan (PNRH) to be supported by the SEM DPL
series. The process includes the drafting of the document by an intersectoral committee, followed
up by a series of consultation meetings with the specific stakeholders. In addition, the draft
document i s disclosed on the internet for comments from the general public. For example, the
PAS was drafted by an intergovernmental committee, established by a Presidential decree,.
comprised by ten ministers and all nine state governors of the Amazon region. This draft was
posted on the internet while consultation meetings were held in all nine states, in addition to two
national meetings. This process resulted in a Plan which has a strong buy-in from all sectors o f

Brazilian society as evidenced by the endorsement of the PAS by the Coordenaqfio dus

(GTA)' at its public signing ceremony.


B. IMPROVINGTHE OVERALL ENVIRONMENTALMANAGEMENTSYSTEM

B.l EnvironmentalChallenges and Government Strategy

60.    Brazil environmental management policy framework has evolved substantially over
the past thirty years.     The National Environmental Policy was enacted in 1981, but was
implemented through several uncoordinated agencies in different ministries until 1989 when
these agencies were merged, and the National Environmental Institute (IBAMA) was created
with the mandate to enforce the entire breadth of environmental policy, reporting directly to the
President of Brazil. In 1992, the Ministry of Environment (MMA) was created, and IBAMA was
repositioned as an affiliate agency of MMA. More recently, it became clear to the GOB that in
order to improve effectiveness inimplementing the environmental policies and to best respondto
current challenges (particularly climate change), MMA needed to be restructured and IBAMA
divided into separate and more agile agencies, focused on separate aspects of the environmental
agenda: conservation, forest management, and environmental licensing.

61. Nonetheless, IBAMA does not have sufficient staff for analyzing the environmental
and social impacts associated with complex non-point source impacts (e.g.,                           large
infrastructure that affects more than one state, oil and gas drilling in coastal areas, and
other areas noted above), though this is a major part of IBAMA's mandate. The range of
skills needed includes biologists, ecologists and social scientists, and the lack of such staff causes
the EIA review stage to be often not comprehensive. This can result in poor mitigation and
remediation of environmental and social impacts, though these are often identified through
judicial challenges by the Public Prosecutor's Office during the EIA review stage and the
associatedpublic consultations.

62.    In response to the emerging threat of climate change, Brazil has positioned itself as
one of the international leaders, playing an important role in the negotiation of the Climate
Change Framework Convention and the related Kyoto Protocol. Brazil leads Latin America on
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects with 146 of the 379 UNFCCC registered
projects for the region, representing an annual reduction of 19.5 million metric tones of C02
equivalent. The sectoral areas covered include, wind mills, small hydroelectric plants, solid waste
management, co-generation from biomass and agribusiness.

63.     In2000, the GOB created the NationalForum for Climate Change with the objective
of raising the awareness of Brazilian society about the issue and assisting the GOB in
defining ways to tackle the climate change agenda in different sectors. The National Forum
for Climate Change i s comprised of ministers and representatives from the private sector,


9COIAB and GTA combined represent over 900 NGOs, grassroots organizations, and indigenous peoples from the
Brazilian Amazon.


                                                 17

academia and civil society. Meanwhile, the GOB is implementing several sectoral plans that
contribute to climate change mitigation (e.g., the promotion o f the long-standing ethanol
program, a new program to promote biodiesel, the program for reducing deforestation in the
Amazon, and others), but these programs are not yet adequately coordinated.

64.   Similarly, several institutions are developing strong expertise in climate change
related fields but not yet as part of a coordinated effort. The Brazilian Space Agency (INPE) is
developing climate change scenarios for the country and recently also collaborating on World
Bank analytic work focused on estimating the probability of Amazon dieback resulting from
global warming and the resulting impacts on the national and regional rainfall cycle. Given the
cross-sectoral nature o f the climate change agenda, the challenge o f the GOB i s to develop a
coherent climate change plan that brings together existing programs, studies and institutions, and
identifies gaps for future action. This plan must be coordinated by an adequately staffed unit
capable o f coordinating and monitoring the plan's implementation, maintaining the Forum as a
consultative body.

65.   The GOB recognizes that enforcement of environmentalpolicies through command-
and-control needs to be balanced with initiatives that promote good environmental
practices.Recognizing the positive role that the financial system could play in promoting good
practices, in 1995 the GOB designed the Green Protocol (GP), which was signed by all federal
banks. However, that version o f the GP defined only general recommendations for the signatory
banks, did not have reporting and coordinating mechanisms, and suffered from lack o f
implementation. The banks tended to improve their internal process and became "greener", but
did not follow all o f the recommendations to improve the environmental sustainability o f their
financing practices.

B.2 Actions Supportedby this Operation

66.   The SEM DPL Iassists the GOB inimproving effectiveness of government agencies inthe
implementation o f mandated Brazilian environmental and social management procedures. An
important step which has been agreed with the GOB to target improved implementation i s the
appropriate strengthening in terms o f staff complement o f key institutions, since understaffing
has prevented them from carrying out critical policy implementation and enforcement (as noted
above). A new institutionalstructure for MMA and IBAMA (particularly to improve the
licensing functions) has been officially established, and the process to hire and train 300
new staff members for MMA and 610 for IBAMA has been completed. This action
represents a 300 percent increase o f MMA's permanent staff and 10 percent o f IBAMA's. As
part o f the MMA's restructuring, the GOB created the Secretariat for Climate Change and
Environmental Quality and the Secretariat for Institutional Coordination and Environmental
Citizenship.

67.   An additional step for the restructuringof IBAMA has been the recent creation of
two other institutionswhich have taken up former IBAMA functions. The first i s the Chico
Mendes National Institute for Conservation o f Biodiversity (ICMBio), dedicated to manage the
federal protected area system and promote the conservation o f biodiversity, particularly o f



                                                18

endangered species. The other i s the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB), dedicated to support the
forest resources management in public land. Without these former functions, IBAMA can now
focus on environmental licensingand general enforcement.

68.    A trigger for the SEM DPL I1would be that the GOB formally conclude the selection
and hiring processes to fill 600 vacancies to staff MMA, IBAMA ICMBio and SFB, in line
with their responsibilities for environmental management, and allow seconded staff to
return to IBAMA. ICMBio and SFB were created without the provision for adequate staffing.
As a result, both have hired only fixed-term staff or have seconded staff from other agencies,
until they are authorized by the GOB to hire permanent staff, The secondment of staff from
IBAMA has put greater stress of IBAMA's ability to execute its environmental licensing role,
particularly with respect to complex non-point source environmental impacts. Thus, it i s crucial
that a sufficient number o f staff be hired to ensure the long-term effectiveness o f these newly
created institutions and IBAMA in fulfilling their mandates. The staffing increase i s necessary to
cover many protected areas currently lacking assigned staff, to accelerate the forest concessions
process, and to adequately support the environmental licensing process.

69.    In addition to the actions for the SEM DPL series noted above, the GOB'S program
encompasses a wider set o f actions to improve the transparency of the environmental licensing
process.     In response to a "Transparency Law" approved by Congress that establishes the
mandatory disclosure of environmental information, including the status of the environmental
licensing processes, IBAMA designed a system to make environment licensing information
accessible to the public over the internet. The next step beingtaken by IBAMA i s the design o f a
module to provide information on the monitoring o f implementation o f requirements under the
licenses, including environmental and social mitigations plans.                 These actions contribute to
making the environmental licensing process more robust.

70.    The GOB is also promoting the integration o f environmental management among its three
tiers, including environmental licensing processes. All 27 states have established tripartite
(federal, state and municipal) committees to discuss and agree on common regulations to clarify
the responsibilities of each tier, and on consistent criteria and procedures for licensing. A draft
law has been submittedto Congress defining environmentaljurisdiction among the three tiers o f
government, including the authority to issue environmental licenses.

71.    As noted above, without this law there is significant confusion among the respective
federative bodies regarding their designated responsibilities vis-a-vis non-point source impacts
related to infrastructure, which leads to environmental licensing issues and requires the frequent
intervention o f the Public Prosecutor's Office". From 1996 to 2005, about 30 percent o f the
environmental licensing processes for hydroelectric projects conducted by IBAMA started as
state-level licensing, and were transferred to IBAMA after a judicial decision was taken in
response to requests by the Public Prosecutor's Office. The subsequent steps under the GOB
program will be the adoption o f the new law and the issuance o f regulations necessary for the full
application o f the new law in order to ensure the clear division of responsibilities among the


loThe role of the Public Prosecutor's Office in environmental management is discussed in more detail in Annex 7
(paragraph 6) on Environmental Institutions.


                                                        19

three tiers o f government, thereby improving clarity to public and private sector investors on
procedures for producing improved EIAs and environmental and social mitigation plans.

72.   Complementing these actions, the GOB'S program targets the expansion o f the system
which has been developed to monitor and evaluate state environmental management performance
under the National Environmental Program to cover all states. (Currently, this system monitors
nine thematic areas of environmental management performance and covers 20 out of Brazil's 27
states). This i s a key step to ensure that the decentralization o f responsibilities maintains the
consistent application o f environmental legislation.

73.   The GOB is also revising national regulations for environmental damage compensations.
The current value o f fines or compensation for a particular environmental damage is not uniform
among agencies and tiers o f government. As a result, very few o f those fines are actually
collected as the value o f the fine i s subject to lengthy litigation. Thus, such revision would
contribute to strengthen environmental policy enforcement.

74.   The desired outcome o f this integrated new structure o f MMA and its affiliates and o f the
improved clarity, robustness, and transparency o f the environmental licensing process i s an
improved environmental licensing process using as a proxy the decrease by 20 percent in the
number of judicially challenged licenses by the Public Prosecutor's Office compared with the
numberofenvironmental licenses issued at the Federal level during2002-2007.

75.   The SEM DPL Ialso assists the GOB in mainstreamingclimate change in public and
private sector investments. As a prior action, a proposal of the National Climate Change
Action Plan   - NCCAP,     was approved by the Climate Change Inter MinisterialCommittee
and submitted for public consultation. The NCCAP proposal presents a balanced set o f
command-and-control and economic instruments covering both mitigation and adaptation
actions. On the mitigation side, it focuses on supporting the Clean Development Mechanism and
verifying emission reductions, capacity building, monitoring, and transfer o f clean technologies.
On the adaptation side, NCCAP focuses on supporting increased resilience o f potable water
supply systems, enhanced monitoring and alert systems for extreme climate events, investments
inpreventiveinfrastructure for floods, institutional capacity building incommunication, and risk
and disaster management. The SEM DPL Isupports the NCCAP in its proposed deployment o f
national economic instruments regarding land use changes related to decreased deforestation,
reforestation, afforestation and agribusinesses.

76.   A second tranche release condition is that the GOB, through its Climate Change
Inter-Ministerial Committee, approve the National Climate Change Action Plan after
public consultation. This is a crucial step to formalize the Plan and address the need of cross
linking actions carried out by different sectoral agencies and key actors in the economy, in
various aspects o f land use and land use change and inthe energy and water sectors.

77.   Given the important role which BNDES is playingin the environmentalmanagement
process, a trigger for the SEM DPL I1 would be that BNDES approve and operate its
intended clean development, C D M and other carbon-related programs in accordance with the



                                                20

National Climate Change Action Plan and its new Environmental and Social Institutional Policy.
These lines will be an effective contribution for the NCCAP, supporting the private sector in
adopting climate change mitigation and adaptation practices.

78.     The desired outcome o f the SEM DPL's support for the implementation o f the NCCAP by
federal ministries and BNDES i s an increase in planned signed reductions o f 20 million tons o f
C 0 2 equivalentlyear from C D M projects", other selected BNDES projects, and other actions
monitored under the NCCAP.

79.     The SEMDPL Iassists the GOB in improvingthe effectiveness of environmentaland
social management systems in BNDES and other financial institutions. The GOB has
updated the Green Protocol (GP) which was then signed by Federal Banks (BNDES,
CAIXA, BB, BNB and BASA). This GP is a marked improvement over the 1995 version and
strengthens the GOB'S commitment to support environmentally sustainable activities. The
signatory banks have agreed to promote policies and procedures aimed at financing development
with environmental responsibility through lines of credits and programs that enhance the quality
o f life o f the population, promote the sustainable use o f natural resources and the environmental
protection. In addition, the current GP 2008 defines clear guidelines for each one o f these
principles. For example, the harmonization principle calls for a common governance mechanism
among the signatories to exchange experiences and monitor the effective application o f the GP,
the development of a standard approach to get socio-environmental information from clients, and
the continuous improvement ofthe GP through a biennial review o fthe principles and guidelines
o f the GP 2008.

80.    A second tranche release condition is for the BNDES Board of Executive Officers to
approve a new Environmental and Social12 Institutional Policy, which includes the
provisionsof the Green Protocoland applies to BNDES' directly financedoperations. This
new Policy aims to provide clearer guidance on environmental and social risk evaluation,
categorization, and monitoring, as well as other principles covered by the Green Protocol. This
i s a crucial step as the previous attempt to establish the Green Protocol (1995) failed due to lack
o f actual implementation by Brazilian banks. BNDES has a key leadership role to play, as it i s
one o f the largest sources o f long-term financing in the country. Once BNDES implements the
GP, it will become a benchmark for other institutions to follow.

81.    A trigger for the SEM DPL I1would be that BNDES apply the new Environmental
and Social Institutional Policy to its full portfolio, including the operations managed by its
financial intermediaries (with procedures specified differentially for each major type o f
operation).

82.    In addition to the actions to be supported by this operation, BNDES has taken into
consideration environmental and social sustainability principles and actions when preparing its


  Current Brazilian CDM projects result in reductionsof 19.5 milliontons of C02 equivalent/year.
  A comprehensivespecification of necessary social impacts (primarily positive, though negative as well) to be
consideredin project screeningis beingtargeted for formalization in a new BNDES Social Policy. See Section VI A
Box 4 for a fuller coverage ofthis new BNDES Social Policy.


                                                      21

2009-2014 Strategic Plan (adopted inNovember 2008 by its Executive Board). To ensure the full
implementation o f these principles and actions, BNDES has created a separate Directorate for
Environmental and Social Sustainability (withinwhich the Environmental and Social Department
i s now located) and substantially elevated the status o f these cross-sectoral themes within the
institution. The additional financing o f the current ENV TAL would support activities to
strengthen the ownership and capacity o f BNDES staff and financial intermediariesto implement
these principles, including studies necessary to develop the social and environmental guidelines
for the different sub-sectors, and training for its operational staff and financial intermediaries.

83.   The desired outcome o f the SEM DPL's support for improving the effectiveness o f
environmental and social management systems in BNDES i s that 100 percent o f the projects
directly submitted to BNDES be screened and monitored according to the new Environmental
and Social Institutional Policy.


C.    IMPROVING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS INKEY SECTORS

84.   Selection of Key Sectoral Reforms. The sectoral focus of the SEM DPL has been
chosen to include key sectors in environmental management which satisfy the following
criteria: (i)remove or help clarify and address critical institutional bottlenecks; (ii)involve
policy reform that can serve as a catalyst for environmentally sustainable investments in the
public and private sectors; (iii)demonstrate an ability for economic instruments to be applied in
order to promote strong environmental benefits; (iv) demonstrate strong linkages to climate
change mitigation and adaptation; and, (v) keep project complexity manageable.

85.   This approach to defining the sectoral scope of the policy reform program improves
focus on policy implementationand involvesBNDES in a virtuous circle of interactionwith
national policy makers. This is to be achieved by targeting reforms that address policy
bottlenecks encountered by BNDES in the pursuit o f its lending in the targeted sectors. It also
functions through direct input back to national policy makers from the development o f BNDES
sectoral guidelines, which supplement national sectoral regulations to achieve sustainable
development. A key sector generally deemed important to the environmental agenda in Brazil,
and which has been excluded from the SEM DPL series, i s that o f air pollution. This conscious
exclusion has been made since the tackling o f air pollution beyond the setting o f the existing air
pollution standards would involve primarily action at the municipal level.

C1. NaturalResource Managementand Conservation

EnvironmentalChallenges and GovernmentStrategy

86.   Forests represent 64 percent of the Brazilian territory, or about 550 million hectares.
In addition to the role forests play in terms of biodiversity and climate, they are the basis for
timber, furniture, fire wood and coal production for domestic consumption, not to mention the
non-timber products, such as essential oils, rubber, nuts, fibers and many others. The forest sector
(including plantations for pulp and paper) i s responsible for about 4 percent o f the GDP and
general employment.


                                                  22

87.   The most promising forest resource, with good domestic and reasonable export
markets, as well as substantial employment prospects, is sustainably-harvested timber.
With over 100 commercially valuable tree species inthe region, the Amazon provides 25 million
m3/yearo f timber, o f which 65 percent is for the domestic market. Most o f this timber is coming
from unsustainable practices which lead to clear cut. One o f the main constraints for the
establishment of sustainable forest management in 30-year selective harvest rotations i s the lack
o f sufficiently long-term financing. If such financing were more readily available, then greater1
use could be made o f Brazil's network o f sustainable use protected areas. The main ones are the
Extractive Reserves (RESEX) and Sustainable Use Reserves (RDS), mainly for community
management, and the National Forests (FLONA) and State Forests.

88,   Over the last30 years, cattle ranchingand large-scalefarming have rapidly expanded
in the Amazon. About 18 percent of the Amazon has been deforested. Pastures account for
over 70 percent o f the deforested area, and soybean and other agricultural commodities
expansion seem to be displacing ranching northwards from the Cerrado (savanna) and into the
forest.   In addition, wasteful and unsustainable agricultural practices, such as poor pasture
management, contribute to the expansion o f the deforested areas without an equivalent increase
in agricultural area. About 165,000 km2of cleared forests, or 25 percent of all deforestation
recorded in the region, have been abandoned to secondary growth or grassland after less than ten
years o f use.

89.   The Forest Code provides for the maintenance of natural vegetation cover in each
private rural property as a "legal reserve" (LR), ranging from as much as 80 percent of
properties inthe Amazon rain forest to 20 percent in Brazilian biomes, and as areas o f permanent
protection (APPs). However, most o f the farms, especially in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest
biomes, are not in compliance with these requirements, putting an additional pressure on
biodiversity conservation in those regions. In addition, current unsustainable agricultural and
logging practices cause significant social problems including displacement o f persons, high
degree o f informality leading to reduced coping potential, and exposure to physical risks.
Moreover, they have significant negative environmental impacts, such as soil erosion,
overfishing, and, o f course, deforestation that accounts for about 70 percent o f the country's C02
emissions.

90.   All Brazilian biomes show signs of biodiversity loss. The most severe case is that of
the Atlantic Rain Forest. Deforestation in this region, which began 500 years ago, accelerated
during the 20th century. As result, the Atlantic Forest now occupies only 7 percent of it original
biome area. The definition o f conservation and sustainable management programs for these
important Brazilian biomes i s therefore o f utmost importance and should take the existing
economic activities into account.

91,   While the more comprehensive SustainableAmazon Plan (PAS) was beingprepared,
the GOB launched the Plan to Prevent and Combat Deforestation in the Amazon
(PPCDAM) in response to an increased deforestation in 2003. The PPCDAM involves 14
different ministries which developed and are implementing an integrated strategy to address the



                                                 23

issues o f deforestation, biodiversity loss and unsustainable agriculture and livestock productions.
This integrated strategy combines actions to improve the policy framework and regional land use
planning, strengthen institutions that focus on natural resource management and biodiversity
conservation, and curb illegal practices.

92.     To this last end, the PPCDAM is using a satellite monitoringsystem that locates new
deforestationareas every 7 to 10 days, comparedwith the previoussystem which registered
deforestation on only an annual basis. The new system has enabled frequent and targeted
enforcement actions against illegal activities which resultedin the recent seizing o f 55,000 m3o f
logs in one area, and the confiscation o f over 2,000 cattle present in an illegal ranch in another
area. In part due to these efforts, the rate o f deforestation in the Amazon in 2007 was 0.27
percent, down from 0.66 percent in 2004, in spite o f the record high commodity prices, which
historically would have caused an increase on deforestation. By the end o f 2007, the area o f
certified sustainable forest management in the Amazon reached 2.7 million hectares. These
successes o f PPCDAM have led the GOB to integrate it as one o f the key sets o f activities under
the more comprehensive PAS.

Actions Supportedby this Operation

93.    The SEM DPL I assists the GOB in improving sustainability o f natural resource
management and conservation by strengthening the forest legal framework. The GOB has
enacted three crucial legal acts affecting public and private lands and the highly
endangered Atlantic Forest biome, namely: (i) the Public Forest Management Law, (ii)
NationalMonetary Councilresolution3545, (iii)and the Atlantic ForestLaw.

94.    The Public Forest Management Law enables the establishment o f sustainable forest
management concessions through a competitive process in National Forests and other public
land. The same law, and related rules and regulations, determines that local communities should
be given preferential treatment when requesting concessions. The forest management guidelines
defined by the law are based on regional best practices, do not allow clear cutting, and encourage
forest certification by offering a 3 percent reduction on fees for certified operations. Hence, the
newlaw contributes significantly to the promotion of sustainable forest management by resolving
one o f the main constraints o f the sector, allowing access to forested areas in a legal and
controlled environment for responsible companies to work, and producing timber without
deforesting.

95.   The GOB, through the National Monetary Council, has enacted resolution 3545 mandating
the cessation o f bank lending to agricultural producers who do not present the necessary permits
requiredby environmental law. This far reaching resolution covers lendingto primary processers
o f agricultural products (meat packing, soybean crushers, ethanol producers, etc.) that outsource
the upstream part of their supply chain. The resolution also provides a clear incentive for many
farmers to comply with the requirement o f maintaining a track o f natural vegetation in their
properties (legal reserves and areas o f permanent protection). Inboth these cases, the resolution
assists environmental agencies to identify those producers who never requested any permit and
are not registered in the national land cadastre.       The Central Bank, as part o f its regular



                                                 24

monitoring o f the banks, verifies banks' compliance with the resolution. The state environmental
agencies verify actual compliance (through satellite imagery and field visits) o f existing and
newly registering farmers and issue the relevant licenses when compliance i s demonstrated.

96.    BNDES will further contribute to the implementation of this approach through its credit
line designed to support ranchers and farmers in the recovery o f Areas o f Permanent Protection
and Legal Reserves. In addition, this resolution and related GOB decree also put pressure on
those with precarious land claims as it requires that the land be inthe national land cadastre. As
each primary processer o f agricultural products has a large number o f suppliers (e.g., a meat
packing unit i s supplied by 600 to 800 ranches), this resolution and related decrees significantly
promotes sustainable agriculture and contributes to reducing land degradation.

97.    The GOB successfully exerted its political influence and Congress approved the Atlantic
Forest Law in 2007, 15 years after its original submission. This law protects the remaining 7
percent o f forest land, promotes reforestation with native species, provides economic incentives
for the conservation the biome, and authorizes the creation of the Atlantic Forest Fund.

98.    In targeting sustainableagricultural and forestry practices, a second tranche release
conditionof the SEM DPL Iis that BNDES restructureits programson forest management,
forest plantations, agriculture and associated processing industries to provide incentives for long-
term forest management and sustainable land useI3, and design the respective three sub-sectoral
guidelines (livestock, soya and ethanol/sugar) and the REFLORESTA Program (BNDES forest
management program) to ensure coherence with the new forest legal framework and BNDES'
new Environmental and Social Institutional Policy. Through this set of actions, BNDES will
contribute to the successful implementation o f the forest concession mechanism while ensuring
highquality environmental performance. The BNDES sub-sectoral guidelines for agriculture and
associated processing industries will also contribute to the effective implementation o f the
Resolution 3545, thus supporting sustainable agriculture and contributing to reduced land
degradation.

99.    The desired outcome targeted by the passage o f the three legal acts related to sustainable
agriculture and forestry and by BNDES support thereof i s an increase o f the sustainable forest
management area o f private and public areas from 27,000 km2in2007 to 50,000 km2in 2011,

100. The SEM DPL Iassists the GOB in developing a multi-sectoralsustainable plan for
the Amazon Region. The GOB and the governors of the Amazon regionofficially approved
the Sustainable Amazon Plan (PAS) to promote the sustainable development of the region
and of the local population. The PAS was designed through a participatory process by a
committee comprised o f 13 ministries and i s focused on: (i)            competitive sustainable production;
(ii)land administration and environmental management; (iii)social inclusion; and, (iv)
infrastructure for development.



13Improvedincentives for long-termmanagement include the lengtheningofthe tenor of loans and grace periods
available to investors,reducedinterestrates for project activitieswith demonstrably positive social impacts, and
direct adviceto project proponents on innovativetechnologies.


                                                         25

 101. The GOB has also piloted a new approach to sub-regional planning in the Amazon. An
inter-ministerial committee designed an Action Plan, through a participatory process, for the area
to be affected by the BR 163 highway. The plan i s being implementedwell before the GOB
starts the process to contract the highway paving. Among other activities, new protected areas
were created, and the GOB i s conducting joint operations involving the MMA, Ministry of
Justice, Ministry o f Defense and INCRA to police illegal deforestation in the region through
integration o f equipment and logistics. As a result, the deforestation rates in this area are
relatively low as compared to previous experiences in the region when the construction o f new
roads was announced.

102. A trigger for the SEM DPL I1 would be that the GOB concludes the macro ZEE of
the Amazon to indicate major land uses for the region. The macro ZEE (prepared at the
1:1,000,000 scale and based on the PAS) will then be available for use by the Amazonian states
to speed up the preparation process o f their state level ZEEs (1:250,000 scale). These state ZEEs
are fundamental to define land use in the states, as they identify the ecologically sensitive areas
that should be protected, the areas where sustainable forest management can be implemented,
and the best agriculture use for the already deforested areas. In addition, the signatories o f the
Green Protocol, including BNDES, must consider in their operations the recommendation and
restrictions imposed by the state ZEEs. As a result, the combination o f state and financial sector
actions based on the ZEEs will lead to promoting sustainable land use inthe states and reducing
land degradation time. In addition, the macro ZEE can be used to identify large tracks in the
Amazon for the creation o fprotected areas14.

103. The desired outcome o f the execution o f the first phase o f the PAS and the macro ZEE for
the Amazon is a reduction in the average annual rate of deforestation in the Amazon for the
period 2008-2010 to 20 percent below the 2005-2007 average annual rate o f deforestation
(14,800 h2).

104. The SEM DPL Ialso assists the GOB in promoting the protection of the Brazilian
Rainfore#. A Presidential decree was issued regulating the Amazon Fund to provide
grantsto governmentagencies (all three tiers of government)and civil society organizations
(CSOs) for projects that prevent, monitor or curb deforestation, or promote the conservation and
sustainable use o f natural resources. The Fundi s managed by BNDES and i s detailed inBox 1.

105. A trigger for the SEM DPL I1would be that the Amazon Fund ManagingCommittee
(COFA) approves the Fund's Operational Policies and the Fund be operational. The
Norwegian government has already pledged up to US$ 1 billion conditioned to the decrease o f
the deforestation rate. The Norwegian government also indicated that the overall initial
contribution o f US$140 million will be conditioned to the implementation o f the first US$22
million yet to be deposited. Thus, the fast and successful operationalization o f this fund i s
essential to ensure its long-term contribution to the sustainable development o f the Amazon, and
reduction indeforestation and carbon emissions.


14This was the case ofthe macroZEE for the state of Parawhich resultedin the creation of seven protected areas
encompassinga total of I0,000 km2.
l5Bothin the Amazon region and in the Atlantic Forestregion.


                                                      26

106. A trigger of the SEM DPL I1would also be that the GOB issues a Presidential decree
regulating the Atlantic Forest Fund, including its operational mechanisms.                           The
authorization to create this fund i s part o f the already approved Atlantic Forest Law, but meeting
this trigger would entail the decree actually establishing the fund and the definition of the Fund's
bylaws and operational policies. This Fund would play an important role in promoting
reforestation o f critical habitat and the conservation o f remaining forested areas, through grants
to CSOs and government agencies from all three tiers of government.

    Box 1-Amazon Fund
    The GOB created the Amazon Fund as its alternativeto receivecompensation for reducingCOzfrom
    deforestationwithout having to rely on market-based mechanisms. The Amazon Fund, created by a
    Presidentialdecree, will support the prevention, monitoring and combating of deforestation, and the
    promotionof conservation and sustainable use of natural resources in the Amazon, fully in line with
    the Sustainable Amazon Plan (PAS) and the Planto Prevent and Combat Deforestationin the Amazon
    (PPCDAM). The Fund will operate through grants focusing on the following activities: (i) forest
    management in public lands; (ii) management of protectedareas; (iii) monitoringand enforcement on
    environmental laws; (iv) sustainable use of forest resources; (v) zoning and land regularization; (vi)
    biodiversityconservationand sustainable use; and, (viii) rehabilitationof degraded areas.

    The Fund is managed by BNDES and will be capitalized only through donations from bilateral and
    multilateralagencies and the private sector. Donations will always be conditionedto the decrease of
    the annual deforestationrate when compared to the average annual rate of the past five years. Each
    donor will receive a non-tradable diploma stating the amount of the donation and the amount of
    carbon "saved' as a result of reduced deforestation.This informationwill be available to the public.
    A Technical Committee will be created to evaluate the methodologies to measure deforestation and
    the amount of carbon "saved" per hectare.

    The Amazon Fund has a Managing Committee comprised of 24 members (nine from the federal
    government, nine from the Amazonian states, and six CSOs). Its first task is to define the Fund's
    bylaws and operational policies. The Committee is also responsible for monitoring the portfolio to
    ensure that it is indeed supporting the PAS and PPCDAM, and periodically review its adherence to
    the Fund's bylaws and operationalpolicies.


107. The desiredoutcome of the SEM DPL's support for the Amazon and Atlantic Forest Funds
i s an increase to area o f 500,000 hectares receiving support from the Amazon and Atlantic Forest
Funds for activities that promote sustainable use of natural resources, biodiversity conservation,
rehabilitation of degraded areas or, prevent/ combat deforestation.

C2. Water Resource Management

Environmental Challengesand Government Strategies

108. Even though Brazil has 11 percent of all surface water worldwide and comparatively
high water availability, stock levels are becoming increasingly critical owing to the inverse
relationship between population concentration and the regional distribution of water resources.
This imbalance is exacerbated by the degradation of water bodies as a result o f agricultural,
urban and industrial pollution.



                                                   27

109. Northeast Brazil is one of the regions facing the most critical issues in terms of water
resources management. As a consequence of natural hydrological events, the Northeast's semi-
arid region i s exposed to long dry spells, aggravating the local environmental conditions, with
negative consequences for the region's economic and social development.                         The Northeast's
mainly crystalline geology severely limits groundwater, and nearly all o f the rivers are
intermittent, with flows only during the rainy season and no base flow. In the industrialized
South and Southeast regions, with nearly 60 percent o f the population, water quality problems are
severe, affecting the health o f poor populations, causing environmental damage, and increasing
the cost o f water treatment.

110. Brazil has had a Water Code since the 1930s, but the increase in demand and
institutional changes have overwhelmed the legal framework, which has had problems
promoting the appropriate means for achieving decentralized and participatory management o f
water resources, both o f which are necessary for adequate water resources management. In 1997,
Law 9433 took aim at overcoming this gap. It instituted the National Water Resources Policy
and established the National Water Resources Management System (SINGERH16).Furthermore,
the legislation in force takes into account the constitutionally mandated federal and state domain
over water resources and the importance o f all stakeholders' participation in water resources
planning and management.

111. Hence, SINGERH provides for the construction of a federative pact that integrates
water resources and environmental management and land use, and promotes concerted
and coordinated actions. The purpose is to assure the sustainable multi-sectoral management
and use o f water resources to support economic development, ensure social equity, and preserve
the environment.      The challenge i s to implement an innovative model for water resources
management with the participation o f the (i)     different sectoral government entities at the different
government levels; (ii) users; and, (iii)civil society. Inaccordance with international best
                          water
practices, the river basin i s considered the unit for water resource management.

Actions Supportedby this Operation

112. An important step supported by the SEM DPL I has been the development and
approval of the National Water Resources Plan (PNFW). This Plan is focused on priority
areas under the responsibility and control o f the Ministry o f Environment and its associated
National Water Agency (ANA), inwhich targeted actions aim to enhance the sustainability o f the
use and management o f water resources. The PNRH i s a key step forward inthe implementation
o f the focus o f the National Policy on Water Resources on the strengthening o f water resources
management institutions, improvements to the regulatory framework, and implementation o f
management instruments.




16The SINGERH comprises the NationalWater Resources Council (CNRH), the National Water Agency (ANA),
State Water Resources Councils, River Basin Committees, federal, state and municipal institutionsthat deal with
water management issues, and water agencies.


                                                     28

113. Also as a prior action, the GOB has approved the NationalWater Quality Evaluation
Program (PNQA). The program is based on partnershipsbetweenANA andthe states for which
technical agreements will be established in order to develop a national water quality monitoring
system, standardize assessment criteria and procedures, and increase availability of water quality
information to the public.

114. In addition, as a second tranche release condition, ANA would sign cooperation
agreementswith five states for the purposes of implementingthe PNQA at the state level.

115. A trigger for the SEM DPL I1would be that ANA sign cooperation agreements with
an additionalfive states for the purposes of implementingthe PNQA at the state level.

116. In furthering the goals of the PNRH, the GOB'Sprogram also supports further progress in
improving ANA'Scriteria and procedures for implementing regulatory instruments, including the
granting of rights for water resources use and the collection of fees for water resources use and
effluent `discharges at the basin level. This element of the PNRH allows for the legal
establishment of mechanisms for the qualitative and quantitative allocation, monitoring, and
control of water for different users. It applies discipline regarding water use and matches water
demand with availability, thereby contributing to the sustainable use of water resources. The use
of bulk water-charges is an additional important step towards sustainability, since these charges
provide for the financing of water resources management and for promoting water conservation.
This is a basin-wide participatory process that has been conductedinthe Paraibado Sul and PCJ
river basins and i s now underway inthe SZio Franciscoriver basin.

117. Insome basins, which have serious degradationof the upper watershed and upstreamwater
pollutionproblems that affect downstream water users, programs for Payment for Environmental
Services (PES) are appropriate and need to be designed and implemented. This has been
pioneered in the PCJ river basin to protect and conserve water sources of the Cantareira system,
which provides water to the SZio Paulo metropolitan region. The initiative is supported by the
federal government and involves partnerships with NGOs, municipal, and state organizations,
and is partially fundedwith revenuesfrom bulk water charges. Other initiatives being supported
by the GOB pwgram are under design inthe Paraibado Sul and Paranariver basins.

118. The desired outcome of the SEM DPL's support for the national Water ResourcesPlan and
the Water Quality Evaluation Program is an increase from 60,000 to 90,000 km of main rivers
monitored and evaluated for water quality and the data publicly released on a regular basis, with
results usedfor prioritizationof investments for improved water quality.

C3. EnvironmentalSanitation

EnvironmentalChallenges and Government Strategies

119. The lack of water supply, wastewater drainage, and solid waste services (known in
Brazil as basic sanitation) and the resultant environment contamination, especially with
fecal coliform, has major impacts on human health and infant mortality through diarrhea and



                                                 29

parasitic diseases. Although Brazil has experienced a sustained improvement in efficiency and
access to these services over the past few decades, regional inequalities remain. Access to
improved water supply in urban areas increased from 83 percent in 1990 to 93 percent in 2007,
and access to improved sanitation (wastewater collection and septic tanks) increased from 71
percent to 81 percent. Still, one o f the main challenges o f the sanitation sector in Brazil i s the
discharge o f untreated wastewater into waterways. Not only i s the percentage o f wastewater
treated low (at about 32 percent o f water sold and 59 percent o f collected wastewater), existing
facilities are poorly maintained and operated. As a result, a large portion o f the generated
wastewater i s being disposed without any treatment, and i s the main source o f pollution inurban
rivers. Therefore, more needs to be done in order to reduce glaring inequalities and to attain the
sanitation Millennium Development Goals, which Brazil will not achieve if the current level o f
investmentis maintained.

120. An existing program for wastewater treatment which already partially addresses this
challenge i s the PRODES program, under which ANA reimburses up to 50 percent o f
investments made by wastewater treatment utilities (over five year periods with disbursements
conditional on actual treatment o f wastewater per agreed volume and quality targets). Due to this
innovative approach which PRODES takes, its start-up has been slow. After having contracted
BRL. 52M o f agreed results in its initial year (2001), the volume o f contracts dropped to BRL.
36M in 2002-2004. No contracts were signed in 2005-2006, but the program i s now in
resurgence as ANA was able to contract about BRL 40M in 2007 and BRL, 120M in 2008. In
addition to variability in its financing, PRODES faces a problem o f geographic concentration in
the richest rivers basins o f the Southeast. Several reasons have been indentified why poorer
services providers are not able to access PRODES resources, and these include their inability to
provide upfront financing o f investmentsand/or lack o f technical capacity.

121. At the national level, the Ministry of Cities coordinates sector policies, which are
implemented by various Ministries, including the Ministry of Environment. Regulation of
service provision i s the responsibility o f the municipalities and states. Fourteen Brazilian states
have established regulatory agencies for public services that cover water supply and sanitation.

122. Accordingto the Brazilian constitution,the primary provisionof water and sanitation
services is the responsibilityof the country's 5,564 municipalities.However, in several cases
services can de defined as o f common responsibility o f states and municipalities, mainly in
complex integrated metropolitan services and inthe semi-arid region. State water and wastewater
companies are in charge o f water services in about 3,900 municipalities representing 103 million
people, or about 75 percent o f Brazil's urban population with water connections. These
companies are also in charge o f sewer services in about 900 municipalities corresponding to 45
million people, or about 55 percent o f the population with access to sewerage. Most state water
and wastewater companies are mixed public-private companies with the majority o f shares
owned by the respective state government.

123. Regardingsolid waste management(SWM), a 2007 study estimates that while 141,000
tons of waste are collected daily in Brazil, only 39 percent of the country's municipalities
dispose of their waste at an adequate final destination(i-e., a sanitary landfill). By contrast,



                                                 30

approximately 32 percent o f municipalities deposit waste in controlled landfills, and the
remaining 30 percent in open dumps, numbers that reflect the continued insufficiency o f SWM in
most Brazilian cities.

124. Regarding investments in the sector, the total investment in water and sanitation by
service providers participating in the national water and sanitation information system
(SNIS) in 2006 stood at BRL 4.5 billion, including BRL 1.8 billion for water, BRL 1.9 billion
for sanitation, and BRL 0.8 billion for other investments. The federal government's Program for
Accelerated Growth (PAC) i s expected to contribute to further raise annual investment levels in
the sector to about R$7.0 billion ($17 per capita or 0.27 percent o f GDP) per year, a 42 percent
increase over the average annual level of 2000-2006. Inaddition to these planned investments, a
further increase in the annual investment level of about BRL 11.O billion (and additional 0.42
percent o f GDP) would be needed to achieve universal access by year 2020.

Actions Supportedby this Operation

125. The SEM DPL Ibuilds upon the long-standingpolicy dialoguebetween the Bank and
the GOB on environmentalsanitationwith the recent approval of the new FederalLaw on
Guidelines for Environmental Sanitation (Law 11445, 2007). This law outlines national
guidelines, mandatory for municipalities and states, for implementing standards in sanitation as
provision o f sanitation services i s expanded.       One o f the law's main goals i s to increase
investmentsto provide universal access to water and sanitation, while taking into account local
specificities and usingappropriate technologies that are inline with users' ability to pay.

  Box 2 Law on Guidelinesfor Environmental Sanitation
         -
  The National Guidelines Law has identified sector regulation and planning as major steps to
   improve service coverage and efficiency, and sets mandatory actions to be taken by municipalities
  and states in these regards. Although it protects existing concession contracts with state and
  private providers, the law establishes that regulation and enforcement be carried out by
  independent agencies, and allows municipalities to either regulate through a local independent
  agency or to delegate regulationto other municipal, regionalor state agencies.

  The Law also states that services should be primarily financed by tariffs for water andwastewater
  and other charges for solid waste management, which should simultaneously be sufficient to
  cover efficient costs and allow access by the poor through social tariffs and subsidies. In general,
  the law encourages a more competitive and better regulated environment through: (i) the
  institutional separation of service providers and service regulators;(ii) the promotionof different
  alternatives for service provision; (iii) the promotion of social participation in sector policy,
  planningand regulation; (iv) the use of low-costtechnologies; (v) the development of financially
  sustainable pricing schemes that include subsidies for low-income families where required in
  order to assure universalaccess to basic services; and (vi) greater federative cooperation.

  In terms of environmental regulation, the Law establishes that environmental standards and
  licensingprocesses should be based on a gradual transition from the current situation.According
  to Article 44 of the law, environmentalauthorities should set progressive standards for effluents
  from wastewater treatment plants and develop a licensing process based on the complexity of
  treatment facilities and environmental impact. Some norms issued by CONAMA need to be
  revisedto be brought into alignmentwith the new legal requirements.



                                                  31

126. The GOB i s implementing the Law on Guidelines for Environmental Sanitation by
supporting the Ministry o f Environment and CONAMA in improving environmental regulations
regarding effluent standards, classification o f recipient water bodies, licensing procedures, and
classification and use o f sludge for agricultural purposes. To foster investment in wastewater
treatment plants, especially inpoorer regions o f the country, the National Law on Guidelines for
Environmental Sanitation establishes a gradual approach to the meeting o f these standards. This
strategy, which ensures the protection o f human health and environment, allows for a phased-
approach to take into account different absorptive capacities and classifications of receiving
bodies as well as to provide incentives for continuous improvements.

127. A second tranche release condition is that BNDES ensures that programs for water
and environmentalsanitationare coherentwith the new legal frameworkand BNDES' new
Environmentaland Social InstitutionalPolicy.

128. A trigger for the SEM DPL I1 is that the PRODES rules and regulationsgoverning
payments for wastewater treatment are updated and approved by ANA (in accordance
with the new legal framework) and that BNDES' two sub-sectoral guidelines on
environmental sanitation (solid waste management; and water, sanitation and drainage) are
designed to ensure coherence with the new legal framework and with BNDES' new
Environmentaland Social InstitutionalPolicy. Giventhe priority ofthe federal government in
addressing the challenge o f wastewater treatment and water pollution, MMA and ANA are giving
a renewed priority to PRODES as a key instrument to effectively improve water quality in the
country. As a result, ANA intends to update the programby conducting a rigorous assessment o f
i s rules, procedures and financing mechanisms, as well as o f the results achieved to date. The
Bank i s supporting this assessment through a technical assistance grant from GPOBA. In
addition, and building on the lessons o f PRODES, the government i s promoting the development
o f pilot schemes for results-based payments for solid waste management improvements.

129. More directly in solid waste management, the GOB drafted the National Solid Waste
Management Law, which has been submitted to Congress. The policies in this draft law set out
comprehensive approaches for waste collection, treatment and final disposal; policies to
minimize waste streams and maximize recycling and reuse; and the establishment o f
environmental quality standards, as well as a comprehensive regulatory framework for
development o f integrated solid waste management plans by local and state authorities. MMA
will further develop the regulations associated with this law neededto bring about its integration
with other relevant policies and available funds, such as the National Environment Program
(PNMA).

130. The desired outcome o f the SEM DPL's support for the implementationo f the Federal Law
on Guidelines for Environmental Sanitation by BNDES and through the PRODES program i s to
achieve additional projected reductions o f 110,000 tons of pollution loads (tons o f bio-chemical
oxygen demands - BODSper year) discharged into rivers from BNDES environmental sanitation
projects reviewedunder new BNDES social and environmental guidelines and from the updated
PRODESprogram17.

 C4. RenewableEnergy

 EnvironmentalChallenges and GovernmentStrategies

 131. By 2015, hydroeletric plants in Brazil are expected to provide around 75 percent of
 Brazil's installedelectricity capacity. Fossil fuels, especially natural gas based generation, are
 likely to increase their share in Brazil's energy matrix. Non-hydro renewable energy sources and
 energy conservation are expected to play a small but increasing role to reach a level o f energy
 security compatible with an expanding economy. In regions where the wind regime i s favorable
 (Northeast and South) the GOB i s stimulating (through guaranteed power purchases and special
tax regimes) the development o f wind projects. This i s further supported by government efforts
to promote the manufacturing o f technology components in Brazil. The use o f solar thermal
energy for residential water heating i s also expected to expand.

 132. Brazil's economically-viablehydropower potential is estimated at 260 GW, of which
70 GW is in commercial operation and 10 GW under construction.The Brazilian Amazon is
home to 43 percent o f the country's estimated hydropower potential. Therefore, one o f the most
pressing environmental challenges inthe development o f the energy sector i s how to best manage
habitat degradation and impacts on forest dwelling traditional and indigenous communities in
developing hydropower in the Amazon. These impacts can be minimized and mitigated by
improvements to basin-wide integrated planning o f the hydro sector, which specifically takes
direct and cumulative environmental and social impacts into account.

 133. For three decades, sugarcane ethanol has played an important role as a fuel in
individualvehicle urban transport. More recently, the flexible fuel automobile fleet (ethanol
or gasohol) and the production o f oil-rich plant based biofuels, used in mineral diesel mixes, has
increased and diversifiedthe use o f renewable liquid fuels makingthe Brazilian transport energy
matrix even less dependent on fossil based fuels (and therefore cleaner). In Brazil, the use o f
biomass residues (predominantly sugar-cane bagasse and to a smaller extent wood chips and
dust) as fuels for generation and co-generation constitute a commercial and tested renewable
source, and their use i s expected to grow in the coming years with the increasing feedstock
availability.

134. The main environmental challenge faced in developing the biofuels sector is how to
ensure that the expansion of feedstock production for these fuels does not exacerbate
deforestationinthe Cerrado and Amazon regions through the pressure such expansion places on
the conversion of pasture areas.        Fortunately, there are large areas o f underutilized and
abandoned pasture in both o f these regions. If adherence to environmental regulations on land
use can be more effectively promoted, this risk can be reduced.

135. Despite its relatively higher costs, energy access through small scale decentralized
renewableenergy systems (photovoltaic-solar,wind, biomass and small hydropower plants)
i s an importantway to increase income opportunities and social and cultural inclusionof
isolated communities where grid extension is not feasible. The national rural electrification



                                                 33

program, "Luz para Todos," has enabled grid based electricity access to over eight million
people. However, grid extension electrification i s not feasible in Amazon isolated areas, and
remote and off-grid small scale generation i s the only technical option feasible to promote energy
access. Enhancing and tailoring financing mechanisms able to support entrepreneurs and
lowering costs o f isolated clean generation technologies are necessary to achieve environmental
sustainability and regional equity.

 136. The Federal Government has achieved significant progress towards the
mainstreaming of environment elements in the energy sector development. The principal
strategic elements being adopted include the following:

       a) A methodology has been developed for the application o f Integrated Environmental
       Assessment (IEA) inriver basins, focused on hydro energy generation;

       b) Pilot studieshave beencarried out to deploy IEA inthe oil and gas sectors;

       c) The Brazilian Congress has approved the new model for the power sector, allowing
       environmental licenses to be processed before concessions are offered in public biddings,
       thus reducing risksand uncertainties for developers and investors;

       d) The crucial role o f developing indicative plans for national energy supply and demand
       systems was recognized and assigned to a specific institution (Empresa de Pesquisa
       Energe`tica - EPE);

       e) A cooperation agenda has been developed between the MMA (Ministry o f Environment)
       and the MME (Ministry o f Mines and Energy) for the implementation o f a joint energy-
       environmental work program; and,

       f ) The National Program for Renewable Sources (PROINFA) stimulated the development
       o f renewable energy sources by introducing government guaranteed long term power
       purchases. The PROINFA experience has set the path for energy auctions exclusively
       dedicated to non-large hydro renewable energy sources.

137. Government plans also include institutional activities such as: a) the application o f IEA
procedures in the environmental evaluation o f those projects prioritized by the MME; b) the
development o f specific environmental procedural guidelines for generation projects using
renewable energy technologies; c) the institutional structuring of EPE as well as the enhancement
o f the environmental analytical capacity o f its staff; and, d) the implementationo f a strategic plan
for the conservation and rational use o f energy.

138. Finally, as a means to overcome financing bottlenecks and perceived risks in energy
savings projects,BNDES established PROESCO in May 2006 as an innovative risk-sharing
credit facility for energy efficiency to be used mainly by Energy Service Companies




                                                  34

(ESCOs)."         PROESCO seeks to make the project finance approach viable for energy efficiency
projects, by using the future income stream o f energy savings to guarantee loans. While
PROESCO i s overcoming some o f the difficulties with obtaining financing for the ESCO
industry, other problems remain for the establishment of an energy efficiency market in Brazil.
These include the lack o f familiarity with energy efficiency projects on the part o f commercial
banks, high interest rates for loans, and the small size and capitalization o f Brazilian ESCOs,
which limits both the size and number o f projects that ESCOs can finance and their ability to
obtain loans from commercial banks.

Actions Supported by this Operation

 139. The proposed Program will continue to support Brazil in its effort to sustain the currently
high participation of renewable sources in the energy matrix and simultaneously maximize
environmental and social benefits, by supporting the policy actions and outcomes set out below.

 140. The SEM DPL Iassists the GOB in designing a strategic environmentalassessment
instrument tailor-made for the energy sector in order to better integrate multiple projects
and anticipate environmental and social impacts at the basin level. The GOB designedthe
Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA) for river basins aimed at expediting and facilitating
river basins inventories within broader environmental and social considerations. This tool i s
already beingapplied to ten river basins. The results of these assessmentswill guide the selection
and preparation of additional hydro power concessions for public bidding and assist the
sustainable development o f hydropower potential.

141. A second tranche release conditionwill be that BNDES ensures that its programs for
energy efficiency and renewable energy are coherent with BNDES' new Environmental
and Social InstitutionalPolicy. BNDES will focus increased attention on wideningthe number
o f its PROESCO's financial intermediaries through an outreach program aimed at raising these
financial intermediaries' awareness o f BNDES' available financial incentives and technical
advice in these areas. The capillarity obtained by new additional financial intermediaries will
boost PROESCO's outreach to untapped economic sectors where energy savings are both
financially attractive and able to promote market transformations.

142. A trigger for the SEM DPL I1will be that BNDES adopt six sub-sectoral guidelines
for renewable energy designed to ensure coherence with BNDES new Environmental and
Social Institutional Policy. The six sub-sectoral guidelines to be prepared are for: (i)
Hydroelectric Plants; (ii)       Small-scale Hydroelectric Plants; (iii)       Biomass Thermoelectric Plants;
(iv) Charcoal; (v) Oilhatural gas basedThermoelectric Plants; and, (vi)Transmission Lines. This
will result in streamlining analytical steps and reducing transaction costs for renewable energy
projects, thereby accelerating their adoption.


  http://www.bndes.gov.br/ambiente/proesco.asp. PROESCOdiffers from conventional financingmechanismsin
severalkey aspects: (i) collateral is not required to obtain the credit.While personalguarantees by the borrowerare
required, they need not bear a minimumrelationto the size of the loan; (ii)a report by an acceptedthird party must
validate the technical and economic soundness of the proposedproject; and (iii) BNDES assumesup to 80 percent of
the credit risk; the rest remainswith an intermediatecommercial bank, which signs an agreement with BNDES.


                                                           35

   143. Inaddition to the actions to be supported by this operation, the GOB i s promoting efforts to
   sustain the predominant participation of renewable sources in the Brazilian energy matrix. The
   GOB also intends to issue a Presidential Decree regulating preparation of basin inventories via a
  multi-agency participatory process, including IEA application to river basins.

   144. Under PROINFA, the GOB is supporting additional private investment in renewable
  technologies and has enabled commercial operation of approximately 2,500 M W of installed
  capacity of renewableenergy sources (biomass, wind and small hydro plants).

   145. The desired outcome from the synergies of these actions i s that 60,000 terajoules per year
   (TJ/year) be produced by renewable energy sources (not including large hydroelectric plants) or
   saved by energy efficiency projects supported by BNDES,when fully operational.


IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

  A. LINK TO COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

   146. The proposed SEM DPL will be a key instrument in addressing the sustainability
  pillar of the Brazil Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2008-2011. It will also
  contribute to the equity pillar of the CPS through its support for the expansion of access to basic
  services by lower and middle income groups, and to the competitiveness pillar through the
  improvement of the environmental management framework for infrastructure and natural
  resource-basedproductive chains. The aspects of the environmental sustainability pillar to which
  the SEM DPL contributestginclude the improvement of the environmental and social quality of
  infrastructure lending, support for forest concessions, sustainable agribusiness and forestry,
  private sector engagement in major environmental challenges, and improving protected areas
  management. The CPS emphasis on engagement in the Brazilian Amazon through the World
  Bank Group's Amazon Partnership Framework i s also pursued by the SEM DPL through its
  focus on the improved Amazon regional planning and rainforest conservation under the PAS and
  the Amazon Fund.

   147. In the formation of the current policy reform program, eight of the 24 specific CPS
  targeted outcomes in Annex 1of the CPS have been selected for targeting by the SEM DPL
  (and are noted inTable 5 below- ResultsFramework Analysis). The majority o f these are under
  the Sustainable Brazil agenda, but the SEM DPL also includes the water sector indicator under
  the Equitable Brazil agenda as well. Annex 1 of the CPS also makes explicit reference to the
  WBG's BNDES engagement on environmental sustainability. Since the engagement under the
  SEM DPL explicitly strengthens the focus of BNDES and other financial institutions on the
  environmental sustainability and underlying efficiency of public investments, the operation
  makes an input to the competiveness pillar's goal of increasing the quality and efficiency of
  public expenditure.

B. COLLABORATION WITH IMFAND OTHER DONORS

148. Brazil made an early repayment of its entire outstanding obligations to the
InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)in December, 2005, and has no current Purchases or
Loans with the IMF. However, the Fund continues a close and constructive relationship with
the Brazilian authorities, in areas such as policy reform and public investment. The last Article
IV Executive Board Consultation was on July 11, 2008. In addition, staff members in the IMF
and Bank maintain formal and informal contact exchanging ideas and coordinating activities on
economic development and public policies in Brazil, as well as on specific technical assistance
requests by the GOB.

149. The Bank and IFC staffs work in close cooperationto providefinancialand technical
support to different actors involvedin the sustainabledevelopmentsectors. On the advisory
side, IFC launched, together with the Bank, a private sector-focused initiative for sustainable
development in the Amazon region focusing on setting standards and structuring deals to create
market incentives to reduce deforestation. The Brazilian Amazon Initiative i s a program for
sustainability-driven private sector investments and advisory services in agribusiness, forestry,
sustainable financing, and biodiversity-related products that aims to develop sector benchmarks
and environmental and social standards. The success o f its efforts will depend on complementary
measures being undertaken by federal and state governments, in areas such as environmental
licensing and land titling, to be supported by this operation. Inaddition, IFC's sectoral guidelines
are being used as examples by BNDES for developing its sub-sectoral guidelines.

150. Climate Change could be another area for collaboration since its financing, through various
mechanisms including energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable agribusiness and
forestry in or near the Amazon, has been defined as one o f the six key pillars, in terms o f sector
and focus for investments, o f thejoint IBRD-IFC Brazil CPS (discussed at the Board on May lSt,
2008.)

151. Several aid agencies from developed countrieswork in Brazil especially on Amazon
conservation and climate change. The Bank has maintained a solid collaboration with most
them over the past 15 years, particularly with German and UK agencies. The Bank works with
German agencies (KfW and GTZ) on Amazon related issues co-financing projects on forest
management, fisheries management, institutional strengthening of state environmental agencies,
among others. GTZ i s also providing technical assistance to MMA supplementingthe ENV TAL,
while KfW i s working with the Bank on the preparation o f a loan to strengthenthe management
o f indigenous lands to be co-financed by both institutions. The Bank collaborates with DFID on
climate change mitigation through the promotion o f sustainable management o f natural resources
aimed at reducing COz emission from deforestation in the Amazon. The Bank also collaborates
with DFID on studies to develop climate change scenarios for Brazil.

C. RELATIONSHIPS TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

152. The sectors to be addressed by this Loan are also supported by other Bank-financed
   .
operations as well as by analytical work currently inprogress, such as:

       Policy Reforms: As already mentioned, the proposed loan has several of its targets
       linked to the earlier ENV PRL, for which the main objective was to support Brazil's
       goal to balance economic growth with social development, and maintain and improve
       environmental quality through policy reforms promotion focusing on two major areas: (i)
       increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency o f the environmental management system;
       and, (ii)mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected sector policies and
   .   programs.

       Linkedto the ENV PRL, a TA loan is being implementedto contribute to building
       the knowledge base required for the advancement of the reform agenda, and to
       improving the Government's capacity to both monitor environmental indicators and
       manage the implementation o f priority programs for results. The TA loan i s still active
       and an additional financing i s envisaged, which would include resources to support
   .   BNDESactions underthe proposed operation.

       Other related projects are: (i) 111, still under preparation, which supports the National
                                     NEP
       Environmental Program (PNMA) and aims to support states and selected municipalities
       to achieve measurable improvements in environmental quality by strengthening their
       management capacity and policies, increasing their capacity to effectively manage their
       natural resources, control pollution and reduce environmental degradation; and (ii)
       PROBIO 11, which aims to promote biodiversity mainstreaming at the national level in
       key government and private sector planning strategies and practices, as well as
       consolidate and strengthen institutional capacity to produce and disseminate biodiversity
  .    information and concepts.

       Natural Resource Management and Conservation; The actions proposed are in line
       with Bank strategy and current operations. Improved land use and planning are being
       supported by several state-level operations (Santa Catarina, Parana, SZio Paulo, Rio de
       Janeiro, Amazonas, Acre, Para) seeking to conciliate agricultural production with natural
       resources conservation practices. The Bank also has five projects to support biodiversity
       conservation: ARPA and AquaBio in the Amazon Region, GEF Espirito Santo, and two
  .    others inpreparation (Rio Grande do Sul Biodiversity and Cerrado Initiative).

       Water Resource Management. Reforms in this sector would contribute to improved
       management and quality of water resources. In these lines, the Bank is currently
       supportingone federal operation (PROAGUA) which aims to: (i)promote rational and
       sustainable use and participatory management o f water resources in Brazil ingeneral, and
       in the Northeast in particular, through the establishment of federal and state regulatory
       and institutional frameworks; (ii)provide reliable and sustainable access to water for



                                               38

       domestic, municipal, and other uses in priority river basins in the Northeast; and, (iii)
       support the consolidation o f ANA (created in December, 2000) and its institutional
       strengthening. In addition, two state loans (Ceara and Rio Grande do Norte) are being
       implemented, and three new ones are under preparation (Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe).
       Finally, a new integrated Technical Assistance Project for the water sector i s under
    .  identification.

       Water and Environmental Sanitation. The reforms supported are fully in line with
       other actions of the Bank to improve potable water, wastewater and solid waste
       service delivery in Brazil.At the federal level, the Bank has an excellent policy dialogue
       and financed two operations over the past decade. PROSANEAR helped develop models
       and deliver low-cost basic water and sanitation services to poor communities, and the
       recently completed Program for Modernization o f Sanitation Sector (PMSS) contributed
       to the development o f national policies and coordination among stakeholders. The Bank
       also has an active state-level portfolio with projects focusing on: (i)efficiency o f utilities
       and corporate governance (e.g., Pernambuco); (ii)pollution control (such as in the
       Federal District, SBo Paulo and Espirito Santo); (iii)new models o f services for water
       supply and sanitation (e.g., rural areas of the Amazonas state and Teresina); and, (iv)
       innovate financial instruments for utility companies, such as results based approaches
    .  (SBo Paulo/Reagua and Cearii) and also through the sub-national financing o f IFC.

       Regarding solid waste management, the Bank is preparing a federal project to be
       implemented by Caixa aiming at scaling-up public and private investments in
       municipal solid waste management treatment and disposal, while ensuring financial
       and technical viability and reducing environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, the
       Bank, through the PCF (Pilot Carbon Fund), supports projects which mainstream carbon
       finance inthe waste management sector with the objective o f creating models and tools to
       attract private sector participation in final disposal and treatment o f municipal solid
       waste. Inthis line, there are four Bank financed operations that are active and four being
    .  prepared.

       Renewable Energy. The Bank is currently supporting this sector through: (a) the
       Energy Sector TA project, which aims to help ensure the sustainable implementation of
       the GOB'Scontinuing energy sector reform program through studies and capacity building
       activities; and (b) four ESW initiatives, namely: (i)Energy Efficiency Strategy; (ii)
       Biodiesel Study, (iii)Climate Change (Low Carbon); and, (iv) Renewable Energy
       Auction PCF. Also, the Bank i s preparing a loan to support Eletrobras Restructuring.


D.    LESSONSLEARNED FROMPREVIOUS OPERATIONS

153.   This operation is based to a large degree on the lessons extracted from ENV PRL I
in terms of the loan's prior actions, which supportedenvironmentalsustainability through
policy reforms covering a broader range of development areas. The first two main lessons
that have been taken into account pertain to complexity and the related packaging o f reforms



                                                39

being targeted by the GOB into appropriately timed tranches and loans (covered in Annex 2 in
greater detail).

 154.   Regarding complexity, the current operation strives to limit the sectoral scope of
policyconditionalityto improvefocus, coordination,and linkageof nationalpolicyreforms
with the existing and planned targeting of BNDES programs in the same sectors. This
design aims to address policy bottlenecks encountered by BNDES inthe pursuit o f its lending in
the targeted sectors. It also seeks to provide direct input back to national policy makersfrom the
development o f BNDES sub-sectoral guidelines, which supplement national sectoral regulations
inguidingthe achievement o fsustainable development by public andprivate sector investors.

 155.   The ENV PRL series and the associated ENV TAL supported the GOB in improving
other aspects o f the environmental agenda which are not being followed inthe current SEMDPL
series.    In some cases, policies have already been reformed and are under implementation and
no additional steps are foreseen during the implementation period o f the SEM DPL series2'
(though additional technical or analytic work can i s often supported by the ENV TAL). The
other rationale for not continuing to support certain policy reform areas under the environmental
agenda previously identified in the ENV PRL series i s to avoid further increase in the
complexity o f the SEM DPL. One o f the lessons learned from the ENV PRL series i s that the
large number o f actions and triggers to be implemented by a large set o f institutions (seven
ministries) created a very complex model to monitor and support, and led to uneven
implementation among different agencies. While the MMA implemented almost all o f the
proposed reforms, other ministries implemented fewer. Thus, the SEM DPL series focuses its
support on those GOB policy reforms which are being well implemented and are ready for
subsequent steps aimed at their effective adoption and implementation.

156.    On timing and tranching, the lesson from the ENV PRL beingfollowed under this
operation is that a series of two operations (the first with two tranches) and narrower
sectoral focus can better harness the political commitment to policy reforms as the
necessary dialogue for the second operation in the series will be easier to sustain while the
interaction with policy makers remains focused due to the heightened consultations on the
implementation o f the second tranche o f first operation.             This supplements the continuous
dialogue with sectoral policy makers that has been maintained over the past three years as a
result o f the many policy elements o f sectoral projects (NRM, water, sanitation, energy, climate
change, and others) and through the Environmental Technical Assistance Loan (ENV TAL).
Moreover, though the formulation o f the SEM DPL series as three separate operations would
increase flexibility, experience shows that the added time o f approving three operations (as
opposed to two) through the Bank's and the GOB'S processing procedures would lengthen the
disbursementperiod o fthe loans beyondthe time targeted by the GOB.

157.   The companion ENV TAL has helpedto avoid gaps betweenthe ENV PRL and the
proposed DPL as the ENV TAL has provided important mechanisms for joint
consultation. First, consultation betweenpolicy makers and the Bank has been sustained by the
*'An example is the design and operationalizationof the Programfor Prevention and RapidResponseto
Emergencieswith HazardousChemicals (P2R2), which addresses key issues relatedto transport, storage,
contaminationand harmful by-products associatedwith chemicals.


                                                       40

discussion o f the particular focus o f analytic studies (supported by the ENV TAL), which have a
significant input to the content o f further policy reforms.      Second, the dissemination o f the
results o f the analytic work supported by the ENV TAL (as well as joint dissemination o f
analytic work executed separately by the Bank) has permitted substantial stakeholder
consultation with wider civil society. Third, the ENV TAL has provided an important cross
sectoral nature to the first two types o f consultation. These mechanisms all serve to intensify the
dialogue which i s supporting the development o f the SEM DPL.

 158. Monitoring and Evaluation. At the time of preparationof the ENV PFU, there were
no good quality indicators on which to base impact monitoring. In the case of the SEM
DPL, there is a much broader range of impact results availablefrom sectoral operations (for
which the M&E has been sharpened over the past few years) and from the analytic work
supported by the ENV TAL. This facilitates substantially the adoption under the SEM DPL of an
improved focus on clear indicators that are accessible to the client.

 159. An important lesson learned from DPLs Bank-wide is that beyond having a strong
nationalanalyticalbase (includingtechnical, institutional,and politicaleconomy analyses),
a programmatic operation must have a strong base of technical credibility with the client.
The Bank should include professionals with knowledge about the issues in the country related to
the DPL area (inthis case, environment) and field a multidisciplinary group capable of ensuring
both that relevant sectors are identified and supported by the project and interactions between the
implementers o f the reforms are taken into account when proposing the specific set o f policy
reform outcomes.

160. The Bank should recognize clearly that reform processes are sequential and
cumulative and target sector policy areas which incorporate continuity with earlier reforms as
much as possible.     As a corollary, programmatic DPLs should be developed with flexible
mechanisms that permit adjustments as the policy reforms in the country evolve. A second
corollary i s that DPLs should be supervisedby experienced senior staff with substantially above
average resources for their supervision.

E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

161. The program has a solid foundation, stemming from a body of analytical work
carried out over the past two decades by the GOB, the Bank, bilateral institutions (KfW,
USAID, DFID, etc.), the IDB, Brazilian and international researchers, and NGOs (e.g.,
IMAZON, IPAM, ISA, SOS Mata Atlantica, WWF, CI, TNC, etc.). These studies were
financed under the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rainforests (PPG7), the GEF
National Biodiversity Program, and recent AAA products covering water, land tenure and energy
sectors, and the Amazon. This body o f analytical work, which highlights the Bank's ongoing
strong policy dialogue, served as a strong input to the Brazil CPS 2008-2011, discussed with the
Bank's Board o f Directors inJune 2008.

162. Licensing. A recent Bank study concluded that in order for clean electricity to
continue playinga major role in the expansion of Brazil's energy sector, the environmental
licensingpracticesand proceduresfor hydroelectricityneedto be improved. Brazil does not


                                                  41

have clear guidelines for non-point source impacts on: (i) to prepare or review the different
                                                               how
technical aspects o f the licensing process, such as the content o f a Terms o f Reference to carry
out Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA); and, (ii)how to prepare and review the EIA.
These problems, combined with the lack o f clear definition o f responsibilities between the
federal and state tiers o f government, may result in the uneven quality of the licenses issued in
terms o f social and environmental impacts and mitigating measures. As a result, the licensing
process i s often challenged in court by the Public Prosecutor's Office (MP), which causes
process delays but results in higher quality licenses. These findings are serving as an important
inputfor the GOB'Sreform agenda on environmentallicensing supported bythis operation.

 163. Natural Resources. Many studies have been produced about the Amazon and its
development and conservation challenges. Over the past 15 years, the Bank worked with
donor countries,the FederalGovernment,and all nineAmazonian state governments in the
preparation and implementationof the PPG7. The main purpose of the PPG7 is to develop
and test pilot and demonstration projects, which would generate knowledge and be mainstreamed
into national and states policies, and strengthen local capacity for their implementation. The
PPG7 developed about 25 projects, and each one was based on solid preparation and generated
important knowledge and analytical work. The ProManejo project, for example, developed a
series o f studies and pilots that served as a technical basis for the Public Forest Law, and the
Natural Resources Policy Program (NRPP) provided technical input for the definition o f the
Environmental Economic Zoning (ZEE) methodology.

164. During the same peribd, the World Bank also carried several AAAs focused on
Brazilian Rainforests. Studies indicate that 70 percent of the deforested area inthe Amazon is
used for livestock production, and that effectiveness o f the new system to authorize and monitor
legal deforestation in rural properties is low, as the participation o f farmers and ranchers i s not
mandatory. A recent Bank study on land administration indicates that those with precarious land
claims tend not to comply with the environmental law (Le., keeping 80 percent o f one's property
in a forested legal reserve), carry out most o f the illegal deforestation, and adopt unsustainable
agricultural practices that lead to land degradation. These issues are being addressed by a set of
reforms including the resolution by the National Monetary Council which determines that, inthe
case o f agribusiness, the financial institutions must ensure that the borrower provides the proper
environmental licenses not only for its operation but also for the entire productive chain
"upstream". Therefore, ranches and farms supplying the processing industry inthe Amazon must
ensure compliance with the environmental law and registration inthe national land cadastre.

165. A recent study identified the economic and environmental impact of trading legal
reserve obligations as a viable but rarely used option established in the Forest Code.
Another study assessed the opportunity costs o f Atlantic Forest conservation, which indicated
that the lack o f clarity in the value o f the fines leads to judicial decisions that favor those that
illegally logged. These studies support the GOB'S reform to issue the Atlantic Forest Law which
supports the conservation and restoration o f the biome, including the legal reserves o f private
properties.




                                                   42

166. Water Resources. Recent analytical work shows that implementationof the National
Water Resources Policy established in 1997 has been unbalanced. Studies supported by the
Bank-financed Federal Water Resources Management Project (PROAGUA Additional
Financing), including extensive consultation with different actors and sectors, showed that
important advances in legal and institutional grounds, especially regarding participation and
decentralization, have not been accompanied with similar attention to management instruments,
resulting in limited planning, ineffective water rights system, and very limited use of economic
instruments. There are eight states in a more advanced stage o f implementation o f the water
rights systems and only five o fthem also progressed to introduce bulk water charge.

167. The National Water Agency (ANA) recently conducted a water quality monitoring
assessment in Brazil and the results show that: (i)just a few water quality parameters are
regularly monitored in the country; (ii)the number and spatial distribution o f sampling points are
inadequate; (iii)methods and procedures are not standardized; and (iv) the information available
has limited use and i s often unavailable to the public. These issues will be addressed by the
National Water Quality Evaluation Program (PNQA) supported by the SEM DPL series.

168. Environmental Sanitation. Analytical works show that discharges of untreated
wastewater from municipalities are a major issue in the most populated areas of the
country.As a consequence, the percentage of wastewater treatment is low (74.6 percent from the
sewage collected by the State Water Companies - SWC, and about 41 percent from those
collected by Local Water Providers     -LWP) and existing facilities are poorly maintained and
operated.

169. The gap in service coverage i s compounded by low quality services, which also affects the
poor disproportionately. As a result, health indicators associated to water-borne diseases are still
high when compared to countries of similar income level. These issues will be addressed by
SEM DPL by improving PRODES, the national program aimed at financing wastewater
treatment through payments for volumes and by BNDES reviewing environmental sanitation
projects using its new social and environmental guidelines.

170. Energy. The Bank has been making an important contribution to the introduction of
energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in the country's energy matrix through
several AAAs. The Brazil Energy Efficiency Studies - BEES has examined energy efficiency
policies and programs in public buildings and in the water sector, and has contributed to
improvements in the regulation in order to promote the use o f electricity efficient wire charges.
Overall, the BREES concludes that there i s an unrealized and viable potential for energy
efficiency in these sectors that can be addressed by better regulation, private and public sector
financing, and by further including energy efficiency strategies and programs in the country's
energy security rationale and planning. The ongoing study on Low Carbon Development
(LCCCS BR) i s an effort to identify policies, programs, and projects with the potential to
mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Alternative and financially feasible initial scenario
simulations point that, given certain stimuli and policies choices, a high participation o f
renewable energy sources inthe energy matrix can be sustained until 2035.




                                                43

  171. In addition, the Technical Assistance Loan by the Bank's Energy Sector to the
  Ministry of Mines and Energy and the Environmental Technical Assistance Loan to the
  Ministry of Environment supported a series of studies that contributed to better energy
  planning in Brazil. These studies clearly pointed to the need of improving the approach and
  number of inventories needed to implement auctions for the concession o f hydro plants. These
  studies are serving as an important input for the GOB reform agenda on the energy sector,
  especially regarding the design and testing o f the Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA)
  methodology, and the design o f policies and programs which promote renewable energy projects.


V.   THE PROPOSEDDEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

  A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

  172. The SEM DPL series supports the GOB'S concerted efforts to strengthen
  environmental management, with particular attention to: improvements in the overall
  environmental management system, sustainable management o f agricultural lands, forests, and
  water resources; reduction o f deforestation in the Amazon; reduction o f the environmental
  degradation o f land and water resources that are key determinants o f the well being o f the poor;
  and, promotion o f renewable energy. By focusing on these sectors, the SEM DPL series will
  support the GOB'S commitment to implement a model o f accelerated competitiveness and
  growth while assuring improved environmental and poverty outcomes, which are pillars o f the
  2008-2011 Country Partnership Strategy.

  173. Environmental sustainability is one of the key pillars of Bank engagement in the
 2008-2011 Country PartnershipStrategy (CPS) for Brazil, reflecting the long and fruitful
  relationship between the GOB and the Bank in the area of improving environmental
 sustainability. By focusing on environmental management and pursuinga focus on maximizing
 the synergies between public polices and procedures with the promotion o f sustainability of
 public and private sector investments,the SEM DPL aims squarely at addressing the challenge o f
 "not only what, but how".          This approach is therefore designed to achieve improved
 environmental sustainability in the current scope o f public and private investments and to
 facilitate an increased pace o f sustainable investments.

  174. Hence, the proposed operation targets the pursuit of a number of the same specific
 objectives of the previous ENV PRL program (supported in 2004 by the ENV PRL I)as
 well as the promotion of greater facilitation of sustainable investments (directly through
 BNDES and indirectly). The strategy for the ENV PRL Iwas to focus on the GOB'S short-term
 policies and programs that could lay the foundation for supporting the achievement o f its long-
 term objectives for environmentally sustainable economic development and poverty reduction.
 The set of policy and institutional reforms supported by this loan included: (i)increasing the
 transparency and social control of the environmental management system (EMS); (ii)improving
 the effectiveness ofthe EMSthrough bettercoordinationand clearer definition ofresponsibilities
 among the three levels o f government; (iii)increasing the use o f economic instruments as
 compared to command-and-control mechanisms; (iv) promoting sustainable development in the
 Amazon and the protection o f other key ecosystems; (v) improving water resources management
 through increased decentralization, improved local management and increased financial


                                                   44

autonomy; and (vi) promoting the upstream inclusion o f environmental sustainability concerns in
sector policies and programs, as well as in the planning and implementation o f major
development projects.
Box 3: Good Practice in Policy Lending

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership. This operation responds to the GOB'Srequest to support specific
programs and areas which reflectthe outcome of nationalpolicymakingprocesses.The fact that the GOB
elected to not request the second and third operations of the previous ENV PRL series, although it
continued to implement the reform agenda and many of the conditions and triggers were met or
exceeded, is a clear indication of the GOB's commitment to the environmental policy reform agenda.
The fact that the reforms to be supported by this operation are included in the 2008-2011 National Plan
(PPA) reflectsthe strong ownership ofthe GOB to the Program.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountabilityframework. The proposed loan is based on a coherent framework of previousactions and
expected outcomes that is based on the GOB's program and was widely discussed with MMA and
BNDES. The Bank and the GOB have prepared an operationalpolicy matrix, agreeing on prior actions
for Board approval and tranche release conditions for this operation, indicative triggers for the
preparationof the second operation, and expected program outcomes based on the GOB's program.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances. Bank support does not include any sensitive policy reforms; rather, support is fully
aligned with the sustainable development goals included in the 2008-2011 National Plan which aims to
promote development with social inclusion, quality education, and care for the environment.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement. The
previous ENV PRL had a large number of prior actions that covered a broad range of development areas.
Consequently, implementation and supervisioncovered a wide range of topics, presentingchallenges in
terms of sufficient human and budgetary resources and the constant dialoguebetween the Bank and GOB
throughout the period of implementation.The current operation has a much more focused policy matrix,
limited to five strategic areas of the environmental sustainability agenda, addressing the priorities of the
country, and includingdevelopment impact.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support. The proposed two-tranche operation is timed to the country's budget cycle, with
timing agreed in discussions with the Ministry of Finance based on the current review of the operation's
prior actions. The policy matrix also indicates the triggers for a second operation, also timed to the
:ountry's budget cycle, and a limited number of outcome indicators,which will be assessed as part of the
3peration's implementationand are closely linkedto the supported policy actions.

175. As a result o f a decision taken by the Brazilian Ministry o f Finance in late 2006 to shift the
focus of World Bank lending away from federal policy loans (affecting a number o f DPLs under
preparation), the preparation o f the ENV PRL I1 was suspended. The ENV TAL (effective in
early 2006) continued to function in order to continue support for the environmental policy
reform agenda (though the potential for future support through Bank DPLs was not clear).
Currently, the SEM DPL has been requested by the GOB to continue support for environmental
sustainability by pursuinggreater interaction o f policy reforms and public and private investment.




                                                  45

176. The programmatic SEM DPL complements existing WBG approaches involvingboth
investment and capacity building in key priority areas, including: public sector
environmental management at the national and sub-national levels (ENV TAL and the 2"d
National Environment Project); natural resources management (soil conservation and micro-
watershed management) in southern and southeastern Brazil; natural resource management
(forest and aquatic resources) and conservation in the Amazon (Para Integrated Rural
Development, Alto Solimaes Regional Development, ProAcre, ARPA, and PPG7), and urban
sanitation improvements supported by the Bank and the GOB's other partners (IDB, KfW,
USAID, IFC, WWF). The combination o f lending for policy, investment, and institutional
strengthening represents a complete and comprehensive "package" o f Bank support to
environmental improvement and sustainable development.

177. Under the SEM DPL I,the proposed US1.3 billion loan will be made to the
Federative Republic of Brazil. The loan would be disbursed in two tranches: the first upon
effectiveness, and the second upon fulfillment of the relevant second tranche release conditions.
Under the second operation in the programmatic series, the loan size would also be in the range
o f US$700 million and be dimensioned inone tranche.

B. POLICY AREAS

178. The proposed SEM DPL would support policy reforms to improve and standardize the
environmental management system. The Loan would also contribute to mainstream climate
change concerns across and within the targeted sectors (natural resources, water, sanitation, and
energy). The sectoral coverage and proposed reform program is as follows (with specific detail
presentedinTable 4 below):

179. Natural Resource Management and Conservation: The proposed reforms would
support the GOB's integrated strategy to address issues of deforestation, biodiversity loss
and unsustainable agriculture, and livestock production. This integrated strategy combines
actions to improve regional land use planning, strengthen policies and institutions that focus on
natural resource management and biodiversity conservation, and curb illegal practices.

180. Water Resource Management. Reforms in this sector would contribute to improved
management and quality of water resources. Prior experience suggests that improving water
resource planning and allocation rights, increasing water use efficiency and reducing water
pollution contribute to enhanced water resource management and improved health conditions o f
the population (particularly of the poor). The National Plan for Water Resources management
calls for decentralized and participatory approaches to water basin management as a means to
ensure the rational and integrated use of water resources for current and future generations, and
highlightsthe need for strong incentives and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of water
quality.

181. Environmental Sanitation. The reforms supported would improve potable water,
wastewater and solid waste service delivery in Brazil, supporting the development of related
environmental and social regulations, the implementation o f integrated solid waste management

plansby local and state authorities, andthe improvement and scale up o f innovative results-based
financing mechanisms. These reforms would facilitate access to basic sanitation services, reduce
the pollution from untreated wastewater inrivers and water sources, and improve the quality of
life and health o f the population, particularly inpoor and marginal areas.

182. Renewable Energy.          The proposed reforms would promote the use of renewable
energy in Brazil by diversifying energy sources and developing innovative technologies for
alternative energy sources. At the same time, these reforms would contribute to providing
access to safe and renewable energy and related services, thereby reducing air pollution and
mitigating its impacts on human health and associated costs related to treatments o f respiratory
diseases and the loss o f income generation opportunities.

   C. LOANAMOUNT AND TRANCHING

   183. The proposed loan, in a total amount of US$ 1.3 billion, is the first operation in a
   series of two loanswhich span the period 2008-2010. The first loan would be disbursedintwo
   tranches: the first upon effectiveness in a total amount o f US$ 800 million, and the second,
   totaling US$ 500 million, upon fulfillment o f the relevant second tranche release conditions,
   expected to take place in mid 2009. Under the second operation in the programmatic series, the
   loan size would also be inthe range o f US$700 million to be disbursedin one tranche.



VI.   OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

   A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

   184.    The policies and reforms supported by this operation are likely to have a significant
   positive social impact as the improvements in environmentalsustainability are expected to
   benefit the poor. The policy measures supported by this operation increase the consideration of
   social impacts and their incorporation into government programs, enhance environmental
   conditions, and improve management o f potential impacts on the poor. These benefits will be
   achieved by systemic improvements to the application o f improved environmental policy
   measures supported by the operation, as well as at the sectoral level through reforms related to
   natural resource and land use management, water resource management and service provision,
   and increased focus on renewable energy.

   185.   The general improvement of the environmentalmanagement policy framework, its
   institutions, and their procedureswill also involve the increasein access to informationby
   and participation of different stakeholders in the licensing processes and in other
   environmental management decisions which can potentially impact the population. The policy
  measures which have focused on IBAMA exclusively on environmental licensing have also
  implemented an internet-based system to disclose and track all environmental licensing
  processes. This directly improves transparency and enables more effective public participation in
  decision making. This supplements the well established consultation process included in the
  Brazilian licensing procedures, which requires public hearings at or near the proposed location o f
  the project.

   186.   This effort to increase transparency and participation is also proceeding through the
  recent restructuring o f the Ministry o f Environment (MMA) to include a Secretariat for
  Institutional Coordination and Environmental Citizenship which focuses on intra-institutional
  and inter-institutional coordination o f policy action and environmental education. This new
  Secretariat organizes the biennial participatory National Environment Conference which receives
  recommendations on policies and programs from communities and CSOs from all regions o f the
  country.    Furthermore, the new MMA structure includes the Secretariat o f Extractivism and
  Sustainable Rural Development, which focuses on promoting policies that support forest
  dwellers, artisanal fishermen and small farmers.




                                                                                                51

   Box 4 BNDES Social Policy and Improved Social Impacts
          -
   Brazilian legislationregardingpotentialsocial impacts covers issuesrelatedto: (i) the population's
   health, well-being, and safety; (ii)impacts on social and economic activities, (iii)loss of employment;
   (iv) landacquisition, expropriation, compensation and involuntary displacements; and, (v) disclosure
   of information. The Brazilian Constitutionalso has specific provisionsagainst race discriminationand
   child labor, and clearly recognizes the rightsof indigenous peoples to demarcate and protecttheir land
   andto maintaintheir languages,traditionsand social structure. Indigenouspeoples have exclusive
   rights over the use of the naturalresources in their lands, and any potentialuse ofwater resources
   insidetheir land, includingfor generatinghydroelectricity,must be reviewedby Congress on a case by
   case basis.The Constitution also determines that quilombolacommunitieshavethe right to the land
   they occupy andthat the GOB must issuethe respective landtitles. (A Presidentialdecree issued by the
   currentadministrationin 2004 defines the necessary procedures and norms to implementthis articleof
   the Constitution.)

   Current national procedures for screening and addressing potential social impacts specify what social
   actions must be implemented as conditions of the environmental licensingprocess. License conditions
   are drawn from recommendations identified in the environmental impact assessment report issues and
   concerns identified by public comment on the report, and requirements identified by local, state, or
   nationalauthorities.

   Inthis framework,the social screening process utilized by BNDES specifies the basic characteristics of
   the investment, including a brief description of the project objectives, the historical, cultural and
   archeological characteristics of the surrounding communities, any relocation of populations, the
   structure and organization of the proponent for dealing with social and environmentalmatters, and all
   other potential impacts that might be covered under the EIA. In addition, the screening includes an
   assessment of the potential impacts on direct and indirect jobs to be created by the investments, and
   considers whether there are racial discrimination, child labor, indigenous peoples, or quilombolas
   issues. In this process, BNDES often requests adjustments by project proponents to aspects of the
   investment project aimed at improving employment generation, labor training, and wider benefits to
   workers and members of the surroundingcommunity.

   Currently, the range of social benefits to be considered is not as wide or as systematicallyspecified as
   the Environmentaland Social Department aspires to include in the pursuit of the social development
   aims which BNDES strategic plans set out. For this reason, a comprehensive specification of
   necessary social impacts (primarily positive, though negative as well) to be considered in project
   screening is being targeted for formalization in a new BNDES Social Policy. The elaborationof this
   BNDES Social Policy will be a key element in improvingthe sensitivity to and focus on improvement
   of social impacts of investments financed by BNDES. By supporting this aim, the SEM DPL series
   expects to be an additional catalyst for improved social impacts, akin to those to be achieved by the
   specific sectoral actions supported by the operation).


187.    At the sectoral level, the continuous dialogue that the Bank has undertaken with Brazil
over the past 15 years has generated a wide ranging set of assessed policy interventions in
different sectors. The policy measures selected from this set for inclusion in this operation are
expected to have a number of well known largely beneficial impacts, the range of which is
presentedbelow by the specific types of actions ineach sector.



                                                                                                       52

 188.    Regarding sustainable management of natural resources, the Public Forest
Management law to be supported by this operation accords local communities preferential
treatment in the area o f forest concessions. In addition, the reforms to be supported by this
operation to control deforestation (Le., PAS, CMN resolution, enforcement operations)
should decrease the frequency of unsustainableagriculturaland loggingpracticesand land
grabbing. The GOB'Sactions supported by this operationwould, over the mediumto long-
term, lessen the negative impacts associated with these unsustainable practices, which
typically involve displacement o f persons, loss o f livelihoods and poor working conditions
(including exposure to physical risks). Through the increase in access to opportunities, the
operation i s also likely to have a significant direct impact on poverty over the medium to long-
term as improved environmental stewardship and the introduction o f sustainable resource
management practices will contribute to improve the livelihoods and well being o f the poor.

 189.    A specific example i s the generation of higher rates o f return and economic and social
stability for beneficiary communities through the practice o f sustainable forestry management
practices to be supported by the Amazon Fund and the Atlantic Forest Fund (as opposed to
currently often unmanaged, predatory logging). When operational, the Amazon Fund's support
to CSOs, communities and indigenous people i s expected to adopt a strong focus on forestry (in
addition to other natural resources) and the aim o f replicating the experience o f the states o f Acre
and Amazonas on avoided deforestation. In both states, local communities receive an additional
income based on the production o f extractive products from the forest (in Acre) or practices that
prevent the clearing o f forested areas (inAmazonas).

190.     The creation of protectedareas as part of the PAS may result in adverse impactson
the livelihood of the people by restricting access to the natural resources o f the new area. These
impacts are not, however, likely to be significant, given processes that the GOB has in place to
mitigate them. For example, the GOB adopts a local consultation process prior o f the creation o f
the protected area. As result, the proposed boundaries o fthe areas are redefined.Whenthis is not
enough to mitigate the impact, the category o f the proposed protected area i s changed from strict
protection to sustainable use (i.e., national forests, extractive reserves) which allows the presence
o f the forest dwellers and full access to the natural resources.

191.     Regarding water resource manapement, the SEM DPL's support for                             the
implementationof the NationalWater Quality EvaluationProgram (PNQA) is expected to
have significant benefits for the poor since they are disproportionately affected by water
pollution. Improvements to water quality bring immediate benefits to local populations in terms
o f enhanced livelihood security, reduced health risks and reduced vulnerability.            Ensuring
continuity in water flows and a minimum of water quality is essential for maintaining the
integrity of ecosystems, which in turn supports activities such as fisheries, small scale irrigation
and livestock raising, all o f which local rural communities depend on for their livelihoods. In
addition, poor water quality increases exposure to water-borne and water-related diseases, which
are still very prevalent in poorer communities in Brazil, and especially affect children under five
and the more vulnerable segments o f the population. Furthermore, water related disasters, such
as floods, droughts and major storms are exacerbated by pollution and sedimentation loads



                                                                                                    53

caused by soil degradation and improperly disposed solid waster, and are expected to even
worsen due to the effects o f climate change.

192.      By enforcingthe monitoring and reportingon water quality, localjurisdictions and
communities will be able to better understandthe degree and nature of the major source of
pollutionaffecting them, be it from organic contamination, agro- and other toxic chemical run-
off, or highlevels o f turbidity due to high sediment loads. Inaddition, raising sensitivity to water
quality inrural areas will also be especially important since many small towns in the poorer rural
areas in the interior o f Brazil rely on surface water to meet their drinking water needs. High
levels o f pollution and sediments increase the cost o f water abstraction and treatment, which i s
translated into a higher tariff charged to water users inboth urbanand rural areas. This increased
price tends to affect the poor to a higher degree as they usually spend a larger proportion o f their
income on basic utility services than richer consumers. The urban poor are also at higher risk
from industrial water pollution (more prevalent in cities) and flooding associated with living in
the more crowded and environmental risky areas of the metropolitan regions Lastly, improved
access to knowledge and information on water quality by consumers can help them lobby local
officials and water polluters to address local pollution and water quality, with consequent
benefits especially for the poor.

193.      One area where the GOB'Swater management policy reforms could possibly have a
negativeimpact (on the poor and small farmers) is through the increaseduse of bulkwater
charges, as these bulk charges get translated into the tariffs levied for water use.                   This impact,
however, i s expected to be very low giventhat the expected bulk water cost would represent only
a very minor portion o f the final price charged to the consumer. Also, the national policy
requires a participatory process, whereby bulk water charges are proposed by river basin
committees which have as a majority composition water users and civil society. Furthermore,
avoiding social impacts i s a key element o f the price schedule determination*'. Inaddition, 100
percent o f the bulk water charges go back to the river basin to be invested according to priorities
established by the basin committee.

194.     Since the SEM DPL series supports the imdementationof the new Law on National
Guidelines for Environmental Sanitation, it is expected to improve the planning, regulation
and provision o f water and sanitation services. The increased access to water and sanitation
services will generate significant positive social impacts since the current deficit of service
coverage deficit is concentrated amongst the poorest families in the less developed and depressed
economic regions, smaller and poorer municipalities, the periphery o f large metropolitan areas
and rural areas. In fact, there i s a 21 percent differential in water supply coverage levels between
the richest and poorest 30 percent o f the Brazilian population (91 percent versus 70 percent
coverage rates). Families who do not have access to these basic services often pay considerably
more to self provide water, and even poor families that are served by utility providers suffer
considerably more from the intermittency of service provision. Unlike the wealthier segments o f



 21For example, inthe PCJ river basin, about 80 percent of the collected bulk water fees come from urban water
supplies, where the bulk water price chargedto service providers represents less than 1 percent of the average tariff
for treatedwater chargedto the population.


                                                                                                                   54

the population, the poor usually can not afford rooftop water storage tanks or household wells to
supply their needs when the taps rundry.

 195.    Coping mechanisms for addressing household waste disposal needs are also particularly
difficult for the poor. Coverage rate differences for sanitation are dramatically worse for the
poorer versus the richer third o f the population (53 percent versus 89 percent).     Inrural areas
where there is less density, families tend to invest in onsite solutions through latrines and septic
tanks, although many o f these use precarious construction methods. Urban residents suffer
considerably more from the lack o f environmental sanitation. The health consequences o f
exposure to untreated environmental waste are well documented and significantly affect the poor
to a much larger degree. Finally, from an environmental perspective, untreated wastewater and
inadequate sanitation and drainage are the main pollution sources o f rivers, which have an effect
through the water quality impacts noted above.

 196.    The local sanitation plans promoted by the new Law on National Guidelines for
EnvironmentalSanitation are designed to protect the poor through the application of social
tariffs and restrictions for disconnecting families who benefit from the social tariff. The Law
explicitly states that a balance between environmental and social objectives should be achieved
through the establishment o f feasible and progressive environmental standards that are
economically affordable to all. At the same time, the regulation should be transparent and
information widely available for access by the population.

197.    The improved social and environmental guidelines of BNDES for water and
environmental sanitation operations are expected to promote positive economic and social
impacts by ensuring service expansion to the poor in a sustainable manner. The specific
enhancement o f the PRODES program i s expected to provide incentives for local jurisdictions
and utilities to invest inwastewater collection and treatment. The program has positive social and
environmental impacts, as grants are based on actual results achieved in the reduction o f
pollution loads. In addition, the extension o f the PRODES model to the solid waste sector will
promote the same sort of social and environmental benefits, while specific provisions to protect
and promote the social inclusion o f waste pickers, the very poorest members o f society, are
already within the scope o f the proposed national policy and expected to be incorporated into
BNDES' social and environmental guidelines.

198.    The social impacts of the policies supported bv the SEM DPL in renewableenergy
generation and energy efficiency are largelv positive, but negative impacts have been
identified as well. The main benefits accrue through the operation's contribution to provision o f
access to renewable energy. A negative impact identified pertains to potential loss o f habitat by
forest dwelling traditional and indigenous communities in hydroelectric sector development in
the Amazon. This impact is not, however, expected to be significant because the reforms
supported by the SEM DPL increase attention to incorporation o f social impacts through the
strategic environmental assessment of river basins in the planning o f expansion o f the
hydroelectric sector. A similar impact identified i s potential deforestation associated with
expansion o f the ethanol sector. This impact is not likely to be significant due to the availability
o f large areas of underutilized and abandoned pasture for use by the ethanol sector and to the



                                                                                                  55

SEM DPL`s support for implementation of CMN Resolution 3545 (discussed below in detail in
paragraph 206).

199.    Expansion of renewable energy through renewable sources and through energy
savings from energy efficiency programs expanded under the SEM DPL have an important
human health impact: the use of less and cleaner energy is expected to reduce air pollution and
associated costs related to treatments o f respiratory diseases. Secondly, though most o f the
energy savings interventions are likely to take place in industrial and urban environments, the
social impacts o f these are expected to be positive for the poor who will benefit from long-term
lower marginal cost tariffs.

200.    The project recognizes that there is a potential trade-off between renewable energy
from large hydroelectric plants and the direct social impact that such plants can cause. By
supporting GOB improvements to basin-wide integrated planning o f the hydro sector which
specifically takes direct and cumulative environmental and social impacts into account, the
operation aims to reduce these impacts and otherwise mitigate them. Inthis regard, considerable
work i s being undertaken by BNDES to develop specific social guidelines to provide for the
populations that are directly and indirectly affected by hydroelectric plants (as well as those that
could potentially be affected by expansion of the ethanol sector). Specific attention i s also given
to ensuringthe livelihoods o f individuals affected by resettlement.


B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

201. The provisions o f OP 8.60 on Development Policy apply to the Sustainable Environmental
Management DPL. The policies and reforms supported by this operation are likely to have a
significant positive impact on the country's environment and natural resources. This operation
plays an important role in supporting the strengthening o f environmental management and in
improving environmental sustainability in key sectors (e.g., natural resources management and
conservation, water resources management, environmental sanitation and renewable energy).

202. The operation continues to assist Brazil in its long path o f transforming the country's
National Environmental Policy Law, enacted in 1981 and bolstered by the 1988 Federal
Constitution, into reality. The GOB's commitment to strengthenenvironmental management and
to improve environmental sustainability in key sectors i s evidenced by its recognition in the
2008-2011 National Plan (PPA) that economic growth i s conditioned on the sustainable use o f
natural resources. The GOB'S commitment i s further evidenced by the detailed bottom-up
consultation process (National Environmental Conference) used to prepare new programs and
plans.

203. Due to their nature, it is not expected that such policy reforms will result in adverse
environmental impacts, but rather, they should bring positive impacts as the operation's
design is proactive with respect to internalizing environmental concerns. The potential
environmental impacts associated with the GOB's reform agenda supported by this operation
typically generate related social and poverty impacts. Thus, specific sectoral analysis of potential



                                                                                                  56

environmental impacts i s presented together with the social and poverty impact analysis in
section V1.A above. For clarity, the main positive impacts o f this operation are reiterated below:

   e  The strengthening of enforcement of the environmental policy framework through the
      restructuringo f MMA and its affiliated agencies.

   e  The development o f the country under a low carbon emission scenario due to the adoption
      ofNational Climate Change Action Plan.


   e  The improvement o f water quality and the management o f river basins through the
      implementation o f the National Water Quality EvaluationProgram (PNQA).

   e  The promotion o f the sustainable use of natural resources, decreased deforestation and the
      reduced frequency o f unsustainable agricultural and logging due to the combination o f (i)
      the enactment of the new Forest Framework (two laws and a legal resolution), (ii)the
      implementation o f the PAS, (iii)the restructuring o f BNDES programs for forest
      management, agriculture and livestock, and (iv) the adoption by BNDES o f sub-sectoral
      guidelines.

   e  The decrease of discharge o f sewage in rivers due to an increase in coverage o f the
      sanitation services through the implementation o f the new Law on National Guidelines for
      Environmental Sanitation, the update o f PRODES and the adoption by BNDES o f sub-
      sectoral guidelines.

   e  The accelerated adoption of renewable energy sources due to the application of BNDES
      sub-sectoral guidelines for this sector.

204. In addition, BNDES is firmly committed to promoting a series of reforms of its
environmental and social policy framework and procedures and programs for green
investments. BNDES has programs to support rehabilitation o f degraded areas, ecological
tourism in Conservation Units, sustainable forest management, C D M projects among others.
BNDES' commitment is further evidenced by the recent creation of the Social and
Environmental Directorate, elevating the status o f this agenda within BNDES. Considering
BNDES' significant role in financing projects and enterprises which engage in activities with
potential adverse environmental impacts, the proposed operation i s expected to have a leveraged
impact: the full spectrum o f BNDES over 70 financial agents i s expected to observe the same
improved environmental and social policies to be adopted by BNDES with support from this
operation.

205. Despite the positive impacts noted above, there are some actions supported by this
operation which could potentially cause environmental negative impacts. These are in the areas
o f biofuel production, expansion o f hydropower and deforestation causedby forest management.

206. The main negative impact associated with developing the biofuels sector is potential
increased deforestationthrough the expansion of feedstock productionfor these fuels. This



                                                                                                 57

impact i s not likely to be significant as it i s partially mitigated by the availability o f large areas o f
underutilized and abandoned pasture. The SEM DPL supports further mitigation o f this impact
by supporting the implementation o f CMN Resolution 3545, which prevents an increase in
biofuel production from increasing deforestation in the Amazon. This resolution establishes that,
inthe case of agribusiness, the financial institutions must ensure that the borrower can provide
the proper environmental licenses not only for its operation but also for the entire productive
chain "upstream". Therefore, any sugarcane or soybean plantation supplying the few existing
ethanol or seed crushing plants in the Amazon must ensure compliance with the environmental
law which requires an 80% forest cover. The resolution also requires registration in the national
land cadastre, thus barring access to credit for those with precarious land claims. BNDES
guidelines for renewable energy are also being devised to require project proponents to
demonstrate more clearly how environmental and social impacts are mitigated and to help
investors integrate best practices in this regard. (The adoption of these revised guidelines for
energy projects is a second tranche condition ofthe SEM DPL I).

207. Regarding the expansion of hydropower, the potential negative impact is habitat
degradation and impacts on forest dwelling traditional and indigenous communities. This
impact i s also not expected to be significant because the SEM DPL series will strengthen
IBAMA's capacity to improve effectiveness in the licensing process through improved staffing
and support from the ENV TAL for strengthened technical capacity. In addition, IBAMA has
adopted a public disclosure mechanism via internet, which increased the transparency and social
control o f the environmental licensing system

208. The SEM DPL series also supports the application of the Integrated Environmental
Assessment (IEA) for river basins. This will improve the analysis, prevention and
mitigationof environmental and social impactsfrom hydroelectric plants. The IEA analyzes
entire water basins with the potential for several hydroelectric plants, enabling adequate
identification o f potential cumulative effects, and proposing the actual number and size o f plants
in order to prevent or minimize such potential impacts. This is an initial step before the regular
environmental licensing process for each proposed project. This a marked improvement over the
current system where the environmental impact assessment i s carried out for each project without
having a good understanding o f possible cumulative impacts and other issues that would affect
the entire river basin.

209. Regarding deforestation associated with sustainable management of natural
resources, the potentialnegative impact arises from unclear guidelines for logging. Inorder
to ensure that this impact i s not likely to be significant, the SEM DPL series supports the Public
Forest Law and its associated decrees which provide a solid framework to ensure sustainable
forest management without using clear cut. This legal framework states clear guidelines for the
management plans to be designed by the concessionaries based on best practices adopted in the
region. It also establishes an improved monitoring system which increases accountability. In the
past, IBAMA was responsible for issuingthe environmental license and concession and carrying
out the audit. The new system separates those functions between IBAMA and SFB and allows for
third-party periodic audits.




                                                                                                         58

C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

210. The Ministry of Environment and its agencies (IBAMA, ANA, ICMBio, SFB), and
BNDESwill be responsible for implementingthe proposed components of the operation.A
set o f outcome indicators for measuring the achievement of the development objectives o f the
SEM DPL series were agreed with the government and are presentedinTable 5 below.

211. The progress o f the SEM DPL series towards achieving its objectives and outcomes would
be monitored according to the Policy Matrix (see Annex 3) which shows the second tranche
release conditions o f this operation, the proposed triggers for the second loan and expected
outcomes o f the SEM DPL series. In order to monitor this operation and the entire SEM DPL
series, the Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Environment will use the monitoring system
developed through the Technical Assistance Loan for Environmental Sustainability project (ENV
TAL) to monitor the previous PRL and the ongoing ENV TAL.

212. The monitoring system will be updated to include intermediate steps necessary to
achieve the tranche release conditionsof SEM DPL I,the triggers for the SEM DPL 11, and
the expected outcome of the SEM DPL series. This system is web-based and open to the
public, ensuring transparency and enabling social participation. This monitoring system i s under
the responsibility of the project management unit of the ENV TAL under the direct supervision
o f MMA's Executive Secretariat.

D. FIDUCIARYARRANGEMENTSAND DISBURSEMENT

ForeignExchangeControlEnvironment

213. The IMF Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank of Brazil done in October 2002
and updated in March 2004 concluded that Central Bank does not present widespread
vulnerabilities that could compromise the safeguarding of Fund resources. Inparticular, its
audit i s conducted by an internationally recognized audit firm, while its internal audit function
contributes effectively to internal control systems. The responses given by the Central Bank to
IMFrecommendations indicatethat they were either implementedor were inthe process of being
implemented.

214. As the IMF Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank has not been updated in
recent years, the Bank also reviewed the comparative Financial Statements of the Central
Bank for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, including the Explanatory Notes to
the financial statements and the independentauditors' report that included an unqualified (clean)
opinion on the financial statements for both years. The financial statements for both 2006 and
2007 were prepared in accordance to the International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"),
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), three years before the transition
deadline date established by C V M (CornissGo de Valores Mobilidrios) Instruction 457 and the
Central Bank`s Rule No. 14.259.

215. The Explanatory Notes, an integral part of the Financial Statements, provide an extensive
explanation o f the Central Bank's risk management policies, including those related to financial
instruments held to manage the international reserves. In relation to operational risks, the Notes
state that the Central Bank "uses internal control systems, which are considered adequate for its
activities."

216. From a fiduciary point o f view, the control environment, procedures and regulations
governing the Central Bank's operations and within which the foreign exchange i s managed by
the Borrower, are considered adequate.

Public FinancialManagement of BudgetResources

217. The World Bank finalized in 2002 a CFAA for Brazil, that was discussed with the
Government and which has been used to draw key conclusions on the country PFM.Brazil
has well developed financial management thus ensuringthat Bank lending i s done inthe context
o f acceptable oversight arrangements. Notwithstanding some desirable improvementsthat could
be made, the Brazilian system o f public financial management provides reliable information, and
adequate systems to manage and track the receipt and use o f funds at the national level and there
i s a high level o f fiscal transparency.

218. The World Bank Report No. 39780-BR Policy Note: Issues and Recommendations,
Enhancing the Performance o f Federal Financial Management Systems, issued in April 2008,
states:



                                                                                                63

        Over the last ten years, Brazil has adopted good governance as a national objective. As a
        result, there i s a high level of transparency, underpinned by a sound public financial
        management system that provides reasonable assurance over the use of government and
        other public resources. Since the last CFAA, the Government of Brazil has made
        considerable enhancementsto its PFM systems, continuing to modernize its arrangements
        and practices, achieving important advances through the strengthening of its internal
        control framework, and has clarified, systematized and invigorated its oversight and
        external control mechanisms.

        Desirable improvements are still needed but notable progress is being made. These include
        significant work to draft first-ever Brazilian accounting standards applicable to the public
        sector (NBCASP), based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS),
        issuedby IFAC. A uniform chart of accounts to support the NBCASP, and to be rolled out
        at the national, state and local levels of government, is under preparation. First-ever
        Brazilian auditing standards applicable to the public sector, based on the auditing
        standards issued by the International Organization of Supreme Audit Organizations
        (INTOSAI), have also beendrafted.

219. Consistent with the CAS objectives, the Bank will continue to engage with the GOB and
support the neededPFM reforms through a number of mechanisms includingwork on expanding
the use of country systems, Institutional Development Grants and other Analytical and Advisory
work aimed at strengtheningPFM and supporting its good governanceagenda.

220. The federal government's public financial management system is therefore considered
adequate to support any Federal DPL program. In light of the adequate control framework
supporting public finance operations, the risk to both Bank and country own funds is considered
low.

Disbursement

221. Once the Bank formally notifies the borrower that the loan is available for withdrawal, the
Borrower's withdrawal applications will be processed so that the proceeds of the loan would be
depositedby the World Bank into an account of the National Treasury of the Federative Republic
of Brazil, established at the Banco do Brasil for the Borrower's use.

222. The World Bank will disburse the two tranches of the loanproceeds into said account
of Banco do Brasil denominated in US Dollars. The National Treasury will then request a
transfer from said account o f Banco do B r a d to the Treasury Single Account uponrequest of the
latter, thus becoming available to finance budgetedexpenditures.The NationalTreasury will then
provide the Bank a written confirmation o f the transaction. The same disbursement procedure
will be followed for bothtranches.




                                                                                                64

E. RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION

R i s k s and Mitigation

223. The first type of risk present in the SEM DPL i s that the environmental reform
agenda is not carried out within the agreed scope or expected timeframe. Due to the factor
o f continuity with the ENV PRL Io f all policy areas included under the SEM DPL, the overall
rating o f this risk i s moderate. The dimension o f this risk relating to the Ministry o f Environment
(MMA) and its associated ,agencies is low since the reform steps that were targeted under the
ENV PRL series to be executed by MMA and its related agencies have largely been
implemented,continuation of reform steps by MMA and its agencies is highly likely.

224. Inter-apency coordination i s a moderate risk to the carrying out of the environmental
reform agenda because the scope and complexity o f the reform agenda has been simplified as
compared to the design under the ENV PRL series (Le,, excluding agrarian reform, urban
planning and tourism).        There is also a moderate risk posed to the carrying out of the
environmental reform agenda by government agencies that may fail to demonstrate sufficient
institutional capacity. These risks have been explicitly recognizedand will be partly mitigated by
complementary operations, particularly the ENV TAL, which will provide technical assistance
and capacity building to MMA and affiliated agencies. (The ENV TAL i s under implementation,
rated satisfactory, and to be expanded through an additional financing which has beenrequested
by MMA for support inovercoming institutional capacity and coordination issues.)

225. Inaddition. there i s a risk that a change in leadership in government agencies could lead to
a delay in the reforms implementation. This risk is considered moderate as the Lula
administration has made explicit public support for a number of the reform steps. This risk i s
being mitigated through: (i)elaboration o f the reforms' framework in national policy programs
which reflect strong inter-ministerial commitments and upstream consultation with civil society;
and, (ii)  a programmatic framework that i s flexible.

226. A related consideration i s whether a sharper economic downturn would affect the GOB'S
commitment to implementation o f the environmental management program. The environmental
management reforms targeted by the SEM DPL are largely areas where improvements in
economic sustainability are being engendered- especially natural resource management, but also
in the water sector and renewable energy.            These goals are supported by strong GOB
commitment, explicitly included in the National Multi-Year Plan, and largely shared by the
private sector actors. Neither the execution o f these reforms nor their being watered down i s
substantially threatened by economic slowdown, though the uptake by enterprises of some o f the
programs for sustainable forest management may be slower with the overall slowing in GDP
growth. Regardingthe water, sanitation, and renewable energy sectors, the GOB has sent a very
clear message to the markets that the Accelerated Growth Program (PAC) investments will
continue to receive priority and not be subject to reducedbudget allocations. This means that the
investments in improving water quality and expanding renewable energy will likely not be
substantially influenced by the economic downturn.




                                                                                                    65

227. The possibility o f the reform agenda not being carried by BNDES i s considered a moderate
                                        -
to substantial risk primarily because o f the recognition that full implementation o f the reform
agenda within BNDES involves a challenging change in corporate culture regarding
environmental and social sustainability. Operational departments aiming to put these reforms
into practice will be tested by the potential for foregone lending. This risk i s addressed through
the substantial expansion o f the ENV TAL project to allow provision to BNDES of technical
assistance and capacity building and by building continual progress into the reform agenda with
important milestones for tranche release conditions. A further mitigating factor i s that BNDES'
management recognizes clearly that the reform steps to be carried out reduce BNDES'
reputational risks associated with adverse environmental and social impacts by improving
screening and monitoring. The challenge for BNDES management i s to further align its staffs
incentives with its corporate vision.

228. In the policy reform area o f Climate Change, successful outcomes depend on the strong
interactive effect betweenthe National Climate Change Action Plan CNCCAP) and BNDES clean
development carbon fund programs.           The risk of this effect taking time to occur and the
corresponding risk to successful outcomes in the Climate Change area are therefore also
moderate to substantial. This risk i s partially mitigated by explicitly building the aims o f the
NCCAP into BNDES' climate change programs (as a trigger for the SEM DPL 2).

229. The second type of risk present is that reforms are carried out as agreed but do not
have the desired impactsin terms of behavioralchanges of economic agents, environmental
quality and natural resource conservationis moderate. Most of the sectoral reforms targeted
by the SEM DPL are in areas where the experience o f the Bank with Brazilian counterparts is
substantial and in which analytic work has a long history. Cause and effect linkages and related
behavioral constraints are relatively well understood, so the risk o f not generating targeted
outcomes as a result o f the reform steps taken i s moderate. Some o f the outcomes in the natural
resource conservation and management area likely face moderate to substantial risks. The ability
for sub-projects to move ahead with support from the Amazon and Atlantic Forest Funds i s
strong, but the exact scope, coverage, and related impact o f such sub-projects are currently
difficult to project. This risk i s to be mitigated by the ENV TAL'Ssupport to the drafting o f the
operational policies o f both the Amazon and Atlantic Forest Funds in a way to maximize focus
on sustainable natural resource management.

230. The risk o f not achieving the target o f reduced deforestation (20 percent over three years) i s
moderate, since the recent pace o f reduction i s roughly this quick. This risk i s not deemed low
because o f the coordination risk o f the National Sustainable Amazon Program (PAS), and
because achieving ever lower rates o f deforestation is inherently difficult. This risk i s mitigated
to a large degree by the GOB's very clear position that deforestation o f the Amazon i s not
typically associated with sustainable economic activity and the GOB's increased openness to
work with the international community to address the challenges o f promoting sustainable
natural resource use as the primary mechanism for reducingdeforestation.

231. Civil society, both national and international, recognizes the strides which the GOB i s
taking in this area and the role which the Bank can play in supporting the GOB with the



                                                                                                  66

challenges o f implementingthe PAS and the Amazon Fund. This i s primarily because the goals
o f the PAS are largely the same as those laid out in the WBG's Amazon Partnership Framework
which the WBG is already pursuing through state-level operations. A strong justification for the
Bank's engagement with the Amazon Fund i s that the Bank's experience over the past fifteen
years with the precursor to the Amazon Fund, the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian
Rainforests (PPG7), can offer significant assistance to the MMA and BNDES in the process o f
structuring the Amazon Fund.

232. More broadly and as noted under section A.3. the reform program supported by the SEM
DPL follows the PAS, the WBG's Amazon Partnership Framework, and the NCCAP, all o f
which were thorouphly consulted during their elaboration. The role o f BNDES in environmental
management was discussed in the course o f the CPS consultations and widely endorsed by the
GOB and civil society, and BNDES intends to consult stakeholders on the development of its
Environmental and Social Institutional Policy and related sub-sectoral guidelines. Lastly, the
current project includes impacts which contribute to eight o f the 14,targets set out inthe recently
concluded CPS.

233. To ensure transparency and enable social participation during proiect implementation, the
SEM DPL will use a web-based monitoring system open to the public. This system, developed
through the ENV TAL, will monitor the intermediate steps necessary to conclude each action or
trigger of the SEM DPL, as well as the targeted outcome indicators. The ENV TAL further
enables the participation o f civil society by providing a seat in the high-level Technical
Committee which defines the technical assistance to be provided by the ENV TAL in support o f
the SEM DPL's targets.

234. Overall, the program's mitigated risk is moderateto substantial and depends on the
speed by which BNDES fully implements the reform agenda across its operations. On the
other hand, if it i s successful, the potential returns would be more substantial, and hence the
strong justification for the proposed operation.

                                                                        Brasilia, January 30,2009

Mr.Robert B.Zoellick
President
World Bank
Washington, D C USA


Dear Sir,

    This letter is intendedto submit the proposal for the Programmatic Development Policy Loan
for Sustainable Environmental Management (DPL) with a view to receiving support from the
World Bank to update and expand environmental sustainability policies in Brazil. The Brazilian
Government's agenda for institutional and microeconomic reforms presentedbelow i s intended
to promote social inclusion and balanced development, with a focus on protection o f natural
resources and environmental sustainability.

BRAZIL MACROECONOMIC SCENARIO
           -
    Brazil i s in a positive moment as compared to other times in its history. The Country has
resumed the path of economic growth, which reflects the adoption of appropriate fiscal and
monetary measures towards macroeconomic stability. Between 2004 and 2007, the economy
grew on average 4.6 percent, well above the average annual rate o f the previous decades, o f 2.5
percent.

    Moreover, Brazil has overcome an adverse situation o f indebtedness with the rest o f the
world, emerging as a net foreign creditor and accumulating a high level o f international reserves.
Thus, Brazil presents less external vulnerability, has significantly reduced the country risk and
has diversified national exports, improving the debt profile that lessens volatility in face o f
market conditions variations.

    In this positive context, it is worth noting the soundness of the fiscal policy, evidenced by
robust primary surpluses that contributed to the drop in the debt/GDP ratio, a trend that i s
expected to continue steadily inthe next few years. From 2003 to 2007, the accumulated primary
result o f the public sector represented an average o f 4 percent o f GDP, ensuring the full
achievement o f fiscal objectives established in the Budgetary Guidelines Laws - LDOs. In
particular, the nominal deficit, accumulated from January to November, dropped from 2.34
percent o f GDP in2006 to 0.40 percent in 2008. Similarly, the net public debt dropped from 52.4
percent of GDP at the end o f 2003 to 34.9 percent o f GDP inNovember 2008.



                                                                                                77

    Moreover, the inflation target regime has helped to anchor inflation expectations: the
inflation measured by the IPCA dropped from 12.5 percent in 2002 to 4.3 percent in 2007.
Consistent with the regime, the Central Bank reduced the basic interest rate from a peak o f 19.75
percent in 2005 to 11-25 percent in 2007. Since the end o f 2007, the more dynamic domestic
demand and external inflationary pressures (increased demand for food, increase o f oil barrel
prices and particularly o f commodity prices) lead to the rise o f interest rates to the current level
o f 13.75 percent, bringingthe 2008 inflation rate to the interval defined inthe target established.

    At the same time, investment programs in the social and infrastructure areas are being
consolidated, which encourages economic growth and formalization o f the labor market, and
reduces poverty and income inequality.

    Within this context, it is worth noting that the poverty rate decreased from 32.9 percent in
2003 to 24.1 percent in 2007, the drop in unemployment (over 12 percent in 2003 to less than 9
percent in 2008), as well as the income increases, particularly among the population with less
purchasing power, helped improve the Gini index.

    Lastly, the current macroeconomic foundations reflect responsible achievements and concrete
actions, and mean that the Federal Government is in a position to strengthen and consolidate the
gains derived from the progress achieved.

MACROECONOMICSITUATION
      Notwithstanding the specific impacts o f the international financial crisis on countries, the
Brazilian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) i s expected to expand more than 5.5 percent in 2008.

      Nevertheless, the prospects for 2009 seem to be less favorable. The current crisis causes a
restriction o f external credit in the country, greater risk aversion and reduction in the pace o f
economic activity, with effects, among others, on raw material exports and on the companies'
production.

      Faced with the variations in the international market conditions, the Federal Government
has focused on easing the current turbulences through specific temporary measures,
strengthening its commitment with the continuation o f the fiscal and monetary policies. The
measures adopted include: a) tax unburdening (IRPF, IOF and IPI) as a fiscal incentive;            b)
liquidity in foreign currency for normalization of the domestic credit market and reduction of
currency exchange volatility; c) increased credit supply from the Brazilian Economic and Social
Development Bank BNDES to companies; d) reduction o f compulsory reserve and short-term
                     -
loans for the banking system; e) in the area o f insurances, access to commercial credit lines for
exporters;   (0 advancement of disbursements for the 2008/2009 agricultural harvest and (g)
strengtheningof the federal financial institutions' role (Bank of Brazil - BB and Federal Savings
Bank  - CEF)  intheir participation inprivate banks.

    Inview of the solid foundations ofthe Brazilianeconomy and the deep commitment with the
continuity o f the fiscal and monetary policies, the current turbulences will be overcome and
economic expansion will be resumedinthe mediumterm.



                                                                                                   78

 ENVIRONMENTALSUSTAINABILITY
        In addition to an advanced legislative framework, Brazil has one of the most modern
 environmental management systems. Despitethe set o f goals achieved interms o f environmental
 policy, institutional development and management o f environmental conditions, it i s considered
 essential to continue overcoming the existing challenges inthis agenda.

        The government's 2008-2011Multi-Year Plan (PPA) reaffirms Brazil's commitment to
 economic growth combined with income distribution and environmental balance, in which the
 education o f children, youths and adults, the promotion o f social inclusion and the reduction o f
 inequality head the list o f national priorities.

        The preservation and valuation of the environment is a compulsory agenda for Brazil,
 which has a large share o f the world's natural assets and the challenge o f combining economic
 growth and social development with the sustainable use o f natural resources. The Federal
 Government's environmental policy follows the principles o f sustainable development, cross-

,cutting action, participation and control by society. The promotion o f economic growth in Brazil
 depends on the sustainable use o f natural resources to ensure that future generations will be able
 to use these resources to meet their needs.

      In this sense, the environmental agenda included in the PPA contemplates actions and
 measures aimed at: a) improving the licensing system; b) reducing deforestation and
 desertification and improving the biodiversity conservation in all biomes; c) improving the water
 resources management to increase the quality and availability o f water for the population, to
 control pollution, and to revitalize the river basins; d) increasing the contribution o f sustainable
 use o f natural resources and protected areas towards national development; and e) promoting
 environmental management, sustainable production and consumption inrural and urban areas, as
 well as among traditional communities and indigenous peoples.

        It is within this context that the Brazilian Government proposes to the World Bank a
 program with two credit operations for the development o f environmental sustainability, with a
 view to supporting its efforts towards: a) improving the effectiveness and efficiency o f the
 policies and guidelines o f the Brazilian environmental management system, and b)
 mainstreaming sustainable environmental development principles inkey growth sectors.
 The responsibility for the execution of the actions beingproposed will remain with the Ministry
 o f the Environment - MMA and BNDES, given the importance o f its role in long-term funding
o f investment inthe Brazilian economy.

IMPROVEMENTOFTHE ENVIRONMENTALMANAGEMENTSYSTEM
       As a means to modernize and strengthen environmental management and the
implementation o f the National Environment Policy, the Brazilian Government, besides
reorganize the Ministry o f the Environment and created the Brazilian Forest Service - SFB, in
2006, to promote public forest management for sustainable production, and the Chico Mendes
Biodiversity Conservation Institute - ICMBio in 2007 to manage conservation units, conduct
research, and protect biodiversity. Thus, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and


                                                                                                   79

 Renewable Natural Resources         -  IBAMA shifted its focus onto environmental control,
 enforcement and licensing.

      At the MMA, this new design lead to the creation of new Departments within the
Executive Secretariat and the reorganization o f the singular Units o f the Ministry in order to
adapt them to the new priorities o f the environmental sector, as a result o f its expanded
responsibilities and the incorporation o f new competencies. It i s worth noting that the
implementation o f these new structures and o f the Environmental Policy depends, basically, on
the adequate staffing. From this viewpoint, the situation in2003 was critical, not only as regards
the institutional links, but also interms ofremuneration.

      However, it should be noted that even though this institutional change has focused on
consolidating the environmental policy framework at the Federal Government's level so that it
can evolve inthe near future, it i s still far from being appropriate. A discussion i s taking place in
the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management - MP on the restructuring of the
Environmental Specialist Career so that it becomes a work instrument that allows social control
and efficiency and effectiveness o f the services provided, and public servants can deliver high
level services.

        As a next step of this institutional strengtheningstrategy, the conclusion o f the selection
process i s expected to add 100 fixed-term technical staff, 225 environmental analysts, 175
Environmental Analysts and 100 fixed-term technical staff to the Ministry o f Environment,
Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renovaveis - IBAMA, ICMBio
and SFB, respectively.

        The Brazilian Government is also promoting environmental management integration
among its three administration levels, including the environmental licensingprocedures. The 27
states established tripartite committees (federal, state and municipal) to discuss and agree on
common regulations, making the responsibilities o f each level clear and establishing consistent
procedures for licensing.      A draft bill submitted to the Congress defines the environmental
jurisdiction o f the three administration levels, including the authority to issue environmental
licenses.   After the approval of the law, the Government's next step will be to adopt the
necessary regulation for its full enforcement, in order to ensure the clear division o f
responsibilities among the three administrative levels.

    Moreover, the national legislation on environmental damage compensation i s beingreviewed.
The current value of the fines or of the compensation for certain environmental damages i s not
uniform in the agencies and administration levels. As a result, few fines are actually paid
because their value i s the object o f lengthy litigations. Thus, such review will contribute to
strengthenthe effective enforcement of the environmental policy.

    Furthermore, the Government i s committed with Climate Change mitigation and adaptation.
To this end, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change drafted a proposal for a National
Climate Change Action Plan - NCCAP, covering the 2008-2012 period, which i s undergoing
public consultation. The NCCAP proposal presents a balance between command-and-control and



                                                                                                   80

 economic instruments in mitigation and adaptation actions. The Plan supports the Clean
 Development Mechanism and the verification o f emission reduction, capacity building,
 monitoring, and clean technology transfer. The NCCAP proposes the use o f national economic
 instruments in the area o f land use related to deforestation reduction, reforestation and
 agribusiness. The NCCAP also envisages actions that increase the resilience o f the drinking
 water supply systems, improvement o f monitoring and alert systems for extreme climatic events,
 investments in preventive infrastructure        for floods,    institutional capacity building in
 communication and management o f risks and disasters. The next step i s the launching o f the
 2008-2012 National Climate Change Action Plan including targets and mechanisms to evaluate
 its performance.

     In compliance with the NCCAP, BNDES will establish credit lines to support clean
 development, Clean Development Mechanism - C D M and other carbon-related operations.
 These lines will provide an efficient contribution to the Plan's goals, supporting the private
 sector inthe adoption o f climate change mitigation and adaptation practices.

     The Brazilian Government's commitment to support sustainable environmental activities has
been strengthened by the recent signing o f the new Green Protocol by all the federal banks
(BNDES, CEF, BB, Bank o f the Northeast of Brazil - BNB and Bank o f the Amazon BASA).       -
The signatory banks agreed to promote policies and procedures aimed at financing development
with environmental responsibility by means of credit lines and programs that improve the quality
o f life o f the population, promote sustainable use o f natural resources and environmental
protection. The aim i s to provide better services to productive sector players that operate
according to the principles o f sustainability.

       It is recognized that BNDES has a key leadership role, since it is the biggest source of
financing for companies inthe country. BNDES will continue to improve its environmental and
social institutional policies, which will be applied to its direct financial operations and, gradually,
to its entire portfolio o f operations, through specific procedures compatible with the
characteristics o f the different modalities o f indirect operations.     It is understood that these
actions by BNDES may become an important systemic reference, particularly for other financial
institutions interested inpromoting environmental and social sustainability principles.

NATURAL RESOURCESMANAGEMENTAND CONSERVATION
       The Brazilian Government is fully committed to the sustainability o f natural resources
management and conservation and the reduction o f deforestation. To this end, the legal
framework has been improved, innovative plans and instruments have been established and
enforcement actions have been strengthened.

     The National Congress approved two bills proposed by the Executive that affect public lands
and the severely threatened biome o f the Atlantic Rainforest: a) the Public Forest Management
Law, which allows the establishment o f sustainable forest management concessions in National
Forests and other public lands; and b) the Atlantic Rainforest Law, which protects the remaining
7 percent o f the original biome, promotes reforestation with native species and establishes
incentives for its conservation. The Public Forest Management Law complies with strict



                                                                                                   81

sustainability principles, thus contributing to the promotion o f sustainable forest management by
addressing the main limitations o f the sector - allowing access to forest areas in a legalized and
controlled environment for the work o f responsible companies, and producing timber without
deforestation.

    The Brazilian Government, through the National Monetary Council, approved Resolution
3545, which determines that banks cannot provide credit to agricultural producers who cannot
provide documental proof o f compliance with the environmental legislation. The Resolution i s a
clear incentive for producers to meet the requirementto maintain a portion o f natural vegetation
intheir properties (legal reserves and permanent protection areas), and may include reforestation
o f deforested areas.

    BNDES will contribute further to the implementation of this approach by means of a set of
instruments-lines, programs and funds -available to it. To this end, some of its programs (such
as REFLORESTA, Amazon Fund, among others) and its sub-sectoral guidelines are being
reviewed. These initiatives are aimed at enabling the necessary conditions to induce long-term
improvement of forest management, within the sector's new legal framework and its
environmental and social policy.

    The Brazilian Government has officially approved the innovative Sustainable Amazon Plan -
PAS to promote sustainable development o f the region and o f the local population. The PAS
was designed through a participatory process by a committee composed o f 13 ministries, and
focuses on: a) competitive sustainable production; b) land administration and environmental
management; c) social inclusion; and d) infrastructure for development. This plan i s guiding all
the Government's actions in the region in an integrated manner, and incorporates all the other
previously existing programs for the region.

    The next initiative is the conclusion of the macro Ecologic-Economic Zoning (ZEE) of the
Amazon to indicate the main uses o f the land in the region. The macro ZEE i s based on the PAS
and will be available for use by the States that compose the Legal Amazon, with a view to
facilitating their processes o f preparation o f the state ZEEs (scale o f 1:250.000). The state ZEEs,
as established by the Brazilian legislation, are key to defining land use inthe states, especially the
areas to be protected and made available for productive use.

    The Amazon Fundwas created inorder to promote the protection of Brazilian tropical forests
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation. This Fund will support, with non-
reimbursable funds, projects in the areas deforestation prevention, monitoring or control, or that
promote conservation and sustainable use o f natural resources, presentedby government agencies
and civil society organizations. The fund i s managed by BNDES and will be capitalized solely by
means o f donations from bilateral, multilateral agencies and from the private sector, always
conditional to reduction of the annual deforestation rate in relation to the average annual rate of
the last ten years. The next step is the definition ofthe Amazon Fund's Operational Policy so that
it can become fully operational.




                                                                                                   82

    Along with this, the Brazilian Government, within its priorities, will publish a Presidential
Decree regulating the operation and implementation o f the Atlantic Rainforest Fund, created by
the Atlantic Rainforest Law. The Fund will have an important role in the promotion of
reforestation o f this critical habitat and o f conservation o f the remaining forest areas, by
providing non-reimbursable funds to NGOs and agencies o f the three levels o f administration.

    The Brazilian Government will continue to make its best efforts in order to have part of its
debt with the United States Government converted into funds to support rain forest conservation
projects through the TFCA - Tropical Forest Conservation Act. Said funds will be used in the
Atlantic Forest Biome.

MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES
      Water distribution and access conditions vary greatly in Brazil, and some urban areas face
serious challenges related to water pollution and floods. In order to address this important issue,
the Government has developed and launched the National Water Resources Plan - PNRH aimed
at the strengthening o f the institutions incharge o f water resources management, improvement o f
the regulatory framework and implementation ofmanagement instruments.

      Another initiative that i s worth noting i s the creation o f the National Water Quality
Evaluation Program - PNQA, based on the PNRH and within the National Water Agency's
framework. The program i s based on partnerships between the National Water Agency         - ANA
and the states, in order to standardize evaluation procedures, and to make information on the
quality o f water available to the public.

      As a continuation of the PNQA implementation, the next steps are the signingof Technical
Cooperation Agreements with ten state governments, five o f which are short-term agreements
and the other are medium-term agreements with a view to implementing the Program in the
respective states.

      The Government also adopts charges for the use of untreated water, incompliance with the
PNRH, as an important tool to promote sustainability, since such charges finance water resources
management and promote water conservation. This mechanism has already been adopted in two
river basins and the Government intends to expand it gradually to other basins. Moreover, in
basins that have serious degradation and water pollution upstream that affect users downstream,
the Environmental Service Fees - PSA programs are appropriate and should be designed and
implemented. A program o f this type was piloted in the basins of the Piracicaba, Capivari and
Jundiai rivers (PCJ) to protect and preserve the water sources o f the Cantareira system, which
supplies the Silo Paulo metropolitan area. The initiative i s supported by the federal government
and involves partnerships with NGOs and municipal and state organizations, and is partially
fundedby the fees charged for use of untreated water.

ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION
      Although Brazil has experienced continuous improvements in water supply efficiency,
drainage o f liquid wastes and solid waste services, regional inequalities in access to these
services remain. With a view to continuing progress in this important agenda, the National


                                                                                                83

Congress approved a new Federal Law o f Guidelines on Basic Sanitation, whose draft bill was
proposed by the Executive. This law defines national guidelines, obligatory for States and
Municipalities, for the implementation o f sanitation standards as the provision o f sanitation
services grows. One o f the main goals o f the law i s to increase investments to achieve universal
access to water and sanitation, taking into account local specificities and the use o f appropriate
technologies inline with users' payment capacity.

       The next step will be a review by BNDES o f its sectoral guidelines for the "Urban Solid
Waste Management" and for "Water, Sanitation and Drainage" to reflect its environmental and
social policies and the new legal framework.

       Moreover, ANA will continue with the implementation o f the Water Basins Depolluting
Program - PRODES (which promotes the purchase o f treated sewage), whose conception i s in
full compliance with the new legislation. A review will be made of the program's regulation in
order to assess the possibility o f making feasible: (i) concentration o f investments in priority
                                                        the
areas for the maintenancehecovery o f the natural waters quality, (ii)a greater incentive for the
participation o f small municipalities, and, (iii) hiring criteria review based on the Program's
                                                 the
budget.

       Regarding solid waste management, the Brazilian Government submitted to the Congress
the draft bill of the National Solid Waste Management Law and will dedicate its best efforts
towards its approval. The policies in this draft bill define approaches for garbage collection,
treatment and final disposal, as well as policies to reduce the solid waste flows and to maximize
recycling and reuse. Once approved, the Government will edit the regulatory decree(s) required.

RENEWABLE ENERGY
     Brazil i s proud that the share o f renewable energy in the national energy matrix i s
significantly bigger than in other parts o f the world, accounting for approximately 46 percent o f
the domestic energy supply in2007. The Government is promoting efforts to maintain the strong
participation o f renewable sources in the Brazilian energy matrix in face o f the natural growth o f
demand expected incoming years.

     Inthis respect, a strategic environmental evaluation instrument specific for the energy sector
i s being developed: the Integrated Environmental Evaluation - AAI for river basins, aimed at
supporting decision making in the electricity sector, facilitating the consideration o f the socio-
environmental dimension at the level o f the river basin, inan integrated perspective o f the uses o f
water. The AAI is already being applied to ten river basins in the development o f surveys on
hydraulic potential for electricity generation. The results o f these surveys will guide the selection
and preparation o f additional hydroelectric concessions for auctioning and pave the way for
sustainable development o f hydroelectric potentials. The Brazilian Government i s also
supporting additional private investments, by means o f the Program o f Incentives for Alternative
Electricity Sources - PROINFA, in renewable technologies and has enabled the commercial
operation of approximately 2,500 MW o f installed capacity from renewable energy sources
(biomass, wind and small hydroelectric plants - PCHs).




                                                                                                   84

   Between 2003 and 2008, BNDES approved R$ 18 billion for projects related to electricity
generation from renewable sources, including hydroelectric plants, PCHs, biomass and wind,
with a capacity of 14 thousand MW. In the same period, the approvals for biofuel, ethanol and
diesel projects totaled R$ 7 billion. BNDES will prepare specific sub-sectoral guidelines for
renewableenergy projects.

   The Government has also been making efforts to increase energy efficiency, thus reducing
demand for generation of new energy, by means of initiatives such as the Program for
Conservation of Electric Energy - PROCEL and the National Program for Rationalization of the
Use of Oil and Natural Gas Products - CONPET. In the scope of its action, BNDES has several
programs and credit lines, such as the Line of Support to Energy Efficiency Projects -
PROESCO, which finances energy efficiency projects. The next step is for BNDES to increase
the number of financial intermediaries engaged in offering these programs, thus increasing its
reach.

   Wi,th the certainty that the request submitted by the Brazilian government will receive your
closest attention, we trust the World Bank will undertakeall required administrative measures.

Sincerely yours.

            ANNEX 2     -ACHIEVEMENTS                 UNDERPREVIOUSDPL OPERATIONS

 1. In 2004, the World Bank had a previous operation in support o f environmental sustainability
inBrazil (FirstProgrammatic Reform Loan for Environmental Sustainability-ENV PRL I).                          This
loan was designedas the first in a series o f up to three loans over a three-year period22to support
key measures within a broader GOB program for the reform o f environmental management
policies and procedures. The loan supported two complementary set o f policy reforms and
actions: (i)   actions that are under the control or influence o f MMA institutional strengthening,
                                                                                   -
protected areas, forest management, hazardous chemicals and the water resources management
system, and (ii)actions aimed at incorporating environmental concerns within other economic
sectors and ministries.A companion Technical Assistance Loan for Environmental Sustainability
(ENV TAL) to fund analytical work and capacity buildingto support the ENV PRL I1and I11was
approved in2005 and i s ongoing.

2. While the GOB elected not to request the second and third operations o f the previous ENV
PRL series, it remained firmly committed to the reform agenda and many o f the triggers set for
these operations were recently met and serve as basis for the current SEM DPL series. The ENV
PRL series intended to support the GOB in improving the effectiveness o f the environmental
licensing process and the integration among the three levels o f government. The ENV PRL I
supported the establishment by the GOB o f the procedures to create State Tripartite Committees
to discuss and agree on common regulations clarifying the responsibilities of each tier, vis-&-vis
licensing, which can be implemented without additional legislation. The GOB continued to
implement this agenda and State Tripartite Committees were created in all states and in the
Federal District*. This was a clear step forward, and the Congress is now considering a draft law
submitted by the GOB defining environmentaljurisdiction among the three tiers o f government.

3. In addition, The ENV PRL, series intended to support the GOB'S efforts to improve
transparency and public participation in the licensing process. The ENV PRL Isupported the
approval of the Transparency Law to allow public tracking o f the licensing process, so as to
contribute to clearer rules o f the game and improved efficiency by increasing social controls.
IBAMA, with the support o f the ENV TAL, implementeda web-based information system open
to the general public, which promotes greater monitoring by civil society*. As a result, every
step o f the licensing o f any project being analyzed at the federal level can be monitored through
this system.

4. The ENV PRL series intendedto support the GOB in improving the federal environmental
agencies. The ENV PRL Isupported the Presidential decree creating a public career category o f
environmental specialists and authorizing the hiring of new staff for MMA and IBAMA with the
objective o f improving institutional effectiveness. The GOB maintained its commitment to
restructure MMA and its affiliated agencies as all 900 permanent career staff were hired* and


22The second and third operation under the ENV PRL series were not requestedby the GOB during the course of
2006-2007, as was originally programmed.
* This action hadbeen identified as a trigger for the ENV PRL 11, as were other actions subsequently denoted here
by an asterisk.



                                                                                                                86

received training with the support o f the ENV TAL. A GOB decree restructured the MMA
including the creation o f new secretariats for Climate Change and Social Participation*. IBAMA
was restructured* to focus on licensing and enforcement, while the ICMBio was created to focus
on the protected areas system and biodiversity conservation, and the SFB to focus on sustainable
forest management inpublic land.

5. The ENV PRL series intended to support the GOB in promoting sustainable forest
management. THE ENV PRL Isupported the GOB's submission o f the draft Public Forest Law
to Congress. The Law was later approved and enacted and the Presidential decree with the
detailed regulations was also signed*, The institutional framework (Brazilian Forest Service-
SFB) was created, andthe process of awarding the first roundof forest concessions is underway.

6. The ENV PRL series intended to support the GOB in conserving the Atlantic Forest. The
ENV PRL Isupported the initial approval of The Atlantic Forest Law by the House of
Representatives. The Law was later approved by the Senate and enacted*. It defines the extent o f
the biome and introduces a special legal regime applicable to forest areas within the biome. The
Law also establishes more stringent rules on land and forest use and protection, and provides for
the restoration o f forest cover and the creation o f a fund for that purpose. The ENV TAL i s
supporting the studies and consultation process to prepare the GOB's decree with the rules and
regulations related to this new law.

7. The ENV PRL series intended to support the GOB in combating deforestation in the
Amazon. The ENV PRL Isupported the Presidential Decree that created the inter-ministerial
committee to prepare the comprehensive Sustainable Amazon Program (PAS) through a
participatory process supported by the ENV TAL. While the PAS was being prepared, the GOB
implemented an Action Plan for the Prevention and Control o f Deforestation inthe Amazon and
the Sustainable Development Plan for the BR-163 region in the Amazon*, allowing for the
implementation o f zoning prior to the paving o f these roads. As a result, almost 4 million
hectares o f protected areas were created inthe BR-163 region, and several joint operations by the
Ministry o f Justice, Ministry of Environment and INCRA were carried out* resultinginhundreds
o f arrests and thousands o f logs seized. The annual deforestation rate decreased to 0.27% in 2007
compared to 0.67% in 2004.

8. The ENV PRL series intended to support the GOB in improving water resources
management. The ENV PRL Isupported the approval by Congress o f a law proposed by the
GOB, establishing the conditions and means for water basin management to allow basin agencies
to serve as executing arms o f basin committees and to collect bulk water tariffs. Continuing the
GOB policy reform in the water resources sector the National Water Resources Council
approved, and the President o f Brazil launched, the National Water Resources Plan* (PNRH),
which defines the actions needed for the effective implementation o f the national water resources
management system. The ENV TAL supported technical studies and the consultation process
used to define the PNRH. The authorization to charge for bulk water enables the financing o f
water resources management and promotes water conservation.                 This is a basin-wide
participatory process already being implemented inthe Paraiba do Sul and PCJ river basins.




                                                                                                 87

9. The ENV PRL series intended to support the GOB in improving the effectiveness of
environmental and social management systems in financial institutions. The GOB recognized
that the first version of the Green Protocol was not effective due to lack of clear principles and
implementation mechanisms. Thus, the ENV PRL Isupported the creation by the GOB of an
inter-ministerial working group to revise the GP and prepared a new draft. The GOB continued
supporting this initiative and the revised GreenProtocol was recently signed by the GOB and its
federal banks* (BNDES, CAIXA, BNB, BASA, BB).

10.The ENV PRL series intended to support the GOB in improving the environmental
sustainability of the energy sector. The ENV PRL Isupported the formal technical cooperation
agreement between the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Mines and Energy for the
implantation of a common environmental agenda. This cooperation resulted in the development
and adoption of the Integrated Environmental Assessment* (IEA) tool. The IEA is a tool to
analyze entire water basins with the potential for several hydroelectric plants, enabling adequate
identification of potential cumulative effects, and proposing the actual number and size of plants
inorder to prevent or minimize suchpotential impacts. The IEA has already been applied to 10
water basins.

11. The ENV PRL series and the associated ENV TAL also supported the GOB in improving
other aspects of the environmental agenda which are not being followed inthe current SEM DPL
series. Insome cases, policies have already been reformed and are under implementationand no
additional steps are foreseen during the implementation period of the SEM DPL series. An
example is the design and operationalization of the Program for Prevention and Rapid Response
to Emergencies with Hazardous Chemicals (P2R2), which addresses key issues related to
transport, storage, contamination and harmful by-products associated with chemicals. The
additional work neededi s on the technical level and is being supportedthrough the ENV TAL.

12.Another reasonnot to continue supporting the GOB in certain policy reforms on topics of the
environmental agenda previously identified inthe ENV PRL series is to avoid further increase in
the complexity of the SEMDPL. One ofthe lessonslearnedfrom the ENV PRL series is that the
large number of actions and triggers to be implemented by a large set of institutions (seven
ministries) created a very complex model to monitor and support, and led to uneven
implementation among different agencies. While the Ministry of Environment implemented
almost all of the proposed reforms, other ministries implemented fewer. Thus, the SEM DPL
series focuses its support on those GOB policy reforms which are being well implemented and
are ready for subsequent steps aimed at its effective adoption and implementation.

                         Brazil-Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                         December I,2008

  I.     h i the context of hicoyarit exterrial corrditioiis and a soirrid policy frariiework.,
 Brazil's riiacroecoriortiicperfr,rniaiice iri recent years has heeii strong. Growth has topped
 6 percent in recent quarters while inflation remained within the target range, despite the
 world spike in food and fuel prices. Brazil's policy framework has been a key pillar of
 macroeconomic stability, with the fiscal responsibility law placing public debt ratios on a
 downward trend and inflation targeting having lowered inflation to low single digit levels

 2.      Brazil is now in a signi~cantlystronger position than in the past to withstand an
 adverseglobal environment. Several factors contribute to providing policy credibility and
 financial resiliencein Brazil: the macroeconomic framework is strong and the exchangerate
 flexible; vulnerabilities have been reduced in recent years, including with a sharp reduction
 in public externaldebt; the central bank's foreign reservesare comfortable; large banks are
 liquid and well capitalized; and the external current account deficit is relatively small.

3.       I n recent months, the adverse impact of the global crisis has been felt in Brazil, but
thepolicy response has beeri tinrely and wellguided.Access to foreign lines of credit has
become more difficult and domestic liquidity has tightened, affecting in particular small and
medium banks. Some large Brazilian corporates have sufferedsignificant losses from
exposure to foreign currency derivatives.The central bank has continuedto let the currency
float, intervening to address disorderly market conditions. To alleviate liquidity pressures,the
central bank has reducedbank reserve requirements. broadenedthe set of assets that can be
rediscounted, and conducted rediscount operations in foreign currencyto be on-lent to
exporters. Brazil's strong fundamentalsand pro-active policy responsewould be expected to
limit the fallout from the global financial crisis. with GDP growth projectedat around 3
percent in 2009. There are, however, downside risks associated with a possibleprotracted
slowdown in domestic credit, a prolongedtightening of foreign financing including of trade
credit lines, and a greater fallout from the global slowdown.

4.       The authorities have reaffirmed theirfiscal stance and plan to boost the lending
activity ofpublic banks. They continueto aim at a primary surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP in
2009, down from round 4.3 percent in 2008. With Brazil's still high public debt ratios and
large rollover needs, the authorities have indicatedthat the primary surplus target could be
raised during the year, depending on how conditions unfold. The authorities also plan to step
up the lending operations of the national development bank BNDES, including to support
sectors faced with difficulties, which would need to be managedcarefully to ensure an
efficient allocation of resources.

                       ANNEX 7 -ENVIRONMENTAL INSTITUTIONS


 1.    The National Environment Council, CONAMA, is the lead institution o f National
Environmental System (SISNAMA). Its main function i s assisting the President o f Brazil in
 formulating National Environmental Policy Directives.          It includes representatives from all
ministries, other relevant federal agencies, the states, municipalities, civil society organizations,
and from the private sector.     CONAMA, along with its technical commissions, establishes,
among other functions, norms and criteria, national environmental norms, guidelines and
standards for the environmental licensing system, related to protected areas, and critical polluted
areas, and decides as last instance o f administrative appeal on penalties imposed by federal
environmental agencies.

2.     The Ministry o f Environment (MMA), established in 1992, has primary responsibility for
planning, coordinating and implementing the National Environment Policy established by the law
o f 1981. Specific areas o f responsibility are: policies for the conservation and sustainable use o f
ecosystems, biodiversity and forests;         strategies and instruments aimed at improving
environmental quality and the sustainable use o f natural resources; policies integrating
production and environment, and programs and policies for the Amazon.

3.     The Institute for Environment and Renewable Resources (IBAMA), created in 1989, i s the
main federal environmental executive agency, subordinated to MMA. IBAMA i s currently
responsible for the enforcement o f environmental policy in the fields o f environmental control,
use o f renewable resources including the permit and control o f exploitation and transport o f
forest resources, among other things. Until very recently, IBAMA was also responsible for
managing federal protected areas, promoting the conservation o f endangered species, and
controlling fisheries. These responsibilities have been transferred to the recently created ICMBio.
In addition, IBAMA was also responsible for promoting sustainable forest management. This
responsibility has beentransferred to the recently created SFB.

4.     The Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA) was created in July 2000, inresponse to the
increasing demands on water resources for multiple uses (e.g., agriculture, industry, urban,
hydropower, navigation, and recreational). ANA i s an executive agency o f the MMA, with a
mandate i s to implement the National Policy on Water Resources. It i s managed by a Board o f
Directors and has autonomy to regulate the multiplewater uses.

5.     The National Water Resources Council (CNRH) is composed o f representatives from the
federal and state administrations, water users groups and organized civil society. One o f its major
roles i s to define complementary directives for the implementation o f the National Policy on
Water Resources. MMA supports the Council with technical work for its decision-making and as
its technical secretariat.  Its other attributions are the formulation of the National Policy on
Water Resources, the approval and oversight o f the National Water Resources Plan, and the
integration o f water resources and environmental management. State-level institutions
corresponding roughly to CONAMA, MMA, IBAMA, ANA and CNRH exist in virtually all
states.




                                                                                                  98

6.    The Public Prosecutor's Office (Ministe`rioPtiblico- MP) is a unique institution worldwide.
It serves as a "fourth branch" of government as it is independent of the other three branches. The
M P plays a highly significant role in environmental management and governance at both levels,
federal and state. One o f its duties i s to protect the People's rights to "sound" environmental
quality and to bring criminal and civil action against environmental offenders. Hundreds o f
environmental lawsuits (both civil and criminal) are filed every year at both federal and state
courts, often with positive results for environmental management but only after lengthy
processes.

7.    The Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) was created in 2007
with the mandate o f managing all federal projected areas in Brazil and conserving biodiversity.
Its responsibilities include: (i)carrying out studies and consultations for the preparation o f the
Presidential decrees for the creation o f new federal protected areas; (ii)
                                                                          protecting and managing
existing federal protected areas, including tourism and sustainable use o f natural resources by the
local communities within these protected areas; and, (iii)supporting studies and knowledge
dissemination on management o f protected areas, biodiversity conservation and sustainable use
o f wildlife, fisheries and forest plant species. These responsibilities were previously under
IBAMA. Thus, the staff working on biodiversity conservation and protected areas at IBAMA at
the time o fICMBio's creation were seconded to ICMBio.

8.    The National Forest Service (SFB) was created in 2006 with the mandate to management
the forests in federal public land. Its responsibilities include: (i)design and implemented forest
concession that ensure sustainable forest management, with preference given to local
communities living in the area, (ii)design and support training and research programs aimed at

                                         -

 1.    BNDES is a key source (over one-third) of long-term financing for Brazil's economic
development. Wholly owned by the federal government, BNDES' main source of funding comes
from governmenttaxes, allowing for a stable source of long-term financing23.In2007, BNDES had
total assets of BRL 202 billion (about US$125 billion), and net income of BRL 7.3 billion, being
the fifth largest bank in Brazil. Roughly two thirds of its credit operations were indirect (through
financial intermediaries) and almost 60 percent of total lending went to infrastructure (33 percent)
and machinery & equipment (25 percent). The bank has a solid financial performance and its
efficiency indicators are betterthan those of peer banks24.

2. Over 2002-2006, lending for infrastructure represented about a third of the overall BNDES
portfolio: 12 percent of this was lent directly to the public sector (state or municipal governments
or decentralized public enterprises), with the bulk lent to private providers of infrastructure
services (primarily transport and energy generation, but extending to "social and urban" projects as
well). With the onset of the PAC, BNDES infrastructure lending is projected to more than double
in2007-2010 to BRL 50 billion annually, or about 60 percent of BNDES' lending per annum. As
PAC implementation accelerated quickly in the first semester of 2008, BNDES disbursements
increasedby over 45 percent comparedto the second semester o f 2007.

3, BNDES non-infrastructure lending, including its recently initiatedenvironmentally and socially
sustainable business lines, extend well beyond the activities of the PAC. In these areas and
through its indirect lending (largely loans under BRL 10 million) BNDES reaches over 100,000
borrowers annually, mainly medium sized enterprises and small agribusiness companies. These
enterprises do not typically adopt corporate social and environmental responsibility programs and
therefore .could represent an important target group for mainstreaming improved social and
environmental policies and practices. The Government recognizes the opportunity to reach this
target group through BNDES, as well as the additional instrument which improved BNDES
environmental and social screening will provide for addressing the sustainability challenges of
large infrastructure.

4. Since 2005 BNDES has beenexpanding its capacity to address socio-environmental issues. An
Environment Department has been re-created and subsequently ~trengthened~~,and in 2005
BNDES enacted an Environmental Policy. BNDES management has clearly indicated its full
commitment to social and environmental sustainability, thus providing a solid foundation on which
further Institutional Policy changes canmaterialize as part of aproject policy framework.

5. BNDES i s also starting to play a more prominent role in green lines of business that promote
the sustainable use of natural resources. Planted forests for paper, pulp, charcoal, and timber,
native forest management for timber and non-timber products, CDM projects, and rehabilitation of
degraded areas are key targeted areas, in addition to BNDES' more traditional environmentally
related areas of solid waste management, and energy efficiency. BNDES is also creating a regular

lending program to support certified forest operations which is key for the success o f the new
federal program o f Forest Concessions.          This program has the extremely important aims o f
increasing sustainably managed forested areas from 2.7 to 8.0 million hectares over the period
2008-2013 and reducing deforestation pressure by over 25 percent. These green lines o f business
represent enormous challenges and opportunities for BNDES, if it can obtain sufficient financing
and offer adequate terms. In addition, the GOB has chosen BNDES to manage the newly created
Amazon Fund, which i s receiving donations from bilateral agencies and private companies and will
provide grants to state agencies and NGOs working on actions that promote the sustainable use o f
the Amazon's resources and combat deforestation.

6. BNDES i s also one o f the signatories o f the Green Protocol (GP) signedbetweenthe GOB and
all federal banks in August 2008. The GP principles include the commitment (i)                    to consider the
socio-environmental impacts and costs in asset management (full portfolio) and in risk analysis o f
clients and investmentprojects based on the National Environmental Policy Law and (ii)                 to finance
sustainable development through lines o f credit and programs that improve qualify o f life and the
sustainable use o f natural resources. Therefore, BNDES i s reviewing its environmental policies
and green lines o f businessto be fully aligned with the principles o f the GP.

Current Status of BNDES Environmental and Social Screening

7. Since the early 1990s, BNDES has had a formal screening process to address environmental
aspects for its direct lending operations.         In 2002, this process became anchored in specific
environmental guidelines differentiated sectorally for mining, infrastructure, commerce and
services, processing industry and agribusiness. More recently in 2006, social considerations have
beenadded to the process, but these are not yet differentiated sectorally.

8. The first phase o f the screening process examines environmental and social issues as part o f the
overall analysis o f the preliminary proposal submitted by the client to the Credit and Assessment
Committee (CAC). At this stage, the project i s categorized into one o f three levels (A, B, or C),
with the A category indicating highest potential impact. As a part of this review, BNDES'
Environment and Social Department (ESD) prepares a summary sheet describing a series o f
recommendations to prevent or mitigate potential impacts. The project category and the related
recommendations are usually based on general characteristics o f the respective sector or type o f
activity and not on a detailed analysis o f the specific project. The summary sheet i s sent along with
the preliminary project to the different sector department teams responsible for project preparation.
These teams have the responsibility for addressing the environmental and social recommendations,
with ESU being involved only upon request by the project preparation team. Once the project is
prepared, it i s submitted for approval o f higher management (at a meeting o f all BNDES
Directors26).

9. A problem which the BNDES ESD recognizes and i s struggling to address i s that (as Box A
below notes) a majority of the projects which BNDES finances directly do not go through the full
environmental and social review process. There is not yet an official requirement to prepare an
environmental and social annex in the project documentation responding to the recommendations

President.


                                                                                                            101

made by the ESD, though such comments are often made at BNDES Board presentations. In
addition, the ESD i s seeking but has not acquired a clearance role for environmental and social
consideration as part o f the project approval process. During the project supervision process, the
ESD does not yet have the mandate or the capacity to conduct reviews o f adherence to safeguard
procedures by project teams. Fortunately, over the course o f 2007-2008, strong commitment has
emerged and initial actions have been taken on the part o f the ESD and BNDES management to
upgrade the ESD's role and monitoring capacity. As the changes involved are complex, BNDES
has requested World Bank support indesigning these further policy improvements and institutional
strengthening measures to address the ESD's role specifically and social and environmental issues
more widely.

10. Commitment by BNDES to environmental and social outcomes is manifest by BNDES'
attempts to go beyond environmental and social guidelines focused solely on legal compliance.
There are at least three reasons why BNDES demonstrates this commitment. First, the Brazilian
licensing process, though well laid out, does not cover all activities financed by BNDES which
may result in environmental and social impact. Also, as demonstrated in the Bank's recently
released study on Environmental Licensing for Hydroelectric Projects in Brazil, Brazil's current
environmental compliance system i s based on the preparation o f environmental impact assessment
reports, which result from a process which merits a number o f improvements.

11.   The existing environmental and social policies and procedures currently apply only to
BNDES direct operations. Thus, an additional challenge will be for BNDES to develop
mechanisms for applying its environmental and social policies to projects financed by BNDES'
over 70 financial intermediaries.


  Box A: Areas for potential improvement of the BNDES screening process for operations:

       Increase the coverage of the initial environmental and social screeningprocess.(Only 35 percent of
       the projects financed through BNDES' direct lending in 2007 were assessed and given A, B, or C
       ratings, thoughthis rose from 20 percent in 2004);

       Establish a mechanism for a review of the project documentation by the Environmentand Social
       Unit beforethe project is submitted for approval;

       Establish a dispute resolution mechanism. Complaints which arise are directed to the BNDES
       general ombudsman who lacks clear guidelines on how to handlethem;

       Define the toolkit at the disposal of project teams to address environmental and social issues
       identifiedby them during supervision;

       Develop social considerations in the screeningprocessdifferentiatedsectorally;

       Develop a production chain approach in the screening process for operations in key agribusiness
       subsectors, such as meat processing,biofuel productionand other;

       Establish a mechanism for ex-post evaluation of environmental and social aspects during project
       implementation; and,

       Establish a mechanism for applying BNDES environmental and social policies to the projects
       financed by its financial intermediaries, through procedures specified differentially for each major
       type of operation.

     ANNEX 9: The BrazilianEconomyinthe WorldwideFinancialCrisis

                                 Impacts and Main Risks

Effects:

   High volatility in financial markets has been the short run effect of the worldwide
   financial turmoil. Stock market, sovereign spreads and exchange rate movements have
   demonstratedthat despite strong macroeconomic fundamentals, decoupling is unlikely.

   The private sector has been the most affected.The recent episodes of extreme volatility
   in stock and exchange rate markets were triggered by the liquidation of corporations'
   speculative positions and have imposed sizeable losses to Brazilian corporations. In
   addition the liquidity crunch has affected small financial institutions and corporations.
   Nonetheless, the private sector is sound, with medium and large Banks well capitalized
   and not leveraged.

   The Brazilianpublic sector is in a relativelycomfortablesituation.The Public sector has
   not been negatively impacted by the crisis. On the contrary, public debt fell strongly due
   to the exchange rate depreciation, robust growth and large primary surpluses. The net
   creditor position of the Brazilian public sector in debt instruments denominated in
   dollars explainsthe positiveeffect of the exchange rate depreciationon indebtedness.

   The real sector is now feeling the impact of the global slowdown. Industrialproduction
   in November fell 5.2 percent from the previous month, or 6.2 percent year on year.
   Leading indicators suggest a further reduction in December. Retail sales, capacity
   utilization and employment also fell. The formal sector lost 655,000 jobs in December
   (190,000 seasonally adjusted). Market consensus forecasts for GDP growth in 2009 fell
   from 2.4 inNovember to 2 percent in December.

   In the medium term, the economy will however slow down significantly, from the
   estimated 5.3 percent in 2008 to around 2 - depending on the developments in credit
   market recovery, global economic activity and commodity prices.

   The main transmission mechanism of the worldwide crisis to the Brazilian economy
   should be the fall in commodity prices and the expected slowdown in the demand for
   Brazilian exports. External sector balances may continue to deteriorate. The current
   account deficit should reach US$30 billion. The financing of this current account
   deficit, to a great extent, depends on how FDIperforms.

3overnment Reactions:

B  Enhanced fiscal sustainability is allowing the adoption of countercyclical fiscal policy.
   Government announced the reduction of its primary balance target for 2009 and the
   maintenanceof its investment programs.

D  The Central Bank interrupted its monetary tightening to avoid a deeper slowdown in
   economic activity and cut its headline interest rate significantly in January 2009. To
   avoid a sharp credit contraction, the Central Bank has also been very proactive in the
   last months and intervened promptly to inject liquidity. Interventions in the exchange
   rate market have been intensified.

1  In summary, Brazil faces an unfavorable external scenario, but the strengthening of
   macroeconomic fundamentals in recent years make the country able to mitigate the
   effects of the internationalfinancial crisis.



                                                                                             05

1.       Despite its increased resilience, Brazil has been hit hard by the global financial crisis. Since
September lSt, market fell 32 percent, sovereign spreads increased by 72 percent, and
                        the stock
the BRL depreciated by 40 percent, returning to their levels observed in 2004-05. Such
movements reflect the relevance o f commodity stocks in IBOVESPA, increasing risk aversion
that affects emergent economies and the fact that the BRL i s a commodity currency (correlated
with global economic activity).

2.       The recent episodes of extreme volatility in stock and foreign exchange markets were
triggered by the liquidation o f corporations' speculative foreign exchange positions, which
lowered their borrowing cost by "betting" on a stable or appreciating BRL. In addition, capital
outflows that in October reached US$4 billion have weighted on the exchange rate. The Central
Bank has adopted different measures to contain the exchange rate depreciation, such as auctions
o f public bonds indexed to the exchange rate (1eilo"es de swaps cambiais), repo-credit lines
auctions in dollars for exporters, and sales o f international reserves to irrigate the spot exchange
rate market. Up to November, partial success has been obtained, and the exchange rate has
continued appreciating, though it still exhibits significant fluctuation.

3.       Faced with better more positive inflationary prospects and a freeze in domestic credit
markets, the Central Bank has initiated a easing cycle, reducing the headline interest rate by 100
basis points from 13.75 percent in December to 12.75 percent in January. Increasing inflationary
pressures (due to the still strong economic activity and the exchange rate devaluation) are

expected to cease as the economy slows. Inflation in 2008 was 5.9 percent, still within the
Central Bank inflation target zone (4.5 percent +/-2). Market expectations for 2009 indicate a
reduction ininflation to 5 percent.

4.          Effects o f the worldwide financial crises have already shocked the real economy. The real
sector i s now feeling the impact o f the global slowdown. Industrial production in November fell
5.2 percent from the previous month, or 6.2 percent year on year. Leading indicators suggest a
further reduction in December. Retail sales, capacity utilization and employment also fell. The
formal sector lost 655,000 jobs in December (190,000 seasonally adjusted). Market consensus
forecasts for GDP growth in2009 fell from 2.4 inNovember to 2 percent inDecember..

5.         The economy will slowdown significantly in 2009, from the estimated 5.3 percent in 2008
to around 2 percent, depending on developments in the credit market recovery, global economic
activity and the trend o f commodity prices. Given the fact that growth has been driven by
domestic demand, the expectation o f expansionary fiscal policy and the increase in credit supply
by public banks would slightly improvethe economic growth prospects for 2009.

6.         The main transmission mechanism o f the international financial crisis to the Brazilian
economy should be the fall in commodity prices and the expected slowdown on the demand for
Brazilian exports. Brazilian exports are concentrated in commodities such as iron, oil, soybeans


                                                                                                                                                                                 107

and meat, which represent 70 percent of exports. The sharp rise of their prices not only resulted
in the growth of exports but also fostered large gains of terms of trade which improved the
purchasing power purchase of the country and resulted in the increase of domestic consumption
and investment. Therefore, the decline incommodity prices would not only worsen the trade and
current account balances (that could be difficult to finance in the current tight international
financial situation) but would also reduce the country's purchasing capacity that may decelerate
domestic demand.

7.          Opinions diverge on whether Brazil will be able to finance the (expected) current account
deficit of around two percent of GDP in the currently tight international financial markets. The
financing of this current account deficit, to a great extent, depends on how FDIperforms. If FDI
falls from the current level of US$38 billion to about US$25 billion (as the market expectations
are currently indicating) the needfor adjustment will be minor with FDIfinancing almost entirely
the current account deficit in 2009. IfFDIdecreases further and/or if the corporate sector were to
find it difficult to roll-over its foreign currency debt, some additional adjustmentsmay instead be
needed such as a stronger depreciation of the exchange rate or a deeper deceleration of the
economic activity.

reduction of the primary surplus target for 2009 from 4.3 percent to 3.8 percent (and still
forecasts GDP growth in2009 at 4 percent).

9.    In addition, the authorities also have improved the composition of public debt. Efforts
have concentrated on reducing the volume of dollar-indexed debt and increasing fixed interest
rate debt and price indexed debt. The return to this strategy i s now becoming visible, with the
exchange rate depreciation promoting a net public debt reduction. Finally, the improvement in
debt composition has been accompaniedby increaseddebt maturity and duration. As a result, the
debt amortization profile does not seem to indicate rollover risk of the federal debt. There is a
very small probability that public sector financing needs will not be met, since the National
Treasury has a financial reservethat couldbe usedto meet its financial needs for about 4 months.

                                       -

1.    NCCAP - the National Climate Change Action Plan i s undergoing a public consultation
process to receive contributions for the final version to be approved by the GOB. The detailed
actions o f the Plan might be modified as a result o f the consultations but its general and specific
objectives should not change much. The NCCAP aims at the mitigation o f and adaptation to
Climate Change, to be achieved by: (i)promoting an increase o f efficiency o f the productive
sector to reduce the carbon content o f the country's GDP, (ii)maintaining the relatively high
contribution o f renewable energy to generation o f electricity, (iii)
                                                                     increasing the contribution o f
biofuels as a source o f energy for the transport sector (iv) seeking a sustained reduction o f the
deforestation rate, on quadrennial basis, for all Brazilian biomes with a goal o f zero illegal
deforestation, (v) reaching zero net deforestation (no decrease o f overall forest cover) by 2015,
and (v) identifying impacts caused by Climate Change and developing a strategy o minimize the
social and economic adaptation costs for the country

2.    PAC - the Program for Accelerated Growth aims at providing stimulus to the productive
sector while providing social benefits to country's population. The PAC includes a series o f
actions to improve the environment for investment and access to finance. The PAC i s enabling
the implementation o f a set o f strategic infrastructure for development and social inclusion,
prioritized by all ministries

3.    PAS - the Sustainable Amazon Plan, launched in May 2008 by the GOB and the state
governors o f the Amazon region aims at promoting the sustainable development o f the region
and improving the quality of life o f the population through the support o f activities which
generatejobs and income compatible with the sustainable use o f natural resources and rainforest
biome conservation. The specific objectives o f the PAS are: (i)to promote territorial planning
and environmental management, including zoning and land administration, (ii)to support
incentive programs for sustainable use o f natural resources, including activities that add value
locally, to respect traditional knowledge and ensure food security, (iii)to support the planning
and implementation o f infrastructure for development (transportation, energy, communications
and urban), and (iv) to strengthen social inclusion and decrease social inequality by improving
the accessto education, health and social security services.

The PAS was designed by a committee comprised o f 13 ministries and representatives o f all
Amazonian states. It underwent an extensive public consultation process which included ten state
and regional meetings with all sectors and the resulting recommendations were integrated into
the final document. The PAS includes and integrates in a single framework all other regional or
sub-regional programs such as the Sustainable Development Plan for the BR-163 region and the
PPCDAm, and i s coordinated by the Secretariat o f Strategic Affairs under the President's Office.

4.    PMSS -the Water Sector Modernization Project, a technical assistance project financed by
the World Bank and executed bythe Ministryof Cities.

5.    PNQA - the main objective of the National Water Quality Evaluation Program (PNQA) i s
the improvement of the knowledge base for policy making and implementation regarding water
pollution control and water quality management.         The PNQA includes: (i)the design and


                                                                                                113

implementation of the national water quality monitoring network; (ii)the standardization of
methods and procedures to facilitate comparison and benchmarking; (iii)institutional
strengthening to improve accuracy and reliability of water quality information; (iv) systematic
evaluation of water quality inpriority river basins; and, (v) development of adequate mechanisms
to increaseavailability of water quality information to the public.

6.    PNRH - the National Policy on Water Resources, enacted by Law 9433/1997, requires the
preparation and regular update of the National Water Resources Plan (PNRH) as a key policy
instrument. The preparation of the PNRH was completed in 2006 by the Ministry of
Environment following a highly participatory process with large involvement of the federal and
state governments, river basin organizations, academia, and civil society. The process was
overseen and approved by the National Water Resources Council. The PNRH establishes
specific objectives, targets and programs in accordance with the general guidelines and
principles, institutional roles and responsibilities, and policy instruments defined inthe National
Policy. The PNRH defined 13 main programs and several sub-programs, in a multi-layer
structure which addresses thematic, regional, and sectoral issues

7.    PRODES - the "River Basin Clean-up Program" has two objectives: 1) to reduce the level
of pollution in urban river basins via financial incentives for building sewage treatment plants;
and 2) to provide stimulus for the implementation of the National Water Resources Management
System (e.g., by strengthening of State water resources agencies, creation of river basin
committees, development of information systems and bulk water charging). This i s an innovative
program that started in 2001 inwhich the federal government provides a reimbursementof up to
50 percent of the cost of construction of wastewater treatment plants to encourage investment in
this area. Payments are made to eligible service providers that have successfully invested inthe
construction and operation of Wastewater Treatment Plants only on the basis of physical results
achieved, measured in terms of reduction of pollution load of effluent (Biological Oxygen
Demand - BOD) over a contractual period. The National Water Agency has been tasked with
program management. The financial resources are made available only after the plant is fully
operational and the provider can prove that it has effectively attained the goals established in the
signed contract.

8.    PROESCO - i s a credit and guarantee facility operated by BNDES and its accredited
financial institutions to support energy efficiency activities. PROESCO works with Energy
Service Companies (ESCOs), final energy users and energy companies in generation,
transmission and distribution. Inshared risk operations, BNDES may bear up to 80 percent of the
financed amount and the accredited financial institutions must bear a minimum share of 20
percent. Projects are presented to BNDES upon analysis by the accredited financial institution,
after a qualified entity has duly certified the technical feasibility.

9.    PROINFA - in April 2002, the Brazilian Congress approved Law 10438 and created the
Program of Incentives for Alternative Electricity Sources (Programa de Incentivo a Fontes
Alternativas de Energia Eletrica). In its initial stage, PROINFA enabled the contracting of
approximately 2,500 M W of renewable energy (from wind, biomass and small hydroelectric
sources) through a system of subsidies and incentives, which draw on the Energy Development
Account - CDE, funded by end-use consumers through a fee on electricity bills (low-income


                                                                                               114

sectors are exempt from this increase). The program i s managed by Eletrobras, which buys
energy at pre-set preferential prices ("economic values" for each of the three sources) and
markets renewable electricity. Contracts between Eletrobras and the renewable private power
producers are valid for a period o f 20 years. BNDES has established special financing lines for
PROINFA projects. BNDES can finance up to 70 percent o f capital costs (excluding site
acquisition and imported goods and services) at the basic national interest rates (TJLP) plus 2
percent of basic spread and up to 1.5 percent o f risk spread. Interest is not charged during
construction and amortization is over 10 years. Payments are due six months after commercial
operation. Eletrobras guarantees in the long-term electricity purchasing contracts a minimum
income o f 70 percent o f the contracted energy during the financing period, as well as full
coverage to exposure risks to the short-term market.

10.    SNIS - the Sanitation National Information System, a database and information system on
water supply, wastewater and solid waste services system supported by PMSS, which will now
become mandatory under the Law on National Guidelinesfor Environmental Sanitation.

11.    SNUC - the National System o f Conservation Units was established by Law 9,985 o f July,
2000. The SNUC is comprised o f all Conservation Units (protected areas) created by the three
tiers o f government. The MMA i s responsible for the overall coordination o f the system. Its main
objective i s to manage and expand a network o f Conservation Units with the aim of: (i)
promoting biodiversity conservation; (ii) maintaining or improving key ecosystem functions such
as water supply; and (iii)protecting the natural resources necessary for the livelihood o f
traditional populations and promoting their social and economic development, while respecting
and valuing their knowledge and culture. The SNUC defines the different types o f Conservation
Units to be created (e.g., Parks, Ecological Stations, and Extractive Reserves) and their different
uses (e.g., community, natural resource management, ecological tourism, research, etc.).

                                  ADDENDUM TO THE PROPOSED
            FIRST PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN FOR
                     SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT


The purpose of this note is to update Executive Directors on a number of developments that
have taken place since distribution to the Board of the report "Brazil - First Programmatic
Development Policy Loan for Sustainable Environmental Management" (P095205) that is
scheduled for Board consideration on March 5,2009.'

Since the distribution of the report in January 2009, the signals of a strong deceleration of
economic activity have been confirmed and led to revisions of GDP growth for 2009 from 2
percent in January to 1.75percent in February. On the other hand, financial and external sector
indicators have stabilized.

On the real side, industrial production fell by 14.5percent y-o-y in December (12.4 percent m-
o-m in December from 6.2 percent in November) as companies cut production in order to
adjust to declining demand. The decline was led by credit dependent sectors such as durable
consumer goods, vehicle output, and capital goods. However, leading indicators, such as
vehicle production and electric energy consumption indicate a resumption of economic activity
in January and February (official data on industrial production in January is still not available).
Employment figures have also deteriorated. Following the large loss in formal jobs in
December (655,000), in January the Brazilian economy lost 102,000 formal jobs, and the
unemployment rate grew from 6.8 percent in December to 8.1 percent in January. Nonetheless,
there is evidence of a slight recovery in employment in specific sectors such as services and
civil construction2.

To face the current economic scenario, the Government has strengthened its countercyclical
macroeconomic policies. In addition to the reduction of the primary surplus from 4.3 percent
of GDP to 3.8 percent, the Government announced the expansion and acceleration of its public
investment program (the Program of Growth Acceleration - PAC), the increase of the
minimum wage from BRL 450 to BRL 465 (effective beginning in February) and greater use
of federal financial institutions. More importantly, due to the reduction of consumer inflation
towards the Government's central point target of 4.5 percent, it is expected that the Central
Bank will accelerate the reduction of the headline interest rate initiated in January. Given the
high interest rate in Brazil (currently at 12.75 percent) there is a sizeable space for monetary
easing and market forecasts suggest an interest rate of 10.5 percent by the end of 2009. In
addition, the Central Bank has been successful in restoring functioning credit conditions, as the
level of available credit has reached that observed prior to the deepening of the financial crisis
in September 2008.

The worldwide economic downturn has contributed to a deterioration of external sector
balances. In January, Brazil had its first monthly trade deficit since March 2001 (deficit of US$
518 million) as exports fell in January reflecting lower commodities prices and weaker external
demand. Given lower profits and dividend remittances, the current account deficit in January


ICut-off date for data included in this note was February 20, 2009.
'Note that January employment figures are influenced by negative seasonal factors.

has been reduced from US$ 3.3 billion in December to US$ 2.8 billion (and much lower than
the observed in the same period of 2008 of US$ 4 billion). As a result, the 12-month
accumulated deficit fell from US$ 28.5 billion in December 2008 to US$ 27 billion in January
2009. The recent recovery of commodity prices, the exchange rate depreciation and the fall of
imports due to lower domestic demand are contributing to an improved trade balance in
February, which should return to the positive side3. While net foreign exchange outflows
amounted to US$ 3 billion in January in the first two weeks of February the Central Bank
announced a net inflow of US$ 1.3 billion. FDI amounted US$ 1.9 billion in January
confirming expectations of an annual flow of FDI of around US$25 billion in 2009.

Financial markets are also stabilizing. The IBOVESPA stock market index has increased 5.3
percent m-o-m in January compared to 4.7 percent in December and has increased by 3 percent
in February. Sovereign spreads decreased by 50 basis points in January and have been
fluctuating around the level of 450 basis points since then. The exchange rate has also
stabilized at the BRL/US$ 2.3 level. Record profits were announced by the big financial
institutions for 2008, which reflects the solid position of Brazilian financial institutions.

In this context, and to complement the analysis presented in the Program Document, Bank staff
simulated a lower case scenario than that undertaken in January. This low case scenario (Table
2 below) is associated with a reduction of the GDP growth rate to 1.75 percent (from the 2
percent of the previous simulation), a lower current account deficit and a similar fiscal
scenario. While the lower growth scenario will worsen slightly public debt dynamics (the rate
of debt reduction will slow, but the path of debt IGDP is stable), it will favor external balances
as lower imports and remittances are expected as a result of weaker economic activity and
exchange rate depreciation. In summary, the medium-term path remains sustainable as robust
fiscal surpluses, prudent debt management, the flexible exchange rate and easing of monetary
policy will help to counteract the strong adverse shock that the Brazilian economy is facing.

A revision of Table 1 (page 4 of the Program Document) is also attached to correct mislabeling
of public and private investments shares.
