Policy Loan (DPL) for Sustainable Environmental\n            Management Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: this two-tranche design was fundamental\n            for the success of the operation. This approach allowed the\n            World Bank to widen the scope of the program, keep the\n            discussion and engagement with the client and ensure a quick\n            execution of all policies in order to the second tranche as\n            early as possible. The Bank had the opportunity through this\n            DPL to participate and influence a national debate on\n            environmental reforms and good practices. This experience\n            and the knowledge generated in this operation will certainly\n            be relevant and useful to other parts of the world. The\n            lessons learned in this operation points to the need to use\n            existing indicators regularly monitored by implementing\n            agencies whenever possible instead of creating program\n            specific ones. This is the case, for instance, of the\n            indicator for annual deforestation rate monitored by\n            Brazilian Space Agency (INPE)."}, "docdt": "2011-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
