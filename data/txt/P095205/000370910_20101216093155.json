improve the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of policies and guidelines of\n            the Brazilian environmental management system, and (ii)\n            further integrate principles of environmentally sustainable\n            development in the development agenda of key sectors. The\n            second tranche of the SEM DPL I was made conditional upon\n            the attainment of three conditions as per the Tranche\n            Release Conditions under Section II C 2 (i), (ii) and (iii)\n            of Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement: (i) progress achieved\n            by the Borrower in carrying out the Program is satisfactory;\n            (ii) the macroeconomic policy framework of the Borrower is\n            consistent with the objectives of the Program; and, (iii)\n            specific policy actions have been taken. The policy actions\n            identified in the Program aim at improving environmental and\n            social management effectiveness in the National Bank for\n            Economic and Social Development (BNDES), improving\n            sustainability of natural resources management, improving\n            management and quality of water resources, reducing\n            environmental impacts through improved water supply and\n            wastewater treatment, and, promoting renewable energy\n            potential. Conditions for release of the second tranche have\n            now been met in full and the Bank recommends that the second\n            tranche be released."}, "docdt": "2010-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
