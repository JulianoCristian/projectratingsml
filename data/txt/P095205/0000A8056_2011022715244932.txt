                         The First Programmatic Sustainable Environmental Management Development Policy Loan (SEM DPL) is the first operation in a series of two loans which span
                         the period 2008-2010 and aim to support the GOB's efforts to (i) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of policies and guidelines of the Brazilian
                         environmental management system, and (ii) further integrate principles of environmentally sustainable development in the development agenda of key sectors.
                         The SEM DPL I also treats climate change concerns at both the inter-sectoral level and within the targeted sectors (natural resources, water, sanitation, and
                         energy).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The team conducted supervision visits to BNDES (October 20-21) and to federal ministries (Ministry of Environment and Secretariat of the Treasury, November 16) to assess the
                         current state of actions aimed at meeting the tranche release conditions for the second tranche of the SEM DPL I. During and soon after these missions, the Bank received the
                         official versions of all BNDES and MMA documents, and the Secretariat of the Treasury (STN) memorandum which presented evidence of the fulfillment of the second tranche
                         release conditions.

                         The mission to BNDES discussed progress made in respect of BNDES' new environmental and social policy (ESP). Specifically, the mission discussed its consistency with the Green
                         Protocol and the process by which the policy has taken shape. The mission also examined the relevant sectoral elements of the second tranche release conditions related to BNDES
                         reform processes. A number of the reforms that have taken place extend the application of Brazilian environmental law or promote sustainable management (e.g. forest, renewable
                         energy). During meetings in Brasilia the Ministry of Environment presented the documentation regarding the finalized National Climate Change Action Plan and its related National
