    strengthen sustainable agriculture through:  (i)\n            institutional and technical developments in irrigation and\n            forestry; (ii) initiating a program of water resource\n            monitoring and regulation in the agriculture sector; (iii)\n            improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture;\n            (iv) conserving key indigenous forest areas, accelerating\n            tree planting, and extending soil and water conservation;\n            and (v) establishing approaches for watershed management and\n            terrace stabilization. The project provides:  (a) improved\n            groundwater irrigation conveyance systems for about 14,350\n            ha; (b) equipment to demonstrate improved irrigation\n            application technologies; (c) materials for constructing\n            improved structures for spate irrigated schemes on\n            identified wadis; (d) equipment and vehicles for irrigation\n            systems maintenance, and for strengthening the water\n            monitoring system; (e) materials and equipment for forest\n            nurseries, sand fixation and flood control activities, and\n            for watershed management and terrace stabilization; and (f)\n            construction of offices, and provision of vehicles,\n            equipment, training and technical assistance for the Water\n            Resources Sector and the Directorate General for Forestry\n            and Rangelands of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources."}, "docdt": "1992-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
