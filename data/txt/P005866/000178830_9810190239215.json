base available to manpower\n            planners; (b) upgrade the skills and knowledge of existing\n            poorly qualified teachers and increase the output of new\n            primary teachers; and (c) improve the quality of school\n            buildings by establishing school building maintenance units\n            in two regional education directorates and by determining\n            urgent school furniture and equipment needs. Specifically\n            the credit would finance construction, equipment and\n            furniture for: (i) a commercial technical institute; (ii) an\n            agricultural technical institute; (iii) anin-service teacher\n            upgrading center; and (iv) a regional primary teacher\n            training institute. Two fully equipped mobile building\n            maintenance units and technical assistance for two studies\n            would also be financed by the credit."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
