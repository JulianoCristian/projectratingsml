Technical objectives are\n            to promote multipurpose use of groundwater resources and to\n            develop least cost, appropriate technology that can be\n            sustained by user groups with minimal public sector support.\n            Development areas have been identified in eleven provinces\n            for the construction of: (a) some 1,900 intermediate\n            technology tubewells to serve about 18,650 ha; and (b) some\n            240 deep tubewells to serve about 6,000 ha.  The project\n            will finance all activities until tubewells schemes can be\n            demonstrated to be in full operation after two years of\n            operation and maintenance (O&M) support.  Major\n            components include:  (a) survey, investigation and design;\n            (b) construction of tubewell systems serving about 25,000\n            ha; (c) initial O&M support for two years after\n            commissioning of tubewell systems; (d) provision of domestic\n            water supply and house garden irrigation facilities; (e)\n            agricultural development activities, including strengthening\n            of extension services; (f) community support, including\n            training and strengthening of Water User Associations and\n            activities related to the role of women; and (g)\n            institutional support for design, implementation,\n            supervision and monitoring and evaluation of project\n            performance.  The project will also strengthen groundwater monitoring."}, "docdt": "1993-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
