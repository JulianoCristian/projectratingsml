Lessons drawn from the project\n            indicate the need for project design, to be at par with the\n            implementation capacity of the designated institutions, to\n            avoid operational, and management difficulties, including\n            drastic restructuring, during implementation. Stakeholders\n            involvement should occur early on, to ensure realistic\n            objectives, particularly in the adoption of new\n            technologies. The complexity of the project, which also\n            involved geographically dispersed activities, could have\n            achieved successful results, had it been implemented at a\n            more decentralized level, with more responsive coordination,\n            and management. Likewise, intensive supervision from the\n            Field Office would enable a proactive Bank/Borrower\n            interaction. Further lessons call for specific quality\n            control, technical assistance provision, successful\n            diversification of crop production, under strong ownership,\n            and inter-sectoral coordination mechanisms."}, "docdt": "2000-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
