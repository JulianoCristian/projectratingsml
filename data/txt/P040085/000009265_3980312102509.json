This impact analysis details how\n            the screening procedures are being applied, evaluates the\n            project's environmental impacts, and suggests\n            mitigation measures. Measures include segregation and\n            disposal of waste materials at dump sites; construction of\n            retaining walls; resort to reforestation to control erosion;\n            replacement of the natural vegetal cover and adjacent\n            forest; construction of longitudinal drainage crossing\n            primary and secondary roads as well as hillsides; control of\n            wastewater, runoff, and garbage from the worksite to avoid\n            damage to river beds and aquatic life; prevention of oil and\n            fuel leaks from machinery and vehicles; synchronized usage\n            of machinery and vehicles in order to reduce air emissions;\n            relocation of displaced human settlements; management of\n            liquid flows to water bodies; and control of solid wastes,\n            liquid flows, and gaseous emissions during the\n            project's operation."}, "docdt": "1997-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
