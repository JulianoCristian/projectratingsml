Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) A demand-driven, market-based\n            model of institutional strengthening generates wider social\n            capacities, increases the number of suppliers and improves\n            local actors' managerial capacities; 2) Restricting the\n            participatory planning process to the municipal territory\n            may not necessarily be conducive to optimal decision-making;\n            3) The coherence between the longer-term municipal\n            development plans (PDMs) and the annual operational plans\n            (POA) are not necessarily automatic. Concerted efforts are\n            needed to guarantee coherence between planning and\n            implementation; 4) The complexity of the M&E indicators\n            needs to be related to the institutional capacity of the\n            user; 5) Outsourcing training services to formal and\n            established training institutions, such as universities,\n            could result in a more sustainable institutionality for\n            supplying these services in the future; 6) Participatory\n            demand identification needs to be complemented with solid\n            technical inputs in order to ensure adequate ranking of\n            development priorities for the communities; 7) The spot\n            improvement approach for low-volume rural roads reduces unit\n            costs, reduces environmental impacts and has a greater\n            likelihood of ensuring year-round access than traditional\n            approaches. 8) Reductions in transportation costs across all\n            sectors and activities prove that rural roads can be\n            justified on the basis of improving access to services\n            (health, education, etc.) and not necessarily on the basis\n            of production increases; 9) It should not be assumed that\n            municipalities will allocate sufficient resources for the\n            cost of operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure\n            built or rehabilitated with the project; and 10) As the\n            experience with \"emergency\" subprojects showed,\n            the subproject cycle can be simplified, identification\n            focused on technical aspects and implementation more clearly\n            delegated to municipalities."}, "docdt": "2007-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
