investment promotion. The project will provide development\n            assistance, by setting up credible insurance mechanisms,\n            against losses caused by political risks, through the\n            provision of technical support, which requires the\n            pre-requisite of sound environmental, and sustainable\n            practices. This environmental operations manual (EOM)\n            outlines environmental assessment guidelines for each\n            project transaction, to be categorized by the African Trade\n            Insurance Agency (ATI), based on the applicants'\n            Environmental Information Note. The EOM identifies\n            environmental standards within: environmental quality\n            standards (air, water, or soil pollution); emission\n            standards; product standards (use/disposal of products);\n            process, and production standards; and, performance\n            standards. Environmental principles, and methods of\n            screening are outlined, where each category is defined,\n            highlighting the environmental scope per\n            category-transaction activity, to then provide guidance on\n            the implementation of environmental assessments, its\n            processes, monitoring by the national environmental\n            assessment authorities, to finally review country specific\n            environmental regulations."}, "docdt": "2000-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
