Project for Africa were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: African trade\n            insurance (ATI) agency plays a public sector role as a\n            multilateral agency owned by multiple states, which provides\n            legitimacy, allows preferred creditor status, and\n            facilitates healthy peer pressure among member states to\n            honor financial commitments. Imbedding self-correction and\n            self-supervision mechanisms in client agencies minimizes the\n            need for the Bank to play the role of a de facto regulator,\n            for which it does not necessarily have sufficient resources,\n            expertise, or enforcement mandate. The presence of a\n            significant number of independent directors competitively\n            selected for their specialized expertise in accordance with\n            an agreed competence matrix may also play a critical role as\n            ATI progresses towards self-supervision. More attention\n            should have been given by the Bank to understanding the\n            specific demand in Africa in terms of market needs, product\n            mix, targeted clients, and transaction origination channels.\n            Operational manuals, technical assistance, and training,\n            while all necessary, are not sufficient mechanisms to ensure\n            that a public sector entity like ATI will be able to keep\n            pace with its internationally competitive peers and without\n            taking excessive risks. Political and commercial risk\n            insurance continues to be a key instrument needed to support\n            private trade and investment flows in Africa."}, "docdt": "2014-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
