                         Project restructued but PDO remained the same, namely to facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities through the provision of
                         insurance, coinsurance and reinsurance, financial instruments and related services. The proposed restructuring would support ATI to meet its objective to
                         become #Africa#s Export Credit Agency# and support the public-private partnership of this institution.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is being implemented well. The new CEO began work and the business plan for 2010-12 will be discussed at the next ATI Board meeting Nov 26, 2010. Operating
                         income for 2009 and 2010 (projected) is negative, although premium income has been doubling each year for the past three years, one of the reasons being that there has been a
                         substantial drop in investment income (the 2009 ATI annual report and financial statements are available to the public on its web-site). This necessitated the need to review the
                         underwriting policy and reinsurance policy is driven mainly by the low investment income generated over the past two years as a consequence of lower global investment returns, the
                         investment allocation of the ATI (short, medium and long-term) and the risk tolerance of the investments. The impact assessment has been completed and the 2010 business plan
