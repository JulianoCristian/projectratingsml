F.     Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (PDO, as noted in the Development Credit Agreements)

The project development objective according to the Development Credit Agreement with each
country, and similarly noted in the PAD, was as follows:
       “The objective of the project is to assist the Borrower to implement poverty alleviation
       through private sector led growth in the region by improving access to financing for
       productive transactions and cross-border trade”. As per the logframe (PAD Annex 1)
       the first part of the PDO refers to the higher level objective while the second part
       (bolded) is the actual PDO.

Similar, but with emphasis on the African Trade Insurance Agency’s (ATI) role, the project
objective noted in the Development Credit Agreement with ATI was:
       “The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower develop and implement a scheme
       for the provision of insurance, including coinsurance and reinsurance, guarantees and
       other financial instruments and services for the purposes of promoting trade, investment
       and other productive activities in Africa.”

Revised Project Development Objective (as noted in the restructuring document)

At the time of restructuring in 2006 the PDO was reworded; in the 2007 amendment to the
Development Credit Agreement (the rewording, while substantially leaving the thrust of the
PDO unchanged, put the emphasis on increasing private sector-led flows) it reads as:
       “To facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities through
       the provision of insurance, coinsurance and reinsurance, financial instruments and related
       services.”

1.        Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.      The Regional Trade Facilitation Project (RTFP11), approved by the World Bank’s Board
of Directors in April 2001, was designed to support the start-up and operation of the African
Trade Insurance Agency (ATI). The project’s financing structure entailed an International
Development Association (IDA) credit to each of the seven ATI funding member states:
Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia (the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Madagascar, and Benin joined later). These IDA credits, totalling US$110 million, were
to provide the capital backing ATI’s issuance of political risk insurance with an emphasis on
coverage for trade; US$5 million of the total (later increased to US$10 million) was extended
directly to ATI to cover its operating and start-up expenses. Additional financing of US$7.5
million was also allocated to Burundi in 2004. The program was designed to continue until 2011
(later extended to 2013), by which time IDA assistance was expected to have been fully utilized
and ATI to have become a self-sustaining entity. From the outset, the project was acknowledged
as being innovative and experimental in nature, recognizing that mid-stream adjustments would
be taken as needed. This is reflected in the decade-long envisaged implementation period as well
as provision for mid-term review after three years of operations, and the nature of the Bank
instrument, which was later characterized as a “horizontal” APL.

1.1       Sector Background

2.      In the early 2000s, expansion of the private sector was recognized as an essential
ingredient for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction and underpinned the poverty
alleviation/development strategies of most Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. A key
constraint to private sector development was identified through analytical work and surveys2 as
limited access to finance, including for cross-border and intra-Africa and international trade.
Intra-regional trade was very small in Africa, as was Africa’s share in world trade. Africa was
perceived to have high levels of political risks, attributed to fluctuating and arbitrary government
policies, weak institutions, as well as to episodes of war and civil disturbance. There was also the
perception of low levels of sovereign and corporate creditworthiness (high risk of non-payment).

3.      Covers for political and commercial risk essentially supported trade and investment flows
from OECD countries to some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, plus the pre-financing of major
African commodity exports such as oil and LNG. National export credit agencies still kept in
mind the large claims they had incurred in the 1980s, and various African countries had
restructured their export credit indebtedness under the Paris Club. As of 2001, players in this
market included: (i) for short-term trade, the “Global Big Three” private credit insurers
(Atradius, Euler-Hermes, Coface) who provided whole turn-over covers; (ii) national schemes
and agencies of France, Japan, United States, etc. who selectively supported their national
exports; and (iii) private underwriters who insured the better structured African short-to-medium
export commodity finance transactions, as well as foreign direct investments into Africa. The
Chinese export credit agency, Sinosure, was established the next year in 2002 and subsequently
became the world’s largest agency. For investment insurance, MIGA had a cumulative gross

      Because a follow-on project was later approved in 2011, referred to as “RTFP2”, the RTFP being reviewed in this ICR is
      referred to as “RTFP1”.
2
      See, for example, documents listed in the PAD Annex 8.

                                                             1
exposure of US$800 million in Sub-Saharan Africa by end-2001 and had provided political risk
coverage to 44 investment projects in the continent. Coverage for trade within Africa, however,
was virtually non-existent.

4.      In response to these challenges, government members of the regional economic
community, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), developed with the
help of the Bank in the late 1990s a proposal for a regional and public sector insurance
mechanism, which was the genesis for the ATI Treaty. The objective of the agency was to
catalyse expansion of activities of private political risk providers in the region. Specifically,
international underwriters in cooperation with local financial institutions would use ATI’s new
political risk insurance facility to offer commercial risk insurance. It was expected that this
arrangement would help lower the risks and thus address a key constraint to trade and
investment. The concept drew from other Bank-financed models prevailing at the time,
specifically the export guarantee facilities in Albania, Bosnia, and Moldova. The key take-away
from those experiences was that such a facility had significant scope for attracting other risk
takers, especially private political risk and trade credit insurers.

5.      While ATI was expected to play an important role in facilitating trade, the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) made it clear that the achievement of the objectives would hinge
upon continued market-oriented reforms in the participating countries, as well as regional
integration initiatives. It should be noted, however, that the project never intended to address
such reforms directly, but rather to rely on ongoing initiatives. 3 These included the creation of a
free trade zone through the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Cross-
Border Initiative4 which aimed to simplify provisions regulating trade and remove trade barriers.
At the national level, the scope of reforms varied amongst the target countries, but generally
were considered going in the right direction. Recognizing that it would take a time to achieve
impact, in conjunction with ongoing national and regional reform efforts, the project life was
planned for an unusually long ten years.

1.2       Rationale for Bank Assistance

6.      There was no Regional Assistance Strategy at the time the project was developed,
although one was adopted later. The objectives of the RTFP1 were consistent with the Bank and
individual Borrowers’ overarching goals related to private sector development, enhancement of
trade and competitiveness, and regional integration in Sub-Saharan Africa. These were
articulated in each country’s assistance strategy, all of which emphasized private sector-led
growth, diversification of exports, and access to finance. The project was also aligned with the


3
    A Bank Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessment done in 2009 concurred with the Bank team’s previous disagreement
    concerning a separate 2001 QAG critique that the design did not pay enough attention to other factors that can impact trade
    and investments. The 2009 QAG review said that it would not have been realistic to expect a single regional project to
    mitigate such macro concerns.
4
    The Cross-Border Initiative in 1999 comprised a common policy framework developed by 14 participating countries
    (including the original 7 RTFP1 countries) in Eastern and Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean, with the support of four co-
    sponsors; the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Union, and the African Development Bank. The
    policy framework aimed to facilitate cross-border economic activity by eliminating barriers to the flow of goods, services,
    labor, and capital, and to help integrate markets by coordinating reform programs in several key structural areas, supported by
    appropriate macroeconomic policies.

                                                                2
prevailing IDA Strategic Framework that stressed leveraging national development programs to
achieve sustainable outcomes through regional initiatives. Likewise, project objectives were
consistent with the Cross-Border Initiative and contributed to improved coordination among
Sub-regional organizations, a priority objective for New Partnership for Africa’s Development
(NEPAD).

7.      The Bank’s role in supporting the creation of ATI was considered to be of high value. At
the time of preparation, stakeholders expressed the view that the Bank could play a key role
through its ongoing policy dialogue with governments if problems emerged that could result in a
claim. The Bank’s participation in the new scheme was also seen as adding credibility to ATI
since it would ensure the establishment of appropriate underwriting and other operational
procedures and ensure transparency and consistency. The private insurance market and export
credit agencies also indicated that they did not perceive ATI as a competitor but rather as a way
to complement and facilitate their business in the region. Likewise, ATI was designed to be
complementary to MIGA covering those short- and medium-term trade transactions that MIGA
could not support according to its convention. In fact, the project was prepared in close
cooperation with MIGA including the secondment of a MIGA staff member to the COMESA
project team during project preparation.

8.      It should also be mentioned that this project was the culmination of efforts spanning two
decades to develop a regional intervention to support trade and investment in the region. These
efforts had not been fruitful in terms of developing an acceptable operational context until
RTFP1, which built upon previous attempts to identify a project as well as from lessons learnt in
the Balkans.

1.3    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) according to the original Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) with each country, and similarly noted in the PAD, was as follows:
        “The objective of the projects is to assist the Borrower to implement poverty alleviation
       through private sector led growth in the region by improving access to financing for
       productive transactions and cross-border trade”.
       As per the logframe (PAD Annex 1) the first part of the PDO refers to the higher level
       objective while the second part (bolded) is the actual PDO.

Similar, but with emphasis on ATI’s role, the project objective noted in the DCA with ATI was
as follows:
       “The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower develop and implement a scheme
       for the provision of insurance, including coinsurance and reinsurance, guarantees and
       other financial instruments and services for the purposes of promoting trade, investment
       and other productive activities in Africa.”

10.    The key project outcome indicators as outlined in the DCA with ATI were:
       Issuance of Insurance Contracts in an aggregate principal amount of one hundred and
       twenty-eight million Dollars (US$128,000,000) or equivalent by the third anniversary of

                                               3
       the Effective Date and Insurance Contracts in an aggregate principal amount of one
       billion two hundred and eighty million Dollars (US$1,280,000,000) or equivalent by the
       tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, all in respect of transactions pertaining to the
       Participating States as at the date of this Agreement. This is noted in the ISRs as PDO #1:
       Volume of policies issued per country as agreed.
       For each Participating State, on average, in any twelve-month period commencing on the
       Effective Date, fewer than one Claim per year resulting from Covered Risks other than
       War or Civil Disturbance, Civil Commotion or Embargo has been made, which Claim, in
       the opinion of the Association, would have arisen as a result of the action or omission of
       the Government of such Participating State. This is noted in the ISRs as PDO#3: Level of
       claims - on average one claim or less resulting from a government performance risk per
       country per year.
       The operations of ATI are self-financing after three years following the commencement
       of its operations. This is noted in the ISRs as PDO#2: ATI becomes sustainable.
       Signature and delivery of the Insurance Facility Agreements. This is noted in the ISRs as
       PDO#4: Leverage partnership agreements with private risk insurers for political risk
       cover have been established.
       A broadening of ATI's client base within the Participating States' territories over the life
       of the Project.

Secondary [intermediate] indicators specified in the PAD and not in the DCA with ATI were:
       The diversification of participating countries' economies and export markets to be
       demonstrated by a decreasing trend in the share of commodities and cash crops as a
       percentage of GDP and exports.
       An improvement in the perception of political risks in participating countries as
       indicated, inter alia, by higher leverage ratios from the private risk insurers involved in
       the facility, more favorable political risk country ratings, and new private market entrants
       providing risk coverage in the region.

Secondary [intermediate] indicators specified in the DCA with ATI were:
       The Project has catalyzed the introduction of comprehensive trade credit insurance
       available within the Borrower's territory.
       On average, in any twelve month period commencing on the Effective Date, there has
       been a ten percent (10%) increase per annum in the volume of bank lending for trade
       transactions pertaining to the Borrower (including both local and foreign banks).
       A decreasing trend in cost and an increasing trend in maturity of trade finance available
       for transactions pertaining to the Borrower - to be measured by surveying users of the
       Insurance Facility.
       An increasing number of States participate in the Insurance Facility over the life of the
       Project.



                                                4
1.4.   Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority)

11.     The project underwent a corrective restructuring in December 2006, requiring Bank
Board approval (Level 1), to adjust ATI’s product mix and financial structure – two aspects
which had hampered the project during its first five years of implementation (discussed in
Section 2). Also, the various parallel IDA credits providing the initial capital to ATI from the
respective Member States were merged into a single project in order to facilitate program
execution, monitoring and reporting.

12.    The PDO was formally changed in the amended 2007 DCA as:
       “To facilitate private sector-led trade flows, investment and productive activities through
       the provision of insurance, coinsurance and reinsurance, financial instruments and related
       services.”

Although it was not a major change, the rewording did put the emphasis on increasing private
sector-led flows. Similarly, the 2006 restructuring resulted in modifications to the indicators,
with a revised set of indicators as follows (per the amended DCA):

PDO indicators:
       Increased trade which will be measured by the volume of trade insured by ATI policies
       (disaggregated by domestic, intra-regional and international) pertaining to the Borrower
       as established in the Annual Business Performance Targets for each fiscal year as
       approved by the ATI Board of Directors and the Association. Noted in the ICR Data
       Sheet as: volume of gross annual trade flows in which ATI participated
       Increased investment which will be measured by the volume of investment insured by
       ATI policies (disaggregated by domestic. intra-regional and international) pertaining to
       the Borrower as established in the Annual Business Performance Targets for each fiscal
       year as approved by the ATI Board of Directors and the Association. Noted in the ICR
       Data Sheet as: volume of gross annual investment flows in which ATI participated. (Note:
       This does not include self-standing political violence insurance.)
       Increased private participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with
       private and public insurers to be measured by the leverage ratio.
       An increasing number of African states joining ATI.

In addition to the above, the following intermediate indicators appeared in Restructuring Paper,
but not in the amended DCA:
       Increased net exposure.
       Number of insurances policies issued by ATI in participating countries. Noted in the ICR
       Data Sheet as: number of new insurance policies issued during the year
       Leverage paid in capital and reserves. Noted in the ICR Data Sheet as: ATI gross
       exposure / paid up capital and reserves
       Ratio of incomes. Noted in the ICR Data Sheet as: underwriting + investment revenues /
       costs + claims
                                                5
          Ratio of operating efficiency. Noted in the ICR Data Sheet as: measured as operating
          expenses / underwriting revenues

1.5       Main Beneficiaries

13.     The target beneficiaries, as noted in the PAD, were commercial firms and banks involved
in trade or investments in the participating countries, and ATI, which as the implementation
agency would benefit from institutional strengthening. More broadly, the population of the
participating countries would benefit from increased employment and economic growth. RTFP1
was also intended to have major leverage effects through its partnership with private risk insurers
who were expected to take on greater political and commercial risk in these countries.

1.6       Original Components (as approved)

14.       The project encompassed two components:

          Component 1: US$105 million to seven countries to finance their respective capital
          contributions to ATI supporting ATI’s underwriting of political risk insurance to private
          companies in the participating countries, covering both sovereign political risks for which
          ATI has preferred creditor status, as well as non-sovereign political risks.5 The scheme
          was to be extended in the future to any other African country that fulfilled the
          requirements for joining ATI.

          Component 2: US$5 million allocated to ATI to cover initial operating costs, including
          personnel and consulting services.

1.7       Revised Components and Other Significant Changes

15.     An additional financing of US$7.5 million was approved in 2004 to supplement
Burundi’s initial allocation (under Component 1) when ATI’s underwriting limits for that
country were exhausted. Also, two additional countries joined in 2005: DRC and Madagascar.
In 2004, DRC received an IDA credit to finance its capital contribution under the amended DCA
of the Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project. Likewise, in 2005 Madagascar
received an IDA credit under the amended DCA of the Second Private Sector Development
Project; these contributions were part of larger IDA credits (the DRC operation is still ongoing).
These latter two IDA financings were components of separate projects. ATI was also granted a
supplemental credit of US$5 million in 2005 (bringing Component 2 to a total of US$10 million)
to finance its operating deficit.

16.    The 2006 restructuring, which sought to address the problems with the capital structure,
necessitated a change in the disbursement trigger scheme. (Specifically, as country exposure
would increase and reach certain pre-agreed thresholds, additional IDA disbursements would
5
    Line of products included: (A) non-sovereign risks: (1) inconvertibility and inability to transfer; (2) inability to obtain
    currency of the insured contract in the market place; (3) cancellation of licenses and restrictions on import and export; and (B)
    sovereign risks: (4) imposition or increase of import or export taxes; (5) expropriation; (6) government interference with
    entities owing insured obligations; (7) seizure of goods, prevention of sale, or prevention of export; (8) interference with the
    carriage of goods; (9) war or civil disturbance; and (10) embargo.

                                                                 6
finance the additional equity contribution required by that member country.) The remaining
disbursements to ATI (reflecting the participating countries’ outstanding capital contributions)
were to be expedited and executed in three tranches. This also allowed the pooling of capital
across the Member States. In addition, a Level 2 project restructuring was conducted in 2011 to
extend the closing date to 2013. The project extension would allow disbursement of the third
(and final) tranche of the IDA credits covering the remainder of the capital contribution of the
Member States.


2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1       Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

17.    Project preparation benefited from close coordination amongst key stakeholders. Strong
country-level commitment was demonstrated by the establishment of a Technical Advisory
Committee in each of the initial seven Member States. Similarly, an umbrella Technical
Advisory Group was created and included the chairperson of each Technical Advisory
Committee, regional market players (e.g., Afreximbank, PTA Bank, and the export credit
agencies of Egypt, South Africa, and Zimbabwe), and regional organizations (e.g., COMESA,
SADC). (Technical assistance during the design phase was also financed by the European Union
and the Government of Japan.) Their mandate was only to ensure sufficient country involvement
during project preparation.

18.     RTFP1 was a highly innovative regional project. It expanded the scope of such projects
that were historically focused on building regional infrastructure such as hydroelectric dams.
Through the creation of an independent regional agency – ATI – it sought to address a common
challenge among several countries: mitigate political risk in order to increase private sector
flows. A regional entity would create economies of scale through the pooling of resources and
diversification of risks. With sound governance mechanisms, strong management, and prudent
financial arrangements, a regional agency would be more resilient to adverse national policies,
regulations, and actions that could affect private sector flows. Another expected design benefit
from this approach was that it would foster regional cooperation and integration.

19.     Integral to risk management and enhancing the credibility of ATI was the creation of a
preferred creditor status. Under the ATI Treaty and the respective IDA Credit Agreements,
Member States are obligated to reimburse ATI for any claim paid by the agency with respect to
sovereign political risk (e.g., excluding embargo, war, and civil disturbance risks, as well as
financial default of private obligors not attributable to Member States) arising in the respective
Member State. ATI is contractually entitled to access the capital contribution of a Member State
to reimburse itself against any claims paid in respect of a sovereign political risk arising in that
country. Importantly, this mechanism also protects reinsurers fronted by ATI. The Bank’s
Quality Assessment Group (QAG) and Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) conducted multiple
reviews6 of RTFP1 and praised its innovative features.


6
      IEG reviewed RFTP1 in 2006, as a case study for an evaluation of regional programs. In addition, two Quality Assessment
      Group (QAG) reviews were conducted for RTFP1, dated June 4, 2001 and September 30, 2009.

                                                              7
20.     Design innovations enhanced ATI’s credibility as a regional insurer, but they also had
ramifications. The main problem, which became apparent relatively soon, was the unsuitable
capital structure of the agency. IDA Credits had to be held in segregated trust accounts, not
allowing ATI to internally leverage its capital. This affected the efficient use of IDA resources,
and precluded the standard practices of risk pooling and risk diversification. The imposed capital
structure also constrained the amount of business ATI could underwrite for any particular
country. This arrangement reflects the fact that Member States were initially opposed to the
pooling of capital.

21.     In addition, ATI’s initial product range was narrow. ATI was restricted to providing
narrowly-defined political risk “three-point” cover which involves: (i) confiscation-
expropriation-nationalization; (ii) inconvertibility non-transfer; and (iii) license cancellation-
embargo. It did not include non-payment by public or private obligors. Three-point cover is
relevant for general FDI business, not so for trade finance where the key risk to be insured is
non-payment by state or private obligors. Coverage against non-payment by private obligors
(“commercial risk”) was to be provided through a partnership agreement with Atradius, however
these discussions fell through. Overall, the operational, revenue and cost projections included in
the PAD proved to be ambitious in terms of how quickly they would be attained – even though
the long implementation period reflects recognition of this risk. Nor did the PAD sufficiently
appreciate the risk of low initial demand for ATI’s products, rating it only modest.

22.      The design drew inspiration from Bank-financed credit guarantee projects in Albania,
Bosnia, and Moldova, where the provision of political risk insurance fostered the emergence of a
parallel market for commercial risk insurance. But circumstances between the two regions were
different: the Bank-supported East European schemes insured private flows mostly to Western
Europe where credit risk was considered acceptable, unlike Africa. Also, it would have been
useful to have given more thought to what specific market failures ATI should address: Which
types of enterprises and transactions were being underserved by private insurers? What specific
types of coverage did they need? Having answers to these questions could have lessened the
initial mismatch between ATI’s product offerings and the market demand.

23.     The PAD did not note alternative public-private arrangements such as outsourcing
service contracts used by the French, German, or Dutch state export credit schemes (under such
arrangements, national schemes are managed and distributed by private operators but ultimately
risk-taking and underwriting decisions remain with the respective ministries). Nor did the PAD
assess the case for a “wholesale” model whereby ATI could, whenever possible, seek to
outsource commercial functions such as business origination and primary underwriting of
transactions. Instead, ATI followed the precedents of MIGA and to some extent ICIEC (Islamic
Corporation for the Insurance of Investments and Export Credits, established in 1994), both fully
public sector entities. The governance of ATI was consistent with the institutional model selected
for the agency -- majority ownership and control by Member States.




                                                8
2.2    Implementation

24.     The agency had a slow start. This was partly due to the long period it took for the IDA
credits to become effective in each country, nearly one year after Bank Board approval. This
subsequently delayed disbursements to ATI for each member’s contribution, which was not
completed until end-2002. No policies were underwritten until 2003, in part due to the
misaligned product range. Accordingly, underwriting (premium) income represented less than 10
percent of the agency’s annual operating cost of around US$3 million in 2005. To bridge
accumulated losses and help ATI avoid insolvency, IDA approved an additional financing for
ATI operations of US$5 million in 2005, doubling the original allocation.

25.     Uneven performance of ATI may also have been due to challenges in appointing in a
timely manner senior management with the right skills and experience. The first chief executive
officer (CEO) appointed in 2001 left ATI in 2004. Due to the low level of business between 2003
and 2005, the role of Chief Underwriting Officer was assumed by the CEO; the appointment of
the first Chief Underwriting Officer was eventually made in September 2005. The second CEO
was appointed in February 2006 (a two-year gap) and left in 2009. The Bank’s mid-term
supervision mission conducted in May 2006 commended ATI’s new management on developing
a revised business model that sought to enhance ATI’s ability to deliver on its mandate.
Following the departure of the second CEO in 2009, there was a one-year interim period during
which the CUO acted as CEO. The current CEO has been in place since 2010.

26.     Late in 2005, ATI’s Board and General Assembly approved expanding the product range
to include payment risks on private obligors, and failure to honour sovereign obligations, and
cover for trade receivables on sub-sovereign obligors. RTFP1’s mid-term review conducted in
May 2006 and the subsequent project restructuring in December 2006 introduced another key
change -- restructuring of ATI’s capital. At the time of the project restructuring, 42 percent of the
original credit had been disbursed. The silo system of separate trust accounts was dissolved. IDA
financing previously granted to ATI Member Countries could now be converted into a pooled
equity capital fund which better leveraged IDA funds across Member Countries. (The project
restructuring, however, did not become effective until end-2008 due to the time required for each
of the Member Countries to ratify the revised legal agreements.) Also at the time of the project
restructuring, it was noted that the proportion of the Board directors representing Member States
coming from the private sector would have to be increased to half, as provided by the ATI
Treaty. In effect, Board directors representing Member States continued to be mostly state
appointees. Under the ATI Treaty, the directors are required to have “internationally recognized
qualifications and extensive practical experience in insurance, trade finance and banking,
commercial law or economics”. The directors representing SACE and Atradius Re had
competence in short-term credit insurance, for example. However, the ATI Treaty does not
explicitly require Board composition to include more specialized knowledge or substantive
experience in credit risk.

27.      There were other positive developments. A major milestone was the “A Stable” credit
rating received from Standard & Poor in 2008. This was a critical step for ATI to be seen as a
creditworthy insurer to international clients, banks, and insurers. In addition, ATI was able to
attract new shareholders in 2010 -- SACE (Italy’s credit insurance agency) with capital of US$10

                                                 9
million and the African Reinsurance Corporation (Africa Re) with capital of US$100,000.
Thanks to these developments and the corrective actions taken at the time of the project
restructuring, ATI’s performance improved significantly after 2008 (see Annex 2). Although not
formally part of the project’s monitoring and evaluation framework, all these achievements
reflect important outcomes fully attributable to the project. ATI did not face significant claims
until 2013.

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design and Implementation

28.     The project’s results framework was developed in the context of a logframe, which was
the approach taken at that time. Since then, the results framework incorporated into Bank
projects has evolved and indicators are now expected to be “SMART” (specific, measurable,
attributable, realistic and relevant, time bound). Only some of RTFP’s indicators are consistent
with this best practice. The original indicators were not sufficiently specific for measurement
purposes, and it was hard to attribute some of the intermediate outputs to the project. For
instance, the PAD did not indicate whether the volumes insured were to include co-insurance
and/or reinsurance. Several indicators were to be measured by regular surveys which did not
happen. The wording of the original PDO was misleading in that it emphasized access to finance,
which in fact was not really the project’s objective (nor were indicators included to measure it).
Similarly, there was no indicator to measure trends in political risk insurance coverage and
market evolution in the region, for which RTFP1 was to be a catalyst. Overall, the design of the
results framework was initially incomplete.

29.     Given its innovative nature and lengthy project life, there was the expectation that the
M&E framework would evolve and respond to RTFP1’s progress and challenges. In this respect,
the 2006 project restructuring sought to bring the results framework more in line with the PDO
and a new set of indicators were introduced. (See Section 1.2) The Restructuring Paper specified
the relevant targets up until 2009 (and up to 2011 for Intermediate Indicators #8 and #9). It noted
that the targets would be reviewed on a regular basis as part of an annual rolling-three year
business strategy. However, the targets were not updated and the end-project targets were not
revised.7 Moreover, many of the 2009 targets did not make sense nor were they explained. For
example, in the results framework annex to the Restructuring Paper, the PDO Indicator #1
increased trade measured by the volume of trade flows in which ATI participated is identical to
the Intermediate Indicator #5 net exposure; it is not clear why the 2009 targets for the two
indicators would have the same values. Therefore, the target for Intermediate Indicator #5, net
exposure, is likely an error. There was a similar (illogical) alignment between the 2009 targets of
PDO Indicator #2, increased investment measured by the volume of investment flows in which
ATI participated and the Intermediate Indicator #6 number of policies issued by the agency,
again suggesting a likely error for the Intermediate Indicator target #6. Moreover, the target for
PDO Indicator #2 is unrealistically low (the expectation that the volume of investment should
have been significantly higher than US$40 million).


7
      The ISRs for RTFP2 use the same revised indicators for RTFP1 following the 2006 restructuring. Unfortunately, the RTFP2
      indicator targets cannot immediately be used to evaluate the performance of RTFP1. This is because they include additional
      ATI member states (Benin and Ghana); although as of December 2013 no new policies had been underwritten for Benin and
      RTFP2 was eventually cancelled for Ghana.

                                                              10
30.     There were shortcomings in monitoring of the results, reflecting limited use of the M&E
framework. The Bank and ATI teams continued to monitor the pre-restructured indicators
instead of also covering the revised ones all the way through to the final ISR prepared for the
project. The aide memoires generally did not discuss RTFP1’s performance indicators, rather
they focused on ATI’s performance indicators. Also, no ISRs were produced after 2011, leaving
two years in which the first project did not have a formal record of supervision distinct from that
of the second project. De facto, the supervision for RFTP1 had been subsumed under the
RTFP26. There was no clear closure despite the fact that in the final ISR filed (January 29, 2011),
the acting sector manager noted that there would be one additional “closing ISR” for the project;
this did not happen.

31.    The Bank administrative cost for project preparation was US$339,010 (this did not
include financial support from trust funds). The average annual supervision cost over the 11.5
year implementation period was about US$122,000. This was generally in line with the average
supervision costs for other projects in Africa.

2.4        Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

32.    Related to environment safeguards, the project was categorized as “FI”, or Financial
Intermediary Assessment. This meant that ATI was to verify through its own staff, outside
experts, or existing environmental institutions, that the sub-project/activity (to be insured) met
the environmental requirements of appropriate national guidelines and procedures. It also
required that these were consistent with the Bank’s applicable environmental safeguard policies.
To this end, ATI’s Operations Manual included specific steps to ensure this. In addition, ATI
was required to receive the Bank’s no objection prior to issuing each policy during the initial
five-year period; this requirement was later dropped. Supervision ratings related to safeguards
were consistently satisfactory.

Fiduciary Compliance

33.    ATI was responsible for procurement which encompassed office equipment, vehicles,
and consultant services, a relatively small share of the project’s total cost. As noted, RTFP1 also
financed ATI’s operating costs. (See Annex 1) Procurement was rated satisfactory throughout.
Financial management performed by ATI was similarly considered adequate throughout project
implementation. Financial statements were prepared and reported to the Bank quarterly. Internal
and external audits were performed by outside firms and were all unqualified.8




8
      The aide memoire of March 2007 noted that ATI informed the Bank mission of suspected fraudulent behavior by a senior
      ATI official. The Bank team subsequently referred the case to the Bank’s Integrity Vice Presidency (INT). That official left
      the company; there was no further mention of this in the supervision documents and INT decided not to pursue.

                                                                11
2.5    Post-completion Operation / Next Phase

34.    A second phase of the RTFP1 program was approved by the Bank in 2011. RTFP2 was
designed as a “horizontal” Adjustable Program Loan (APL), which created a structure to enable
countries to join ATI in a streamlined manner. Since it was difficult to ascertain a priori the
commitment of governments to join the program, an estimated overall envelope of US$85
million was notionally allocated for the RTFP2-APL program. In terms of actual Bank Board
approval, US$7.5 million in IDA financing (phase 1) was approved for Benin in 2011. RTFP2
remains ongoing. An additional US$20 million for Ghana was also planned, but the project did
not proceed because the counterpart did not fulfill conditions of effectiveness, despite several
time extensions. If completed, Ghana’s participation would have increased ATI’s addressable
market by at least 25 percent.

35.     Other countries including Liberia, Gabon, Cote d’Ivoire, South Sudan, Togo, and
Ethiopia have applied for ATI membership and have been accepted. However, none of these
countries have yet signed the ATI Treaty. In addition, Djibouti, Eritrea, Sudan, and Sierra Leone
are in the process of completing their membership applications. Most of these countries would
require IDA or African Development Bank (AfDB) support to finance their equity shares in ATI.
In August 2013, the Member Countries of ECOWAS confirmed their interest in joining ATI
which would make ATI a pan-African guarantee facility. Again, the expectation is that most of
these countries would seek IDA or AfDB financing for their equity contributions.

36.     Also encouraging was AfDB’s injection of US$15 million in equity capital at the end of
2013. In addition, ATI benefitted from an AfDB grant of US$1 million for capacity building.
AfDB is also discussing with ATI possible financing of equity capital of new members, similar
to the World Bank. At the end of 2013, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted ATI
technical assistance of EUR 2 million over three years for consulting work in relation to the
Sustainable Energy for All program. This technical assistance will include consulting and
training to strengthen the skills of the underwriters related to renewable energy, energy
efficiency, and project finance structures. These positive developments suggest that ATI is
reducing its dependence on IDA support.

37.     ATI is also considering ways to further develop its activities in trade insurance, including
the possibility to underwrite commercial risk outside member states, aiming to better utilize its
capital and diversify its risk portfolio.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Rating of Relevance of Objectives: High
Rating of Relevance of Design: Substantial

38.    The project’s objectives were highly relevant when the project was designed in 2000 and
remain highly relevant at time of closing. It sought to address a key impediment to private sector
growth – limited finance for trade and investment flows in Sub-Saharan Africa. As noted in the
                                                12
PAD, financing for productive activities in Africa was severely constrained by a perception of
high risk. A significant element of this perception was associated with corporate and government
creditworthiness, weak institutions, government behavior, and political events, such as war and
civil disturbance. At the time, however, political risk coverage for trade and investments was
essentially limited to some exports and investments from OECD countries to some (but not all)
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and pre-financing of major commodity exports such as oil and
LNG. By establishing a credible insurance mechanism against losses caused by political risks,
the project sought to facilitate productive investments and cross-border trade.

39.     RTFP1’s objective was, and remains, aligned with the countries’ and regional Bank
partnership strategies which emphasized private sector development, trade enhancement, and
regional integration in Sub-Saharan Africa. The project objective also remains in line with the
Bank’s 2008 Regional Integration Assistance Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa. Regional
integration in Africa continues to be a strategic priority as reflected in recent research such as the
Africa Competitiveness Report (May 2013), Africa Can Help Feed Africa (October 2012), and
De-fragmenting Africa: Deepening Regional Trade Integration in Goods and Services (January
2012).

40.     The current relevance of RTFP1’s objective is also reflected by the persistent perception
that Africa is high risk, creating a barrier for new investors. According to the 2013 Ernst and
Young Attractiveness Survey, there is a “stark and enduring perception gap between those
respondents who are already doing business in Africa versus those that have not yet invested in
the continent.” The report notes that “a lot of the big issues around risk pertain to access to
finance”. Underscoring the continued relevance of RTFP1’s objectives, the report also
emphasizes that “in the final analysis, it’s all about managing risk”. Given that, with the
exception of Zambia (rated 5), ATI’s members are all rated 6 or 7 on the OECD risk
classification scale (7 being perceived to be the most risky), the relevance of mitigating that risk
through political and commercial risk insurance continues to be high.

41.     In terms of the relevance of design, the project’s components were logically in line with
the project’s development objective. The lending instrument was appropriate. The regional
approach involving several governments was innovative by pooling resources and inherently
reducing political risk. Moreover, it was a precursor to the Bank’s “horizontal” APL operations.
The design concept was strong, with prudent financial arrangements. Some aspects of design,
although relevant, proved to be problematic (as discussed in Section 5.1, Quality at Entry) -
specifically, the narrow product range and inflexible capital structure. Also, with hindsight, while
majority control of the Board by directors representing Member States was consistent with
ownership and preferred creditor status, at the same time, the absence of independent directors
alongside Board directors appointed by Member States was not fully congruent with ATI’s
commercial orientation, and not abreast of international industry and management best practice.

42.     Notwithstanding some of these design challenges, the overall relevance of the design is
considered substantial since it was consistent with the RTFP1’s stated objectives. This ICR does
not provide a separate rating for relevance pre- and post-restructuring because these ratings are
identical for both periods.


                                                 13
3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial

43.     The revised Project Development Objective was “to facilitate private sector-led trade
flows, investment and productive activities through the provision of insurance, coinsurance and
reinsurance, financial instruments and related services”.

44.     In evaluating whether the PDO was achieved, the result indicators are assessed.
Revisiting the original PDO and Intermediate Indicators that prevailed up to 2006 (see Data
Sheet) three out of the four PDO indicators were considered to have been met in 2006 when the
project was restructured (as outlined in ISR#16). [These same four indicators are considered to
have been achieved or partially achieved as of the project close (see Data Sheet).] Despite this
ostensibly positive benchmark it would be difficult to make a credible case that the project was
in fact performing better than moderately satisfactory up to the time it was restructured in 2006.
The reasons for the pre-2006 under-performance have been discussed in Section 2 and are
reflected in the various measurements presented in Annex 2.

45.     Reviewing the post-restructured 2006 indicators, however, indicate an improved
performance and outcome. Three of the four PDO Indicators performed well and can be
considered achieved as of the project closing: PDO Indicators #1, #2 -- Volume of gross annual
trade/investment flows in which ATI participated; and PDO Indicator #3 -- Increased private
participation through reinsurance and co-insurance partnerships with private and public risk
insurers will be measured by the leverage ratio. Similarly, for the Intermediate Indicators three of
the five (#6, #8, #9) can be considered achieved even though no end-project targets had been
specified for any of them.

46.      The PDO indicators relied on proxies for tracking private sector-led flows, specifically
the volume of ATI policies issued for trade and investment activities. There are inherent
shortcomings with using such indicators, however. Foremost, the PDO indicators provide no
monitoring of the broader market nor ATI’s share in the target market. There also is the problem
of attribution and counterfactual. Would the private sector flows have taken place without ATI?
This question is typical not only of this project but of trade facilitation interventions more
generally. While there is no doubt that increasing private sector flows was an overarching goal,
such flows are clearly influenced by many factors beyond the scope of RTFP1. Hence, it is
useful to look at other dynamics to fully assess whether RTFP1 met its project development
objective – and, as discussed below, attribution seems credible.

47.     The creation of ATI responded to market constraints, specifically the limited availability
of risk insurance for investors/trading businesses in the early 2000s. Although not explicitly
noted in the PAD, as a public-supported entity ATI would be able to absorb and spread risk
better than markets, especially during periods of crises when the private sector seeks to
significantly reduce its risks. In addition, as a public agency ATI could play a catalytic role to
promote initiatives which markets would not otherwise finance, due to first mover disadvantages,
for instance. In these respects, ATI sought to stimulate the risk insurance market by
complementing rather than competing with, other insurers. Accordingly, two questions are
asked.
                                                14
48.     First, did the establishment of ATI foster the growth of the political risk insurance
market for Africa? Since its creation, ATI has issued approximately US$1.6 billion in
investment and trade coverage. (See Annex 2, Graph 2.1) Graph 1 shows the trend in ATI’s
annual volume of policies issued (trade and investment coverage) in participating Member
States. Even though it took considerable time, policies issued really started to pick up in 2008
and increased an impressive nine-fold over the 2008-2013 period. These policies have been
associated with nearly US$5 billion in investment and trade flows. (See Annex 2) Although it is
methodologically difficult to directly attribute these flows to ATI, a logical link can be inferred.

49.      ATI’s impact in catalyzing additional political risk coverage is also encouraging. As
illustrated in Table 1, short-term credit insurance limits of Berne Union insurers in ATI Member
States more than doubled over the 2006-2012 period. This also coincides with a doubling of the
amount of re-insurance and co-insurance for ATI’s policies.

                          Graph 1: Volume of Policies* Issued by ATI




            Gross amount including amount ceded to reinsurers

50.     Taken together, the above indicates that ATI has contributed to the growth of the political
risk insurance market in Sub-Saharan Africa. ICR-related interviews with ATI clients and
reinsurers provide further insights about ATI’s impact. Private PRI underwriters in the London
market appreciate the risk mitigation afforded by ATI’s preferred creditor status. Banks see ATI
as a meaningful tool supporting companion financing that supplements export credits extended
by the national schemes of OECD countries. Several financial companies interviewed said that
ATI coverage was an important factor in their decisions to invest in the mining and housing
sectors. Another client, a manufacturer of industrial chemicals, indicated that ATI coverage
enabled it to increase its line of credit from international banks. Nearly half of those companies
surveyed indicated that ATI’s insurance policy helped increase lines of credit with banks. But
most insured said that having coverage did not lower the price of financing. The ICR interviews
also confirmed that given the regional and public nature of ATI (i.e., country peer pressure and
government liability), there was a higher level of confidence that potential claims could be
avoided.


                                                    15
     Table 1: Short Term Exposure Limits of Berne Union Members in ATI Countries




51.     The second question to ask is whether ATI has become a credible agency, and in a
sustainable manner? During the first phase of ATI’s existence -- until around 2008 -- the
primary problem faced by the agency was insufficient business origination, notably due to an
insufficient product range and the fact that ATI did not have an international credit rating.
During the second phase of ATI’s existence -- from 2008 to the present -- ATI achieved a major
milestone in 2008 when it received an international “A Stable” rating from the financial rating
agency Standard & Poor’s. This was primarily thanks to the improved capital structure following
the 2006 restructuring, which allowed pooling of the countries’ capital contributions financed by
IDA. In its 2012 report, Standard & Poor’s highlighted that the A rating “reflects the company’s
strong capitalization, strong liquidity, and the implicit support of the World Bank”.

52.     These favorable changes allowed ATI to improve its revenue performance beginning in
2008. (See Graph 2) The number of policies underwritten by ATI grew substantially from 21
policies in 2008 to 138 policies in 2013. In tandem, the gross volume of insurance issued by ATI
increased from US$65 million in 2008 to US$537 million in 2013 (including political violence
cover). (See Annex 2, Graph 2.3) These achievements were accompanied by strengthening
financial practices. In 2011, ATI thoroughly revamped its treasury management in accordance
with sound international practice to diversify the investment portfolio and reduce risk (from only
two counterparties rated on average BBB in 2010, to over 100 counterparties rated AA on
average in 2012). Beginning in 2012, ATI started booking reserves against potential claims.
However, ATI has yet to put in place comprehensive, catastrophic, or country excess-of-loss
reinsurance treaties consistent with best industry practice.

3.3    Efficiency

Rating: Modest

53.     The PAD did not include an economic analysis and instead relied on a cost benefit
assessment – did the project generate substantial benefits compared to the costs incurred by the
government in taking an IDA credit? This was based on a sensitivity analysis which projected
financial performance using a range of assumptions for the number of insurance policies issued,
maturity of the transactions, types of transactions covered, and claims filed over the ten year
project period. But, as noted, the projections included in the PAD (particularly insurance
underwritten) were too ambitious. Similarly the expectation that the agency would be self-
financing after three years was very ambitious.

54.     As seen in Annex 1, the final disbursements at project closure were US$137.24 million
indicating that IDA funds were fully utilized. The difference between total disbursed (US$137.24
million) and approved (US$110 million) –US$27.24 million – reflects the fact additional
financing of US$7.5 million was approved to Burundi in 2005 to increase its paid-in-capital.
Also, an additional financing of US$5 million was arranged in 2005 to further support ATI
operations. The remaining difference reflects SDR / US dollar exchange rate fluctuations. [Two
additional countries joined in 2005, DRC and Madagascar bringing additional capital of US$19.2
million and US$1 million respectively, financed by separate IDA credits.]

55.     Although ATI has been breaking even in recent years, its return on shareholder equity
remains modest - 0.4 percent in 2012 and 0.7 percent in 2013. This is broadly in line with
multilateral insurance agencies such as MIGA, ICIEC, and Dhaman (an Arab supra-national
insurance company), which all provide political and/or commercial risk cover in their Member
States with a strong developmental agenda, albeit below commercial standards.




                                                             17
56.      A case can also be made that the Borrowers received, on aggregate, value for money (but
not on a country-by-country basis since Kenya was by far the major beneficiary of ATI’s
activities). ATI coverage of US$1.8 billion was linked to nearly US$5 billion in aggregate
investments and trade transactions in its ten Member States during the project period. So, while
ATI’s capital may have been under-utilized it does appear that there was value for money in
terms of facilitating private sector flows. As seen in the Graph 2.1 of Annex 2, more than 90
percent of the flows in which ATI participated as insurer were after the restructuring period.
Similarly, 94 percent of the volume insured by the agency was underwritten after the 2006
restructuring.

57.     Above and beyond the IDA Credits to fund the Borrowers’ capital contributions, RTFP1
also funded US$10 million for operating costs, including salaries and consulting. IDA funds for
project management represented a reasonable share in total operational costs (about 25 percent
over the project period). The regional multi-country nature of the project itself, also promoted
cost efficiencies through economies of scale. Finally, ATI was in principle able to spread risks
by providing insurance in multiple countries.

58.    Considering the range of measures of efficiency assessed above – use of project
resources, return on capital, and value for money – the efficiency rating for RTFP1 is modest.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     Per ICR guidelines, a split evaluation is performed to weigh the performance of the
project prior to the project restructuring in 2006 and afterwards until closing in 2013, based upon
the respective amounts disbursed. The outcome rating is evaluated to be moderately
unsatisfactory before the restructuring and moderately satisfactory after the 2006 restructuring.
Given the weight of the respective disbursement levels, the overall outcome rating for the project
is moderately satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.    There was no mechanism in place to measure the project’s impact on poverty.
Nonetheless, the creation of jobs related to increased private sector flows no doubt had a positive
impact on poverty reduction in the beneficiary countries. No specific goals were articulated, nor
monitored, in terms of gender or social development.

(b)    Institutional Change / Strengthening

61.      Given that the core activity was to establish a viable regional risk insurance agency, the
project did, in fact, focus on institutional change and strengthening. In addition to providing
initial financing for ATI’s creation, the project supported the development of its operational
procedures and policies, and extensive training. Support to these areas was critical but ultimately
not sufficient given the need for the agency to become world class within a specialized global
industry.


4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

62.    The project’s development outcome – nearly US$5 billion in private sector flows that
were covered by ATI’s trade and investment insurance (net of political violence, See Annex 2) –
cannot be reversed and thus the risk to development outcome is negligible in this respect.

63.      Following the restructuring approved in 2006 and on the basis of the credit rating
obtained from Standard & Poor’s in 2008, ATI has been able to expand its activities and revenue
levels. The agency is now well established and recognized by the market, and it has been able to
attract significant investment from one specialized industry player, namely SACE in 2010.
AfDB’s participation as a shareholder and provider of technical assistance is also encouraging, as
is EIB’s technical assistance. But despite ATI's relatively strong capital base, sustainability risks
are still not insignificant. Since 2011, ATI has posted positive comprehensive results after
treasury income (from investing the proceeds of its capital), but as of 2013 it has yet to achieve
positive net underwriting results. ATI has not yet achieved critical mass and its cost-to-income
ratio, typical of many state-owned agencies, hinders its ability to absorb claims when they may
arise, set aside risk reserves, and pay for comprehensive treaty reinsurance to protect against
catastrophic losses (as opposed to facultative or case-by-case), a central tenet of sound risk
management. Increased profitability is also important if ATI is to attract additional private
investors for significant amounts.

64.     Importantly, ATI operates in a specialized market characterized by high adverse risk
selection and potential severity of claims compared to revenue. And, within the political risk
insurance market, ATI is also a relative new comer. Although the agency has received an "A"
international credit rating from Standard & Poor’s for five years in a row, it must continue to be

                                                 19
proactive in strengthening its risk management in order to match the capabilities of some of the
longer-established political risk insurance entities particularly given that some of the structured
transactions are relatively complex. Continued improvements will help ATI become truly world-
class and sustain its valuable "A" international credit rating, a key requirement for the agency to
remain an insurer of choice for international clients.

65.      In terms of its geographic footprint, country membership is still insufficient for ATI to
fulfil its pan-African mission. The membership drive itself is a lengthy and costly process which
absorbs significant management time. Further growth is challenged by country exposure limits
on several key markets. Moreover, ATI needs to address new challenges that have emerged in
recent years. The planned expansion into West Africa may require some adjustments in
governance design, to imbed into the Board self-supervision and self-correction mechanisms,
and further enhance risk oversight; this will help ensure that ATI remains sustainable in the
future. Similarly, ATI may need to review and clarify its mission, and further develop
benchmarking (from public and private sectors) as well as performance metrics.


5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.     The Bank team deserves praise for taking an approach that was not only innovative but
also regional. Indeed, RTFP1 was one of the Bank’s first “modern” regional projects done in the
Africa and certainly the first one focusing on trade. (Some previous efforts were tried in the
1980s.) It is also noteworthy that the Bank team closely collaborated with MIGA in the design,
involving the secondment of a MIGA staff member to the COMESA project team during project
preparation. The Bank used its significant convening power to draw in ten Member States.
Furthermore, the project design called for a realistically long implementation period and, as
reflected in the mid-term review, the appraisal team realized that the project was experimental
and would need to evolve over time to correct initial design challenges and take advantage of
opportunities not initially apparent. Hence, the degree of success would depend more than ever
on proactive identification and resolution of issues during supervision, discussed below.

67.     Notwithstanding these positive attributes, design problems affected project outcomes. A
significant challenge was the unsuitable capital structure (e.g., inability to pool equity
contributions) -- Member States initially objected to their capital contributions being used to pay
claims caused by other Member States. Similarly, the product range was misaligned as it did not
allow cover for non-payment risk, not required for investment insurance but a key consideration
for trade finance. Moreover, greater attention could have been paid to ATI’s dual public/private
sector structure, and the need for a high level of technical, risk and management oversight
expertise at the Board level. The aide memoire of the May 2006 mid-term review did highlight
this issue, noting that changes to the capital structure would inevitably require changes to the

                                                20
rules governing the composition, appointment, tenure, powers, etc. of the Board. However, at
that time it might have been challenging to convince Member States to adopt a different Board
structure. Although the Bank team was willing to pursue a groundbreaking operation, certain
aspects of design did not sufficiently reflect the characteristics of the global industry. Absent
these design problems, the development ATI’s business would have been much better over the
first six years and likely would have matched the 2013 results several years sooner. Overall, the
quality at entry rating is moderately satisfactory.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

68.     The quality of the Bank’s support during the 12 year implementation period was uneven,
and the team’s subject matter technical expertise also varied. Given that RTFP1 was
experimental in nature, supervision (as measured by staff time and other costs) was more intense
up to the time of the 2006 restructuring, as reflected by relatively large annual supervision costs
during that period (See Annex 6). Although during the 2006 restructuring the Bank addressed the
inadequate product mix and capital structure – these issues could have been addressed earlier.
Nevertheless, the Bank team worked hard in identifying and resolving issues and ATI expressed
appreciation for the Bank’s support for the 2006 restructuring. The 2006 restructuring,
irrespective of its timing, was ultimately successful in fixing the key problems. In addition,
through the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), in 2008 the Bank
proactively arranged for a study on ATI’s enterprise risk management framework.

69.     After the restructuring, the intensity of supervision declined. The Bank emphasized
reduction of costs and an increase in profitability for ATI. In hindsight, the Bank should have
been more proactive during the second half of the implementation period in encouraging ATI to
actively benchmark and close the gap with international best practice, including on Board
governance design. This underscores the challenging role that the Bank played over the 12 year
implementation period – it essentially acted as ATI’s de facto insurance supervisor without
necessarily having the expertise, time or resources to effectively play that role. In terms of
supervision procedures, the Bank continued to track the original results framework following the
2006 restructuring, in aide memoires and ISRs. Although ISRs were not filed for RTFP1 during
the final two years, the project was still subject to Bank supervision under RTFP2. The fact that
ATI was supervised by four different Task Team Leaders may have contributed to these
oversights.

70.    In view of the under-investment of resources required for effective dialogue in
benchmarking to international standards, risk management framework and governance design, as
well as the weak monitoring of the M&E framework, the Bank’s quality of supervision is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.




                                                21
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.     Based on a moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and a moderately
unsatisfactory rating for supervision, and considering the overall moderately satisfactory
outcome rating, the overall rating for Bank performance is moderately satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.     It is difficult to assess individual government performance in RTFP1 since the regional
nature of this project makes an evaluation of participating governments challenging. Each
government’s involvement in the design and ownership of the approach are noteworthy.
Similarly, the governments deserve credit for accepting the 2006 restructuring which paved the
way for better performance. Going forward, challenges for Member States will include attracting
independent industry expertise to the Board, and more systematically monitoring the risks
covered by ATI. Member States will need to closely follow the extent of the contingent liabilities
they incur through ATI covers, and ensure that potential claims are resolved early on without
triggering the redress mechanism under the preferred creditor scheme. Through their Board of
Directors, shareholder countries will also need to further engage ATI management in areas such
as strategy formulation, monitoring of emerging trends, performance management, corporate
culture, credit risk, cost control, and expansion to new Member States and investors. A
noteworthy initiative is that the ATI Board put in place in 2013 a mechanism to periodically
evaluate its own efficiency.

(b)    Implementing Agency (ATI)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     Considering the initial challenges -- inadequate capital structure, product misalignment –
ATI has performed reasonably well and merits a moderately satisfactory rating. If project
corrections had been undertaken and completed earlier by all relevant stakeholders, it is likely
that ATI’s performance would have improved sooner (ATI brought to the Bank’s attention in
2002 that the product mix was inadequate). Areas for further improvement include: articulation
of a clearer vision and continued advocacy for the trade credit and political risk insurance market
in Africa; updating of ATI’s strategy in this market based on lessons learned and international
best practice; more systematic communication to Member States of the contingent liabilities they
incur through ATI covers; and continued strengthening of the risk management framework, as
well as financial sustainability (reserves) and operational and cost efficiency. ATI’s senior
management team will need to continue addressing these challenges.




                                                22
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     Based on a moderately satisfactory rating for both the performance of the Government
and the implementing agency (ATI), the overall rating for Borrower performance is moderately
satisfactory.


6.     Lessons Learned
75.    This ICR provides an opportunity to consider some specific lessons for trade and
investment facilitation initiatives, as well as broader lessons for designing projects establishing
regional development agencies.

76.      RTFP1 illustrates the challenge of melding a public objective with a competitive delivery
mechanism. ATI plays a public sector role as a multilateral agency owned by multiple states,
which provides legitimacy, allows preferred creditor status, and facilitates healthy peer pressure
among Member States to honor their financial commitments. ATI is also a development agency;
it seeks to address market failures without competing with private sector operators but
complementing them; it nurtures the development of critical financial and insurance markets; and
it acts as a last resort insurer when need be. Finally, ATI has a commercial role that requires it to
strive for efficiency and sustainable financial returns.

77.     Public, developmental, and commercial orientations are never easily compatible
especially in the context of a regional project. Most important is to have an effective governance
structure carefully balancing these three over-lapping roles and objectives. The Board must
legitimately represent Member Countries through state appointees, while providing strategic
guidance, as well as management and risk oversight. It is especially important for agencies that
are not subject to national financial supervision to imbed in their governance design self-
correcting mechanisms which would ensure the long-term alignment of objectives between
senior management, Board members, country shareholders, and key stakeholders including
development partners. Imbedding self-correction and self-supervision mechanisms in client
agencies minimizes the need for the Bank to play the role of a de facto regulator, for which it
does not necessarily have sufficient resources, expertise, or enforcement mandate.

78.     In terms of governance design, best international practice (reflected in more recent
projects financed by the Bank) is for Boards to include a significant number of independent
directors – a possibility which the ATI Treaty did not contemplate. Similarly, good international
practice indicates that the HR Committee of the Board should best be led by independent
directors, to give further assurance that senior management is truly competitively selected and
has sufficient expertise, independence, financial incentives, and employment security to run a
world class operation. The presence of a significant number of independent directors
competitively selected for their specialized expertise in accordance with an agreed competence
matrix may also play a critical role as ATI progresses towards self-supervision.


                                                 23
79.     Another key lesson is the importance of reflecting relevant and evolving market
conditions not only in project design but also throughout implementation. Supervision should
also explicitly engage client agencies on institutional arrangements and governance during
implementation to assess the need for adjustments to the project’s initial design in light of
changing market conditions and best international practice. For example, ATI has outsourced
some functions such as environmental analysis/compliance and internal audit. Consideration
could be given to the possibility of outsourcing substantially more commercial functions (such as
sales, underwriting, accounting, risk management framework), as has been the case in other
regional insurance initiatives such as the African Risk Capacity (supported by the African
Union) and the Caribbean Risk Insurance Facility and Europa Re (both supported by the World
Bank).

80.    The Africa market presents a unique set of issues. More attention should have been given
by the Bank to understanding the specific demand in Africa in terms of market needs, product
mix, targeted clients, and transaction origination channels. While adjustments were eventually
made when the project was restructured, there also remained a need for ATI (and the Bank) to
keep abreast of international best practice.

81.     In this regard, the lesson for the Bank when it invests in entities that operate within a
global industry (e.g., political and commercial risk insurance) is that there must be built-in
mechanisms to ensure benchmarks are continually reviewed and updated. Operational manuals,
technical assistance, and training, while all necessary, are not sufficient mechanisms to ensure
that a public sector entity like ATI will be able to keep pace with its internationally competitive
peers and without taking excessive risks.

82.     The importance of having in place an adequate results and performance monitoring
framework is an important lesson from this project, even though it may be a common
observation related to many Bank-financed projects. ATI has put in place a mechanism to
periodically evaluate the efficiency of the Board by independent consultants acting on behalf of
shareholders, international development partners, and other key stakeholders. This is a valuable
tool and should be part of any M&E framework.

83.    Finally, a key message that has emerged from RTFP1 is the appreciation that political
and commercial risk insurance continues to be a key instrument needed to support private trade
and investment flows in Africa.

Component 1: IDA Credits to ATI Members

1.     In response to market demands, seven countries (Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda,
Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) jointly established an insurance agency to cover political and
commercial risks. In 2001 IDA credits of US$105 million to Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda,
Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia financed the respective countries equity in ATI. In 2004, DRC
received an IDA credit of US$19.20 million to finance its capital contribution under the amended
DCA of the Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project. Likewise, in 2005
Madagascar received an IDA credit of US$1 million under the amended DCA of the Second Private
Sector Development Project.

Transactions Insured by ATI

2.      As of end 2013, aggregate cumulative trade and investment flows, and political violence9
transactions covered by ATI (partially or wholly) totaled about US$5.0 billion and US$8.0 billion
respectively. Graph 2.1 reveals that the volume of transactions for political violence in which ATI
participated was significantly greater than for investment and trade even though insurance coverage
for trade and investment had been a key goal of the agency.

                                     ATI Participated as Insurer (2001-2013)




3.    Kenya by far was the largest recipient of the agency’s coverage, followed by Uganda and
Zambia. Inra-regional transactions accounted for 58 percent of the investment policies written by the

    Political violence (PV) may include: terrorism and sabotage (TS), malicious damage, riots, strikes and civil commotions, war and
    civil war, coup d’état, insurrection, rebellion and revolution. PV may be covered either as a stand-alone insurance on property or as
    one of the risks in a broader package of political risk insurance cover (subsumed in this ICR under "investment insurance").


                                                                   26
agency, followed by international (extra-regional) transactions for 28 percent, and less than 13
percent for domestic transactions. (See Table 2.1) In the case of trade, international and intra-
regional transactions accounted respectively for 48 percent and 41 percent of the trade policies
written by the agency. Domestic transactions accounted for 11 percent. As for political violence,
domestic transactions accounted for 84 percent followed by intra-regional transactions for 16
percent. No international transactions received political violence coverage.

4.      The geographic breakdown of ATI’s activity in its Member States can be explained the size
of the respective economies and the volume of their external trade, as well as various others factors
such as: business environments, legal systems.as shown in the following table, as well as the fact
that ATI is headquartered in Kenya, where many international companies have established regional
offices covering East Africa.

5.    Across insured companies, the sector which received the most insurance coverage
(cumulatively) from ATI was infrastructure (41 percent), as shown in Graph 2.2. Mining followed
with 20 percent and non-financial services accounted for 16 percent. The predominance of

                                                         27
infrastructure is not surprising and is typical of other political insurance agencies underwriting in
Africa.

Business Volume

6.      The 2006 restructuring and, importantly, the “A stable” rating that ATI received from
Standard &Poor’s in 2008 allowed the agency to improve its underwriting performance. This rating
was reaffirmed in 2013. Between 2008 and 2009, the volume of underwritten policies almost tripled.
As of December 2013, the cumulative gross (including reinsurance) volume of policies underwritten
by the agency was over US$1.8 billion in 459 investment and trade transactions.
.
    Graph 2.3: Annual Gross Volume of Policies Issued By ATI for Trade and Investment




7.     Products offered by ATI cover three broad types of risks: (sovereign) political risks (PRI),
commercial risks (CRI), and political violence (PV). In 2013, ATI started covering the non-payment
risk on performance and similar bonds issued by banks and insurance companies on behalf of
contractors and suppliers. Graph 2.4 indicates that PRI accounts for most of ATI’s business in terms
of annual gross volume underwritten. Similarly, in 2013 PRI accounted for 73 percent of annual
gross written premium and 69 percent of gross exposure. Coverage related to CRI was second with

                                                 28
less than 20 percent of ATI’s business, as seen in Graph 2.4. The graph also reflects ATI’s growing
involvement since 2011 in PV, primarily terrorism and sabotage insurance. The average premium
rate for PV is much lower than for any other category. PV policies mostly cover existing property
rather than new investments. The market for African PV risks is well developed in London.

8.      Following Standard & Poor’s “A stable” rating to ATI, underwriting volume of co-insurance
and reinsurance substantially increased, as shown in the Graph 2.5.

                        Graph 2.5: Annual Volume Underwritten by ATI




9.      Graph 2.6 illustrates how ATI has been sourcing its business over the first nine months of
2013. Direct client marketing (i.e., acting sourcing) accounts for 53 percent and direct enquiries from
clients (i.e., passive sourcing) for 42 percent. Only 5 percent of its business was originated by
brokers, a low percentage compared to international standards reflecting the lack of specialized PRI
and CRI brokers in Africa.

10.    Looking at ATI’s insured client base as reflected in Graph 2.7, 45 percent of premiums
generated in 2013 came from commercial banks, about 35 percent came from export credit agencies
and other international partners, 11 percent came from local companies, and 7 percent came from
foreign companies.

Exposure

11.    Enlarging country membership is a top priority. At the end of 2013, 84 percent of the
agency’s net exposure was concentrated in four countries: Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania.
As illustrated in Table 2.3, ATI has significantly exceeded approved country limits and has little
headroom left in Tanzania and Zambia.

Component 2: IDA Credit to ATI

14.     The rating assigned to ATI by Standard & Poor’s, and the introduction of new products
(nonpayment risk) allowed ATI to ramp up its operations from 2008 onwards. Since 2012 the agency
has been generating net profits. Table 2.6 shows the financial performance of the agency over the
past five years

1.      According to Berne Union (BU) statistics, Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated at a small
percentage of the global political and commercial insurance market as measured by exposure
limits. More specifically, SSA represents 2 percent of BU’s global short -term exposure limits
(consistent with SSA’s share in global merchandise trade), and 6 percent of global medium-to-
long term exposure. At end-2012, the aggregate exposure limits of Berne Union members in the
41 SSA countries totaled US$62 billion.

             Graph 3.1 Global and Sub-Saharan Africa Credit Risk Markets




2.      Among these 41 SSA countries, ten account for approximately 80 percent of the region’s
total. Only two ATI Member Countries - Kenya and Zambia – are among these ten countries.

        Graph 3.2: Top 10 Sub-Saharan Countries (Berne Union Exposure Limits)




3.      The Berne Union market in ATI Member Countries accounts for 11 percent of the SSA
market – 17 percent business, and 9 percent for medium and long term. As reflected in Graph
3.3, the short term political and credit risk market in ATI countries (as measured by BU exposure
                                               34
limits) grew over two-fold between 2005 and 2012, while medium-to-long exposure varies
considerably from year to year. Note that in addition to products reflected in Berne Union
statistics (i.e., cross-border credit insurance), ATI also insures domestic trade flows and
performance bonds, domestics investments, and political violence – for which no market
statistics are available.

            Graph 3.3: Berne Union Exposure Limits in ATI Member Countries




4.     Although Berne Union and ATI statistics are not consistent, their comparison in Graph
3.4 suggests that ATI’s market share in its Member Countries might be in the order of 10
percent.

              Box 3.1: Political Risk and Trade Credit Insurers Active in Africa

The global political risk and trade credit insurance industry comprises four broad types of
providers.

Privately-owned underwriters: The “Big Three” global players are Atradius (former Dutch state
incumbent, now owned by Catalana Occidente), Coface (former French state incumbent, now
owned by Natixis), and Euler Hermes (former German state incumbent, now owned by Allianz).
The “Big Three” mostly provide short-term, whole-turnover insurance products, supporting both
cross-border trade (captured in Berne Union statistics) as well as domestic trade (not captured in
Berne Union statistics). These global providers have also developed specialized units underwriting
tailored single-obligor transactions similar to those described below. Specialized private
underwriters include various Lloyd’s syndicates as well as companies such as ACE, AIG, Axis,
Sovereign, Starr, XL, Zurich, etc. These underwriters offer tailored products supporting
transactions ranging from short-term trade to project finance. It is estimated that 10-20 percent of
their underwriting portfolio consists of African risks.

National schemes (supporting eligible national exports, investments, and in some cases strategic
commodity imports): The largest national export credit agencies (“ECAs”) are the three East Asian
agencies: Sinosure for China (established in 2002, now covering annual global flows exceeding
US$200 billion), K-sure for Korea (established in 1992, now covering annual global volumes
slightly below US$200 billion), and Japan’s national agency Nexi (established in 1950, annual
volumes of US$80 billion). These schemes offer a complete range of products supporting both
short-term (similar to the “Big Three” global players) as well as medium-to-long term business
similar to the national schemes based in Europe, North America, and South Africa, described
below. Other key national schemes are those based in Europe (such as the French state scheme
managed by Coface, the German state scheme managed by PWC Euler Hermes, Italy’s SACE), in
North America US Exim and OPIC (for investment) as well as Canada’s EDC, and South Africa
ECICSA.

Multilateral agencies: MIGA (focusing on PRI cover for investment insurance) and regional
agencies: Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC, based in
Jeddah), the Arab Investment & Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (Dhaman, based in Kuwait),
and African Trade Insurance Agency (ATI).

Reinsurers: Many of the private, public, and multilateral underwriters described above reinsure
some of their risks either on a deal by deal ”facultative” basis, or on a portfolio (“treaty”, notably
excess of loss) basis. Leading reinsurers active in this market include Hannover Re, Munich Re,
Swiss Re, as well as the Lloyd’s syndicates.

                      Africa: Regional Trade Facilitation Project (P063683)

Interviews were conducted with ATI clients and prospects based in Nairobi and London. The
general consensus from these interviews was that ATI is a visible and relevant market player in
Africa. ATI’s preferred creditor status with respect to sovereign political risk is valued by banks,
underwriters, and brokers. The interviews were consistent with the findings of an impact
assessment conducted in 2010.

Positive Feedback

    International (mostly British and South African) bank clients value ATI cover as a useful
    support for companion tranches of export credits extended by European and North
    American state schemes.
    Regional commercial banks value ATI cover which allows them to increase their trade
    finance facilities to corporate clients, notably export finance facilities.
    Domestic commercial banks in East Africa value ATI’s cover, which they rely on to
    increase credit facilities to contractors (discount of receivables and performance bonds
    arising from state procurement contracts) and re-exporting manufacturers (customs bonds).
    European and North American export credit agencies value ATI’s flexibility and credit
    rating, and use the agency as a reinsurer to share risks and support the financing of exports
    that do not originate from their home country.
    The London market (private underwriters including Lloyd’s syndicates) is very familiar
    with ATI, which they value as a front for their facilities given ATI’s preferred creditor
    status with Member Countries.
    Local insurance companies which have no capacity to retain specialized (political and
    commercial) risks, and are not familiar with the London market, prefer to transact locally
    through ATI.
    East African exporters and contractors rely on ATI to secure receivables on corporate,
    parastatals and state agencies, both on a single-obligor or whole-turnover basis.

Other Feedback

   One major international bank does not consider ATI as an acceptable insurer given their
   policy to cap ATI’s credit rating at a maximum of one notch above Kenya’s credit rating.
   Depending on national banking regulations, ATI cover does not always allow international
   banks to claim capital relief under Basel (BIS) guidelines.
   Some clients are disappointed by ATI’s geographical footprint– only ten Member Countries
   in Sub-Saharan Africa.

               Annex 8: Borrower's Detailed Comments on the ICR
                          and World Bank Response
                     Africa: Regional Trade Facilitation Project (P063683)


A draft version of the ICR was shared with ATI management in April 2014. ATI provided very
useful comments and insights, most of which were subsequently incorporated in the final ICR
herewith. A summary of ATI’s comments and the Bank team’s responses are noted below.

Ratings

Comment: A report by IDA’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG) issued by the end of FY2009
indicates a different and a more positive assessment. Further, the ratings of project performance
in the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) were mostly “satisfactory” and in three
instances “highly satisfactory”. How then did the overall performance rating for the ICR become
“moderately satisfactory”?

Comment: There is no evidence in the report to show how in the short period the ratings of
project performance deteriorated and were therefore downgraded by the ICR and how the risk to
development outcome all of sudden became “substantial.”

       Response: The basis for the outcome rating is provided in the ICR text which balances
       both strengths and weaknesses in implementation. The project completion process
       undertaken involves two steps. The first is a self-evaluation undertaken by the World
       Bank unit providing implementation support, primarily a desk review of project
       documents and relevant outside sources. A lesson emerging from the preparation of ICRs
       is that task teams at times misjudge project performance and when they do it tends to be
       on the optimistic side. Also, it is worth noting that ISRs for the first RTFP project were
       not prepared after 2011, as supervision focus shifted to the second operation and
       complicates the issue. ISRs are snapshots at a given time that incorporate expectations
       on how project implementation will evolve over time.

       QAG reports (the one referred to was issued three-and-a-half years before actual project
       closing), on the other hand, are an input into the ICR. As pointed out, the QAG
       Assessment of 2009 rated the likelihood of achievement of the development objective as
       “highly satisfactory”. There are times when the ICR differs with QAG conclusions (both
       upgrades and downgrades are possible). Upon further consideration and with the benefit
       of inputs from sector specialists, the ratings in the ICR are marginally different from
       QAG’s and their basis is explained in the ICR. Please also note that a moderately
       satisfactory rating (which the ICR assessed for this project) or better reflects a broadly
       successful project.

       The second step is an independent validation exercise of the final draft ICR to be
       conducted by the Internal Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank who will scrutinize
       the ratings.

Board Structure and Functioning

Comment: The ICR states as follows: “In practice, however, Board directors representing
member states continued to be mostly state appointees with no specialist knowledge of the
political risk and credit insurance industry, or experience in credit risk. ATI Management was
seldom held to account in key areas such as strategy formulation, international benchmarking,
risk management and cost control”. These assertions are not supported by any assessment of the
skills profile and experience background of Board members. Benchmarking can only be done
with similar institutions (public) but not with purely private market entities. The ATI Treaty
provides the qualifications to be met by all directors, alternate directors, the Chairman of the
Board and the Vice Chairman of the Board. Board members are appointed by the AGM of
shareholders when they meet set qualifications. ATI Management has been answering to the
Board and we don’t believe ATI Management has not been held accountable as indicated therein.
The Board of Directors will have however to directly take a position on this statement at its next
Board meeting. In the meantime we can confirm that the Board is not composed only by
representatives of Member States. The Board comprises also representatives of the political risk
and credit insurance industry including Atradius, SACE and the African Development Bank.
The Chairman also has the relevant insurance qualifications.

Comment: The draft ICR states as follows: “At a later stage while consistent with ownership and
preferred credit status, was not fully congruent with ATI’s commercial orientation and not
abreast of international industry and management best practice”. As per the letter and spirit of
ATI Treaty which was developed with the assistance of IDA and MIGA and ultimately approved
by IDA, at least half of Board members are from the private sector, they are either Chief
Executive Officers of international banks or insurance companies. The Board structure
representation is consistent with Board composition of comparable institutions such as MIGA.
ATI fulfils both commercial and development objectives and should not only benchmarked with
commercial entities as indicated in para 46.

Comment: In many sections of the report including in paras 66 & 68 the ICR indicates that there
flaws in design of the Board structure and governance of the institutions. Since these are serious
issues, yet at no time did IDA indicate the areas of concern in terms of governance or assessed
shortcomings in the Board function. The Board had board evaluations which were found
satisfactory.

Comment: The link between government performance and the ability to attract independent
industry expertise to the Board is not clear. Further, ATI Board is holding Management
responsible and challenges in attracting new members is well known even to the World Bank as
well as associated costs which impact on ATI’s cost ratio and cost control efforts.

       Response: We agree that these aspects deserve to be clarified and have done so in the
       revised ICR.

       The ICR in the section on Lessons Learned commends ATI’s Board for undertaking a
       Board evaluation in 2013 (given that the Board itself commissions such evaluations,
       other independent evaluation opportunities may also be useful). The evaluation offers
       some useful insights on areas for improvement noted in the ICR.
                                               44
       The need for the governance structure to evolve was noted in the mid-term review aide
       memoire in 2006. This was also reflected in the subsequent workshop on corporate
       governance organized for Board members.

       The ATI Treaty requires directors to have internationally recognized qualifications and
       extensive practical experience in at least one of the following fields: insurance, trade
       finance and banking; commercial law, or economics. The ATI Treaty does not require
       directors to have specialized expertise reflected in credit risk, political risk insurance,
       commercial risk insurance, KPI/incentive management, governance, etc. Directors
       representing the two shareholders who are credit insurers (SACE, Atradius Re) as a
       matter of course have a background in short-term credit insurance. The ICR has been
       clarified accordingly.

       The revised ICR notes the need for ATI’s Board to further engage ATI management in
       areas identified in the above evaluation and in our aide memoires as critical for the
       continued success of the second Regional Trade Facilitation Project.

ATI and Board Performance

Comment: Para 71 notes: “Areas of improvement include: articulation of a clear vision and
advocacy for the trade credit and political risk insurance market in Africa; development of ATI’
strategy in this market”. This general statement implies that there is lack of a clear vision
advocacy and strategy in ATI. If this is true then we would expect the report to articulate how a
clear vision and strategy should look like. This statement is however contradicted by another
statement in the same ICR which asserts the following: “Interviews were conducted with ATI
clients and prospects based in Nairobi and London. The general consensus from these interviews
was that ATI is a visible and relevant market player in Africa. ATI’s preferred creditor status
with respect to sovereign political risk is valued by underwriters and brokers. The interviews
were consistent with findings of an impact assessment conducted in 2010”.

Comment: (i) ICR indicates that “ATI did not assess its performance against peers”. First the
institutional set up benefited from the experience of institutional building arrangement from
similar organizations. MIGA staff was seconded on full time basis during project design and
during the first year of operations. All institutional arrangements were shared with the London
market and were accepted. (ii) We also need to agree who are ATI Peers. Is it in the public or
private insurers? (iii) The above statement must be read together with comparator organizations
listed under Table 2.9 [2.7]: Comparison of ATI with ICIEC and ECIC. ATI should be
compared with similar institutions. ECIC, the South African ECA cannot be compared with
ATI. Instead the closest institutions ATI should be compared with are MIGA, probably with the
Arab Investment & Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (DHAMAN) and ICIEC. You will find
that ATI has not done badly in key areas.

       Response: ATI is commended for its achievements, the intention of the ICR is to identify
       areas where ATI can continue to improve upon, especially in light of the planned
       expansion into West Africa. ATI is an advocate for credit insurance in Africa, and the
       ICR notes that the agency is recognized as a relevant market player. In the opinion of the
                                               45
       Bank team, areas for improvement include further articulation of a vision for the trade
       credit and political risk insurance market in Africa, as well as benchmarking of
       institutional arrangements, governance design (including progress towards self-
       supervision), and operational performance against a broad range of international practice
       – public and private. Whichever benchmarks are the most appropriate, ATI should
       continue to aim at achieving the highest levels of excellence.

Risk Framework

Comment: Para 62 - we do not agree with the first sentence [that risk is not negligible] which is
not substantiated and might be wrongly interpreted by other partners.

Comment: We don’t believe that the World Bank failed to invest resources for improvements in
risk management framework and governance design. In fact the Bank invested substantial
resources in the risk management framework which were made available through the World
Bank’s FIRST Initiative. Recently, the African Development Bank has also provided resources
to help in ATI in assessing the Enterprise Risk Management.

Comment: It is an important lesson learned that ATI should be allowed to underwrite business in
non-Member States particularly commercial risk for better utilization of capital and spread of
risk.

       Response: The ICR has been made clearer about the basis for our assessment and the
       wording has been adjusted to convey confidence that ATI is proactively addressing risks
       identified. AfDB and EIB’s support to ATI are also reiterated.

       ATI is still a relatively young player in a specialized market characterized by high
       adverse selection, potentially severe claims, and transactions that can be complex. Given
       that ATI only has preferred creditor status for political risk in member states, ATI has
       prudently focused on underwriting risks in its member states. This being said, expanding
       underwriting business is an important goal. A convincing case can be made, explaining
       the experience so far in underwriting commercial risk in member states, and outlining the
       risk implications of underwriting risks in non-member states. These are issues for the
       Board Risk Committee -- which is now being constituted.


Monitoring and Evaluation

Comment: The ICR declares as follows: “…there was no indicator to measure trends in
political risk insurance coverage and market evolution in the region, for which RTFP was to be
a catalyst. Overall the design of the results framework was incomplete”. The assertion of the last
sentence is wrong. Various market surveys and interviews with the Lloyd’s market provided
indicators on the need for PRI coverage and market gaps in the region as a qualitative analysis
and not a quantitative research. Later on in the same ICR it is recognized that even today:
“Unfortunately, no statistical tool is available to measure market size and market share at
regional and country levels”. Annex 3: Overview of the Political and Commercial risk Industry
p. 36. In view of the above critique, it was expected that the ICR would have proposed under
                                               46
“lessons learned” a better and complete results framework to be used in future for similar Bank
operations.

       Response: As discussed in Section 2.3 of the ICR a more suitable M&E framework
       should have involved SMART (specific, measurable, attributable, realistic and relevant,
       time bound) indicators. While market survey and interviews can be informative they
       cannot substitute for objective and systemic indicators that can be relied on to measure
       actual progress. The importance of using SMART indicators and ensuring a viable M&E
       is widely recognized by Bank and development partner teams.

Bank Performance

Comment: Quality of Bank supervision -- It is up to IDA to assess its performance. Though
from ATI’s point of view, the IDA closely supervised ATI and was very responsive until
recently.

Comment: Para 35 -- Second sentence: IDA’s engagement to provide financial support to
eligible countries was confirmed from inception and subsequently reaffirmed to ATI
shareholders, Board of Directors and ATI Management. IDA regional allocations are internal
processes. ATI and prospective member states are not involved in the budgeting and allocation
processes. Therefore please reframe the sentence reading “It was not clear whether IDA regional
allocation would be available to finance equity”.

Comment: Accountability of IDA staff -- IDA staff has not been responsive to the client
especially in recent times. Requests for no objections have been unreasonably withheld and as
well as not acting on requests for financing for countries willing to join ATI. Membership
expansion was to be supported by joint missions so that the involvement of the World Bank
could add credibility to the process.

       Response: The Bank team is grateful for this feedback on Bank supervision. The rating
       is based on the fact that for an experimental project such as this one maximizing its
       development impact would have required more proactive supervision. The other possible
       aspects of strengths and shortcomings in supervision are explained in the ICR.

       Financing of ATI membership expansion was intended under the follow-on project,
       RTFP2, which is not the subject of the ICR. This financing hinged on allocations under
       IDA 16, which were later exhausted. The allocation of regional IDA is inherently an
       internal exercise by World Bank management.

       In recent months, the Bank has allocated extensive resources to further strengthen
       supervision, and respond to ATI’s requests. This includes putting together a team of
       senior professionals with global expertise in risk, credit insurance, and reinsurance to
       prepare and attend the Technical Committee held on March 20, 2014. As recommended
       by the recent meeting of the Board’s Technical Committee, ATI’s risk management
       framework should be evaluated and vetted by a Risk Committee, calling on external
       expertise whenever necessary.

                                              47
Lessons Learned

Comment: It was expected that the ICR would have proposed under “Lessons Learned” a better
and complete results framework to be used in future for similar Bank operations.

       Response: While the ICR has sought to distill key lessons that are relevant to RTFP and
       its successor project, this section is meant to inform broader issues supported by Bank-
       financed activities.

Important Areas Not Covered by the ICR

Comment: Partnerships -- the ability to attract and retain partners including reinsurers to the
African market is an indicator of success. ATI was able to conclude partnership arrangements
with ECAs which also a vote of confidence. Having mobilized the African Development Bank
to support same development objectives was also an achievement. ATI was able to attract other
partners like EIB who has just approved a grant for capacity building.

       Response: Agreed. The ICR notes this in Sections 2.2 and 4.

Comment: S & P Credit rating -- Though credit rating was not a project performance indicator
per se. However, it turned out to be a powerful tool to get a sustained flow of business especially
from banks. While the ICR noted S&P credit rating it did underline the advantages for such
rating for a world class organization.

       Response: The Bank team agrees. The importance of the S&P rating is noted in Sections
       2.2 and 3.2.

Comment: Cost -- The issue of cost discipline was raised severally in the ICR but there is no
evidence that the cost centers have been analyzed to make a more informed assessment of the
main costs and reasons to make a more balanced opinion and also compared with similar
multilateral entities like MIGA, ICIEC, etc.

       Response: The aide memoire of the most recent mission (March 2014) sheds some light
       on this issue. ATI could undertake a closer examination, including benchmarking against
       a broader range of special risks insurers.

Comment: Membership -- No mention was made on membership drive challenges particularly
the lengthy process and cost of recruitment of new members not to mention significant
management’s time.

       Response: This important point is now noted in Section 4.

Conclusion

Comment: -- This was a provisional review of the ICR. Additional comments may be provided
and especially from members of the ATI Board of Directors. We would like to thank IDA
through the World Bank for thinking of such an innovative project which has gone a long way in
                                                48
increasing trade and investment in Member States. We would also like to thank Member States
for agreeing to borrow or take grants for this purpose. The ICR report is a good medium to
assess the project implementation and performance. The report has been positive in many
respects save for areas we have highlighted which we would like reflected to give a more
objective and balanced assessment of the project for the benefit of those who will read and use
the report. The lessons learnt should go a long way in improving design of future projects and to
us in ATI to improve (where necessary) our current operations for the better. While we may
have different opinion on some issues we believe we both have good intentions for ATI.

       Response: The Bank team gratefully acknowledges the feedback.
