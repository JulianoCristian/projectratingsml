The two components will: 1) Support\n            the establishment of a regional political insurance\n            facility, to be implemented, and managed by a multilateral\n            agency, i.e., the African Trade Insurance Agency (ATI). The\n            facility will cover productive activity involving\n            cross-border trade, and, political/non-commercial risks,\n            which include inter alia, inability to convert, or transfer\n            currency; imposition of exchange controls; cancellation of\n            licenses/restrictions on import/export; and, seizure of\n            goods, prevention of sale, or of export. 2) ATI's\n            operating, and capital costs will be shared by the\n            participating countries, and a credit from the International\n            Development Association (IDA) will cover the start-up period\n            of ATI's operation. Each country's share will be\n            proportional to the level of ATI's activity, related to\n            transaction, covering imports into, and exports out of each\n            country.
