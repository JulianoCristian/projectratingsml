project will substantially improve\n            the physical condition of the highway network. The key\n            objectives of the project are to : a) bring the highway\n            network to acceptable operating standards through a program\n            of road rehabilitation and periodic and routine maintenance;\n            b) improve the institutional capability of the Secretariat\n            of Public Works (SEOPC) to plan and maintain the road\n            system; c) increase the availability of road maintenance\n            equipment; d) improve pavement quality; and e) strengthen\n            the domestic construction industry.  The project would\n            comprise : i) rehabilitation of 839 km of roads; ii) a\n            program of periodic maintenance; iii) a program of workshop\n            reconstruction; iv) equipment rehabilitation including\n            purchase of spare parts; v) road signalling and marking and\n            vehicle weight control; and vi) technical assistance for\n            training equipment operators, pavement technology transfer,\n            road maintenance management, a rural roads inventory, an\n            urban transport study, a construction industry study,\n            general training and scholarships; and engineering services\n            for road design."}, "docdt": "1991-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
