MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FOR A FIFTH ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$79.0 million equivalent to the Dominican Republic is submitted for
approval.  The proposed loan would be repayable over 20 years, including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. It
would help finance the Fifth Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project.
Economic Setting
2.       After a period of vigorous economic growth, amounting to about 6.5
percent of GDP p.a. from the mid-1960s to the late 19708, economic
conditions in the Dominican Republic declined sharply. Between 1982 and
1986, GNP per capita fell from US$1,330 to US$730, the rate of open
unemployment climbed from 18 percent to 25 percent, and the external debt
rose from 30 percent to 59 percent of GDP. Based on a massive rise in
public investment intended to reinstate growth, GDP grew by 8 percent in
1987. but the excessive expansion of domestic demand led to the loss of
international reserves, and to persistent Inflation, which reached 101 in
1990. Real GDP growth decrease to 2.42 in 1988, and to a negative 5.11 in
1990.
3.       To halt the rapidly deteriorating economic situation, the
Government has recently implemented a stabilization program. Inflation was
reduced to an annual equivalent rate of less than 10? in the first quarter
of 1991. The differential between the official and the parallel market
exchange rates was eliminated, the official exchange rate was devalued, and
international reserves have begun to accumulate. All arrears to the Bank
and to the International Monetary Fund were cleared in February and April,
1991 respectively; and new overdues have been kept below 60 days. As part
of the stabilization program, all regulations pertaining to deposit and
lending interest rates in the banking system were lifted, and step. were
taken to reduce portfolio requirements and a free interbank market was
created; and key domestic prices like gasoline, electricity, flour and
sugar were substantially increased; the official exchange rate was
devalued. All current government expenditures were frozen and capital
expenditures limited to the completion of on-going works. Stabilization
efforts have continued strong and successful over the first half of 1991.
Further details on recent developments will be presented in the forthcoming
Country Brief.
4.       Medium to long term prospects, however, depend upon the capacity
of the Government to maintain its stabilization efforts and to go beyond by
implementing policy reforms necessary to sustainable growth. Also, arrears
to other creditors remain very large, and sustainability will strongly



depend upon the government's capacity to implement a coherent debt
strategy, for which there will be a need to reach an agreement with the
Fund, to obtain rescheduling in the Paris Club, to obtain additional
bilateral financing through the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development, and to reach an agreement with commercial bank creditors.
Sector Background
5.       The road network in the Dominican Republic consists of about 4,900
km of highways and about 14,000 km of rural roads. Of the total highway
network about 3,800 km are paved or being paved. The economy relies
heavily on the road system to provide an adequate and efficient access to
market for primary agricultural production and rining output. Domestic
cargo traffic consists mainly of exports of commodities to the ports
(sugar, coffee, cacao and minerals) and internal trade in agricultural
products from the central regions and industrial and consumer goods from
Santo Domingo. Tourism, which is second only to agriculture in
contribution to foreign exchange earnings, depends heavily on transport
infrastructure for future growth.
6.       A recent survey conducted by the Secretariat of Public Works and
Comunications (SEOPC) with the assistance of consultants financed under the
ongoing Third Road Reconstruction Project (Loan 2609-DO1, shows that about
1,300 km of the highway network are in deteriorated condition and need
rehabilitation. This is an improvement from the more than 2,000 km
reported in need of major repairs in 1985. The improved state of the roads
is due to the major effort mounted by the Government in recent years to
rehabilitate existing highways. In the period 1987-89 the Government, with
the help of the Bank, completed reconstruction of 517 km, work on 448 km is
still underway.
7.       The SEOPC is responsible for maintaining the road network,
supervising construction and reconstruction of roads, and transport policy
and planning. SEOPC's organizational structure is generally adequate.
However, a major institutional weakness within SEOPC continues to be the
General Directorate of Maintenance (DGM4).
8.       The budget of the SEOPC is approved annually by Congress based on
the submission by the Presidencia. Budget allocations to the transport
sector have varied between 122 and 16% of total Government expenditures in
the period 1981-88. This level is reasonable. However, the process of
preparing the road reconstruction budget has been increasingly shifting
away from the SEOPC to Presidencia, giving the latter substantial control
over the selection of roads to be rehabilitated. In addition, the budget
has contained less funds than would normally be required for road
maintenance. Through an agreement on a Five-Year Highway Investment
Program, the proposed project is designed to shift the budgeting process
back to the SEOPC and give it a determining role in road selection. The
proposed project also emphasizes an increased level of expenditures for
road maintenance, both routine and periodic.
9.       Government intervention in the transport sector is mainly limited
to urban passenger transport, for which it sets tariffs, licenses operators
and assigns routes and frequencies. There is mlnimum interference in
freight transport (where entry into the sector is free) and inter-urban



passenger services. The main source of revenues from road users has
traditionally been taxes on petroleum products. In 1980, reflectins high
receipts from such taxes, road user charges covered all road maintenance
costs as well as most construction costs. However, because of a lag in
adjusting the prices of gasoline and diesel, fuel taxes turned negative in
1989 and user charges totalled only RD$14 million, significantly less than
the RD$75 million required just for road maintenance. This situation has
been drastically reversed since mid-1990 with the Government raising the
price of fuel products on several occasions leading to their present level
of RD$13.50 (US$1.04) per gallon of diesel and RD$20 (US$1.54) for
gasoline. At this level, fuel taxes should be sufficient to cover all road
expenditures for periodic and routine maintenance.
Rational for Bank Involvement
10.      The Government's strategy in the transport sector, supported by
the Bank, has focused on reconstruction of key links of the higbway
network. Despite recent efforts, about 252 of the highway network still
require rehabilitation. The Goverament is aware that transport is a
critical production and marketing facilitator for the economy, which
depends heavily on the production of goods. Therefore, the Government has
requested Bank support to continue the rehabilitation program.
11.      The Bank has financed to date four operations in the road sector.
The total amount lent was US$100.8 million. The Third Road Reconstruction
Project (Loan 2609-DO) is now nearing completion (expected closing date
December 31, 1991). The last two project completion reports point to the
problem of late completion of engineering work as being largely responsible
for implementation delays. The proposed project aIms at avoiding this
problem by having engineering design for the first year (1992) already
completed and those for subsequent years (1993-94) available about a year
in advance. Also, delays were experienced because of lack of strict
criteria for prequalification of contractors. To alleviate this problem, a
now prequalification document was agreed upon during negotiations. The
proposed loan is building on the foundations laid by the technical
assistance program under Loan 2609-DO. For the first time, SEOPC is basing
its investments on a comprohensive five-year investment plan prepared by
its General Directorate of Planning and Programung (DGPP). Improvements
resulting from the technical assistance rendered in workshops and equipment
will be followed by further workshop modernization and equipment
rehabilitation under the proposed project. In addition, with Bank support,
the pavement division within DGPP, which has been reorganized and
reirforced under the recent Bank loan, will play a larger role in the
future In highway design and maintenance planning.
12.      The benefits from the rehabilitation worke will be maintained in
the long term only by assuring a well-executed maintenance program for the
highway network, and the setting up of an efficient organization to plan
and carry out this maintenance program; this should be the main
contribution of the Bank's participation in the proposed project. The deep
changes in the organization of the work force, the systematization of a
medium-term maintenance program, increased budgetary allocation, and
introduction of periodic maintenance by contract, would be implemented only
with Bank involvement and close supervision. Bank participation will also



- 4 -
enable the annual updating of a five-year investment plan based on changing
road condition and demand tequirements. Finally, the Bank's involvement
would help maintain a viable financing plan for the transport sector,
including rational pricing of petroleum products.
Proiect Objectives
13.      The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a)    reduce vehicle operating costs, improve access to markets
and encourage tourism development by rehabilitating about
830 km of deteriorated road links over a three-year period;
(b)    improve the institutional capacity of SEOPC to maintain the
road system by introducing detailed work programs,
reorganizing the work force, providing additional funds for
road maintenance materials, and training maintenance staff;
(c)    increase the availability of equipment through a detailed
equipment rehabilitation program; and
(d)    improve the quality of pavements through an extensive
technical assistance program in this area.
Proiect Description
14.      The proposed project finances the initial three-year slice of
SEOPC's five-year (1992-96) investment program. The major components of
the project are: (a) rehabilitation of 834 km of roads (52Z of total
project cost); (b) a program of periodic maintenance (20Z of total cost) to
be carried out mostly by contractors; (c) rehabilitation and urgent repairs
to bridges (1.5Z of total cost); (d) reconstruction of workshops (1.52 of
total cost); (e) rehabilitation of existing road maintenance equipment and
purchases of spare parts and equipment fur road safety, axle weight control
and environmental enforcement (14.57 of total cost); (f) supervision of
civil works by consultants (4.52 of total cost); and (g) an institutional
development program, including an action program for DGM, training,
technical assistance and studies (6Z of total cost). The total project
cost amounts to US$111.0 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$78.6 million (712 of total project cost). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amount and methods of procurement
and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the schedule of Bank
operations in the Dominican Republic are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. During negotiations, the terms of reference for the studies
under the technical assistance program were agreed with the Government.
The roads to be rehabilitated are shown in the attached map. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8750-DO dated May 30, 1991, is also attached. The
project will be carried out by the SEOPC, which has accumulated substantial
experience and is capable of implementing the project satisfactorily. The
technical assistance to be provided will enable DGM to carry out the road
maintenance component satisfactorily.



W5-
Alreed Actions
15.      During negotiations agreements were reached thats  (a) the prices
of diesel and gasoline will cover at least their CIF cost; (b) road
maintenance costs will be covered by road users; (c) the revised
prequalification document, referred to above, will be used to prequalify
all contractors under the project: (d) SEOPC will carry out the 1992-94
rehabilitation works according to the list of roads agreed on with the
Bank, and any modification or addition will be done only after obtaining
the Bank's approvals te) the 1992-96 Highway Investment Program, as agreed
with the Bank, will be updated annually and presented to the Bank by
September 30 of each year; (f) SEOPC will implement the 1992-96 Highway
Maintenance Program and the Government will allocate the funds necessary
for this purpose; (g) SEOPC will present to the Bank, by September 30 of
each year, a satisfactory updating of the road maintenance budget for the
next fiscal year, and by March 31 of each year will report to the Bank
expenditures by category for maintenance in the preceding fiscal year; (h)
the Government will earmark the counterpart funds needed for the project
for 1992-94, as followss 1992 - US$ 10.5 million equivalent, 1993 - US$
10.7 million. and 1994 - US$ 10.8 million; (i) SEOPC will consult with the
Bank before contracting any work under the project if final engineering
estimates exceed the original cost estimate by more than 251 in US dollar
terms; and (j) SEOPC will implement a detailed action program which
includes, among other issues, measures required to strengthen the DGM to
ensure timely preparation of detailed engineering studies.
Proiect Benefits
16.      The project will result in a substantial improvement of the
physical condition of the highway network and a significant reduction in
vehicle operating costs, improved access to markets and further tourism
development. All subprojects included in the project and the five-year
plan have been subject to an economic analysis, which discarded any
investment with a rate of return below 122 (the rates of return of the
subprojects included in the project vary from 142 to over 1002). Other
benefits include improving the institutional setup, increasing availability
of equipment and productivity of workshops and introducing an improved
system of road maintenance, thereby eliminating the need for repeated road
rehabilitation cycles.
Project Risks
17.      The main project risks ares  (a) slow implementation of the road
maintenance program. To minimize this risk, the proposed project includes
an agreed five-year maintenance program supported by extensive training in
pavement technology, and consultants for the maintenance management system.
Periodic maintenance will be largely contracted out and the maintenance
organization strengthened both at the central level and in the field; (b)
possible delays in starting civil works because of insufficient engineering
design capability. First year designs were completed before negotiations
and the project includes funds for preparation of engineering designs by
outside firms; (c) delays in issuing bid documents and selection of
inexperienced contractors. Work on bidding documents started before
negotiations, and a revised document with stricter criteria for



prequalificatioa of contractors vsa agreed upons and (d) high staff
turnover. Vhile the project provides some Incentives In the form of
training programs, ths issue has to be resolved in the contezt of overall
overnmAnt policy In the public sector.
Recoamendtion
18.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
articles of agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
