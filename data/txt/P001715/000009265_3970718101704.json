Government to improve living and sanitary\n            conditions in the project area in Western Mali.  About 230\n            villages will be beneficiaries of boreholes equipped with\n            handpumps.  The project will stress villagers' direct\n            participation from siting of boreholes through construction\n            of waterpoints to operation and maintenance.  Assumption by\n            villagers of responsibilities for maintenance will be a key\n            ingredient to the success of the project.  The project will\n            strengthen Government's capability to identify, prepare\n            and manage this type of project.  The project includes: (a)\n            provision of about 340 productive boreholes in Western Mali;\n            (b) supply and installation of handpumps and necessary spare\n            parts; (c) technical assistance, consultancy services and a\n            training program; and (d) studies to prepare for a follow-up project."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
