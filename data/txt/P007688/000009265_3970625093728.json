satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the kind of approach used in the municipal funds\n            program of allowing rural communities to actively manage\n            their own small scale development investments can be\n            successful. Participatory evaluations, involving different\n            levels of government and community members, can be done\n            effectively with limited resources. Capacity building\n            measures and incentive structures need to be integrated into\n            the design of programs containing substantial community\n            complexity and diversity of sector investments, and need to\n            include also the local level."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
