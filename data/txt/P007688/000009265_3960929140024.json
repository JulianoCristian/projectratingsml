of poor and indigenous populations in\n            the four poorest states of Mexico to basic infrastructure,\n            social services, larger markets, and agricultural\n            technologies. The project consists of three components:\n            investment; environmental and archeological site protection;\n            and (c) institutional development. The investment component\n            will finance programs for infrastructure projects (rural\n            roads and rural electrification), productive projects\n            (agriculture, forestry and agroindustries), and social\n            projects (education, water supply and sewerage systems). The\n            environmental preservation and archeological protection\n            component will finance a program (the Lacandona Protection\n            Plan) which will: (a) protect the last remaining humid\n            forest area in Mexico; (b) strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of federal offices, state agencies, and\n            municipalities in order to improve project assessment\n            techniques and environmental policy implementation; and (c)\n            finance the restoration of selected archeological sites. The\n            institutional development component will finance costs for\n            strenghtening: (a) project executing agencies; (b) state and\n            municipal planning and budgeting systems; and (c) the state\n            and municipal entities to assume additional administrative\n            functions that they have and will be receiving under the\n            government's program of decentralization."}, "docdt": "1991-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
