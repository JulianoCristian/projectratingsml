Project's\n            objectives will be to help the Government formulate an\n            agricultural development strategy in the context of\n            Portugal's anticipated entry into the European Economic\n            Community.  The project includes:  (a) the elaboration of a\n            national master plan for research, the design of priority\n            research programs and development of selected adaptive\n            experimental farms; (b) the reorganization and strengthening\n            of extension services in seven representative agrarian\n            zones, on a pilot basis, for eventual replication on a\n            national scale.  The project also involves; (c) review of\n            investment plans and establishment of priorities for large,\n            medium and small irrigation schemes, promotion of efficient\n            water use and cost recovery procedures; (d) studies and\n            technical assistance to strengthen agricultural cooperative\n            credit banks, and to establish a central cooperative bank.\n            Finally, the project intends to; (e) review the national\n            seed industry, promotion of seed production and\n            certification, and feasibility studies for the extension of\n            seed production and certification.  This enterprise will\n            consist of the provision of 316 man-months of technical\n            assistance, equipment for research, seed treatment,\n            extension services and 103 man-months of training."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
