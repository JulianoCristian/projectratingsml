constitute\n            bottlenecks to efficiency and effectiveness in the civil\n            service; b) assist the Department of Statutory Bodies to\n            better manage the interface between the parastatal sector\n            and the Government; and c) strengthen the Malawi Institute\n            of Management. The project will be implemented over a\n            five-year period and has five main components: 1) improving\n            civil service policy and information framework by designing,\n            installing, and implementing an appropriate management\n            information systems for the personnel and finance functions;\n            2) strengthen the capacity of the department of personnel\n            management and training by reviewing the institutional\n            arrangements for determining remuneration, redesigning the\n            pay structure and benefits, preparing procedure manuals for\n            common service staff, developing an open performance\n            appraisal system, and developing and introducing career\n            paths; 3) strengthen institutional capacity of the Ministry\n            of Finance by financing the installation and implementation\n            of budget financing and providing support to the tax policy\n            analysis unit; 4) support the Department of Statutory\n            Bodies; and 5) strengthen the Malawi Institute of Management\n            by supporting staff training and providing the necessary\n            facilities and equipment."}, "docdt": "1994-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
