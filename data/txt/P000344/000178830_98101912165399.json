         help establish an efficient institutional framework for\n            planning, developing, and maintaining feeder roads to\n            support high priority agricultural/rural development\n            projects. It consists of (a) a four-year program for the\n            construction and improvement of about 2,200 km of feeder\n            roads; (b) technical assistance to establish a Feeder Roads\n            Unit within the Department of Roads, to implement the above\n            program and train local staff; and (c) a study of a\n            follow-up feeder road program and resources for feeder road\n            maintenance. The project would have an important\n            institution-building effect. The feeder roads to be included\n            are indispensable for rural development in the project\n            areas; four high priority rural development projects to be\n            served by the roads are expected to improve the condition of\n            some 100,000 low-income farm families."}, "docdt": "1977-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
