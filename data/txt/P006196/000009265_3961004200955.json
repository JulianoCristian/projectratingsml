Bolivia (GOB)\n            and its Ten-Year Action Plan for Children and Women. It\n            contributes toward poverty alleviation and human capital\n            development objectives by supporting the initiation of the\n            Proyecto Integral de Desarrollo Infantil (PIDI), thus\n            expanding coverage and improving quality of child\n            development programs in poor urban and peri-urban areas of\n            the 34 largest cities. The specific objectives of this\n            project are to: (a) improve children's readiness to\n            succeed in school and beyond by facilitating their physical,\n            emotional, social and cognitive development; (b) enhance the\n            status of women by increasing their employment\n            opportunities, and expanding their knowledge of education,\n            health and nutrition; and (c) increase community and private\n            sector participation in the social development process. An\n            associated objective of this project is to assist the GOB to\n            strengthen its capacity to formulate and evaluate social\n            policy. The project is comprised of three main components:\n            (i) the sector policy development and management\n            strengthening component enhances the public sector's\n            capacity to formulate and evaluate social policy; (ii) the\n            service delivery support component supports the delivery of\n            integrated child development services to poor children; and\n            (iii) close project performance monitoring and impact evaluation."}, "docdt": "1993-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
