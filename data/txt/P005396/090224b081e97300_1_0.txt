3.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in com-
pliance with the policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the
Loa,i shall be disbursed on account of payments for taxes levied
by, or in the territory of, the Borrower on goods or services,
or on the importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof;
to that end, if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in
respect of any item to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan
decreases or increases, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower,
increase or decrease the disbursement percentage then applicable
to such item as required to be consistent with the aforementioned
policy of the Bank.
4.   For the purpose of Category (6), the disbursement percen-
tage "65% of net financing" means for any given period the
equivalent of 65% of the aggregate amount lent for house con-
nections minus the amount produced during such given period
as described in paragraph 1(k) (iii) of Schedule 4 of this Agree-
ment; provided, however, that: (i) the amount withdrawn from
the Loan Account in respect of such given period under any Sub-
Category of Category (6) shall not exceed the amount so determined
minus the amount withdrawn under any corresponding Sub-Category
of Category (7) to the extent that it has not yet been so deducted
for the purpose of determining earlier withdrawals under Category
(6); and (ii) the cumulative amounts withdrawn from the Loan
Account under any Sub-Category of Category (6) shall not exceed
one half of the cumulative amounts withdrawn under any corres-
ponding Sub-Category of Category (7).
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no
withdrawals shall be made in respect of:
(i) payments made for expenditures prior to the date of this
Agreement; and
(ii) payments made for expenditures in respect of any Sub-
Category of Categories (6) and (7) (other than Sub-Categories
(6)(a) and (7)(a)) by any Rggie, until the Convention de Prft
and the FEC Lending Agreement for such R6gie shall have been
executed by the parties thereto and the Bank shall have been
furnished with an opinion or opinions showing that such Conven-
tion de Pret and FEC Lending Agreement have been duly authorized
or ratified in accordance with their respective terms.
6.   With respect to Categories (1) through (5) and Sub-Category
(8)(a), notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Loan
or the disbursement percentages set forth in the table in para-
graph 1 above, if the Bank has reasonably estimated that the


﻿- 18 -
amount of the Loan then allocated to any such Category will
be insufficient to finance the agreed percentage of all expen-
ditures in that Category, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower:
(i) reallocate to such Category to the extent required to meet the
estimated shortfall, proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated
to another Category or Sub-Category (8)(a) and which in the
opinion of the Bank are not needed to meet other expenditures; and
(ii) if such reallocation cannot fully meet the estimated short-
fall, reduce the disbursement percentage then applicable to such
expenditures in order that further withdrawals under such Category
may continue until all expenditures thereunder shall have been
made.
7.   With respect to Categories (6) and (7) and Sub-Category
(8)(b), notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the
Loan set forth in the table in paragraph 1 above:
(i) upon selection from time to time by agreement between
the Borrower and the Bank, of a Rfgie other than one
of those listed under Sub-Categories of Categories (6)
and (7), the Bank shall add corresponding Sub-Categories
listing such R6gie under Categories (6) and (7) and,
by notice to the Borrower, allocate from Category 8(b)
to said corresponding Sub-Categories amounts required
by such Regie to finance expenditures for house con-
nections; and
(ii) if the Borrower and the Bank have determined that the
amount of the Loan then allocated to any Sub-Category
of Categories (6) and (7) will have to be increased
to finance expenditures under such Sub-Category for
additional house connections, the Bank may, by notice
to the Borrower, reallocate from Sub-Category (8)(b)
to Sub-Categories of Categories (6) and (7) and from
Sub-Categories of Category (6) to corresponding Sub-
Categories of Category (7), to the extent required,
the amount of the proceeds of the Loan then allocated
to said Sub-Categories to meet expenditures for such
additional house connections.
8.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the
procurement of any item in any Category or Sub-Category is
inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to in this
Agreement, no expenditures for such item shall be financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way


﻿- 19 -
restricting or limiting any other right, power or remedy of the
Bank under the Loan Agreement, by notice to the Borrower, cancel
such amount of the Loan as, in the Bank's reasonable opinion,
represents the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise
have been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the
Loan.

SCHEDULE 5
Procurement
A.   International Competitive Bidding
1.   Except as provided in Parts C and E hereof, goods and works
shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with
procedures consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines for
Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA .Credits" published by
the Bank in March 1977 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the
basis of international competitive bidding as described in Part A
of the Guidelines.
2.   For goods and works to be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding, in addition to the requirements of
paragraph 1.2 of the Guidelines, the Borrower shall cause ONEP and
each of the R6gies concerned to prepare and forward to the Bank
as soon as possible, and in any event not later than 60 days prior
to the date of availability to the public of the first tender or
prequalification documents relating thereto, as the case may be, a
general procurement notice, in such form and detail and containing
such information as the Bank shall reasonably request; the Bank
will arrange for the publication of such notice in order to
provide timely notification to prospective bidders of the oppor-
tunity to bid for the goods and works in question. The Borrower
shall cause ONEP and each of the Rfgies concerned to provide the
necessary information to update such notice annually so long as
any goods or works remain to be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding.
3.        (i) Bidders for the works included in Part C of
the Project shall be prequalified as described in
paragraph 1.3 of Part A of the Guidelines; and
(ii) contracts for goods and works for each part of
Part A which falls within ONEP's and the Rfgies'
respective jurisdiction and for Parts B, C and D-of
the Project shall be grouped to the extent possi-
ble.
4.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for the
supply of goods to be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding: (i) bidders shall be required to state in
their bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for the imported goods,


﻿- 30 -
or the ex-factory price or off-the-shelf price of other goods,
offered in such bid; and (ii) customs duties and other import
taxes levied in connection with the importation, or the sales and
similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery,
pursuant to the bid, of the goods shall not be taken into account
in the evaluation of the bids.
B.   Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures
described in Part A of this Schedule, goods manufactured in
Morocco may be granted a margin of preference in accordance with,
and subject to, the following provisions:
1.   All bidding documents for the procurement of goods
shall clearly indicate any preference which will be granted, the
information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for
such preference and the following methods and stages that will be
followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
2.   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in
one of the following three groups:
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in
Morrocco if the bidder shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Borrower, ONEP or the
R&gies, as appropriate, and the Bank that the
manufacturing cost of such goods includes a value
added in Morocco equal to at least 20% of the
ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2) Group B: all other domestic bids.
(3) Group C: bids offering any other goods.
3.   In order to determine the lowest evaluated bid of
each group, all evaluated bids in each group shall first be
compared among themselves, without taking into account customs
duties and other import taxes levied in connection with the
importation, and sales and similar taxes levied in connection with
the sale or delivery, pursuant to the bids, of the goods. Such
lowest evaluated bids shall then be compared with each other, and
if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group A or group B
is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award.


﻿- 31 -
4.   If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids
shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group
A after adding to the evaluated bid price of the imported goods
offered in each group C bid, for the purpose of this further
comparison only, an amount equal to: (i) the amount of customs
duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would
have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such group
C bid; or (ii) 15% of such price of such goods if said customs
duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price. If the group A bid in
such further comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for
the award; if not, the bid from group C which as a result of the
comparison under paragraph 3 is the lowest evaluated bid shall be
selected.
C.   Other Procurement Procedures
1.   Contracts for works, installation and supply of pipe-
lines and construction of distribution networks for Parts B, C and
E of the Project estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
$1,000,000 each may be awarded on the basis of competitive bideing
advertised locally and in accordance with procedures acceptable to
the Bank, provided that the aggregate amount of such contracts
does not exceed the equivalent of $12,000,000.
2.   Contracts for the supply, with or without installation,
of equipment for Parts B, C, D and E of the Project estimated
to cost less than the equivalent of $250,000 each may be awarded

accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank, provided that
the aggregate amount of such contracts does not exceed the equi-
valent of $2,500,000.
3.   Contracts for equipment and materials for those parts of
Part A of the Project which fall within the areas of ONEP's or the
Rfgies' respective jurisdiction estimated to cost less than the
equivalent of $250,000 each may be awarded, prior to the instal-
lation of house connections, on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with procedures acceptable to
the Bank, provided that the aggregate amount of such contracts
does not exceed the equivalent of $1,500,000 in the case of ONEP,
RAD, RADEEF and RADEEMA, respectively.

D.   Review of Procurement Decisions by the Bank
1.   Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall cause ONEP,
before qualification is invited, to inform the Bank in detail of
the procedure to be followed, and to introduce such modifications
in said procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The
Borrower shall cause ONEP to furnish to the Bank for its comments
the list of prequalified bidders, together with a statement of
