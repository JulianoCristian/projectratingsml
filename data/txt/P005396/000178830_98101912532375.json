Water\n            Supply Project for Morocco is to improve access to safe\n            water supply of the low income population of at least 11\n            major towns and 80 smaller centers, and to bring water or\n            improved water supply to the population around Karia Ba\n            Mohamed and in the Ziz valley from Errachidia to Erfoud, as\n            well as on the Tafilalet plain around Rissani. The project\n            consists of: (i) revolving funds to finance credit granted\n            to low income households for house connections in at least\n            11 major cities and about 80 other population centers; (ii)\n            a line of credit to ONEP (Office National de l'Eau\n            Potable), referred to later as the sector loan component,\n            for subprojects consisting of improvements and expansion of\n            water supply facilities in about 32 small centers; (iii)\n            construction of two regional water supply systems, in the\n            areas of Karia Ba Mohamed (about 7,300 inhabitants), and\n            Errachida-Erfoud-Rissani (170,000 inhabitants); (iv) the\n            development of water resources in some 24 centers; (v) the\n            acquisition of laboratory equipment, water meters, leak\n            detection equipment and materials, and equipment for\n            maintenance and surveys; and (vi) technical assistance,\n            training, and studies."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
