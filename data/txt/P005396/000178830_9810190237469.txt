THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                Kingdom of Morocco
Beneficiaries:           The Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP); the water
supply agencies (Regies) in the cities of Casablanca,
Fes, Marrakech, Meknes, Tetouan, Safi, Oujda, Tanger,
Rabat-Sal6, Taza and Kenitra, as well as other Regies
which may be agreed upon during project
implementation; the Hydraulics Department of the
Ministry of Equipment; and a government agency to be
designated sbortly.
Amount:                  The equivalent of US$87 million.
Terms:                   Seventeen years including four years, of grace, at an
interest rate of 9.6 percent per annum.
On-Lending
Arrangements:          The Government will onlend the proceeds of the loan
allocated to ONEP (about $45.8 million) and the Regies
(about $38.1 million) on terms identical to the
loan's, as in the financing plan below. The
Government would use the remaining $3.1 million for
the water resource development component and for the
rural water systems study.
Project
Description:           The primary objective of the project is to improve
access to safe water supply of the low income
population of at least 11 major towns and 80 smaller
centers, and to bring water or improved water supply
to the population around Karia Ba Mohamed and in'the
Ziz valley from Errachidia to Erfoud, as well as on
the Tafilalet plain around Rissani. The project
consists of: (i) revolving funds to finance credit
granted to low income households for house connections
in at least 11 major cities and about 80 other
population centers; (ii) a line of credit to ONEP,
referred to later as the sector loan component, for
subprojects consisting of improvements and expansion
of water supply facilities in about 32 small centers;
(iii) construction of two regional water supply
systems, in the areas of Karia Ba Mohamed (about 7,300

inhabitants), and Errachidia - Erfoud - Rissani
(170,000 inhabitants); (iv) the development of water
resources in some 24 centers; (v) the acquisition of
laboratory equipment, water meters, leak detection
equipment and materials, and eauipment for maintenance
and surveys; and (vi) technical assistance, training
and studies. The beneficiaries of the project would
consist of (i) approximately 1.6 million low income
inhabitants of the cities and other centers referred
to above, constituting about 275,000 households who
would finance their house connections through the
revolving funds financed under the loan; and (ii) some
600,000 people living in the small centers served by
the two regional systems or in the centers to benefit
from the sector loan component. The implementation of
the project does not pose any special risks.
Estimated Cost:           The total project cost is estimated at US$169 _
million apportioned as follows:

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO FOR A
THIRD WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Kingdom of Morocco for the equivalent of US$87 million to help finance
a third water supply project. The loan would have a term of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace, with interest at 9.6 percent per annum. The
Government would onlend on the same terms about US$45.8 million to the Office
National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP) and about US$38.1 million to the water
distributing Regies of Casablanca, Fez, Marrakech, Meknes, Tetouan, Safi,
Oujda, Tanger, Rabat-Sale, Taza and Kenitra, and possibly to other Regies to
be agreed upon, to finance mainly water supply systems and house connections
for low-income customers.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       A basic economic mission visited Morocco in November 1978, and
updating missions in September and December 1979 and in May 1980. A report
entitled "Morocco: Basic Economic Report" (3289-MOR) was distributed to the
Executive Directors in December 1980. Country and Economic Data Sheets are
attached as Annex I.
Introduction
3.       Compared with many developing countries, Morocco is well endowed with
natural resources. It has a considerable agricultural potential both in
irrigated and rainfed areas. The Atlantic and the Mediterranean coastlines
offer considerable fish resources. Morocco also has the world's largest and
most easily recoverable phosphate reserves, which makes the phosphate sector a
key export sector. Other minerals such as iron ore, manganese, lead and zinc
are also exported, but in much smaller amounts. Coal and hydropower plants
satisfy only a small part of the country's energy requirements, which are
essentially met with imported oil. Morocco has however uranium and oil shale
resources which it plans to exploit. In addition, Morocco's proximity to
Europe has favored trade, tourism and labor migration with the EEC countries.
4.       During the first 15 years after independence (1956), a conservative
approach to economic policy predominated in Morocco. GDP increased at an
average rate of 4% a year in the 1960s. Growth accelerated somewhat under the
1968-72 development plan as the economy derived substantial momentum from
exports. However, a relatively weak savings effort and a small externally
financed resource gap resulted in only a slow rise in the share of resources
allocated to investment. Morocco thus entered the 1970s with no major
financial imbalances, but a relatively limited growth capacity. Although some
industrialization had taken place, over half of the labor force was employed



-2-
in the relatively inefficient traditional agricultural sector, and primary
products accounted for close to 90% of merchandise exports, with phosphates
representing about a quarter of the total.
Economic Performance in the 1970s
5.       During the 1970s, economic policy became more ambitious.  The 1973-77
development plan aimed at an acceleration of economic growth, as well as an
improvement in income distribution. To accomplish this, the original plan
strategy included two key elements: an intensified savings effort and the
development of exports. However, in 1974, with the sudden jump in phosphate
prices, phosphate export earnings more than quadrupled. As a result of this
windfall, the value of merchandise exports doubled and budgetary receipts rose
by 70% between 1973 and 1974. Although the petroleum import bill also
quadrupled in 1974, the current account of the balance of payments remained in
surplus. The plan's concern for exports and savings lost some of its urgency,
and the Government launched a massive public investment program which brought
about a sharp acceleration in the rate of growth of the economy and a
considerable increase in demand for imported goods and services, whose share
in GDP doubled from 19% in 1972 to 39% in 1977.
6.       The phosphate boom, however, was shortlived.  As early as mid-1975,
phosphate exports started falling in both volume and value, and, until 1980,
Morocco was faced with declining prices for its major export. At the same
time, markets for other exports as well as for tourism and labor migration
were negatively affected by the world recession and restrictions imposed by
the EEC. Agricultural production and exports entered a period of prolonged
stagnation, and Morocco turned from a net exporter to a net importer of
foodstuffs. The growth of exports of goods and nonfactor services, which in
constant prices had exceeded 8% a year in 1968-72, was only 1% a year in
1973-77.
7.       Stimulated by the high investment level, a high GDP growth rate of
7.3% a year was achieved during the 1973-77 plan period. This growth was led
by the expansion of the construction and service sectors. The pattern of
investment, however, favored economic and social infrastructure more than the
productive sectors. In addition, public investments in industry, agriculture
and transport tended to be capital intensive and to emphasize import
substitution.
8.       Accelerated investment and growing public expenditures created strong
pressures on both the balance of payments and the government budget. While
investment jumped from about 15% of GDP in the early 1970s to 32% in 1977,
gross domestic savings rose briefly from 13% to 21% of GDP in 1974 thanks to
phosphate receipts, but fell back to 10-11% in 1976-77. The large resource
gap which emerged as early as 1975 rose to an unsustainable 20% of GDP in 1977
(in current prices). Morocco started borrowing heavily from the international
capital market, which led to rapid increases in external debt and the debt
service burden. By the end of 1977, external debt outstanding was close to
40% of GDP. The debt service ratio rose from 5.6% of exports of goods and
services in 1975 to 10.7% in 1977, and 18.5% in 1978.



- 3 -
9.       The Government's overall budget position deteriorated considerably
during the period 1973-77. While budgetary revenues increased rapidly as a
result of the windfall phosphate profits in 1974 and 1975 and of the growth of
import duties and taxes in following years (reaching 23% of GDP in 1977), the
growth of expenditure far exceeded that of revenues. Total budgetary outlays
rose from 20% of GDP in 1972 to nearly 42% in 1977, in response to a number of
pressures. These included not only the large scale of the public investment
program launched under the plan, but also a rapid increase in defense spending
in response to growing tensions in the Western Sahara, and the acceleration of
current expenditure for social programs (particularly education). As a
result, the Government's overall budget deficit increased sharply, reaching
peaks of 17 and 18% of GDP in 1976 and 1977. The expansionary monetary and
fiscal policies pursued during the period led to some acceleration of domestic
inflation, but excess demand was largely allowed to spill over into the
external sector.
Recent Developments
10.      In order to redress the rapidly deteriorating financial situation,
the Moroccan Government in 1978 adopted a three-year stabilization program,
characterized by a substantial retrenchment of investment and import levels.
In 1978, the first year of the adjustment, public investment was cut back by
nearly half in real terms and the growth of current budgetary expenditure held
down to about 13% (or less than 3% in real terms). These measures of fiscal
restraint were combined with tight credit policies and stringent import
controls. As a result, the overall budget deficit declined to about 12% of
GDP and the external payments situation improved considerably in 1978. Since
then, however, the stabilization program encountered a number of obstacles,
including poor barvests, petroleum price increases and the rise in interest on
the commercial debt. In addition, internal pressures led to some relaxation
of the highly restrictive fiscal policy adopted in 1978. Although the economy
continued to make progress toward equilibrium, by 1980 both fiscal and
external imbalances were still substantial. The resource gap (in current
prices) remained at about 10% of GDP and the ratio of the overall budget
deficit to GDP at about 11%.
11.      The reduction in the Government deficit during the 1978-80 period was
achieved chiefly through cutbacks in the level of budgetary investments, which
dropped from 22% of GDP in 1977 to 12% in 1980. The growth of current
expenditure proved difficult to restrain because of the continuing need to
maintain defense and social expenditures, the growing interest payments on the
public debt and the rising cost of consumption subsidies. The latter tripled
in 1979-80 reaching 2% of GDP, as the raises in prices of subsidized staple
food and petroleum products could not catch up with the rise in import costs
for these products. Reflecting these pressures, the growth of current
expenditure accelerated to 16% in 1979 and 22% in 1980. Substantial increases
in food and petroleum prices in late 1980 and early 1981 should now make it
possible to contain consumption subsidies in 1981. With the help of economies
in other areas, the Government's plan is to hold the growth of current outlays
to 11% in 1981.



12.      In the external sector, non-oil imports were reduced substantially
and remained below the 1977 level in nominal terms due to a sharp reduction in
capital goods imports (by about two-thirds in real terms between 1977 and
1980). Oil imports on the other hand increased 2.5 times in value due to
price increases. Export earnings improved in 1979 and 1980 and received a
significant boost from the recovery of phosphate prices in 1980. Thus,
despite a large increase in the petroleum import bill (from less than $400
million in 1977 to over $1 billion in 1980) and a rise in external debt
interest payments by about $350 million between 1977 and 1980, the current
account deficit was reduced from $1.8 billion, or 18% of GDP, in 1977 to about
$1.4 billion, or 8% of GDP, in 1980. The growth of external borrowing slowed
considerably during the period. However, the absolute level of gross external
capital requirements, after declining significantly in 1978, has risen because
of growing amortization payments on medium-term commercial credits contracted
earlier.
13.      The budgetary and balance-of-payments constraints had a serious
impact on the levels of investment and economic activity. Annual GDP growth
dropped to about 3% in both 1978 and 1979. In 1980, GDP growth is estimated
to have risen to about 6%, largely because of favorable weather, increased
exports and some recovery of investment in the private sector. The adverse
impact of the stabilization program on employment has probably been
substantial. A rapid rate of employment creation had been one of the major
achievements of the 1973-77 period. Since then, the growth of employment is
estimated to have slowed down significantly. On the whole, the demand
management policies followed since 1978 have had a high cost in terms of
growth and employment and appear to have been only partly successful in their
short-term stabilization objectives.   Moreover, during this period the
pressures of the short-term financial disequilibrium did not allow the
Government to address adequately the long-term structural weaknesses which are
at the root of the continuing financial imbalances in the Moroccan economy,
and which must be corrected if an acceptable rate of economic growth is to be
achieved without unsustainable external deficits.
Medium Term Prospects
14.      Projectionsl of the likely outcome of the continuation of past
policies without concerted effort to implement major structural reforms
suggest that Morocco would be faced with a prolonged period of slow growth,
rising unemployment and continued large external imbalances which would keep
the country in considerable dependence on external borrowing and could
jeopardize its creditworthiness. To forestall such a deterioration, the
Government adopted a strategy in the forthcoming 5-year development plan for
1981-85 which aims at narrowing the external resource gap while accelerating
growth and spreading the benefits of growth more widely. The main objectives
are to achieve a significant increase in domestic savings and exports, a
1/ For details on these Bank projections, see Morocco - Basic Economic
Report, December 30, 1980 (No. 3289-MOR), Chapter III.

reduction in the elasticity of imports with respect to GDP, and a rise in
productivity and the employment rate. The Plan's projections show that, if
achieved, such changes would permit a gradual acceleration of annual GDP
growth to 6.5% p.a., somewbat higher than Bank projections, in 1981-85,
accompanied by a reduction of the resource gap to about 7% in 1985.
15.      The containment of imports would result in part from the substitution
of imports of food products (cereals, sugar, vegetable oil, meat and dairy
products) to be brought about by an acceleration of the rate of growth of
agricultural production. This will require a wide range of institutional
reforms in addition to a review of prices of certain inputs and outputs, and a
greater allocation of resources to rainfed areas and to projects with high
rates of return. The Government also intends to follow a determined policy in
1981-85 in the area of energy conservation, including in particular the
maintenance of domestic energy prices at high levels, and making the necessary
investment allocations to increase energy production from local sources.
16.      An essential role in the achievement of the Plan's objective will
have to be played by export promotion aimed at exploiting Morocco's
comparative advantage as regards phosphates and phosphate derivatives as well
as the current favorable export prospects for manufactured goods, agricultural
products and tourism. Exports of goods and nonfactor services are expected to
rise at 8.5% p.a. in real terms over 1981-85. While feasible, such a growth
rate would require implementation of the supporting investments and incentives
policies.
17.      Narrowing the resource gap wbile maintaining at the same time high
investment levels would require an increase in domestic savings as well as
rationalization of the pattern and content of investment. A vigorous recovery
in domestic savings, which would rise from 11.5% of GDP in 1980 to 16% by 1985
would make it possible to narrow gradually the resource gap from about 10% in
1980 to 5% of GDP by 1985. Such a rise in the domestic savings rate would
exceed the performance in 1973-77 when savings averaged 14% of GDP. It would
demand intensive efforts to increase public savings (through an increase in
budgetary savings and an improvement in the performance of public enterprises)
and to stimulate private savings (througb a revision of interest rates and
improvements in financial intermediation).
18.      Given the feasible level of investment, the future rate of growth of
the economy will depend to a large extent on the sectoral allocation and the
efficiency of investment as well as institutional reforms. Under the Plan,
the Government will start fewer large capital-intensive projects and pay
particular attention to the allocation of investments to priority subsectors.
Priority is given to projects that are export oriented, less capital intensive
and which use a greater proportion of domestic resources. In addition,
particular attention will be paid by the Government to manpower planning and
to the employment effect of investments in order to ensure that unemployment
would not rise.

Social Development
19.      Comparatively slow economic growth and employment creation up to the
early 1970s were accompanied by widening income disparities. The limited data
available indicate that in the 1970s, while disparities have continued to
grow, household incomes increased in both urban and rural areas, and the lower
income groups shared in the real increase in incomes. In addition, infant
mortality has declined and life expectancy has increased, both significantly.
More recently, partly in response to the demands of locally elected
assemblies, the Government has shown more awareness of social problems and
greater interest in the issue of basic needs. Social expenditures have been
at a high level in recent years, accounting for more than half current
outlays. However, social indicators still appear to be at low levels in
Morocco. The limited effectiveness of past social policies in reaching the
lower income groups, especially in rural areas, is increasingly recognized as
a major issue, and the new strategy of the 1981-85 Development Plan emphasizes
rural development in rainfed areas, where most of the poorest households in
Morocco currently live, and improved mechanisms to deliver services to meet
basic needs at an affordable cost, especially in rural areas. An effort is
also being made to increase the involvement of local communities in providing
basic needs, particularly for sites and services for low cost housing, water
supply, sewerage and electrification. Although rapid results cannot be
expected in any of these areas, implementation of these policies would help
meet the needs of low-income groups, while holding down the budgetary cost of
social programs.
External Debt and Debt Service
20.      Morocco sharply increased external borrowings after 1974.  Nearly all
of the increase came from Arab and commercial sources. Morocco also drew on
the IMF automatic credit facilities in early 1976, and obtained about $70
million in IMF compensatory financing in August 1978. Agreement was reached
with the IMF in 1980 for Morocco to draw on the Extended Fund Facility (EFF);
the agreement provided for the use of IMF resources in the amount of SDR 810
million over the 1980-83 period, an amount subsequently increased to SDR 956
million ($1.2 billion).
21.      From the low levels of 1974-75, Morocco's external debt rose rapidly
to an estimated $7.0 billion (disbursed only) by December 1980. Debt service
amounted to $800 million in 1979 and over $1 billion in 1980 (22 and 24%,
respectively, of total exports of goods and services). As a result of recent
and projected borrowings, debt and debt service may be expected to remain
close to 23 percent in the early 1980s; it may rise to about 25% or drop to
about 21% by 1985 depending on the success of the Plan's export drive and
containment of imports. Because of the growing burden of debt service,
external borrowing has become more restrictive and selective since 1978. If
debt service is to stay manageable, Morocco will have to continue this policy
over the next few years. Limits on commercial borrowing have been agreed
within the framework of the Extended Facility arrangement with the IMF, and
efforts should be continued to seek loans on softer terms.



- 7 -
22.      Loan commitments from multilateral and bilateral official sources to
Morocco rose from $205 million in 1975 to $1376 million in 1978. Since then,
they have averaged $700-800 million a year (excluding grants). Major sources
of aid were France, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the U.S., Germany and the Bank
Group. At the end of 1979, the Bank Group's share in Morocco's outstanding
and disbursed external public debt was 8.4 percent. The share of the Bank
Group in debt service was 21 percent in 1976 and declined to 15 percent in
1977, and 8 percent in 1979. By 1985 the Bank Group's shares in debt
outstanding and in debt service are projected at about 10 percent and 11
percent respectively.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
23.      Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 49 projects, financing
a total of $1,607.9 million (net of cancellations), of which $l,122 million
has been lent since the beginning of FY1975. IDA credits, totalling $50
million, have been made available for five projects. A Third Window loan for
$25 million for the third education project was approved in March 1976. IFC
investments have amounted to $43.8 million ($26.7 million after cancellations,
terminations, repayments and sales). Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1981, and notes on
the execution of ongoing IBRD/IDA projects. In some cases delays in project
implementation have been caused by management problems and budgetary
constraints; however, overall performance in project execution has been
improving and is satisfactory. Total disbursements as of December 31, 1980,
amounted to 63 percent of original appraisal forecasts, and 71 percent of
revised forecasts.
24.      Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the agricultural and
industrial sectors, which have accounted for 33 and 22 percent respectively of
total commitments; the balance is represented by utilities (13 percent),
education (10 percent), tourism (10 percent), roads (6 percent), energy
(3 percent) and urban development (3 percent). While limited as regards the
transfer of resources to Morocco (Bank Group gross disbursements amounted to
2.2 percent of total fixed investment during the 1973-77 Plan period), the
main objectives of Bank lending in the early years of Bank operations in
Morocco were to foster and strengthen development institutions, provide
technical assistance, especially for project preparation, and increase
productive capacity, in order to improve the balance of payments.
25.      While these objectives remain, over the last few years Bank lending
has increasingly focussed on supporting a number of policy objectives: to
promote exports and other foreign-exchange earning activities; to reduce
imports, particularly of food and energy; to lower unit costs for the delivery
of basic services, widen their distribution among regions and increase access
by lower-income groups; and to increase employment and improve income
distribution.



26.      Since FY1975, lending in agriculture has emphasized improvement in
the productivity of rainfed agriculture and livestock, which employ over 80
percent of the rural population, primarily small farmers. The Fes-Karia-Tissa
Agriculture Project, approved in June 1978, directly addresses these
objectives in the favorable cereal producing zone. The Loukkos project,
approved in May 1980, extends support of these objectives to a less favorably
endowed region and finances investments for agricultural development, erosion
control, forestry and livestock. It should have a significant poverty impact
and address major issues in developing Morocco's relatively densely populated
but poorly endowed mountainous regions. Continued Bank support of rainfed
agriculture is expected to be provided through an extensive livestock project
in central Morocco and an integrated rural development project in the
Khemisset province, both under preparation. A fourth line of credit to CNCA
has helped provide credit to small and medium farmers, and a fifth project is
under preparation.   Increased export earnings are expected to result from a
Bank-supported project for fruit and vegetable marketing and production, as
well as from a project currently under preparation to improve the efficiency
of the coastal fishing industry.
27.      Increased foreign exchange earnings or savings and, more recently,
job creation, have been the key objectives of Bank projects in industry and
tourism. A fourth line of credit to CIH for tourism projects was recently
approved by the Executive Directors, in a sector which has contributed a
substantial share of Morocco's foreign exchange earnings and provided
significant employment. A loan to the Government and to the Banque Nationale
pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE), planned for presentation to the Board
in mid 1981, will incorporate a pilot component for export-oriented industries
and a substantial component for small-scale industries to replenish the
successful first line of credit for this purpose approved in FY1979; this
component is expected to generate increased employment opportunities. A
project to increase the incomes of artisanal and small-scale miners in
southeastern Morocco, a region largely bypassed by previous development
efforts, is also scheduled to be presented to the Board shortly.
28.      Projects to improve basic infrastructure and services have
concentrated on improving the efficiency of existing investments and extending
services to rural and low-income urban groups, whicb is the principal
objectives of the project presented in this report. A second urban
development project was recently submitted to the Executive Directors, and
would continue to support the Government's efforts to provide shelter, basic
services and employment to low-income urban families. A third highway project
approved in FY1980 supported the Government's road maintenance efforts and a
fourth project would continue support for maintenance and improve rural access
roads. A loan for village electrification approved in FY1979 will help bring
power to over a hundred small towns and villages. In addition, a project to
strengthen the capacity of local communities to prepare and implement their
own development programs and provide financing for such programs through the
Communal Infrastructure Fund (FEC) is being prepared. It will not only help
to widen the distribution of infrastructure and services but will also support
the Government's policy of encouraging administrative decentralization and
local participation.



- 9 -
29.      Education continues to need attention to ensure Morocco's manpower
development. While recent projects have focussed on secondary level technical
education and teacher training, attention has also been given to expanding
basic education in the rural areas and ensuring a greater orientation in
primary schooling towards practical training. This would be complemented by
future projects in non-formal education and vocational training. The
Government's recent policy supporting primary health care would be tested
through a project currently being prepared as a first phase in a nationwide
program to reorganize medical and paramedical training, health education,
nutrition, environmental sanitation and family planning services, especially
in rural areas.
30.      In order to reduce the impact of the oil import burden on the
Moroccan economy, a project was approved in April 1980 that would contribute
to the Government's efforts to accelerate the exploration and development of
its petroleum potential. Preparation is also underway of an Engineering Loan
to finance studies and a pilot unit to test the potential for commercial
extraction of oil from oil shale.
31.      The sectoral objectives implied in these projects as well as other
objectives relating to price policy, efficiency and composition of the public
sector investment program, and measures to mobilize domestic savings, would be
reinforced by the policy changes envisaged under the first Structural
Adjustment Loan which is planned for consideration by the Executive Directors
in the near future.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Background
32.      Water is generally scarce in Morocco.  Rainfall is unevenly
distributed over the seasons, as are water resources among the regions. The
pressure of demand on these limited water resources is rising: population is
increasing at about 3 percent per year; more land is brought under irrigation
every year in an attempt to stem Morocco's widening food deficit, and industry
is growing fairly rapidly. Domestic consumption accounts for about 3.7
percent of the total use of water, agriculture for 94 percent and industry for
2.3 percent.
33.      Growth of demand for domestic consumption is fastest in urban areas,
which in 1980 accounted for about 9.3 million or 47 percent of Morocco's total
population of approximately 20 million, making Morocco one of the most
urbanized countries in Africa. Rural migration adds significantly to the
natural rate of population increase in cities, bringing the urban growth rate
to 4.8 percent per year, against 1.8 percent in rural areas. While most of
the growth has taken place in the large agglomerations along the Atlantic
coast, the pattern is shifting towards the mid-size cities in the interior.



- 10 -
34.      Piped water is available in all cities, but only about 45 percent of
households are connected to the water supply systems, some of which date back
to the middle ages. The remainder of the population draws water at public
standpipes, mosques, and from neighbors, or purchases it from street vendors.
In some underpriviledged areas such as recently established shanty towns,
public multifaucet standpipes often serve more than 2,000 consumers at walking
distances of sometimes over 500 meters. In rural areas, about 25 percent of
the population has access to public water supply; 10 percent from public
wells, 10 percent from public standpipes and 5 percent from individual
connections to a public network; the remaining 75 percent depend on
traditional sources, water vendors, private wells or rainwater storage tanks,
all of which can cause grave health hazards because of bacteriological
contamination sometimes compounded by inadequate waste disposal systems.
Sewerage exists in all medium and large cities, but is generally inadequate;
only one third of the population is connected to sewers, there are no sewage
treatment facilities and the networks discharge raw sewage into rivers,
streams or the sea, creating severe health hazards. Few sewer systems are
available to the smaller cities and rural population.
Sector Organization
35.      The study and development of water resources is the responsibility of
the Hydraulics Department of the Ministry of Equipment which is also in charge
of the operation, maintenance and control of all major dams. A special
commission in the Prime Minister's office determines the allocation of water
resources among the various users. The responsibility for production and
distribution of potable water lies with different agencies mostly depending on
the location of the system (urban, semi-rural or rural) but partly resulting
from historical institutional developments in the sector. Sixteen autonomous
municipal agencies called Regies ensure water as well as electricity
distribution in nearly all large cities and operate water production
facilities dating from before 1972. Indeed, the Office National de l'Eau
Potable (ONEP) was created in that year under the aegis of the Ministry of
Equipment for the development, production and tranmission of water to the
urban centers. It is by far the largest organization in the sector and among
other tasks mainly sells water in bulk to the Regies. Municipal water supply
systems in urban areas which are not operated by a Regie are run either by
ONEP or by municipal services. ONEP is also responsible for water supply
systems in administratively chartered centers with a total of about
1.5 million inhabitants; the Ministry of Agriculture covers the population of
about 10.7 million living in rural areas, where it finances investments and
assists in the operation of the systems. Sewerage, where it exists, is
operated by the municipalities, although in order to remedy institutional
weaknesses in the operation of the systems the Government is planning in some



- 11 -
cases to add sewerage to the responsibilities of the Regies. The Government
encourages the creation of new Regies in municipalities in which ONEP operates
the distribution network in order to enable ONEP to concentrate more on bulk
production and transmission of water.
36.      Effective cooperation between the various agencies operating in the
sector helps overcome the complexity of institutional arrangements. However,
in order to rationalize sector management and in particular to avoid having
responsibilities overlap, a study on the organization of the sector will be
financed under the loan; it will be carried out by ONEP with the assistance of
consultants and under the supervision of the Prime Minister's Office (see
paragraphs 50 and 55).
37.      ONEP.  Since its establishment in 1972 under the First Water Supply
Project (Loan 850-MOR), ONEP has taken great strides: water sales increased
from 66 million m3 in 1972 to 205 million in 1980; over the period, staff
increased from 1,300 to 2,733, and ONEP's dependence on foreign technical
assistance considerably diminished, from 51 expatriates to 12. ONEP, which is
an autonomous public enterprise commercially run, is now a mature institution
with good technical capability and management, a competitive salary structure,
and an effective training program to help it meet its growing needs for
qualified staff. The main institutional areas in which the project will
assist ONEP further are in developing a management information system and cost
accounting, and in strengthening its planning, design and operations
divisions, for which the loan would help finance respectively two and three
expert advisers to work within the organization and train ONEP staff. ONEP
will recruit these experts by November 30, 1981 (Project Agreement, Section
2.02 (a) (iii)). The project would also build up ONEP's capacity to select,
prepare, appraise and execute water supply projects through the implementation
of the sector loan component of the project and of the two regional water
supply systems (see paragraphs 48, 49, 52 and 53), both witb limited
assistance from consultants. It will also enhance ONEP's ability to monitor
water quality and the operation of water supply systems (see paragraph 50).
Financial policies in the sector
38.      Tariff policies in the sector are governed by two general
principles: (i) water revenues should be sufficient to recover, discounted at
an appropriate rate, all operating, maintenance and administrative expenses,
as well as the cost of investments required for the renewal and expansion of
water production and distribution systems, over their useful economic life;
and (ii) the tariff structure should provide for concessionary rates for basic
domestic consumption levels (currently set at 30 m3/connection/quarter).
39.      In practice, current tariffs were established in 1977 following a
comprehensive review of the long-term cost of developing water resources.
Although the study recommended yearly adjustments for inflation, the tariffs
have not been adjusted since. The current tariffs have resulted so far in a
satisfactory overall financial rate of return in the sector of more than 7
percent of net fixed assets, taking into account other charges levied in the
sector such as connection charges and customer contributions.



- 12 -
40.      Current bulk and retail water tariffs, as well as the very high
charges levied on customers prior to connection ($485 in 1980) 1/, have
ensured a very sound financial position for the Regies, which have been able
to finance between 80 and 100 percent of their investments out of their own
resources. As for ONEP, it agreed under the second project (loan 1724-MOR) to
reach a financial rate of return of no less than 2 percent on net fixed assets
until 1980, 5 percent in 1981, and 7 percent from 1982 onwards. Calculations
made so far indicate the minimum rate of return was met in 1980, but in the
absence of a tariff increase it will not be met in 1981. ONEP is financially
viable: the sale of water in bulk to the Regies is profitable, and the
operating losses incurred in small and expensive systems it operates on behalf
of mostly rural municipalities, are compensated by Government contributions to
the financing of its investment program, which the Government finances in turn
mostly out of taxes collected in the sector.
41.      Under the project, an effort has been made to better distinguish
between tariff and financial policies to be applied by the Government to the
sector as a whole, and the financial viability of the main institutions in the
sector. On the one hand, the Government has agreed to maintain the policies
outlined in paragraph 38 (Loan Agreement, Section 4.06); on the other hand,
instead of the minimum financial rates of return outlined above, ONEP will
maintain from 1982 onwards a working ratio of at most 66 percent to ensure,
with a margin of safety, that ONEP has a positive cash flow. In addition ONEP
will maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.3. Finally, by the
end of October in each year starting in 1981, ONEP will establish a forecast
of its revenues, operating expenditures and efficiency indicators for the next
year in order for the Government to review the adequacy of existing tariffs
(Project Agreement, Sections 4.03, 4.04 (c), and 4.05). As for the Regies,
current connection charges and customer contributions will ensure that their
financial position remains strong.
42.      In order to compensate for inflation incurred since 1977, when the
current water tariffs were implemented, and to enable ONEP to meet its minimum
financial performance obligations, adjustments in water tariffs will be
required soon. The Prime Minister has recently establisbed a special
commission to make proposals for tariff increases before the end of the year.
The Government is planning to implement a first round of increases later this
year and, if necessary, a further round in 1982.
1/       Connection charges are set at estimated connection costs, which
averaged the equivalent of $200 in 1980. Customer contributions are
assessed according to plot surface (Regies) or to frontage (ONEP);
they averaged the equivalent of $285.



- 13 -
Sector priorities and previous Bank lending
43.      Investments carried out so far in the sector have largely favored
urban over than rural consumers, large cities over small cities, and middle
income over poor families. On the other hand, this pattern has allowed to
extend maximum coverage of water supply services out of limited budget
resources; economies of scale generally ensure that in larger cities, more
consumers can be connected for a given level of investment than in a smaller
city or in rural areas where dwellings are dispersed, and middle-income
consumers can make (and have made) large financial contributions to the
expansion of the distribution sytems. For the future, investment needs for
the development of water resources and for further expansion of the
distribution networks remain high: it is estimated that in order to maintain
current service levels for a growing population, or alternatively to increase
them to individual connection rates of 75 percent of urban consumers (with the
balance of urban consumers and 75 percent of rural consumers served by
standpipes) by the year 2000, capital expenditures would be required of 3 and
7 percent respectively of gross fixed investment, or 0.6 and 1.5 percent of
CNP. In recent years, greater emphasis has been given to serving low-income
urban consumers and to investing in water supply systems in smaller population
centers, a policy which the Bank has fully supported.
44.      Three Bank loans have been provided so far in the sector.  The first
loan for $48 million (Loan 850-MOR) in FY1972 helped finance water production
facilities along the Mid-Atlantic Coast and establish ONEP as an efficient
institution. Disbursements were completed in June 1980. An engineering loan
of $1.5 million (Loan S-7 MOR) in FY1977 helped finance the preparation of a
feasibility study for sewerage facilities of the Casablanca Mohammedia area.
The study started in May 1980 after an initial delay of 15 months. The
project executing agency is the municipality of Casablanca. A third loan of
$49 million (Loan 1724-MOR) in FY1979 aimed at increasing the water production
facilities along the Mid-Atlantic Coast and setting up a revolving fund within
the Regies of Casablanca, Rabat-Sa1e and Kenitra to grant credit facilities to
low income customers for payment of the cost of house connections and related
charges. Execution of the projects has been satisfactory, except for the
delay incurred in starting the sewerage feasibility study under the
engineering loan.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
45.      The project, which would be the Bank's fourth operation in the
sector, was prepared by ONEP and the "Direction des Collectivit6s Locales" in
the Ministry of Interior. It was appraised in November 1980. Negotiations
took place in Washington between April 6 and 15, 1981. The Moroccan
delegation was led by Mr. Belkoura, of the Prime Minister's Office. A Staff
Appraisal Report entitled "Kingdom of Morocco - Third Water Supply Project"
(No. 3339a-MOR, dated April 24, 1981) is being distributed separately.
Supplementary project data are provided in Annex III; a Loan and Project
Summary is provided at the beginning of the report, and map No. 15497R
(attached) displays the location of project activities.

Project Objectives
46.      The project will provide greatly improved access to safe water for
the low-income residents of the largest cities, and to the population of
smaller and remoter centers bypassed by earlier investments. The project will
also pursue the institutional development of ONEP undertaken by the two
earlier projects and help build up further ONEP management, enhance its
ability to monitor water quality and manage water supply systems, as well as
provide improved capability in the sector to develop water resources and to
plan and prepare investments, particularly in the rural areas.
Project Description
47.      To enable low-income households to finance the cost of house
connections, which have to be paid in full before the connection is made (see
paragraph 40), the revolving funds set up under the Second Water Supply
Project and which met with strong demand will be extended from three to at
least eleven major cities and to the population centers served by ONEP, which
number about 80. The three original cities are Casablanca, Rabat-Sald and
Kenitra, to which would be added Fes, Marrakech, Meknes, Tetouan, Safi, Oujda,
Tanger and Taza, as well as other Regies which may apply during project
implementation and would have been selected by the Government and the Bank.
Households applying to borrow from one of the revolving funds would have to
have a family income of less than DH 1,500 ($357) per month in 1980 prices and
would have to meet other eligibility criteria such as the classification of
their zone of residency (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, paragraph I (i)).
48.      Under the project, a line of credit, referred to as the sector loan
component, would be extended to ONEP for the financing of subprojects
consisting of the expansion or upgrading of about 32 water supply systems in
agreed locations, on the basis of appraisal reports prepared by ONEP following
an agreed format. Subprojects costing less than DH5 million ($1.2 million) in
1980 prices and satisfying agreed criteria wbich would exclude those for which
the cost per capita is highest, would be deemed eligible for financing under
the loan, while others would have to receive prior approval by the Bank on the
basis of the appraisal reports (Project Agreement, Schedule, paragraph
4 (b)). It is estimated that subprojects accounting for about 60 percent of
the sector loan will be subject to prior approval.
49.      The project also comprises two regional water supply systems:  one
for the area of Karia Ba Mohammed, which would serve about 7,300 people, which
consists of water pumping, treatment, transmission and storage facilities; and
one for an area about 100 km long in the Ziz valley between Errachidia and
Erfoud and the Tafilalet plain around Rissani, with a population of about
170,000, where a new water supply system would replace and expand the existing
water supply system which is insufficient and contaminated.



- 15 -
50.      Smaller components of the project would consist of i) water resource
development, mostly well development and testing, in about 24 agreed
localities, in order to determine the availability of water; ii) acquisition
of equipment for water quality control, water metering, leak detection,
maintenance and surveys; iii) technical assistance for the establishment of
management information and cost accounting systems, the strengthening of
ONEP's planning, design and operations divisions, and for training,
particularly in water treatment and quality control techniques; and iv) three
studies, one on the organization of the water supply sector, one on the
identification, selection, operation and maintenance of water supply systems
in rural areas, and one to update and enlarge the master plan for meeting the
water demand in 2010 on the Mid-Atlantic coast between Safi and Kenitra.
Project Implementation
51.      The house connection revolving funds will be managed by the Regies
operating the water supply systems in the eleven or more major cities and by
ONEP in the localities for which it is responsible. Installation of the
connections will be realized under force account. Before being allowed to
draw on the amount of the loan allocated to it, each Regie will have to enter
into i) a subsidiary loan agreement with the Government providing for the
credit conditions to be offered to customers, their eligibility criteria and
the mechanism of the revolving fund, all agreed with the Bank; and ii) a loan
agreement with Fonds d'Equipement Communal (FEC), an autonomous lending agency
which lends to municipalities and will finance the local cost component of the
scheme (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 (d); Schedule 1, paragraph 5 (ii); and
Schedule 4). On the other hand, to ensure that sufficient water resources
will be available to meet the additional needs of the Regies related to their
house connection program, the Government will make available to ONEP
sufficient funds to allow it to undertake the necessary water resource
development projects, which all figure in its current investment program (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.08), and which ONEP has' confirmed it would implement
(Project Agreement, Section 2.10). The subsidiary loans are expected to be
disbursed from early 1982 to end 1985.
52.      ONEP is responsible for the implementation of the sector loan
component. It has already appraised four of the subprojects. All subprojects
have been identified, the availability of water resources has been checked and
the design standards have been reviewed by Bank staff and were found
satisfactory. ONEP is fully competent to execute this component with limited
outside assistance for specialized tasks. Work is expected to be executed
from 1982 to mid-1986.
53.      The two regional water supply systems were prepared by ONEP which has
initiated their final design. Limited outside assistance for specialized
tasks will also be required in order to complete final design, prepare bid
documents and help ONEP supervise execution. Furthermore, the Government will
help ensure that agreement will be reached by December 31, 1982 between ONEP
and the appropriate local authorities, on the operation and maintenance of the
systems and on the procedures for collection of water charges (Loan Agreement,



- 16 -
Section 3.07; Project Agreement, Section 2.04). These administrative
arrangements are expected to serve as models for water supply systems in rural
areas and help replicate similar projects on a larger scale. The smaller
system (Karia Ba Mohamed) is expected to be executed from 1983 to mid-1984,
and the larger system (Errachidia-Erfoud-Rissani), from late 1982 to mid-1985.
54.      The Hydraulics Department of the Ministry of Equipment will execute
the program for development of local water resources in about 24 agreed
locations; it is fully familiar with this type of task. ONEP is planning to
set up four laboratories for testing of water quality in different regions.
55.      As indicated earlier, ONEP will carry out the first study which
relates to sector organization (see paragraph 36); consultants for the study
will be hired by January 1, 1982, the study will be made available to the Bank
for comments, and the Government will take the measures it deems appropriate
on the basis of its review by June 30, 1983 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03 (b),
Project Agreement, Section 2.03 (a) and (b)); ONEP will also be responsible
for the second study which consists of an update of the water supply master
plan for the Mid-Atlantic coast between Safi and Kenitra. Consultants will be
hired by January 1, 1982 and the final design for a first phase project,
including the preparation of bid documents, will be completed by December 31,
1984 (Project Agreement, Section 2.03 (a) and (c)). Finally, the study
relating to water supply systems in rural areas will be executed by a
government agency to be designated shortly. Consultants will be hired by
December 31, 1981 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03 (a)). Draft terms of
reference for the three studies were reviewed during negotiations.
Project costs and financing plan
56.      Total project cost is estimated at DH 710 million ($169 million), of
which DH 365 million ($87 million), or 52 percent, in foreign exchange. The
detailed breakdown of cost estimates is provided in the Loan and Project
Summary. Cost estimates were prepared on the basis of recent international
and local bid awards in Morocco. Base cost estimates are stated in March 1981
prices. Physical contingencies were set at 10 percent. Price escalation
rates were used of 11 percent in 1981, 9 percent in 1982 and 8 percent per
year thereafter, both for domestic and for international prices. Because it
consists of a credit facility, no provisions for cost escalation were made for
the bouse connection component. Custom duties and applicable local taxes,
estimated at $7.2 million, are included in the base cost estimate. Total
technical assistance needs are estimated at 710 man-months of which 590 would
be for consultant services for the three studies, for the sector loan
component, and for the regional water supply systems, at an average cost of
$8,500 per man-month. The remaining 120 man-months would be for the five
expert advisers to ONEP (see paragraph 37), at an estimated cost of $10,000
per man-month.
57.      The loan, which covers the full estimated foreign exchange cost of
the project, would be made to the Government, with a term of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace, at 9.6 percent interest per annum. The Government



- 1 7 -
would onlend on the same terms about $45.8 million to ONEP and about $38.1
million to the Regies, the detailed allocation of which is indicated in the
Loan and Project Summary. The onlending rate of interest is higher than the
estimated long-term rate of inflation in Morocco of 8 percent per annum. $8.1
million, or about 16 percent of the proceeds of the loan earmarked for house
connections, will be allocated during project execution either to additional
Regies which may apply to join the eleven original Regies and would have been
selected by the Government and the Bank, or to Regies planning to increase
their original targets for house connections. Loans from FEC will cover the
local cost of the house connection program; they will have an amortization
period identical to the Bank loan's, and carry interest at 8.5 percent per
annum. Effectiveness of the Government's subsidiary loan agreement with ONEP
would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (Loan Agreement, Section
6.01), and effectiveness of each Regie's subsidiary loan agreement with the
Government and of its loan from FEC, will be a condition of disbursement of
its share of the Bank's loan (see paragraph 51). The Government will assume
the foreign exchange risk. The local cost of the sector loan component and of
the regional water supply systems will be financed by equity contributions
made by the Government, which will also finance any cost overruns (Loan
Agreement, Sections 3.01 (b) and 3.02 (a)). The local cost of the studies
will be met by ONEP and by the Government, according to the responsiblity for
carrying them out. The local cost of the other project components will be met
by the Government.
58.      Credit to low income households for house connections would be
extended by the Regies for five and one half years, at an interest rate equal
to the average of the Bank loan's and FEC's, weighted according to their share
in the financing. As a measure of affordability, recurrent charges for house
connections represent in most cases about 4 percent of family income,
depending on how many families share a connection. The success of the scheme
under the second project shows that families are willing to bear these costs
to gain access to water supply.
Procurement and disbursement
59.      The installation of the house connections will be executed by force
account, as is generally done in utilities. Materials and equipment would be
procured through international competitive bidding, according to the Bank's
guidelines. However, for equipment contracts of less than $250,000 each,
procurement would take place after local competitive bidding following
procedures acceptable to the Bank, with aggregate limits of $1.5 million each
for ONEP and the three Regies with the largest allocations. As for the other
project components, contracts for civil works or equipment would as a rule be
procured through international competitive bidding according to the Bank's
guidelines. However, contracts for civil works and equipment estimated to
cost less than $1 million and $250,000 each, respectively, and for an
aggregate amount not exceeding $12 million and $2.5 million, respectively,
would be procured through local competitive bidding following procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. In all, international competitive bidding



- 18 -
procedures according to the Bank's Guidelines will be used for at least 54 and
73 percent of the amounts of the contracts for equipment and civil works,
respectively, which would be financed under the loan. Many foreign suppliers
and contractors are represented in Morocco and will be able to compete
effectively for the contracts which would be procured through local
competitive bidding and these contracts would not be expected to attract
foreign suppliers and contractors which are not currently represented in
Morocco. The qualifications and experience of consultants, expert advisers or
consulting firms required for the project, as well as their terms and
conditions of employment, will have to be satisfactory to the Bank.
60.      The Bank loan would cover the full foreign exchange cost of the
project, on the basis of actual expenditures in foreign exchange or on the
basis of the estimated foreign exchange content of expenditures in local
currency, as follows:
a)   36 percent of the cost of civil works and of the construction of
pipelines for the sector loan component and the regional water supply
systems;
b)   54 percent of the cost of equipment procured locally for the sector
loan component and for the two regional water supply systems;
c)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 54 percent of local
expenditures for the equipment and materials purchased by ONEP for
water quality control, etc.;
d)   45 percent of total expenditures for water resource development;
e)   100 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 50 percent of the local
cost of consultants, expert advisers and of training; and
f)   65 percent of the remaining cost of house connections after having
applied the net proceeds generated by the revolving funds; this would
include 48 percent of the cost of equipment and materials or 100
percent of their foreign exchange cost, which would be withdrawn as
the purchases are made, before the connections are installed. Taking
into account the proportion financed from the revolving funds which
will grow during project execution, Bank financing would amount to
about 48 percent of the total cost of house connections, which
corresponds to the estimated foreign exchange cost. (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1, paragraph 4.)
Project benefits and justification
61.      The clearest benefit of the project will be to provide much improved
access to water supply of better quality, to population groups which had been
bypassed by earlier investments in the sector. The house connection scheme is
expected to benefit about 275,000 households counting some 1.6 million
members, of which it is estimated about 670,000 are below the poverty



- 19 -
threshold. The criteria for eligibility under the scheme, the availability of
credit and the tariff structure providing for concessionary rates for the
first 30 m3 of water consumed every quarter, should ensure that the scheme is
properly targeted towards the low-income households, and at the same time that
basic water requirements remain affordable to the poor, as has been
demonstrated in the second project under which the scheme was extremely
successful. The two other major project components, the sector loan and the
two regional water supply systems, represent the most significant attempt so
far to bring public water supply services outside the main cities. Their
impact on poverty would also be significant, as they are expected to affect
210,000 urban poor and 160,000 rural poor, out of a total population served of
600,000. All together, about 48 percent of the loan would be directed to the
poor.
62.      Other benefits that would be derived from the project consist of
further institution building in the sector. The sector loan component and the
two regional water supply systems on the one hand reflect the impressive
progress made by ONEP since its creation in 1972, and on the otber band
represent a challenge for ONEP to continue to develop its ability to conceive
and realize water supply systems. Other areas in whicb the project would
affect ONEP are in management, accounting, planning, design and operations,
and in monitoring water quality. Towards the end of the project ONEP should
also have reduced further its already limited dependance on external technical
assistance. As for the studies foreseen and the water resources development
component, they should allow better sector planning and organization,
including better coordination among the different agencies involved.
Risks
63.      The project faces no particular risks.  The successful implementation
of the house connection component under the second project bodes well for the
expanded scheme to be carried out under the present project. As for the other
components, the experience acquired by ONEP and the unexceptional technical
characteristics of the investments should ensure smooth execution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
64.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Office National de l'Eau
Potable (ONEP) and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
65.      A special condition of the effectiveness of the loan will be the
effectiveness of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco
and ONEP (draft Loan Agreement, Section 6.01). Before each Regie can disburse
the proceeds of the loan allocated to it, the Regie shall have entered into a



- 20 -
subsidiary loan agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco and a loan agreement
with FEC (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph 5 (ii)). Other special
conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex III.
66.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
67.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Ln. No. 1018         Sebou II Development Project; US$32.0 million of June 27,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: February 28, 1975; Closing
Date; December 31, 1981.
The project as originally appraised was completed in November 1980,
except for the procurement of sugarcane transport equipment ($0.7 million).
Funds have been committed for about 50 percent of the costs of additional
infrastructure works foreseen under an amendment to the Loan Agreement made
in July 1980.
Ln. No. 1123         Souss Groundwater Project; US$18.5 million of June 11,
1975; Date of Effectiveness; September 26, 1975; Closing
Date; June 30, 1982.
The tube wells required for new irrigated areas (6,400 ha) were
completed and tested one year ahead of appraisal schedule. Land clearing
and distribution as well as construction of the Project Headquarters and
Development Centers have been completed. Works related to the social
components of the project which suffered from substantial delay are now
underway. Budgetary constraints facing Morocco resulted in cutbacks in the
operating budget and held back the assignment of additional personnel,
causing 2 years delay in project implementation, and consequent cost
overruns. A revised work program has been prepared to reflect this.
Agricultural yields are satisfactory.
Cr. No. 555         Meknes Agricultural Development Project; US$14.0 million
of June 11, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: November 14,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
After a 2-year initial delay, project implementation has picked up
momentum. Major activities concerned with the land consolidation and
redistribution program have been completed in one district and works have
been started in the remaining three districts. Progress is slower than
expected, mainly because project implementation proves more complex than
anticipated. However, the first results of the completed components are
promising. Because of the initial delay and the complexity in
implementation, the original closing date was extended by three years.
1/       These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in particular
to report any problems which are being encountered, and the action
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and
with the undertanding that they do not purport to present a
balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Ln. No. 1201 Doukkala Irrigation Project; US$30.0 million of February 27,
1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 20, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981.
The project includes sprinkler irrigation for 15,400 ha.,
infrastructure and equipment and a research laboratory on bilharzia.
Construction of irrigation and drainage works is nearly complete. The first
4,600 ha. have been completed and put in service. Completion of the remainder
is underway and expected to be on schedule. Agricultural development has been
satisfactory.
Ln. No. 1202 Bay of Agadir Tourism Project; US$21.0 million of February 27,
1976; Date of Effectiveness: October 29, 1976; Closing Date:
May 1, 1981.
The project consists of infrastructure works and public facilities
for developing Agadir into a major tourism area. Most infrastructure works
were completed in December 1980, except for the construction of public
facilities (representing some 20% of the total project costs). This delay is
