Overall, the performance of\n            the International Development Association (IDA) is\n            satisfactory. Similarly, overall Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory based on its commitment, ownership, and\n            performance during project preparation and implementation in\n            a sub-sector requiring innovative interventions, and its\n            achievement of project objectives and fulfillment of almost\n            all major project indicators. The Borrower achieved these\n            despite initial delays, the strained capacity of the\n            Directorate of Non-Formal Education (DNFE), and high staff\n            turnover. Some of the lessons learned include: Ensuring\n            program quality by having in place a comprehensive\n            government vision and strategy, a robust assessment of\n            institutional capacity, and a clear understanding of\n            additional resources required. Having a lower-level council\n            that is able to meet at least annually. Ensuring cost\n            effectiveness and timely preparation of key activities by\n            giving greater importance to donor coordination, which, when\n            led by the government, will avoid overburdening government\n            entities. Where a project specifically targets female\n            education, incorporating appropriate performance indicators\n            to monitor progress towards this objective, e.g., training\n            and hiring female teachers, and designing relevant\n            curriculum. Systematic monitoring and formative evaluation\n            of non-formal education programs are essential."}, "docdt": "2002-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
