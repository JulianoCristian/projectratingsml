Specifically, the project will\n            strengthen NFE by: 1) assisting in the institutionalization\n            of the Integrated Nonformal Education Program into a\n            Directorate of NFE staffed by qualified personnel able to\n            function in related tasks such as planning, training,\n            monitoring, and evaluation; and 2) expanding and improving\n            NFE programs to reach an estimated 2.5 million learners of\n            the targeted age group through nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs) and the local district administration. The project\n            will form part of the government's overall NFE\n            development program to be supported by different external agencies."}, "docdt": "1996-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
