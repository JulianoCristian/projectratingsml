With that in mind, the project\n            comprises (a) rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and\n            flood protection works in all but the southwestern region;\n            (b) rehabilitation of roads and associated structures in the\n            northwestern and southwestern regions; and (c)\n            reconstruction and refurnishing of primary schools.  In\n            addition, the project provides for (d) replacement of\n            tugboat, navigational aids and water gauging equipment; (e)\n            repair of river landing jetties; and (f) provision of\n            technical services by local and foreign consultants.\n            Without restoration, the efficiency of road and waterway\n            systems would be seriously impaired, flood protection and\n            irrigation and drainage schemes would be in jeopardy, and\n            the primary education of at least 170,000 children would\n            suffer.  Consequently, restoration of flood damage is a high priority."}, "docdt": "1987-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
