The project consists of three\n            components.

The last\n            component, policy development, will support the design and\n            implementation of selected policy measures for introducing\n            systematic pricing and cost-recovery for primary health\n            services in the public system and for quality control for\n            primary health care, and for strengthening employment system\n            for public health personnel; and provide for an impact\n            evaluation for the project."}, "docdt": "1993-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
