Lessons reinforce once\n            again, the beneficial aspects of flexible projects, which as\n            in this case, the continuous evolution in the interpretation\n            of project objectives, permitted adaptation to radical\n            changes in the policy context. Particularly in this project,\n            such flexibility became an important tool for the\n            project's survival in a changing political, and\n            economic environment, whose highly focused monitoring, and\n            evaluation criteria, adapted to the overall project\n            indicators, allowing an essential, and rigorous\n            post-evaluation. Moreover, the reconciliatory effect that\n            projects supporting health, and social sectors can have in\n            countries suffering from difficult security problems, was\n            demonstrated by this project's state presence at the\n            local level, responsive to people's needs, especially\n            in areas with precarious security."}, "docdt": "2001-10-10T00:00:00Z"}
