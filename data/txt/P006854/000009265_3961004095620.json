The project consists of three\n            components. The first component, institutional development,\n            is designed to: (a) introduce a municipal health management\n            information system to support planning and monitoring of\n            primary health care services; and (b) provide related\n            training and technical support for municipal administrative\n            authorities, municipal health administrators and community\n            representatives, numbering about 6,000 in the project area.\n            The second component, service development is designed to:\n            (a) implement municipal subprojects, to be co-financed by\n            the municipalities and the central government, to support a\n            basic package of primary health care services by: providing\n            medical supplies and equipment; and financing\n            rehabilitation, expansion, construction and furnishing of\n            selected primary health care facilities; and (b) provide\n            related training and technical support for some 13,000\n            municipal health practitioners in the project area. The last\n            component, policy development, will support the design and\n            implementation of selected policy measures for introducing\n            systematic pricing and cost-recovery for primary health\n            services in the public system and for quality control for\n            primary health care, and for strengthening employment system\n            for public health personnel; and provide for an impact\n            evaluation for the project."}, "docdt": "1993-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
