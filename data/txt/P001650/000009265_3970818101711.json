Malawi. The main components of the\n            AMED project were to be the development of a multi-channel\n            system for marketing agricultural produce and inputs, an\n            improvement in the access of small estates to medium-term\n            credit through existing credit channels, and the\n            strengthening of capacity within govermment in project\n            management and in the management of marketing and pricing\n            policy reform. The project's objectives were to: (i)\n            improve agricultural marketing and increase rural incomes;\n            and (ii) improve resource utilization and productivity on\n            estates, by providing medium-term credit to intensify and\n            diversify production. Bank's performance was generally\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was generally\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            it is important that projects be grafted into the existing\n            institutional arrangements for portfolio management within a\n            sector without resorting to the creation of\n            'independent'units; (ii) the project's\n            experience points to the needed design of revolving fund\n            facilities,with suitable apex institutions, that can\n            continue to finance micro loans after project closure; (iii)\n            Participating Financing Institutions (PFI) need to be\n            sensitized to the special features of lending groups,\n            especially those requiring microloans, which require\n            significant departures from conventional lending approaches\n            to include group loans, closer loan supervision, and\n            simplified application procedures; (iv) coordination\n            arrangements for multisectoral activities should consider\n            moving towards the creation of \"councils\" with\n            permanent membership, defined terms of reference, and\n            incentives; and (v) in terms of the project design, the\n            barriers to entry into agricultural trade faced by small\n            entrepreneurs should have been examined and reviewed up front."}, "docdt": "1997-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
