      Re:   Agricultural Marketing and Estate Development Project
            (Cr. 1966-MAI)
            Amendment
Dear Mr. Minister:
      I refer to (a) the Development Credit Agreement between the
Republic of Malawi (the Borrower) and the International Development
Association (the Association) and (b) the Project Agreement between
the Association and Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), for the above-
referenced Project, dated March 31, 1989.  I also refer to the
exchange of views between representatives of the Borrower and the
Association in July 1992, proposing inclusion of Investment and
Development Fund Limited as a Participating and the partial use of
Credit funds for seasonal credit.
      Having reviewed the above recommendations, we propose to amend
the Development Credit Agreement as follows:
1.    Section 1.02. Paragraph "f" is amended to read "Participating
Bank" means any of the following banks: Investment and Development
Bank of Malawi Limited, the Commercial Bank of Malawi Limited and
the National Bank of Malawi and shall include Investment and
Development Fund Limited.
2.    Schedule 2. Paragraph (b) of the objectives of the Project is
amended to read:
      "(b) improve resource utilization and productivity on estates
      by providing seasonal and medium-term credit to intensify and
      diversify production."
3.    Schedule 6. The amount "$500,000" in the second line of
paragraph 1 (c) is deleted and replaced by the amount "$800,000".
      Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing, on behalf of
the Borrower, by signing, dating and returning to us the enclosed
copy of this letter.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
