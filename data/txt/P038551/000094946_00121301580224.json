of individual heat substations; and rehabilitation of boiler\n            houses. These activities may generate negative environmental\n            impacts and must be mitigated by appropriate measures. 1)\n            The negative impact of public safety and nuisance can be\n            minimized by observing special rules and including the\n            procedure for implementation of the works into the contract.\n            2) Dust can be reduced by water sprinkling. Noise can be\n            reduced by carrying out activities during the daytime;\n            providing ear protection for workers; and properly planning\n            track movements and transportation ways. 3) Disposal of\n            solid materials can be managed by removing metal, concrete,\n            and other scrap material from the sites, depositing at\n            authorized dealers for recycling; identifying, removing, and\n            disposing materials containing asbestos; using personal\n            safety equipment in contaminated area; separating the\n            workplace from non contaminated areas; encapsulating working\n            area; installing suction systems to lower the air pressure\n            inside the containment; placing a decontamination unit where\n            contaminated clothing is removed and the workers may take\n            shower; packing waste into plastic film during\n            transportation and disposal. 4) Water/fuel leakage and\n            spillage can be reduced by setting up extended maintenance\n            systems and special collection devices and spill prevention points."}, "docdt": "2000-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
