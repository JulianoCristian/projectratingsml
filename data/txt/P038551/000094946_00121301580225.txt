C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1.    Equipment Purchases (Tabular Presentation Preferred)
Equipment is listed in annex 15 of the Project Implementation Plan
2.    Training/Study Tours
Technical training is discussed in Project Implementation Plan, annexes 3, Technical assistance
program and twinning program.
Training will be set up for operators and other specialists if the monitoring equipment and instruments
will be replaced. Duration of the training will be according to recommendation and requirements from
the supplier.
Training of appropriate staff will be performed to inform and learn about handling of asbestos waste
and if required of PCB in order to manage correct purchasing and monitoring of the contracts works
3.    Consultant Services
No consultants are planned to be involved in the environmental institutional strengthening.
D. SCHEDULE
The activities are identified in the Project Implementation Plan.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Books of PDV/PDS (licensed or permit discharge limits) comprise all information required for all the
facilities that are emission sources, and which are incorporated in the particular enterprise. That means,
PDV do not give a distinguishing characteristic of one particular source of emissions but they present
the emission characteristics of the particular enterprise as a whole. In the event any emission source
changes from owner, both parties should incorporate relevant changes into the composition of their
enterprises' sources. Consistent with the requirements books of PDV should be adjusted
correspondingly.
Besides the above mentioned rate of permit limits, the book of PDV incorporates a time-schedule of
required inspection (including emissions measurements) with regard to their concentration or other
parameters (load table). The enterprise's staff carries out the inspection. Natural environment
protection bodies could either undertake at regular intervals parallel inspections or participate in the
inspection procedures carried out by the enterprise. All data, obtained as a result of the inspection,
carried out by enterprise's staff in conformity to the adopted schedule, is recorded. Environment
protection bodies are not entitled to present the results of their check to the inspected enterprises.
Existing environmental regulations set up a fixed time interval to draw up a revised version of the PDV
(PDS) books - once in 5 (five) years. Rates of PDV (PDS) should be revised and adjusted in case the
equipment, processing procedures and type of fuel are undergoing changes. Basically, the above
mentioned rates(or norms) could be revised even every three months.
The result of this approach is that emission limits are laid down in the permit of every stack as a mass
flow of the pollutants in tons/year and grams/second. These limits are per stack, not per boiler, because
more than one boiler can emit through the same stack. These limits and the temporarily allowed
emission limits will be used as reference situation for the current state of the environment.



Enterprises that are sources of environmental pollution have to pay environmental (emissions,
discharges. waste and etc.) fees. They are to fill in corresponding forms: 2-TP (air) - (2-TB - B03,3yX),
2-TP (water) - (2-TB - BOtX03), 2-TF (harrnful waste) - (2-TB - TOKCwqHbie oTXaJb1). Data, that is
included in the above forms, reflect the recorded information with regard to environmental pollution
and appropriate natural resources consumption.
Collection of data: If available computerized supervision system for collection, storage, handling of
data as charts, statistics, historical values etc.
Other plants - Data is collected by operational staff once a week at each boiler plant
or during unusual situations as failures, irrational firing process if required.
Analyze of data:  Analyze of data is perfoimed by the chief of production plants by visual review and
check of collected data. Data is filed in the operational register.
Reporting:       Normal procedure is that the report with filed operational data is sent to the
Production Department ornce a month. If the data diverge from the ordinary, the
report immediately is sent to the chief of Technical Department for appropriate
measures.
Decisions:       The decision to take action, to authorize expenditures, to shut down etc. is
performed by the Techn cal Directors Mr. V. Mukhin, Mr. G. Smirnov (PTO) and
Mr. V. Borodin (Energik.-Tenzor).

program and twinning program.
Training will be set up for operators and other specialists if the monitoring equipment and instruments
will be replaced. Duration of the training will be according to recommendation and requirements from
the supplier.
Training of appropriate staff will be performed to inform and learn about handling of asbestos waste
and if required of PCB in order to manage correct purchasing and monitoring of the contracts works
3.    Consultant Services
No consultants are planned to be involved in the environmental institutional strengthening.
D. SCHEDULE
The activities are identified in the Project Implementation Plan.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Books of PDV/PDS (licensed or permit discharge limits) comprise all information required for all the
facilities that are emission sources, and which are incorporated in the particular enterprise. That means,
PDV do not give a distinguishing characteristic of one particular source of emissions but they present
the emission characteristics of the particular enterprise as a whole. In the event any emission source
changes from owner, both parties should incorporate relevant changes into the composition of their
enterprises' sources. Consistent with the requirements books of PDV should be adjusted
correspondingly.
Besides the above mentioned rate of permit limits, the book of PDV incorporates a time-schedule of
required inspection (including emissions measurements) with regard to their concentration or other
parameters (load table). The enterprise's staff carries out the inspection. Natural environment
protection bodies could either undertake at regular intervals parallel inspections or participate in the
inspection procedures carried out by the enterprise. All data, obtained as a result of the inspection,
carried out by enterprise's staff in conformity to the adopted schedule, is recorded. Environment
protection bodies are not entitled to present the results of their check to the inspected enterprises.
Existing environmental regulations set up a fixed time interval to draw up a revised version of the PDV
(PDS) books - once in 5 (five) years. Rates of PDV (PDS) should be revised and adjusted in case the
equipment, processing procedures and type of fuel are undergoing changes. Basically, the above
mentioned rates(or norms) could be revised even every three months.
The result of this approach is that emission limits are laid down in the permit of every stack as a mass
flow of the pollutants in tons/year and grams/second. These limits are per stack, not per boiler, because
more than one boiler can emit through the same stack. These limits and the temporarily allowed
emission limits will be used as reference situation for the current state of the environment.
A



Enterprises that are sources of environmental pollution have to pay environmental (emissions.
discharges, waste and etc.) fees. They are lo fill in corresponding forms: 2-TP (air) - (2-Tn - B3o3ayX).
2-TP (water) - (2-Tl - BO;IX03), 2-TH (harmful waste) - (2-TH - TOICHqHble OTXObl). Data, that is
included in the above forms. reflect the recorded information with regard to environmental pollution
and appropriate natural resources consumption.
Collection of data: If available computeriz+d supervision system for collection, storage, handling of
data as charts, statistics, historical values etc.
Other plants - Data is collected by operational staff once a week at each boiler plant
or during unusual situa ions as failures, irrational firing process if required.
Analyze of data:  Analyze of data is perfcrmed by the chief of production plants by visual review and
check of collected data. Data is filed in the operational register.
Reporting:       Normal procedure is th it the report with filed operational data is sent to the
Production Department once a month. If the data diverge from the ordinary, the
report immediately is sent to the chief of Technical Department for appropriate
measures.
Decisions:       The decision to take action, to authorize expenditures, to shut down etc. is
performed by the Technical Director Mr. A. Kazakov

(PDS) books - once in 5 (five) years. Rates of PDV (PDS) should be revised and adjusted in case the
equipment, processing procedures and type of fuel are undergoing changes. Basically, the above
mentioned rates(or norms) could be revised even every three months.
The result of this approach is that emission limits are laid down in the permit of every stack as a mass
flow of the pollutants in tons/year and grams/second. These limits are per stack, not per boiler, because
more than one boiler can emit through the same stack. These limits and the temporarily allowed
emission limits will be used as reference situation for the current state of the environment.



Enterprises that are sources of environmental pollution have to pay environmental (emissions,
discharges, waste and etc.) fees. They are tc fill in corresponding forms: 2-TP (air) - (2-TBI - Bo3flyX).
2-TP (water) - (2-TI - BOUX03), 2-TI (harniful waste) - (2-TF - TOKCHqHbie OTXO0tb]). Data, that is
included in the above forms, reflect the reccrded information with regard to environmental pollution
and appropriate natural resources consumpt on.
Collection of data: If available computerized supervision system for collection, storage, handling of
data as charts, statistics, historical values etc.
Other plants - Data is ccIlected by operational staff once a week at each boiler plant
or during unusual situatians as failures, irrational firing process if required.
Analyze of data:  Analyze of data is performed by the chief of production plants by visual review and
check of collected data. Data is filed in the operational register.
Reporting:       Normal procedure is thai the report with filed operational data is sent to the
Production Department once a month. If the data diverge from the ordinary, the
report immediately is sent to the chief of Technical Department for appropriate
measures.
Decisions:       The decision to take action, to authorize expenditures, to shut down etc. is
performed by the Technical Director Mr E.B. Kasianov.

D. SCHEDULE
The activities are identified in the Project Implementation Plan.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Books of PDVIPDS (licensed or permit discharge limits) comprise all information required for all the
facilities that are emission sources, and which are-incorporated in the particular enterprise. That means,
PDV do not give a distinguishing characteristic of one particular source of emissions but they present
the emission characteristics of the particular enterprise as a whole. In the event any emission source
changes from owner, both parties should incorporate relevant changes into the composition of their
enterprises' sources. Consistent with the requirements books of PDV should be adjusted
correspondingly.
Besides the above mentioned rate of permit limits, the book of PDV incorporates a time-schedule of
required inspection (including emissions measurements) with regard to their concentration or other
parameters (load table). The enterprise's staff carries out the inspection. Natural environment
protection bodies could either undertake at regular intervals parallel inspections or participate in the
inspection procedures carried out by the enterprise. All data, obtained as a result of the inspection,
carried out by enterprise's staff in conformity to the adopted schedule, is recorded. Environment
protection bodies are not entitled to present the results of their check to the inspected enterprises.
Existing environmental regulations set up a fixed time interval to draw up a revised version of the PDV
(PDS) books - once in 5 (five) years. Rates of PDV (PDS) should be revised and adjusted in case the
equipment, processing procedures and type of fuel are undergoing changes. Basically, the above
