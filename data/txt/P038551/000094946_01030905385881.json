There are four project\n            components. The first finances systems rehabilitation\n            including replacing coal and mazut-fired old heat-only\n            boilers with modern gas-fired boilers, improving the quality\n            of district heating circulation water, replacing old and\n            worn district heating pipelines and armatures with modern\n            pre-insulated pipes and fittings, replacing central\n            tube-type substations and underground domestic hot water\n            pipelines with advanced plate heat exchangers and control\n            systems in individual buildings, replacing hydroelevators in\n            the space heating circuits, flushing the secondary pipelines\n            and radiators of buildings, and installing heating meters,\n            among others. The second component supports the Central\n            Project Development Unit (CPDU) and the third component\n            funds the CPDU's operating expenses including but not\n            limited to salaries if local staff, consultants, travel\n            expenditures, office equipment, and office supplies. The\n            third component also provides the cost of carrying out the\n            audits of the project financial statements as well as the\n            costs of carrying out periodic updates of the assessments of\n            the credit-worthiness of cities participating in the\n            project.
