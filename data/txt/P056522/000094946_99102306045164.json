           public sector management through: 1) the implementation of\n            performance-based budgeting for line ministries; thus,\n            central agencies' capacity will be strengthened to\n            review and evaluate sector policies and performance, and,\n            fiscal transparency will be improved; 2) the restructure of\n            service delivery, will align organizational structures of\n            line ministries with new functional objectives, and, staff\n            profiles, will be matched with new requirements for civil\n            service. This restructure will in turn contain costs. Human\n            resources management systems will be developed, to achieve\n            modern civil service performances, and, a cross-governmental\n            senior cadre, to lead the renewal process will be\n            instituted, along with regulatory frameworks for autonomous\n            public organizations; 3) an improved accountability and\n            transparency, will strengthen revenue management, for better\n            taxpayer compliance practices, and collection enforcement,\n            with appropriate business and information technology\n            priorities. Decentralization will provide adequate\n            expenditure functions, enhancing local revenues/resources.\n            Institutional accountability will be increased, and, public\n            access to information and promotion will be enhanced.\n            Nonetheless, insufficient inter-agency coordination, and,\n            lack of political commitment to reform, may present risks."}, "docdt": "1999-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
