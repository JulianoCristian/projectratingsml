1.    The closing date for the Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project, IDA Credit No.
3860-YEM and IDA Grant No. 420-RY will be extended from October 31, 2011 until June 30,
2012.

2.       Implementation of the GSCP had been carried out satisfactorily and its ISR ratings for
both the Progress Towards Achieving PDO and Implementation Progress (IP) had been
“satisfactory” until its IP rating was downgraded in June 2011 due to stoppage of most of the
activities as a result of the current political and security environment in the country. A number of
contracts (Works and Goods) amounting to US$6.6 million are put on hold now. Without
completing these ongoing activities, the PDO may not be fully attained.

3.      The proposed extension is thus necessary to complete the remaining contracts and attain
the PDO. These contracts have already been awarded and are expected to be completed as soon
as the current situation stabilizes.

4.      The original Credit – Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project of SDR27.1 million
(US$40 million equivalent) was approved on February 26, 2004, signed on April 23, 2004 and
declared effective on August 17, 2004. The Closing Date was then extended from October 31,
2009 to October 31, 2011 and an Additional Financing (AF) Grant for an amount of SDR9.2
million (US$15.0 million) was approved on September 11, 2008. The Additional Financing
Agreement was signed on October 13, 2008, and declared effective on December 23, 2008. The
Closing Date of both Credits was originally October 31, 2011. This would be the second closing
date extension for the original project and the first for the Additional Financing.
