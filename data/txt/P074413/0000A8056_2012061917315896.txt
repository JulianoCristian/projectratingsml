                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to assist GOY in promoting groundwater conservation in farming areas and increasing surface and groundwater availability through: (i)
                         improving irrigation water use efficiency, thus increasing farmer returns to water and creating the conditions that would allow them to reduce groundwater pumping
                         from aquifers towards sustainable levels; (ii) improving recharge and protection of watersheds in order to increase surface and groundwater availability through the
                         improvement of small to medium spate irrigation schemes, bank protection works, terraces and other water harvesting structures; and (iii) supporting the groundwater
                         management framework and institutions that will have the incentive and capacity to manage local water resources in a sustainable manner.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Bank's suspension of disbursement was lifted in February 2012. Since then, the GSCP has been picking up momentum to complete the remaining works. The GSCP attained the
                         overall PDO to assist Government in promoting groundwater conservation in farming areas and increasing surface and groundwater availability, which is proved by (i) significantly
                         improved water use efficiency contributing groundwater use by farmers, (ii) expanded and rehabilitated spate irrigation systems and rehabilitation of bank protections and terraces,

                         and construction of new water harvesting pits, and (iii) established groundwater aquifers management at the local level by water users associations established and trained under the
                         GSCP.
