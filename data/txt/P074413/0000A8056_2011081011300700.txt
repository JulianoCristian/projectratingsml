                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Based on the Bank's operational policies for suspension of disbursements, the Bank has decided to allow disbursement of direct payments for contracts signed prior to suspension,
                         which will help ease the tension between the project coordination unit and the contractors and help improve the status of the project implementation.
