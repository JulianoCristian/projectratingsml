priority\n            investments; (ii) assist in the development of a small-scale\n            enterprise (SSE) program in Rwanda by helping implement a\n            pilot program for financing SSE projects and by financing\n            the cost of study necessary to develop a nationwide SSE\n            development program; and (iii) help BRD continue developing\n            its capabilities and evolve into a strong and mature\n            financial institution. The main components are: (a)\n            provision for a line of credit to BRD including: i) at most\n            US$4.4 million to help BRD finance larger projects; ii) at\n            least US$2.5 million for BRD's proposed program; and\n            (b) US$0.1 million to help Government carry out studies for\n            the development of an SSE program and of the interest rate\n            structure in Rwanda. Benefits: Private and public sector\n            investment would be promoted. BRD's capabilities and\n            procedures particularly as regards assistance to SSE\n            development would continue to be strengthened and improved.\n            Risks: There is no major risk associated with this project."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
