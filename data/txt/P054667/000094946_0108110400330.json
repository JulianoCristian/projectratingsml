While the project contributed\n            significantly to increasing Peru's capacity to forecast\n            and respond to future El Nino events, it only achieved\n            partial restoration of assets originally targeted within the\n            project period, and about 55 percent of the laon amount had\n            to be cancelled. On balance, therefore, the project outcome\n            is rated unsatisfactory. Overall, project sustainabiliy is\n            rated likely: Many works which by their nature were\n            temporary mitigated the impact of the El Nino phenomenon.\n            The sustainability of the institutional development\n            achievements for future disaster forecasting will depend on\n            continuing cooperation among the agencies under the Estudio\n            Nacional del Fenomeno \"El Nino\" (ENFEN), whether\n            budgetary resources continue to be available to these\n            agencies, and their ability to develop and retain qualified\n            professionals. While the project was large and necessarily\n            undefined at appraisal which posed risks for implementation,\n            and there were insufficient safeguards for reassessing the\n            project and its scope after the impact of the disaster was\n            known, the Bank did respond quickly and flexibly to the\n            emergency. During supervision it correctly identified the\n            need to reassess and reduce the project, particularly the\n            roads component. Also, the Bank successfully supervised the\n            works and designs as well as the institutionsl development\n            components. Borrower performance was marginally satisfactory."}, "docdt": "2001-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
