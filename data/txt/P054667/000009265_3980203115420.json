of the El Nino\n            Emergency Assistance Project are to (a) reduce the loss of\n            human life and deterioration of living standards that may\n            result from the floods and/or droughts caused by the 1997-98\n            El Nino event; (b) minimize the loss of, or damage to,\n            economic and social infrastructure that may result; and (c)\n            enhance institutional capacity to forecast and respond to\n            future El Nino phenomena. The operation's components\n            are tied to three distinct phases - prevention, emergency,\n            and reconstruction - and include an institutional\n            strengthening component. The prevention phase consists of 1)\n            flood construction measures on the northern coast, including\n            river dredging, strengthening river defenses and bridges,\n            clearing and building storm drainage canals in all areas,\n            building temporary housing, and protecting archeological\n            sites; and 2) drought mitigation measures in the Andean\n            highlands including water management, producing forage for\n            livestock, and a seed production program. The emergency\n            phase provides limited support, to provide certain emergency\n            requirements such as mobile bridge structures, plants, pumps\n            and metallic protection structures. The reconstruction phase\n            will likely rebuild key public infrastructure; resettle\n            families in flood prone areas and equip them with\n            infrastructure facilities and public services; and operate a\n            labor-intensive rural works program. Institutional support\n            consists of equipment, technical assistance, and training."}, "docdt": "1997-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
