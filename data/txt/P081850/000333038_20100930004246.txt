DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO--EMERGENCY ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
               REUNIFICATION SUPPORT PROJECT
                              P081850
               (Credit No. 38240 and Grant No. H0640)

                                 Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing date for the above-mentioned project (Credit No. 38240 and Grant
No. H0640), P081850 will be extended from September 30, 2010, until March 31, 2011.

2.       Ratings for the Project Development Objective and the overall Implementation
Progress have been consistently "Satisfactory" since the Project was restructured in
September 2008, and the Government's commitment to the Project remains strong. All
activities have been completed for three of the five Project components (Components A,
C and E). The results achieved on the ground have greatly contributed to improving the
living conditions of the populations. The Project has been instrumental in helping the
country achieve the reunification of its economic activities and has supported social
reunification. The Project has also contributed to jumpstarting the economy in the eastern
part of the country which had been cut off from the other parts of DRC for several years
and the project objectives continue to be achievable.

3.      The extension of the project is to complete activities under components B and D
which are experiencing implementation delays. As agreed with the Borrower during the
last supervision mission, it will involve finalizing the ongoing works:
    · Rehabilitation of the Ruzizi power station (to be completed by March 2011)
    · Water supply at Goma, Bukavu and Kindu (to be completed by November 2010)
    · Power supply in Kindu (to be completed by December 2010)
    · Rehabilitation of an urban road at Bukavu (to be completed by October 2010)
    · Rebuilding the Basoko School at Kindu (to be completed by October 2010)
    · Dam safety assessment (to be completed by December 2010)
    · Impact studies for the government completion report (to be completed by March
        2011).

4.     This restructuring involves a cumulative extension of the original Project Closing
Date for more than two years.
