As revised, this PDO is\n            in line with the government strategy of creating an\n            environment for an economic and social reunification of the\n            country. The project changes will concern: 1) reformulating\n            the PDO. The original PDO was too general and it was\n            difficult to directly correlate project results and its\n            objectives; 2) adapting a new results framework to the new\n            changed PDO in order to better capture achievements on the\n            ground. In the revised results framework, particular focus\n            is given to providing a baseline and targeted value for each\n            outcome. This aspect was not taken into account in the\n            original results framework where baselines and targets were\n            not clearly established and where most of the indicators\n            measured outputs; and 3) Cancelling the forest concessions\n            sub-component. The Government and the Bank have agreed to\n            cancel the forest zoning sub-component and instead provide\n            support to the Ministry of Environment in the forestry\n            reforms. The original activities involved a complex set of\n            issues that would be better addressed in a comprehensive way\n            and not through an emergency operation which cannot allocate\n            the resources needed. Based on the above, the government and\n            the Bank have concluded that this sub-component fits better\n            in a specific operation and should be considered under the\n            forest project under preparation. The restructuring measures\n            are to: (i) reduce the scope of works on the RN2\n            (Bukavu-Mbuji-Mayi) road; (ii) cancel the forest zoning\n            sub-component; (iii) reformulate the PDO and the results\n            framework; (iv) reallocate the Project Grant proceeds; and\n            (v) extend the project closing date from September 30,2008,\n            to September 30, 2010."}, "docdt": "2008-08-21T00:00:00Z"}
