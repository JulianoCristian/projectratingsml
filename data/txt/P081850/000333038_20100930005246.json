and (ii) to increase\n            access to and use by the local population of basic\n            infrastructure and social services in the provinces of\n            Orientale, Maniema, Nord Kivu, Sud Kivu, Nord Equateur, Nord\n            Katanga, and Nord Kasai Oriental. Ratings for the project\n            development objective and the overall implementation\n            progress have been consistently 'satisfactory'\n            since the project was restructured in September 2008, and\n            the Government's commitment to the project remains\n            strong. The results achieved on the ground have greatly\n            contributed to improving the living conditions of the\n            populations. The project has been instrumental in helping\n            the country achieve the reunification of its economic\n            activities and has supported social reunification. The\n            project has also contributed to jumpstarting the economy in\n            the eastern part of the country which had been cut off from\n            the other parts of DRC for several years and the project\n            objectives continue to be achievable."}, "docdt": "2010-09-23T00:00:00Z"}
