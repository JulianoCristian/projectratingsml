for the Emergency Economic and\n            Social Reunification Support Project (PUSPRES) for\n            Democratic Republic of Congo were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: introduction of flexibility\n            mechanisms at the design level in emergency projects is\n            essential to allow responses to adapt to rapidly changing\n            needs. Emergency projects are prepared in a short time in\n            order to quickly produce significant impacts on the ground,\n            and the valuable database necessary to make a good\n            evaluation is usually not available. The case of PUSPRES is\n            a perfect example. Thus, it is necessary from design to\n            introduce flexibility mechanisms to adapt to changing needs\n            and fill the gaps resulting from shortened preparation\n            times. This flexibility should also be reflected in the\n            provision of adequate resources to deal with the inevitable\n            cost overruns. Proactive restructuring of post-conflicts\n            projects is a good alternative to mitigate the weaknesses in\n            the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework and of\n            project design considering the fact that emergency\n            operations will always suffer from design weaknesses. The\n            M&E framework is often overlooked in emergency projects\n            which are more focused on physical reconstruction efforts\n            than on monitoring impacts. PUSPRES used the restructuring\n            component to set up a stronger M&E framework."}, "docdt": "2011-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
