the Water Supply\n            Infrastructure Improvement Project for St. Lucia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the Bank tried to minimize\n            the risk of dispersed focus and efforts by staffing the Bank\n            teams assigned to both projects to overlap and advise the\n            Government of St Lucia (GoSL) as one seamless team. This\n            should have been replicated at the local level by having one\n            single Project Implementation Unit (PIU) coordinating with\n            all water sector stakeholders; an alternative that can be\n            explored to maximize Bank's assistance, noting that\n            this is not always possible as funding availability and\n            timing is a constraint, particularly in International\n            Development Association (IDA) countries, is a programmatic\n            and wider sector approach, combining technical assistance\n            (TA) and investment with clear links and objective\n            milestones in terms of performance to access the financing\n            under the program; given the lack of real linkages (in terms\n            of financing) between the two operations, the results\n            monitoring framework of the investment project could have\n            considered performance indicators only related to the\n            implementation of the investment project financed by the\n            loan and credits, i.e. within its control and influence; in\n            hindsight, considering that the Private Sector Participation\n            (PSP) eventually did not go through, the project as a\n            standalone project could have considered alternative routes\n            for the institutional strengthening of Water and Sewerage\n            Company Inc. (WASCO) vis-a-vis the sustainability of the\n            services and investments in its risk analysis and proposed\n            mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2009-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
