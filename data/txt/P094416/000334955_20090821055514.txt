F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Saint Lucia Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement Project will support a short
term investment program to carry out critical works which are required to achieve the
following objectives:



                                                   ii
  (i) alleviate the water shortage in the north of the country. (The infrastructure works
proposed will allow the utility to supply the entire north of the island with a more
efficient, continuous and reliable service.)
  (ii) implement urgent investments that will result in additional revenues, reduce the
likelihood of commercial users (important sources of cross-subsidy for poor consumers)
abandoning the system and improve the potential of a successful partnership between the
government and the private sector.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Like many of its neighboring island states, Saint Lucia was at the time of appraisal in
   2005 i n a d evelopment c rossroads. A s i n other O ECS c ountries, e conomic
   performance in the island improved in 2003 and 2004, driven by a revival in tourism
   and the absence of natural disasters during that period. With a population of around
   160,000, t he pove rty he adcount i ndex i ndicated t wenty-five pe rcent of them l ived

   position a s a t ourism de stination. Y et, t he a bility of t he c ountry t o a bsorb f urther
   resort development and t o attract be yond t he approximately on e m illion tourists per
   year, who then visited the island in 2005, was being tested by the extraordinary fiscal
   constraints that restricted (and still do) public investment in the island's infrastructure.
   Earlier that year, the Government of Saint Lucia (GoSL) had submitted a successful
   bid to host Cricket World Cup (CWC) in March 2007. This posed a serious challenge
   as t he co untry w as al ready n ot able t o m eet t he need f or a co nsistent r eliable w ater

2. The water sector in Saint Lucia had been performing poorly for more than 20 years1.
   Despite a c oncerted effort i n 2000 t o t urn a round t he s tate w ater ut ility, t he w ater

   government owned utility which operated nearly all water and sanitation services on
   the i sland, W ater an d S ewerage C ompany ( WASCO2), h ad ceas ed t o m ake c apital
   investments and lost the good will of its domestic and commercial consumers due to
   severe shortages, mis-billings and poor quality of service. Exacerbating the situation,
   a severe dr y s eason i n 2003 c ompounded e xisting w ater s hortage pr oblems f orcing
   WASCO to imp lement s trict w ater allocation s chedules, is land-wide. H otels
   throughout the island were purchasing water trucked to them in tankers, while entire
   neighborhoods w ere r elying on r ainwater, pr ivate pur chases and s torage t anks t o
   compensate for da ys-on-end without water from the utility. While the private sector
   was r ecognized a s t he e ngine of s ustainable growth f or S aint L ucia's e conomy, t he
   access of developers and hoteliers to basic services affected their interest in investing
   in the island.

   which was the Government's strategy for the management and long term operation of

   been a chieved. T he pr oblem of i nadequate s upply to t he e ntire i sland ( especially i n
   the north with over 50% of the population) continued to affect all sectors of activity.
   The inability of WASCO to meet the growing demands of the north was clearly due
   to inadequate infrastructure. The rapid and uncontrolled expansion of the north with
   respect to r esidential, c ommercial a nd in dustrial d evelopment, w ithout th e

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5. The project financed a focused, short-term investment program packaged around a
   turn-key contract, in order to ensure full completion in a timely manner of critical
   infrastructure works aiming to achieve the following objectives:
   (i) Alleviate the water shortage in the north of the country, by supplying water to the
        entire north of the island with a more efficient, continuous and reliable service;
        and
   (ii) Implement urgent investments that would result in additional revenues, reduce the
        likelihood of commercial users abandoning the system6 and improve the potential
        of a successfully planned partnership between the GoSL and the private sector.

   including r esidential, c ommercial, i ndustrial consumers t otaling about 86,000
   residents.

1.5 Original Components

6. The Project had two components (details on each component in annex 2)
   (i) Component A: Infrastructure Improvement Works: This component includes the
       following:
       · John Compton Dam Pumping Station Upgrade (16% of project cost, USD
           1.76 million)
       · Roseau System Raw Water Gravity Transmission Pipeline Improvement (26%
           of project cost, USD 2.91 million)
       · Theobalds WTP Upgrade and Expansion (20% of project cost, USD 2.27
           million)
       · Morne Bocage Distribution System Upgrade (28% of project cost, USD 3.13
           million)

      (ii) Component B : T echnical A ssistance a nd P roject M anagement (9% o f project
           cost, US$ 1.04 m illion): This component financed consultancies, equipment and

      financed by the project were considered the best alternative and technically sound for
      Bank f inancing10. Funds from t he W ater S ector Reform TAL were us ed to finance
      the pr eliminary d esign of t he w orks a nd e laborate t ender doc uments. Given t hat

      documents were prepared with full involvement of WASCO staff. Project design was
      kept s traightforward a nd r ealistic f or t his t ype of w orks. In t he i nterim, t he P roject
      was taken to the Bank's Board and approved on May 19, 2005, within 2.1 months of
      PCN review. At that time, the preliminary designs and tender documents were already
      underway and the project was formally launched on June 7, 2005.

2.2 Implementation

9. Implementation pr oceeded a t a r apid r ate. C onsultants hi red dur ing pr oject
    preparation c ompleted t he pr eliminary design and t ender doc uments f or a t urnkey
    contract with the support of WASCO. The project went to tender in September 2005
    and t enders w ere evaluated b y November 2005. T hree bi ds w ere r eceived a nd
    evaluated. T he Government e ntered i nto n egotiations w ith t he s uccessful bi dder i n
    January 2006 a nd a c ontract w as s igned on M arch 17, 2006. T he c ontract dur ation
    was set at 1 year, given the GoSL's commitment to hosting the CWC 2007 from late
    March 2007, w hich was considered as the deadline for the significant completion of
    some key works under the contract. It was acknowledged that this was ambitious but
    the contractor indicated commitment to the task and willing to provide the necessary
    resources for the timely completion of the works.
10. Detailed designs were prepared and approved in parallel with the commencement of
    some w orks. T he c ontractor de veloped d ay and ni ght c rews t o ge t t he w orks
    implemented according to the ambitious schedule. The Project Coordinating Unit and
    WASCO f acilitated i mplementation, w hen required, and t here was s trong
    coordination be tween t he Bank t eam, t he di fferent G overnment c ounterparts a nd
    consultants a nd c ontractors. T he pr oject i s pe rceived i n t he c ountry11 as a m odel

    both the Bank team and the counterparts.
11. The two major issues affecting implementation were :
    (i) Timely delivery of overseas procured items;

   This study indicated that the alternative to be financed by the project will not only improve the level of
service, but will also improve the integrity of the system for the long term at a lower cost than the
alternative considered, which was desalination .
10
   The project finally was designed to increase the capacity of the Roseau system from 6 to 10 million
gallons per day (MGD) by upgrading existing infrastructure (transmission, treatment, pumping) that
follows the dam.

11
     As mentioned in the last Country Portfolio review of March 2009


                                                       9
    (ii) Inadequate skilled labor force in Saint Lucia resulting in over 80% of contractor's
         technical staff coming in from India, Trinidad and Guyana. The GoSL facilitated
         this by issuing the requisite work permits despite local pressure to do otherwise.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

13. A results framework was included in the PAD with clear details on arrangements for
    results m onitoring. T he P DO, i ntermediate out comes a nd i ndicators w ere clearly
    defined a nd a b aseline value w as e stablished d uring pr eparation or w ithin t he f irst
    year of project implementation. Though at the time WASCO was considered to have
    a good enough system to be able to keep a good record for collection of management
    and consumer information going forward, results in this area have been mixed. Whilst
    monitoring and reporting improvement in the level of service in the North (the main
    Project O utcome Indicator) w as t horough a nd r elatively s traightforward t hroughout,
    WASCO has been unable to provide specific data regarding the sales to commercial
    users i n t he North (one of t he five Intermediate Outcome Indicators) b y the t ime of
    the w riting of t his ICR, given t he c urrent w eakness of i ts i nformation m anagement
    systems. S ee s ection 3.2, on out come a chievement, f or a c omplete s ummary of t he

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

14. The P roject was classified a s an E nvironmental C ategory B, as r esult of t he l arge
     scale e xcavations e xpected dur ing t he i nstallation of t he pi pelines. During t he
     planning p hase o f t he p roject, E nvironmental an d S ocial A ssessments w ere carried
     out and i ssues regarding t hem were addressed and well m anaged. S ome of t he ke y
     aspects were:
     (i) With r espect t o l arge s cale ex cavation, t his w as d one i ncrementally w ith
         installation of pipelines and temporary reinstatement being done on a daily basis.
         As such there was minimal disruption to residents in project areas as well as there
         were no a dverse environmental impacts. Formal and verbal communication with
         residents pr eceded t he implementation of w ork a nd a lternative t ransportation
         routes w ere pr ovided w hen c ertain s ections of t he r oadway were bl ocked t o

        Dams w as t riggered. Although t he p roject di d not i nvolve m odification of t he
        existing dam, it was necessary to ascertain the integrity of the dam as the success
        of t he pr oject w as hi nged on t he a bility of W ASCO t o a bstract w ater f rom t his
        dam. An analysis of the dam safety was undertaken by the supervising consultant.
        The i ntegrity of t he da m w as f ound t o be i ntact a s w ell a s t he s torage c apacity.
        The assessment of the dam also included options for increasing its capacity in the
        future. A more recent assessment of the capacity of the dam has determined that
        there is a need to desilt the dam in the immediate future to prevent the live storage
        from being reduced significantly.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

18. The main objective of the project was to meet the urgent water supply requirements
    explicitly in the context of a delayed PSP transaction for the water sector. This project
    aimed t o j umpstart the future i nvestment pr ogram a nd t he c ompleted works w ere
    expected to be maintained by the future mixed water company introduced through a
    successful P SP t ransaction. C urrently, t he w orks a re ope rated a nd m aintained b y
    WASCO. A ny other follow up a ctivity, improvements or upgrade would need to be
    part of the company's operations and maintenance.

    project ach ieved i ts m ain o bjectives ef fectively and ef ficiently within a very s hort
    timeframe and before its closing date. This is a particularly outstanding performance
    for the Caribbean region, where project are often extended, and would usually merit
    an ove rall out come r ating of hi ghly s atisfactory. H owever, g iven t he c urrent
    deteriorating financial and operational situation at WASCO and the uncertainties as to
    its f uture m anagement a rrangements ( see R isk t o D evelopment O utcome s ection),
    which pose a risk to the sustainability of the investments and final project objective,
    the overall outcome rating of Satisfactory is considered more appropriate.

    the project are presented in annex 2. Based on the information provided by WASCO,
    around 46% of the communities affected were classified as lower income. Moreover,
    at the time of appraisal, by taking on this critical project, the Government was able to
    leverage t he Bank as a pa rtner i n s eeking a nd obt aining grant f unds f or poor
    community connections by the European Union Water Fund. Originally identified as
    a target for t his project because o f i ts underserved poor popul ation, water s upply t o

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

26. Based on t he customer r eporting s ystem at W ASCO, and also i nterviews conducted
    by t he ICR m ain a uthor dur ing t he pr eparation of t he r eport, t he f eedback f rom t he
    customers w as e xtremely positive a nd i ncluded pl enty of a necdotal i nformation on
    improvement of service levels since the implementation of the project. In general, the
    population was favorably surprised that after such a long time there was a continuous
    supply of w ater. W ASCO ha s r eported calls from c ustomers congratulating t he
    company a nd e xpressing s atisfaction w ith t he services. Annexes 2 a nd 6 f urther
    illustrate the impact of the improved level of service on the beneficiary communities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

28. Given t he t ight pr oject i mplementation s chedule, r eview of on going works a nd
    documents and no obj ections were processed under a fast-track mode whilst keeping
    top technical quality control. During supervision the Bank also played a key role in

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

30. GoSL showed firm commitment to achieving project objectives from the onset. The
    GoSL r ecognized t he c ritical ne eds of t he c ountry, i nitiated pr oject pr eparation a nd
    requested B ank's s upport. T he pr oject i mplementation pe riod s pread ove r a g eneral
    election in which there was a ch ange of Government. D espite the change, there was
    continued commitment from the new GoSL to the project objectives, and thus the best
    interest of t he popul ation. T he G overnment a ssumed pa rt of t he f inal c ost i ncreases
    and so increased their contribution significantly. A lthough the GoSL's performance
    was c ommendable with regards t o t he i mplementation of t he w orks f inanced und er
    this project, the PSP transaction is currently being re-considered, following the failure
    to award in the last bidding process, which was abandoned due to legal concerns and
    ultimately a lack of consensus within the Cabinet with regards to the structure for the
    PPP. A s atisfactory r ating i s c onsidered a ppropriate g iven t his s hortcoming, a s t he

6. Lessons Learned

33. Value and effectiveness of having two standalone water operations: The project was
    a highly successful one from an investment perspective. However, it was designed as
    a complement to the Government's strategy for sector reform (which at the time was
    partnering w ith a s pecialized pr ivate ope rator) s upported b y an on going Bank T AL
    project. The investment project re-engaged the Government in the dialogue with the
    Bank for sector reform and also increased the likelihood of a successful completion of
    the P SP tr ansaction b y ma king th e o peration mo re attractive for in ternational
    operators. However, it could be argued that by resolving the pressing water issues in
    terms of a n i mproved l evel of s ervice a nd s ecured s upply, t he ur gency of de cision
    making ove r a di fficult reform w as r educed. S ome l essons f or c onsideration i n t his
    context are:

   ·   The Bank tried to minimize the risk of dispersed focus and efforts by staffing the
       Bank t eams a ssigned t o bot h pr ojects t o ove rlap a nd a dvise t he GoSL a s one
       seamless team. This should have been replicated at the local level by having one
       single PIU coordinating with all water sector stakeholders;
   ·   An al ternative t hat can be ex plored t o m aximize B ank's as sistance, n oting t hat
       this is n ot a lways p ossible a s f unding availability a nd timin g is a c onstraint,
       particularly i n IDA co untries, i s a p rogrammatic an d w ider s ector approach,
       combining TA and investment with clear links and objective milestones in terms
       of performance to access the financing under the program;
   ·   Given the lack of real linkages (in terms of financing) between the two operations,
       the results monitoring framework of the investment project could have considered
       performance in dicators only r elated to th e imp lementation o f th e in vestment
       project financed by the loan and credits, i.e. within its control and influence;
   ·   In hindsight, considering that the PSP eventually did not go through, the project
       as a s tandalone pr oject c ould ha ve c onsidered a lternative r outes f or t he
       institutional strengthening of WASCO vis-a-vis the sustainability of the services
       and investments in its risk analysis and proposed mitigation measures.

34. The role of WASCO: WASCO's technical contribution to the project was strong, but
    project implementation could have involved more WASCO staff from the operations
    and c ommercial de partments t o e nsure t he ut ility w ould be able t o f ully r eap t he
    benefits of the operation in terms of increased revenue. Whilst levels of service have
    improved s ignificantly, current c ollection r atios i n t he nor th m ust be i mproved i n

Additional financing was approved in 2006 to accommodate price adjustments due to: (i)
a more detailed engineering analyses of the works resulting in cost changes; (ii) the actual
cost of the turnkey contract being higher than initially estimated; (iii) an increase in the
contingency cost; a nd ( iv) s ignificant i ncreases i n f uel a nd c onstruction c osts s ince

Government requested additional funding from IDA.

The unexpected increase in the cost of works explains 79 percent of the additional
financing while the remaining 21 percent was due to a higher contingency provision,
which was used to protect the project against the risks associated with hurricanes and
other unforeseen costs and modifications to technical specifications.

1. Country background

Saint Lucia is part of the Windward Islands. The interior of the island is mountainous, but
there is more flat land than in Dominica, Grenada, or Saint Vincent. The soil is generally
fertile a nd t he ba nana i ndustry ( and ot her a griculture pr oducts) m akes Saint Lucia t he
biggest exporter of a gricultural pr oducts a mong t he O ECS m ember countries. T he
pleasant c limate a nd t he s andy be aches h ave e ncouraged t he d evelopment of t ourism,
which ha s b ecome t he main f oreign exchange earner i n t he economy i n r ecent years.
Despite r elatively s trong s ocial i ndicators a nd a s table e conomy, pove rty a nd

25 pe rcent of t he popul ation l ives be low t he l ocally de fined pove rty line w hile t he
unemployment rate is around 19 percent.
Saint Lucia experienced a marked decline in economic growth during the 1990s and early
2000s. A verage G DP growth de clined from 6.5 pe rcent pe r year i n t he 1980s t o 2.5
percent i n t he 1990s and - 0.5 pe rcent du ring 20 00-03. T his m arked s lowdown w as t he
result of exogenous shocks (the 9/11 events, the global economic slowdown and a severe
drought in 2001) as well as increased competition from lower priced tourism destinations.
The most significant structural shift in the economy since 1996 ha d been the decline in
banana pr oduction as favorable m arket a ccess conditions f or ba nana e xports ha ve be en
removed. The total number of banana farmers has declined from 13,000 at the time of the
1996 Poverty Assessment Report to less than 3,000 today. This change has been reflected
in t he de clining c ontribution of a griculture t o G DP, w hich w as a round 11 pe r c ent i n
1995 failing to around 5 per cent in 2003.

result, t he ove rall f iscal de ficit ( before gr ants) i ncreased f rom - 1.2 pe rcent of G DP i n
1999 to -8.9 percent in 2002 and the public sector debt rose from 39.5 percent of GDP in
1999 to 65.2 percent in 2002.

However, de spite t he i mprovement i n f iscal ba lances, t he t otal publ ic s ector de bt a s a

this context, the water and sanitation sector had emerged as a key factor in the economic
development of Saint Lucia.

2. Sector issues

Despite a concerted effort in 2000 t o turn around the state water utility, Saint Lucia was
suffering once again from a crisis of confidence and performance in the water sector. The
government owned utility which controls nearly all water and sanitation services on t he
island, t he W ater an d Sewerage C ompany ( WASCO), h ad ceas ed t o m ake cap ital
investments a nd lo st th e g ood w ill o f its d omestic a nd c ommercial consumers d ue to
severe shortages, miss-billings and poor quality of service. Hotels throughout the island
were purchasing water trucked to them in tankers while entire neighborhoods are relying
on rainwater, private purchases and storage tanks to compensate for days-on-end without
water from the utility. Exacerbating the situation, a s evere dry season over the last year
had c ompounded e xisting w ater s hortage pr oblems a ffecting t he qua lity of l ife of t he
country's 161,000 pe ople. D uring 2003, W ASCO w as f orced t o i mplement s trict w ater
allocation s chedules, i sland w ide. T hese pr oblems ha ve a t remendous impact on t he
economy of the country and the residents' quality of life and have the potential to become
severe if they are left unattended.
In s ummary, t he m ain f inancial a nd ope rational i ssues f aced b y t he w ater s ector w ere
(and still are in 2009) the following:
(i) Insufficient cash flow t o co ver al l o perating and m aintenance co sts (let al one
      servicing dept and maintaining a sustainable level of investments);
(ii) Decrepit state of the utility's assets which are in dire need of a capital infusion;
(iii) Insufficient s upply o f t reated w ater to me et current d emand le ading to w ater
      shortages-particularly i n t he popul ation a nd resort c enters of t he nor th; T his ha s
      been alleviated by the implementation of the present project
(iv) Prospects for further increase in demand for water as a result of the booming tourist
      industry and upturn in over-all economic growth;
(v) Loss of good will on the part of consumers due to the further decline in service after
      the 2000 tariff increase.
The G overnment a nd t he W orld B ank a gree t hat t his s ituation ha s grown out of t he
legacy of underinvestment in assets, insufficient average tariffs over the past decades and
severe hum an resource constraints. W hile W ASCO ha s a ttempted t o t urn a round i ts
performance o ver t he l ast f ew years, t he u tility h as b een u nable t o confront t hat l egacy
and, instead, has seen its services and assets deteriorate further.
Defining characteristics of Saint Lucia's Water Sector
Dependency on surface water sources. Saint Lucia's s upply of water i s de pendent on
surface sources. As a result, the occurrence of rainfall events has a significant impact on
the ability of the company to provide an adequate water supply. This has also forced the

17
   Interviews conducted during Project preparation by the Bank team with developers, hotel owners, the
Ministry of Tourism and the National Development Corporation revealed a heightened sense of concern
among developers that their expansion plans would not be feasible due to the inability of the country to
provide water connections, reliable service and other basic infrastructure such as access roads.

country includes 67 pum ping s tations, all o f t hem i n a s ignificant l evel of deterioration
and without backup capacity. Water rationing and lack of adequate service is more acute
now in the south of the island.
Low reliability of water services. Water s upply s hortages w ere p roving t o be a
development bottleneck in the north for the hotel sector and a major impact on the quality
of l ife of t he popul ation i n general. W ater s upply interruptions i n S aint Lucia a re m ore
severe as el evation i ncreases; i n s ome cas es co mmunities r eceive w ater o nly o nce p er

purchase s torage t anks a nd a re una ble t o s tore m inimum s upply r equirements w hen

In a ddition, la ck o f c ustomer a nd s ales d ata h as le d to a n in crease in mis -billings,
disaffected customers and decreasing rates of collection.
Non-revenue water and poor cost recovery. Consumption by 30 pe rcent of WASCO's
consumers is based on estimated rather than metered consumption. Non-revenue water is
approximately 44 percent of water production in the north. The estimated level of leakage
for W ASCO a ccounts f or 36 pe rcent of w ater pr oduction. In a ddition t o t he m entioned
critical problems, WASCO has an inefficient commercial management and billing system
that c ontribute t o a poo r c ost r ecovery. Around 74 pe rcent of active connections w ere
billed on a metered basis in 2003.
Long-term investments in sanitation infrastructure. In a ddition t o l ong-term s upply
needs, improved collection and treatment of wastewater will require considerable capital
investment in the tens of millions of US dollars-in the 10 to 15 years ahead. Depending
upon t he w illingness a nd a bility of c onsumers t o pa y f or s ewerage a nd w astewater
services through increased user fees, a portion of that capital cost is likely to be required
from public funds.

3. Government's strategy

Since 2000, t he W orld Bank ha d be en w orking w ith t he G overnment of S aint L ucia
through a T echnical Assistance Loan for Sector Reform to pursue a strategy that would
leverage pr ivate s ector f inancing a nd know -how t o r each a s ustainable s olution f or t he
sector. As a result of that project's Private Sector Development (PSD) Strategy and direct
discussions with the World Bank, the Government of Saint Lucia had decided to pursue a
public-private partnership (PPP) for the utility. The Bank and the Government had agreed
upon a s tructure f or a m ixed c apital c ompany expected t o be capitalized w ith t he
immediate investment needs of the utility. In this way, the Government could break from

analysis of the investment activities to be financed under the project. The full results are

In t he f inancial a nalysis, t he pr oject w as appraised m easuring i ts f low of c osts a nd
benefits at market prices. The financial evaluation was undertaken with and without the
project being transferred in grants from the Government to the utility. Under the scenario
in which WASCO receives the investment costs as a full subsidy from the government,
the results show extremely high financial viability of the project with a financial IRR of
172 pe rcent a nd a ne t b enefit of a bout E C$23 m illion. I n c ase no i nvestment s ubsidy
would be granted, the project would still be financially viable as financial benefits exceed
financial costs - with a net benefit of EC$5 million and a financial IRR of 15 percent.
The economic feasibility of the project was appraised converting financial cash flows into
economic cash flows by converting to economic prices, that is, by subtracting taxes and
adding subsidies to financial costs. The economic benefits were calculated as the avoided
costs of w ater r ationing t o c apture t he be nefits f rom e xpected i mprovements i n t he

the c ontext o f th is p roject; w hile th e equally s ignificant imp rovement o n th e c ost s ide

   About 13 percent of current water demand could not be met at appraisal due to production capacity
constraints. If no investments were made to increase the production capacity, the water shortage could
reach up to 50 percent of total water demand by 2030. Alternatively, if the project was implemented,
demand could be served and coverage could increase to attain 96 percent of population.

Cost-Benefit Analysis at ICR
The model for the Cost Benefit Analysis undertaken at appraisal was utilized and updated
for this ICR. The "with" and "without" project s cenarios were modified t o consider the
final a nnual i nvestment pl an w ith a ll c ost i ncreases ( see A nnex 1 f or more de tail on
project costing) and the benefits associated with the works, which are related to increase
in supply capacity.
Given the lack of availability of updated data from WASCO on ke y variables, some key
assumptions w ere m ade to as certain t he p roject cost-effectiveness co nsidering t he final
project investment costs.
1. No operational or commercial improvement was considered other than a reduction of
    7% of t he ph ysical l osses ( from 38% t o 31% ) reflecting t he r eduction i n l eakage
    achieved through pipe replacement. Commercial losses were kept the same;
2. An i ncrease of one p ercent i n dom estic consumption was c onservatively assumed.
    The "without" pr oject s cenario c onsidered t hat w ater s ervice w ould c ontinue
    unchanged without a change in coverage levels because of the sharp increasing water
    shortages.
3. Hotel occupancy rates. These had been assumed to be 65% through project life except
    for two months during the CWC projected with 100% occupancy. They were updated
    with a ctual in formation f rom 2 005 f rom p ublic s tatistics f rom th e Ministry o f

A sample of c onsumers, w ere i nterviewed a nd a D VD w as pr oduced dur ing t he
preparation of this ICR. The following reflects consumer's views on the project impact as
extracted from this DVD:
      ·   Most customers, residential, commercial, tourism sectors all confirm an
          improvement in the level of service including a more reliable supply and
          increased water pressures.
      ·   Most customers were concerned about the sustainability wondering how long they
          were going to have the water for, not believing that the supply was finally
          reliable.
      ·   At this stage more than a year after the initial improvements there has been a
          significant increase in the level of confidence of the consumers as the supply has
          been consistent. As well the dry season 2009 has not been severe with a lot more
          rainfall than expected. As a result the demand has been very well managed and
          the need for trucking in the North as is the norm for the dry season is significantly
          reduced.
