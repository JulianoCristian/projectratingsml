development objective of the Saint\n            Lucia - Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement Project is\n            to alleviate the urgent need to improve the availability of\n            good quality drinking water in the northern section of the\n            island. Current inadequacies of the distribution system\n            coupled with the demands for growth in the region are\n            placing increasing pressure on the distribution system. This\n            environmental assessment (EA) presents environmental impacts\n            expected : potential soil erosion; interdiction of public\n            roadways; contamination of work sites with fuels and\n            hazardous materials; pollution from construction wastes;\n            noise from construction activities; dust control issues;\n            cultural historical sites; standing water and disease vector\n            production. Some of the mitigation measures are :\n            development plans for : site stabilization and erosion\n            control; traffic management; construction waste management;\n            oil and hazardous materials management; and workers\n            sanitation plan. For dust control wet roads with water;\n            prohibit long-term accumulation of standing water suitable\n            for mosquito reproduction; identify lands where crops will\n            be removed for construction and negotiate with farmer and\n            pay appropriate compensation; and finally. Dispose of fuels\n            and used containers in accordance with St. Lucia's law"}, "docdt": "2005-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
