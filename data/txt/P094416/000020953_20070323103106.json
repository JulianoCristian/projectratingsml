The reasons for the\n            request for additional financing are: the actual cost of the\n            bids received for the turnkey contract; contingencies\n            recommended by the technical consultants to the project; and\n            an increase in fuel and construction costs since the\n            original project appraisal estimates. The additional\n            financing request does not entail changes to the\n            Project's objectives. The overall scope of the project\n            to be financed with IBRD and IDA funds (including the\n            additional financing) remains the same as defined in the\n            PAD. The project supports the Government of Saint\n            Lucia's agenda for the water sector, which establishes\n            as a priority the provision of reliable service to meet\n            demand from population as well as to facilitate investment\n            from hoteliers and developers in the north region. The\n            project has two components: (i) Infrastructure Improvement\n            Works; and (ii) Technical Assistance and Project Management."}, "docdt": "2007-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
