The\n            project elements are summarized below: (a) dam and storage\n            reservoir at the Bacurato site with minimum provision for\n            adding hydroelectric power facilities in the future; (b)\n            access road to the site and a camp to house construction and\n            operating personnel; (c) a diversion dam at the Sinaloa de\n            Leyva site to divert water to main canals on each side of\n            the river; (d) wells to augment surface water supply; (e) a\n            concrete-lined irrigation distribution system of main\n            canals, laterals, and sublaterals and devices to measure\n            water delivery; (f) a complete drainage system of main and\n            secondary drains; (g) roads along canals and drains for\n            operation and maintenance and for use by farmers; (h) houses\n            for ditch riders, a telephone network, gauging stations and\n            project facilities to serve as operating headquarters; (i)\n            land clearing and leveling; and, (j) intensive extension\n            service during initial period of project. This report\n            comprises two impact evaluation reports for Mexico an\n            Morocco, and an overview which synthesizes the findings of\n            both impact evaluations regarding the extent of, and reasons\n            for, sustainability a compares the impact of irrigation\n            systems design on project performanc striking feature of all\n            four projects is the lower agricultural and ec performance\n            than that estimated at the time of audit. Weaker commodity\n            an inadequate development approach in one project, lower\n            than expected efficiencies, insufficient attention to\n            operation and maintenance in a projects, and damage to the\n            environment and natural resources have bee main factors\n            affecting performance. However, with one exception, which\n            performed poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of\n            technology respect of both irrigation practice and\n            agricultural productivity has continued to be sustained in\n            the other three projects."}, "docdt": "1974-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
