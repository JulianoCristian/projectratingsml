environmental adversity may\n            occur, and, stipulates that if major impacts are identified,\n            an environmental assessment will be prepared, with\n            extensive, and detailed screening criteria. Environmental\n            effects, and mitigation measures are as follows. Road\n            planning, and design should take into account the terrain,\n            and traffic volume, to minimize excessive earthworks, and\n            disruption to local people; which should include an\n            appropriate number of bridges, and culverts, and, the\n            effects of road widening on existing roadside tree-lines,\n            could be reduced by widening only one side, retaining trees\n            on the other. Engineering design should avoid adversity on\n            natural habitats, wildlife, and forestry, as well as\n            cultural heritage sites. Installation of sound barriers, and\n            protective forest belts, will abate noise, and air pollution\n            as a result of construction, while bituminous surfacing will\n            prevent dust pollution, namely on gravel roads sections\n            traversing settlements. Provisions regarding safety, include\n            traffic signaling, safe crossings, and fences. Vegetative\n            propagation will preserve the buffer zone between the road,\n            and surface water bodies, and, adequate design of culverts,\n            and road drainage will be ensured to minimize flooding, and\n            adversity on existing irrigation systems, prevent water\n            contamination, and contain soil erosion. Resettlement issues\n            are specifically addressed in the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)."}, "docdt": "1998-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
