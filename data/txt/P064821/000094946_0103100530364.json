Road Maintenance Project for Laos\n            promotes the sustainable preservation of the national road\n            network (NRN) through the development and implementation of\n            financing and management maintenance systems; and designs\n            and tests, in four selected provinces, financing and\n            management systems for the sustainable maintenance of the\n            local road network (LRN). There are eight project\n            components. The first component finances periodic\n            maintenance works on various maintainable sections of the\n            NRN and LRN. The second component finances routine emergency\n            works. The third component supports a strategy to reduce\n            overloading on the road network and provides works, weighing\n            equipment and specialized services that promote policy\n            reforms, partnership between the government and the\n            transport industry, and capacity building. The fourth\n            component completes the establishment of the road management\n            system. The fifth component consists of providing\n            specialized consultants that will assist the Road\n            Maintenance Advisory Board and its Secretariat in carrying\n            out their activities. The sixth component develops\n            institutional capacity to manage projects by improving\n            project preparation, execution, and monitoring, and by\n            developing a strategy to improve the performance of the\n            local contracting and consulting industry. The eighth\n            component fosters the involvement of road users and\n            beneficiaries in delivering and managing road maintenance activities."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
