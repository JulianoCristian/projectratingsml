performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the political economy must be understood and given due\n            consideration because it affects the capacity of the\n            authorities to implement their own program. The size and\n            complexity of the policy matrix must be reasonable, and\n            feasibly balanced with the government's program and\n            institutional capacity. A strong focus on the results\n            framework facilitates stock-taking of achievements during\n            program implementation. The program matrix including the set\n            of indicative outcomes facilitated the assessment of\n            progress, provided a sound basis for and policy dialogue.\n            Complex lending operations require strong field presence and\n            cross-sector collaboration by the Bank team. In an\n            environment where implementation capacity is weak,\n            operations like the PRSC series require day-to-day\n            supervision and strong crosssectoral collaboration within\n            the Bank on the policy agenda to deliver the expected\n            outcomes of the lending program."}, "docdt": "2011-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
