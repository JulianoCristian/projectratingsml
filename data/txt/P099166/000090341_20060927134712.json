is intended to bolster and deepen\n            those efforts.

To this end, the proposed PRSC will support\n            selective areas of the Government's reform agenda, as\n            outlined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and\n            the European Union (EU)-Moldova action plan, thereby\n            complementing and reinforcing other Bank Group programs in\n            Moldova, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-supported\n            Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other donor\n            activities. Closely aligned with the Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS), the PRSC will support the EGPRSP objectives\n            of: Improving the Investment Climate; Improving the\n            Efficiency and Management of Public Resources; and\n            Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems."}, "docdt": "2006-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
