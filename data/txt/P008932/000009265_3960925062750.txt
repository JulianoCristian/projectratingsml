PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Fruit
and Vegetable Project in Turkey, for which loan 1967-TU in the amount of
US$40.00 million was approved on April  6,  1981.   The loan vas closed on
June  30,  1986  after  cancellation   of  US$10.9  million  and  the  last
disbursement was on December 31, 1986.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division,
Country Department I of the Eutope, Middle East and North Africa Regional
Office, in cooperation with the PAO/World Bank 0ooperative Programme. The
PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.
This PCR wa read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on August 14, 1989 for comments, but

FROECT COPLTIO  AOR
SECOND FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PROJECT
(LOAN 1967-TU)
EVALIAION SUKRY
Introductaon and Objectives
Turkish climate favors production of horticultural crops and the
above project was designed to take advantage of apparent export opportunities
in this field through provision of an appropriate marketing organization, and
technical assistance in packaging, quality control and grading, as well as
credit, technical services and training to expand and improve produx.tion.  The
project also included credit for agroindustry working capital and financing of
the preparation of a subsector master plan.
nlmglementatijpn gm,xrience
Tes project was carried out during a period of major economic
disruptions, significant changes in Government policies, and reorganization of
some of the intended implementing agencies. While the investments actually
made under the project had high economic returns, demand for production and
agroindustry credit was significantly less than anticipated. About 251 of the
loan was cancelled. About 751 of the farm credit employed was used for
operational credit, while investment credit for much longer gestating
activities such as establishment of orchards and building of greenhouses was
only 251 of what had been expected. This probably reflects farmer reluctance
to make longer term investments during a period of high and fluctuating
inflation, rapid currency depreciation, and overall economic uncertainty. The
marketing component was a failure, in part due to a change in Government
policy from an intervertionist orientation to one envisaging a greater role
for the trading houses and reduced Government involvement. The Government and
the Bank were slow to recognize that the project's marketing approach no
longer fit current liberalization policies. While the reorganization of the
Ministry of Agriculture, including the merger of various specialized extension
services, is expected to be beneficial over the longer run, the dissolution
during the project period of the agency responsible for coordinating the
implementation of support services and technical training clearly had acme
disruptive effects on the implementation of various project components.
Main Lessons Learned
Farmers are unlikely to makce long-term investments (such as
orchards) at times of unstable and unpredictable economic movements. In
addition, when credit is available through several programs, the source that
provides the best terms with least difficult requirements is likely to
prevail. Working with the Agricultural Bank to raise the technical



- v -
requirements and appraisal capability under its normal lending program would
have been a better strategy than opening a new credit program while the old
one continued in operation. At times of major economic changes or significant
changes in Government policy orientation, ongoing projects should be reviewed
to see whether the project design stould be modified in light of changed
circumstances. In any case, issues of how and in what capacity Government can
best promote export marketing require careful consideration and involvement of
specialized marketing expertise during project implomentation as well as
during appraisal.

TURKEY
SECNON FRUIT AND VEGETABL! PROJ!CT
COMPLETTON RFPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The Turkish climate favours the production of horticultural  crops.
Along the Mediterranean coast, citrus, grapes and early vegetables are
predominant. Grapes. satsamas, peaches, apples and open field vegetables are
grown in the Aegean region. The Marmara region produces peaches, apricots
and artichokes. In Central Anatolia, apples, pears, peaches, apricots and
winter vegetables occupy most of the horticulturally cropped area. These
seasonal aspects and Turkey's geographical location appear to give it a
long-term comparative advantage in the export, particularly to Middle
Eastern  and  European  m-rkets  vis-a-vis  most  of  its  potential   major
competitors. Turkey has been exporting to these markets but in a limited way
and in the past many export opportunities have been missed because of
quality problems and unreliable delivery. Moreover, the quantities of fruit
and vegetables available for export had been decreasing during the 1970s and
in 1978 Bank projections on growth rates of production and demand suggested
that Turkey would become a net importer by the mid-1980s. It was concluded,
however, that production levels higher than projected seemed possible.
Additional orchard development could be undertaken in certain areas and
vegetable output could be increased faster than projected if more attention
were paid to  provide,  i=nte   alia.  marketing  information  and  technical
advice.
1.2      A  rapid  expansion  of  exports  and emphasis on quickly gestating
projects were two major features of the policy package of economic recovery
announced by the Turkish Government in early 1980. A good opportunity within
the agricultural sector for initiating these interrelated measures was then
believed to be offered by the horticultural subsector. The Second Fruit and
Vegetable Project was therefore designed to go beyond the objectives of the
First Project which concentrated on citrus production in three provinces and
provision of transport, processing and packing facilities. By providing for
an institutional framework that would rationalize the marketing of fresh
fruit and vegetables and that would at the same time provide technical
assistance to exporters in the areas of packaging, quality control and
grading of other needed services, the Second Project was expected to
facilitate a substantial and rapid increase in exports from existing
production. The marketing organization was also to facilitate the export of
project production, which would derive from the use of improved cultivars
and/or good extension supervision and therefore be of a higher average
quality at the farmgate than current production and therefore be more
amenable for export.
1.3      At the time it was felt that although Turkey had some disadvantages
vis-i-vis its competitors on the EEC market with regard to tariffs and
transport cost, it could significantly increase its exports of off-season
vegetables and fruits to the EEC countries. On the other hand, it appeared
to be possible that increasing demand for traditior        uits and  vegetables
such as apples and oranges, by East European and Middle East countries could
be met from Turkish supplies. Until then, Turkey's export potential had been
largely underutilized for several reasons, both on the production and
marketing sides. On the production side, growing techniques were found to be
backward,   productijon  not  oriented  toward  exrort  and  quality  control
unsatisfactory. Marketing organization was considered to be primitive with



-2-
systemat4A and timely knowledge about export markets lacking ar.d with no
link between marketing and production such that production and post-harvest
handling could be planned with close attention to the ultimate market
requirements. Hence, it was considered essential to establish a central
marketing board or agency responsible for dealing with major aspects of
fruits and vegetable production and market4ng.
II. PROJECT FGRMULATION
A. Proiect Origin and Prgnaration
2.1      At several meetings with  Bank  missions  supervising  the  'Turkey
Fruit and Vegetable Export Project*, i.e. the first project (Loan/Credit
762/257-TU). Turkish officials expressed a strong interest in a second
project that would continue the development of the fruit and vegetable
subsector through an integrated effort. In February 1978,-- a Bank mission
visited Turkey to assess the possibilities for a project and to assist the
General Directorate of the Fruit and Vegetable Export Projects (MEYSEB)
within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) in preparing it. A
detailed outline was provided by the Mission. Since project preparation
would require expertise in modern horticultural production methods as well
as in export marketing, it was agreed that MEYSEB employ local and foreign
consultants and that it would involve all agencies concerned.
2.2      MEYSEB  submitted the draft preparation report to the Bank in early
May 1979. Under the project a concentrated effort would be made to increase
fruit and vegetable production, originally in four Mediterranean provinces,
by strengthening applied research and extension and by providing production
and marketing credit to growers in the area. At the same time, the project
would assist the Turkish Govenment in establishing an efficient marketing
organization on a country-wide basis. This agency would have to be involved
in three aspects: production planning (especially for export), post-harvest
handling and marketing. If necessary credit could be provided to finance
processing and marketing as well as transportation facilities in the project
area. During preparation and following Bank recommendations, the project
area had been expanded to cover a total of ten provinces.
2.3      In preparing the draft report, MEYSEB did not  consult  with  other
agencies involved as had been agreed. A Bank mission of October 1979 that
explored the possible involvement of commercial banks in the project,
reported that the Agricultural Bank (TCZB did not agree with the proposal
and threatened not 'Wo be involved in the project if lending for agro-
industries  was  implemented  through  other banks and not TCZB. The mission
4lso followed-up on organizational aspects of the proiect and found that
institutional arrangements for the proposed project were not fully agreed
upon among concerned Turkish agencies. Ouring November 1979. the Turkish
Cabinet changed and a new cadre of civil servants was instituted. MEYSEB was
no exception. A pre-appraisal mission which visited Turkey in February 1980
found the new MEYSEB administration eager to implement the proposed project
and ready to cooperate with other agencies. This cooperation, especially
within MAF was translated into protocols to coordinate applied research,
extension, plant protection and training in horticultural activities related
to   the  project.  However,  marketing  organization  and  roles  of  other
cooperating agencies were not clear. All export promotion activities had
been moved from the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of Commerce to the
Prime Minister's Office.

B. Anoraisal and Neantiations
2.4      The project was appraised in June/July 1980 by a Bank mission which
consisted   of   an  horticulturist, an  agricultural  credit  expert,  two
economists,  an  agro-industries  exoert  and  an   agricultural   marketing
specialist. As agreed during negotiations which took place in February 1981.
the project, to be carried out in the provinces of Adana. Amasya, Antalya,
Bursa, Hatay, Icel, Izmir. Kayseri, Mugla and Tokat. included the following
components:
a) AaCicultural Credit. Investment credit to private farmers for (i)
nurseries establishment (4 citrus and 3 non-citrus nurseries with
an annual production capacity of 70,000 budlings); (ii) orchards
establishment (700 citrus and 550 non-citrus orchards of about
2.5 ha each and 2,000 small orchards of about 0.5 ha each to be
interplanted with vegetables during the establishment period) and
vineyards establishment (about 100 of 2.5 ha each); (iii) vegetable
farm   establishment   (50   glass   greenhouses  and  100  plastic
greenhouses of 0.5 ha each to intensify vegetable cultivation and
produce early vegetables). Production credit for (i) producing
orchards (1,500 citrus and 1.000 non-citrus of 2.5 ha each),- (ii)
existing greenhouses (50 of 0.5 ha each), (iii) plastic greenhouses
(125 of 0.5 ha each) and (iv) vegetable farms (35!0 low tun. els of
0.5 ha each and o,n field vegetables 5'0 farms of 1.0 ha each) to
improve yields and the quality of horticultural produce from
existing farms.
b) Technical  Suanort  Services  and  Trainina.  To  implement applied
research and the expansion of extension and training programmes
envisaged under the project, finance for the employment of five
internationally-recruited horticultural production specialists for
three years and one each in the following areas: nurseries, citrus.
pome fruits, stone fruits and early vegetables. Training programmes
would be conducted for SMS (110), foremen (289) and technicians
(240) of MEYSEB, GDAA, TCZB and cooperating research institutes.
c) Agro-industries Workina Canital. Finance to augment TCZB s working
capital fund for agro-industries and assist it to meet the seasonal
direct and imputed foreign exchange requirement of fruit and
vegetable storage, processing and marketing for such items as
cartons, boxes, electric power, fuel and transport cost.
d) Marketing Oraanisation. Funds to support new institution building
through the establishment of four regional marketing corporations
(RMCs) under the umbrella of a central marketing organization
(CMO). Funds for the employment of five internationally-recruited
experts to assist the CMO and RMCs in each of the following key
areas:    general    management,   transport,   marketing.   market
intelligence  and  cold  storage.   Funds   also   for   short-term
consultants (three to six months) to be engaged to promote services
and train Turkish staff and entrepreneurs in the areas of packaging
and promotion.
e) Master Plan for the Subsectjr. Finance for the preparation through
SPO of a master plan and studies for the fruit and vegetable
subsector by internationally-recruited consultants (8 mlm of highly
specialized expertise and about 1,349  m/m  of  general  specialist
expertise,



-4-
2.5      Proigct  Oraanization.  Although  SPO's  mandate in project-related
matters had been considerably strenathened under the new government, it was
recognized that its ability tV undertake management of each project
component was limited by the size of its staff and it was agreed that SPO
would confine its role to general project coordination where other agencies
are involved and each agency would communicate directly with the Bank on
withdrawal and procurement matters exceDt for the submission of six-monthly
progress reports whicn would be routed t: the Bank through SPO
2.6      MEYSEB was to be responsible for coordinating the implementation of
the technical support services and training component according to signed
protocols with TCZB and TOPRAKSU (agricultural credit), GOAA on behalf of TZ
(extension), GOAR and Cukurova University (applied research). TCZB was to be
the executing agency for on-farm credit aspects and, assisted by MEYSEB and
TZ with sub-loan preparation, would extend sub-loans to beneficiaries in
accordance with its rules and regulations which have been applied in other
Bank-financed projects. TCZB was also to manage the agro-industries working
capital component. In addition to overall coordination of the project, SPO
was also to promote the establishment of the RMCs and CMO through its Export
Marketing Division and would be responsible for implementing the study and
master plan component. It was to appoint a project coordinator and a staff
marketing specialist. The appraisal mission was of the view that no other
agency   could   provide  overall  coordination  of  project  activities  as
effectively as could SPO.
2.7      Timely monitoring and systematic evaluation of project achievements
was to be implemented by SPO, MEYSE8 and TCZB and measured against the
project implementation schedule. Early Bank SPN missions were to  include  a
monitoring specialist to assist executing agencies in developing monitoring
and evaluation systems and key indicators for project implementation.
2.8      During negotiations, which took place in February 1981,  assurances
were obtained from Government that:
- only farmers meeting the established lending criteria would qualify
for loans. After determination of the farmer's credit worthiness
and credit limit by TCZB, an appropriate farm development plan
would be prepared by MEYSEB's SMS or TZ's technicians who would
submit the plan to the regional manager for review. The existing
protocol between MEYSEB, TOPRAKSU and TCZB was to be appropriately
amended with respect to dates, areas of implementation etc. of the
proposed project. The Government would submit the amended protocol
to the Bank for its review and approval. The appropriateness of the
interest rates charged by TCZB for project sub-loans and other
terms and conditions were to be reviewed annually and in the light
of changing conditions by TCZB, the Government and the Bank:
- in order to provide high quality cultivars for the use of sub-
borrowers in the project, it would take all necessary measures to
facilitate procurement of improved vegetable seeds, particularly
hybrids,    and    healthy    buds   from   internationally-reputed
organizations and seed companies to meet farmers' demand;
- in order to implement applied research and' the expansion of
extension and training programmes envisaged under the project, five
internationally-recruited  horticultural   production   specialists
would   be  employed  by  MEYSEB  for  three  years,  international
recruitment of consultants would begin after negotiating and that



-5-
their appointment would be not later than January 1, 1982. The
Government had also agreed that all 28 counterparts would he
assigned and posted as indicated above not later than Septeber 30.
1981; that all in.ormation  on  horticultural  crops  reseajAch -and
extension programmes would be made available for the consultants'
use and that it would cause MEYSES to provide the consultants and
counterparts   with   adequate   transportation,   suitable  office
facilities and clerical assistance to enable them to carry out
their duties efficiently;
by  March 1st each year during the four and half-year time slice in
which  disbursements  for  the  technical  services  and   training
component are expected to occur, Government will satisfy the Bank
that adequate annual operating budget estimated to be about USS 1.0
million equivalent has been allocated to meet the needs of the
project during the forthcoming fiscal ye r. Subsequent to the end
of each corresponding Turkish fistal year. the Bank will be
provided with a summary of operating budget requested by each
agency for purposes of the project and of amounts actually
allocated and spent during the recently completed fiscal year;
for purposes of disbursement, proceeds of the  Bank  loan  will  be
incorporated into overdraft facilities, to be opened each year for
the eligible sub-borrowers by TCZB before the peak season occurs in
order to assure the timely availability of needed working capital;
the Government had also agreed that sub-borrower loan repayments
under the project, to the extent that such repayment is not
required for amortization of the subsidiary loan, will be placed in
a fund which will be rolled-over from year to year by TCZB in order
to sustain the overdraft credit facility;
five internationally-recruited consultants will be engaged  by  SPO
on or before the date of establishment of the RMCs and CHO and in
any event, not later than January 1st, 1982. Agreement was obtained
during negotiations also on the concept and functions of the CMO
and RMCs, their date of organization and the utilization of Bank
funds thereafter. Additional assurances were obtained that SPO
would draft pro-forma basic articles of incorporation and by-laws
for the RMCs and CMO. These will be transmitted for approval by the
Bank immediately following loan negotiations ard in any event not
later than July 31st, 1981. Following receipt of Sank approval, the
Government has agreed that SPO will initiate a vigorous promotional
effort amongst private exporters to ensure that the RMCs and CMO
are organized and capitalized not later than January 31st. 1982;
between 1982-1983 a master plan for  the  horticultural  sub-sector
will be prepared by internationally-recruited consultants under
terms of reference which are acceptable to the dank. Government
agreed that all consultants required to carry out this component
would be recruited through SPO not later than January 1st. 1982. It
further agreed that the progress made by the consultants will be
periodically reviewed by the SPO, which will also approve changes
in scope and work plans in consultation with the Bank as may be
required during the progress of work;
in order to provide vertical links between production and marketing
entities, SPO will establish a horticultural coordination committee
representing the following areas: applied research, extension,
production, credit and marketing to meet at least once every 6
months to review the experience of the preceding 6 months, and



-6-
identify and resolve production-marketing constraints;
- it would make available to MEYSEB, TZ and cooperating research
institutes the equivalent of USS 31.0 million (including USS 8.4
million from the proposed loan) for technical support services and
training, USS 2.3 million to SPO for the Government's financial
participation in the marketing organization and USS 2.0 million to
SPO for carrying out the studies and master plan;
- it would provide or -cause to be provided sufficient additional
funds (amounting to about USS 49.7 million of which USS 15.0 would
be FE) after the proposed loan has been disbursed to fully
implement the remainder of the nine and :ialf-year programme;
- SP0 would submit to the Bank six-monthly progress reports with
summaries from cooperating agencies. In addition, SPO would prepare
a completion report and submit it to the Sank within six months of
the roan closing date.
2.9      A  Sank  loan  of  USS 40 million was approved by the Board on 31st
March 1981. The Loan Agreement was signed on 6 April 1981 and became
effective on 4 August 1981.
2.10     The  principal  changes  incorporated  in  the final version of the
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) of March 1981 were (i) introducing a time-slice
approach to the proposed loan, which reduced the disbursement period for
Bank  funds  from  the  first  seven  years  of  the   project's   nine-year
implementation period to the first four yeirs, a reduction of the proposed
loan from USS 60 million equivalent to USS 40 million and of project costs
to be incurred during the period of Bank participation, from USS 156.7
million to USS 107 million (see Table 1); (ii) highlighting the export
orientation of the project to resolve export constraints, to increase export
earnings  through  the  quick  gestating  features  of  the  project,   thus
capitalizing on Turkey's identified export potential particularly of fruit
crops and thereby contributing to help alleviate Turkey's foreign exchange
problems.

III. IMPLEMFNtATION
A. Start-up
3.1      Initial   steps   towards    project    implementation    proceeded
satisfactorily. The Project Coordinator from SPO had been appointed in time
and the Horticultural Coordinating Committee had been established and
members from various government agencies were appointed as foreseen at
appraisal.
3.2      Under the project, four Regional Marketing Corporations (RMC) and a
Central Marketing Organization were to be set up and their managers to
become  members  of  the  Committee  once  these   institutions   had   been
established. Due to delayed implementation of this component the managers
did not join the Committee as anticipated.
3.3      The creation of a  General  Directorate  of  Horticultural  Affairs
(GDHA) as part of the then on-going reorganization of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) helped to facilitate project start-up as it
concentrated responsibility for the project's technical aspects under one
entity.
B. Chanoes in Project
3.4      The project did not undergo any significant  changes  except  that,
due to the unexpectedly high demand for operational credit, it had been
decided to re-allocate unutilized funds from the agro-industry working
capital component (sub-loan portion part A) to this category. A substantial
part (USS 8 million out of USS 11 million) of the unallocated portion of the
loan had been cancelled. As a result of the slow implementation, the final
disbursement took place only in January 1987 and the outstanding balance was
also cancelled. This brought the loan amount cancelled to a total of
USS 10.9 million.
3.5      As  all  material  for  greenhouse  construction  was  found  to be
available locally, it was agreed to waive ICS and allow local procurement.
The loan agreement was changed accordingly.
C. General Imolementation Fxnerienee
3.6      Oespite  a relatively good start, groject implementation was slower
than anticipated. The initial uptake of credit was low due to mainly
economic uncertainties and institutional problems. In subsequent years. the
utilization of the investment credit component has been rather weak. whilst
up-take of credit has been nearly five times higher than appraisal
estimates. The technical support services component suffered from lack of
transport, coordination between agencies and insufficient back-up. The
training programme was delayed largely due to organizational changes within
MAf.



-8-
3.7      The  establishment  of  marketing  organizations  was  affected  by
changes in government policies, shifting emphasis from state intervention to
private sector initiative. Thus, the four RMCs were established with a delay
of over two years, whilst the CMO was not established at all. The Master
Plan for the horticultural sub-sector became available only towards the end
of the project and hence provided only limited guidance for project
implementation.
3.8      The  project  aimed  at  strengthening  the  various   institutions
involved   in  project  coordination  and  technical  implementation.  This.
however, was only partly achieved as the foreign expertise made available
under the project did not have the expected impact. Project coordination
through SPO was weak and suffered from lack of staff and resources to carry
out the duties assigned.
D. Imnlementation of Main Comoonents
AnriculcLura) Credit
3.9      As determined at appraisal, credit for on-farm development would be
channelled through TCZB. The Bank loan would cover 50X of the total amounts
disbursed  by  TCZB   for   nurseries,   orchards,   vineyards,   greenhouse
establishment and for production credit to existing fruit and vegetable farm
operations. The other 50% would be provided from TCZB's own funds.
3.10     Initially the responsibility for the preparation of farm plans  for
sub-borrowers was vested with MEYSEB/TZ and TOPRAKSU in the case of
irrigation projects. Sub-loan preparation was to follow TCZB's criteria for
loan eligibility. Upon submission of the loan documents TCZB subsequently
disbursed against statements of expenditure. The existing protocol between
MEYSEB, TOPRAKSU and TCZB was amended (signed 30 September 1981) to reflect
the above working arrangements as agreed at appraisal.
3.11     Loans equivalent to USS 6.7 million have been disbursed  under  the
procedures followed in the original protocol. In the course of the
reorganization of MAf in 1983/84, the various specialized extension services
including MAYSEB were merged and all responsibility of sub-loan preparation
was  transferred  to  the  unified  extension  service  of  MAFRA.   Revised
arrangements   permitting  TCZB  credit             officers  to  prepare  loan
applications were agreed in late 1985.
3.12     Two types of agricultural credit were foreseen:
- Investment credit with the main objective to expand the production
base through the establishment of nurseries, orchards. vineyards
and  the  construction  of  glass  and  plastic   greenhouses.   In
accordance with TCZB's credit guidelines individual farmers would
have to contribute at least 10% in the case of small- and medium-
sized farms and at least 30% in the case of large farms. A
proportion of the collateral requirement could be satisfied by
chattel mortgage to TCZB on farm assets. The SAR foresaw a total of
USS 26.7 million (excluding price contingencies).
- Produetion Credit which would support producing orchards, existing
greenhouses and vegetable farms. In this case farmers' equity
contribution was Jetermined at 30%. As under earlier projects,



-9-
small farms were expected to provide family labour as part of their
contribution. Credit 7or incremental labour has only been provided
in special cases. the SAR foresaw a total of USS 12.7 million
(excluding price contingencies).
3.13     Under  the  project medium- and long-term sub-loans were to be made
at least at a rate of 24X p.a. to individual farmers for investment  credit,
and  at  least  at  a  rate of 22X p.a. for supervised short-term production
credits. TCZU    however, decided in early 1982 to reduce the  interest  rates
by 2 points each.
3.14     As  from 1983 interest rates were adjusted as follows to compensate
for the effects of inflation.

Short-term loans were mostly given for operational purposes and were
recovered after one year. Long-term loans were given for establishment
purposes. In the case of glasshouses a repayment period of S years was
normally stipulated whilst for orchard establishment a ten-year sub-loan
repayment period including 4 years grace had been chosen.
3.15     The  repayment  performance  for  short-term  loans  has been quite
satisfactory with an average of 95X during the rroject period.
3.16     Credit  disbursement  was  to  commence  in  early  1982  with  the
provision of two sub-loans for the establishment of one citrus and one non-
citrus nursery. As from 1983 both investment and operating credits were
expected to be disbursed at an accelerating pace.
3.17     Contrary  to expectations no loans were disbursed in 1982. Over the
project period loans disbursed for nursery and orchard establishment were
only about 101 of the anticipated targets. Loans for vegetable farm
establishment were about 501 of SAR estimate. The estimates for production
credit requirement of about USS 21 million were exceeded by 451 and amounted
to over USS 31 million by the end of the project (see data in TL in
Table 2).

applies to each category.
3.18     As  table 3 shows the number of farmers receiving investment credit
for nursery and orchard establishment was only about 17% of anticipated
levels. From an expected total of 3,350 loan applicants, only 572 sub-loans
were disbursed. Despite a slow start the number of farmers receiving loans
for vegetable farm establishment, however, registered unforeseen expansion.
Whereas the SAR anticipated a total of 150 sub-loans, 1,767 farmers used the
credit facility offered. Even more dramatic was the up-take of production
credit. Already in the first year over 4,043 sub-loans were approved
(against 400 SAR estimate) and over the project period 24,681 production
sub-loans were disbursed, nearly 7 times the appraisal estimate.
3.19     A similar picture emerges from the comparison of SAR estimates with
actual achievements of the areas benefitting from investment or production
credit (see Table 4). Nursery development reached with 6 ha only one-tenth
of expectation, whilst orchard development extended only to 1,112 ha or
about one-fourth of SAR estimates. In contrast, over 250 ha were brought
under   glass  or  plastic  greenhouse  cultivation  (75 ha  SAR  estimate).
Production credit helped to improve farming on over 33,400 ha or nearly five
times appraisal estimates.
3.20     The  main  reasons  for slower uptake of investment credit were the
following:
- MEYSEBITZ/TOPRAKSU staff was not sufficiently well trained to draw-
up loan applications;
- TCZD staff, especially at provincial level was initially not
familiar with lending procedures established under the project.
Moreover, several branch managers were reluctant to follow TCZB
protocol fo- determining farmers credit wnorthiness:
- Farmers interest in taking up investment credit wae much lower than
anticipated at appraisal. Especially for nursery and orchard
establishment interest was extremely low as farmers were uncertain
about the future of the sector and producer prices in 1983/84 were
not sufficiently attractive to stimulate term investment;
- Lack of healthy bud-wood and new vegetable seed varieties impeded
potential investors to join the project;



- 11 -
- Farmers in certain areas were generally reluctant to take loans as
they resented the payment of interest;
- TCZB provided loans for similar purposes from its own funds with
less rigorous technical requirements.
3.21     Additional training provided to MEYSEB/TZ/TOPRAKSU and  TCZB  staff
resulted in a gradual improvement of the situation. The working relationship
between MEYSEB/TZ and TOPRAKSU and later on MAFRA on the one side and TCZB,
however, was always somewhat strained as TCZB did not feel confident about
the agricultural agencies capacity to formulate financially viable sub-loan
proposals, while MEYSEB resented TCZB making loans with its own funds
without following the project's stricter requirements on such issues as
quality of the budwood.
3.22     The  credit  up-take  by province varied widely. As shown below the
provinces of Antalya and Icel account for over 71X of total credit use.
Other provinces such as Amasya and Kayseri did not even reach the 1% mark.
These differences can partly be explained by the more favourable climatic
conditions in the key provinces but are also a reflection of the farmers'
attitude towards credit and partly of the performance of the institutional
framework operating in the area.

to   supplement  payment  of  miscr'laneous  expenditures  incurred  in  the
technical services provided to farmers under the project and to provide
incentives to staff through increases in per diem.

Technical Sunnort S rvices and Trainimv
3.25     In order  to  implement  applied  research  and  the  expansion  of
extension and training programmes envisaged under the project, the SAR
specified  that  five  internationally-recruited  horticultural   production
specialists would be employed by MEYSEB for three years (starting not later
than January 1, 1982), one in each of the following areas: a) nurseries; b)
citrus; c) pome fruits; d) stone fruits; and e) early vegetables. All
consultants would be located in Antalya which is centrally placed in the
project area. These consultants were to work hand in hand with a total of 28
counterparts from MEYSEB, TZ, TCZB and cooperating research institutions.
3.26     The consultants' contract was signed in May 1982 and  all  took  up
their assignments in Antalya by July/August of that year, with the exception
of the nursery specialist who arrived only in February 1983. Contrary to SAR
provisions, the team remained in the country only for two years and the
nursery specialist resigned before completing his two-year contract and was
not replaced.
3.27     It  was  deemed  essential  for  a successful implementation of the
production aspects that a strong team work approach between farmers, trained
extension staff and able research workers be established. To achieve this
goal the appraisal report foresaw that the vegetable con.,ltant would be
statioped at the Vegetable Research Institute and the four fruit consultants
at the Citrus Research Institute. The consultants  would  train  counterpart
staff and carry out regular field visits. The consultants were also to help
initiate research projects and assist in the establishment of a citrus
indexing programme. which would identify healthy budwood.
3.28     During the first 9 months of their sbay in Antalya the consultants
were underutilized due to difficulties in getting direct access to farmers and
research centers located throughout the project area. This was mainly due to
lack of support by the local implementing agencies in Antalya, such as, for
example, not providing vehicles and delays in providing translators.
Furthezmmre, it has been a poor decision to station the porn and stone fruit
specLalists in Antelya, where there is no production of these types of frult.
Bursa for instance would have been more appropriate.

3.29     Later on the work programme of the consuiltants  improved.  as  they
became better integrated in the project work and their mobility improved.
The pome fruit specialist was transferred to the Yalova Research Centre
where he could work more productively. The nursery expert initiated the
establishment of several 'model nurseries' and laid the foundations for a
citrus indexing programme.
3.30     Jritjjj.  The  consultants  trained the respective counterparts as
foreseen. Due to the merger of the MEYSEB and GDAA extension services under
MAf the strength of the consolidated staff was deemed sufficient to cope
with project activities. Therefore, no new staff had been appointed, but
existing staff quality was improved through on-the-job training. Besides
additional formal training, local study tours were also undertaken during
1985/86 involving 32 field staff. Details on in-service training subjects
and participants are given in Table 5.
3.31     A comprehensive l%al and external training  programme  was  to  be
submitted  to  the Bank by July 1, 1982. Due to organizational problems, the
submission was delayed by two and half years, which affected mostly the
external training component. Only 4n May 1985 a contract for USS 1.4 million
between MAFRA and FAO was signed for FAO to execute the prograimne as
indicated in the following table:

3.32     As  shown  above  the  programme  fell  considerably  short  of the
original target, especially with regard to the meoium-term training. The
main reasons for this shortfall were organizational problems within MAFRA.
Especially the lack of medium-level trained agricultural personnel affected
the dissemination of improved horticultural techniques at an early stage of
the project.

Aaro-indu tries Workina Capital
3.33     The SAR assumed that the poor  performance  of  many  cold  stores,
processing and packing plants was due to their inability to secure operating
capital when needed and in sufficient amounts to procure imported materials
for cardboard and wooden box manufacture and other inputs such as spares,
machinery parts and raw materials. To overcome this constraint the project
had provided USS 4.5 million which was allocated to TCZB to cover the
expected incremental foreign exchange component of such lines of credit.
Funding for agroindustry investment credit was available through June 1984
under loan 1248-TU (agricultural credit and agroindustries).
3.34     The uptake of the credit was, however, very slow and total  amounts
disbursed amounted to only USS 1.67 million as shown below:

Source: TCZB.
3.35     A major reason for the slow disbursement appears to be the management
of the project within TCZB by the Encouragement and Development Loan
Department, which normally provided medium and long-term loans rather than
working capital finance. Meanwhile, the Commercial Loua Department of TCZB
continued to provide short term working capital credit to agroindustriea from
its normal sources of funds. A second problem was the cumbersome procedures
to be followed for subloan approval, as each subloan had to be sent by TCZB to
the Bank for its approval. This practice was not originally intended since
the legal documents required only submission to the Bank of the first
financin? plan approved by TCZB tinder this component. It appears that concern
was expressed as to the quality of TCZB's initial appraisals and an
understanding was reached that TCZB would continue to send its appraisal
documents for this component to the Bank until the Bank was satisfied as to
the quality of appraisal. Even after the Bank agreed (by telex June 25, 1985)
that TCZB could approve working capital subloans up to US$300,000 without
prior Bank approval, up-take was still slow. Although procedures were
accelerated for smaller loans, the bigger industrialists had acCess to other
sources of funds allowing them to obtain credit at a faster pace.
Furthermore, the agro-industries sector did not develop at the pace expected
by the SAR and therefore demand for credit was less than anticipated. By
cable of February 11, 1986, the Bank agreed to transfer the unutilised amount
of this component to agricultural credit.

Marketing Orcani2ation
3.36     The  SAR  states: 'To quickly capitalize on the export potential of
present  production,  the  project  will  provide  funds  to   support   new
institution building through the establishment of four regional marketing
corporations (RMCs) under the umbrella of a central marketing organization
(CMO).   In   the   period   immediately  following  its  establishment  the
organization will seek to streamline transportation and market intelligence,
and to convince producers of the benefits of improved packing, processing
and quality control. In subsequent years, it is expected to assume direct
management of Turkish fruit and vegetable exports under a unified brand name
which would be synonymous with high quality. The four RMCs will be
established, at Adana-Mersin, Antalya, Izmir and Bursa-Istanbul which are
centers of the horticultural industry; have good  communications  with  both
domestic and export markets by land, sea and air; and have cold storage and
packing house facilities.
3.37     When operational, each RMC will identify export opportunities,  and
provide skills. resources and services which by definition are outside the
financial capability of most individual exporters. These include market
intelligence; marketing per se; quality control; monitoring of cold storage,
packaging and packing house procedures; and transport coordination.
3.38     The CMO will be owned by the RMCs to perform services for the  RMCs
vital for achieving regional export objectives, but which will be beyond the
capability of individual RMCs either to direct or influence. It is expected
that the CMO ultimately will be empowered to: (a) coordinate all export
related activities from production to sale and collectively represent RMCs
in foreign markets; (b) set quality standards in collaboration with
concerned Government agencies, for Turkish horticultural produce; (c)
appoint   resident   representatives   in   overseas  markets,  monitor  the
performance of overseas agents, and negotiate on behalf of the RMCs with
multiple retail chains and wholesale buyers in importing countries; and (d)
represent the RMCs in bilateral trade negotiations. It will also be
responsible for preparing annual export promotion plans in consultation with
the RMCs, which will contain regional export sales targets for each
commodity, expected monthly shipments and destination. In addition, a formal
market intelligence service, transport coordination service, marketing and
sales promotion service, and purchasing finance service will be established
within the CMO to assist the RMCs with their daily operations. The CMO  will
probably be located in Istanbul because of its excellent communications
facilities.
3.39     The  RMCs  and  CMO  would  be  organized  ir  the  form  of  stock
corporations which would come into existence when the inir,imum capitalization
required by Turkish law has been satisfied. Shares in the RMCs initially
would be available both to the public and the Government; however, the
Government's capital participation when the corporations are formed will be
limited to about 30% of all stock subscribed to ensure that control of the
organization is vested in the private sector from the start, and to furnish
producers with incentives to participate in order to avail of the services
to be orovided as a result of Government's involvement. Participation by
individuals or companies will be limited to not more than 5X of the
subscribea shares. Shares of RMCs issued would be at no more than TL 1000
par value to allow small investors to participate. Shares of the CHO would
be available to the RHCs only, and in equal proportion.'



- 16 -
3.40     The RMCs and the CMO shotild have been formed by January  31.  1982.
At the time of project preparation, government policy was substantially
geared towards direct intervention in economic activities. Within such a
policy framework, government support for the formation and operation of
marketing organizations was guaranteed. By the time of implementation,
however. government's policy had changed and a rapid liberalization process
had started to set in. This new economic environment proved unfavourable to
RMC/CMO establishment and the SPO no longer 'vigorously promoted' their
organization and ce'italizpt.on as envisaged by the  SAR.  Furthermore,  the
private sector proved to be more suspicious towards government organized
ventures than anticipated and was reluctant to participate as shareholders.
Moreover, the large private export companies were encouraged to also take up
fresh fruit ?nd vegetable export marketing.
3.41     The four RMCs were finally established as follows:
Location  Datg EstabliShment   Mpmhershin        Membershin Comnocition
Antalya   November 1983          2000     Mostly producers
Bursa     November 198<           162     Mostly producers but also
private traders and cooperatives
Izmir     June 1984                42     Only fruit & vegetables exporters
Mersin    June 1984                98     Mostly fruit & veg. exporters
As the table shows the membership  numbers  and  composition  varied  widely
between the four RMCs. The shareholders of Antalya and Bursa were mostly
producers which considered the RMCs as a purchasing organization controlled
by them. In contrast, the RMCs of Izmir and Bursa were dominated by
exporters who endeavoured to use the RMCs for their own ends.
3.42     According  to  Turkish  law  the  minimum  capitalization  for  the
formation of stock corporations has been fixed at TL 200 million of which
25% have to be paid down. As agreed at appraisal, the government's capital
particioation had been limited to '0% whilst participation by individuals or
companies had been limited to 5% each of the subscribed shares. Due to the
change in economic policies, government no longer wished to participate in
the venture and requested TCZB to take its role and to assist in guiding the
managerial,   organizational   and   financial   operations   of  the  RMCs.
Consequently, TCZB became the single most important shareholder with a block
of 30% of the share capital. Each RMC was governed by a body of nine board
members of which three were provided by TCZB and charged against the
company's budget.
3.43     At  appraisal  it  was estimated that the RMCs would need a cepital
base of USS 3 million equivalent (in 1981, 200 million TL) in order to
operate during the first two or three years. With the constant depreciation
of the Turkish Lira against US$, the share capital equivalent decreased to
USS 545,000 in 1984 and US$ 296 000 in 1986. Moreover, only 252 of the share
capital had to be paid in initially followed by three annual instalments of
25%  each.  As prices for fruit and vegetables followed domestic inflation ,
scope for RMCs trading operations became very much limited as the capital
base was never adjusted.



- 17 -
3.44     Besides the lack of working  capital  the  insufficient  managerial
capacities of the newly established RMCs contributed to the overall poor
performance of these organizations. Even those showing a profit have a
return of less than 3X on capital as shown below:

3.45     From their inception the RMCs concertrated  on  trading  activities
(including grading and packing) rather than providing the services as
originally fo-eseen (see para. 3.37). On the one side this can be attributed
to the lack of experience of the staff of the RMCs and possibly more
important the lack of perception of the concept by the RMC managers. On the
other side, the RMCs continued to expect financial support from Government
to their activities which was however not forthcoming (see para. 3.40) and
thus they were forced to generate income by concentrating on trading
activities in order to cover overhead costs.
3.46     The fact that the RMC5 were rather unsuccessful  in  their  trading
activities cannot only be astributed to the constraints mentioned above but
also to the failure to establish the CMO which should have provided support.
coordination and guidance to the RMCs. Although it was SPO's clearly defined
resconsibility to establish both the RMCs and also the CMO it made very
little effort to form a CMO. In view of the revised, less interventionist
policies of the Government, SPO was unclear as to the appropriate role and
structure of the CMO and requested Bank assistance under the loan to advise
on this (see para. 3.51). As late as 1985 there was enough interest for SPO
to request an amendment to the Loan Agreement (which the Bank approved) to
allow participation in the CMO by private exporters as well as by the RMCs.
However. there was continued internal disagreement on the appropriate role
and function of the CMO and as a result the CMO was not formed even by the
end of the project. The absence of this apex organization led the RMCs to
behave like individual marketing companies acting in competition to the
existing estimated 600 other traders and therefore also in competition with
their own members (especially in Izmir and Mersin). This conflict of
interest impeded the RMCs to fulfill the role foreseen. Furthermore, the
anticipated development of a uniform brand name for Turkish produce. a
forceful representation in major export markets, and adequate marketing
advice and intelligence was not provided to the RMCs and their members.



- 18 -
3.47     At appraisal it was reconnizpd thAt the newly estahlished marketinq
organizations would require spe.iolist assistance during the initial years
of their existence. For this purpose, SPO had agreed to internationally
recruit, by January 1, 1982 at latest, consultants in the fol.lowing key
areas: general  management  (for  36  m/m).  transportation  (for  36  m/m).
marketing  (for  36  m/m), market intelligence (for 12 m/m) and cold storage
(for 18 m/m). In addition, short-term consultants  were  to  be  engaged  to
promote services and train Turkish staff and entrepreneurs in the areas of
packaging (6 m/m) and promotion (12 m/m).
3.48     In  view  of  delays   initially   encountered   the   consultants
recruitment  was  delayed  by one year in the expectation that the marketing
organizations would have been set up by then. Subsequent  to  the  agreement
signed  with  the consulting company expirt services were provided according
to the following schedule:

3.49     In spite of expectation, the establishment of the RtMCs did not take
place prior to the consultants' arrival but only about 10 to 17 months later
(see para. 3.41) which considerably limited the consultants contribution to
the project as they were supposed to help with RMC operations. Furthermore.
the consultants rigidly followed the terms of their contract even when the
actual development of the project warranted significant changes.
3.50     Once the RMCs were operational, the experts still did not frequently
provide support as administrative and legal misunderstandings regarding the
local cost portion of their contract prevented the timely provision of funds
for domestic transport and subsistence. The experts concentrated thus mainly
on the Bursa RMC, which was closest to their duty station - Istanbul. It was
unfortunate that in both Bursa and Izmir trial shipments, made based upon the
RMC's understanding of the advice of the experts, resulted in considerable
losses.
3.51     As shown above (para 3.44), the financial situation of the RMCs
deteriorated rapidly over the project period. In order to rectify the
situation and to obtain guidance regarding the revised role and functioning of
the CHO in line with the Government's revised, less interventionist policies,
the Government requested the preparation of a special study. This study was
carried out in early 1986 and proposed that the CMO should be



- 19 -
established following a similar pattern of operations as the New Zealand
Kiwi Board. Until now, however, the Government has not yet taken a. decision
on CMO's establishment, mandate and terms of operation. The future of the
RMCs is considered very uncertain at this stage as their activities have
virtually come to a halt.
Master Plan for the Subsector
3.52     In  order  to  facilitate  the  planning and coordination of future
investments in the fruit and vegetable subsector the project provided
finance for the preparation of a master plan to be prepared between 1982-83
by internationally recruited consultants. The SAR foresaw the use of 8 man-
months of expatriate agro-industry expertise and about 1,349 man-months of
general specialist expertise. The contract for the study was signed on 10
August 1982 and the first draft completed by 27 September 1984. Although the
report provided some answers with regard to the key areas of export
marketing investment possibilities it failed to establish clear priorities
and policy guidelines for the development of the sub-sector. Consequently
the Government requested additional information and analysis which was only
provided by early 1986. The study was of limited usefulness, long,
repetitious, and out of date. It received only limited circulation and its
findings were not incorporated in Government's policy and planning efforts.
E. Project Cost
P*roiect Cost
3.53     Total cost for the nine and half-year investment  programme  period
were estimated at USS 156.7 million including estimated foreign exchange
cost of USS 59.2 million. For the four and half-year time slice under review
total project cost were estimated at USS 107.0 million including USS 29.8
million price contingencies. Actual total project cost during the time slice
were only USS 51.4 million or 48X of SAR estimates as shown in Table 1 and
summarized below:

3.54     Major  factors  contributing  to  lower  cost  were  mainly reduced
expenditures for Technical Support Services and Training, the low uptake  of
Agro-Industries Operating Capital and agricultural investment credit and the
late start-up of the marketing organization and the  partial  withdrawal  of
government support to these organizations. The Lira devalued by over 4001
during the project implementation period while inflation ranged from 30 to
50X per year. Such economic uncertainty reduced willingness to make long-
term investments (such as orchards).

Financing and Disburtement
3.55     Total external financing was estimated at US$ 40 million to cover:
a) 100X of foreign expenditures on imported motor vehicles, training
abroad, imported equipment, market promotion, market information
services, and communications equipment required for the technical
support services and training component and/or by the marketing
organization component;
b) 100%.of local expenditures ex-factory (less taxeu and  duties)  for
locally procured vehicles and office and other equipment for the
marketing organization, and for applied research, extension and
training;
c) 65X of the total expenditures for goods and services procured for
existing cold stores and packing plants and processing factories. A
list of goods to be financed was agreed upon during negotiations;
d) 90X of total expenditures on consultants' services; and
e) 50X of the total amounts disbursed by TCZB for credit for
nurseries, orchards. vineyards, greenhouses establishment and/or
production credit to existing fruit and vegetable farm operators.
3.56     The   actual   total   external   financing   amounted   to    only
USS 29.5 million or 73X of appraisal estimate.
3.57     World  Bank  loan  disbursements  were  slower than anticipated due
mainly to the delayed start-up of the project, the sluggish up-take of on-
farm   investment   and  agroindustry  working  capital  credits,  and  late
recruitment of consultants. Total disbursements as of 30 June 1987 are as

F. Comoliance with Covenants
3.58     GOT  complied  with  most  covenants concerning the start-up of the
project, i.e. the appointment of the project coordinator (LA Section 3.0
(a)) the establishment of the horticultural coordinating committee (LA
Section 3.02 (b)), the appointment of the marketing specialist by SPO (LA
Section 3.08 (b)).and the signature of the required protocols between TCZB
and HEYSEB.



- 21 -
3.59     Especially with regard to timeliness of semi-annual reporting
(LA Section 3.11 (b)), yearly audit reporting (LA Sections 4.01 (e) and
4.03 (b)), compliance has been poor. Also the provision of estimates of
operating expenses (LA Section 3.01 (b)) has been frequently delayed. The
establishment of RMCs by January 1982 (LA Section 3.08 (e)) has been delayed
by nearly 2 years and the CM0 (LA Section 3.08 (e)) has never been established.
3.60     GOT  was  to furnish local and overseas training programmes by July
1982 (LA Section 3.05 (a)) but did not comply with this covenant until May
1985. Also the covenant to furnish a programme for screening healthy budwood
mother trees and for producing improved budlings for orchards (LA Section
3.06 (a) has been complied with only 10 months later.
IV. PROJFCT ITPACT
A. InitendLd mnac
4.1      The project  aimed  to  increase  fruit  and  vegetable  production
through the provision of credit, research and extension support in 10
provinces. During the time-slice under review a total of 70 ha of fruit
nurseries, 4,375 ha of orchards and 75 ha of vegetable greenhouses should
have been newly established. In addition, productivity should have been
increased on 6,250 ha of fruit orchards and 813 ha of vegetables, through
the provision of supervised credit. It was also expected that the income  of
the beneficiaries of the credit programme would substantially increase.
4.2      It  was  foreseen  that  20X  of  the  incremental  output would be
exported with estimated annual foreign exchange earnings of USS 19.4 million
and   the   balance   consumed   domestically.  By  putting  into  place  an
institutional framework which had been designed to rationalize the marketing
of fresh fruit and vegetables, that could at the same time provide tecinical
assistance to exporters in the area of packaging, quality control and
grading and other needed services, the project was expected to facilitate a
substantial and rapid increase in exports from existing production.
4.3      Furthermore, the project was to provide  guidance  for  the  future
development of the fruit and vegetable sub-sector and consolidate the
achievements of the first project.



- 22 -
B. Incremental Production
Fruit
4.4      The  SAR  anticipated  that  in the coastal provinces 1 /land under
open field vegetables, cotton, wheat and other field crops wouTd be replaced
by mainly citrus orchards and some deciduous fruit. Although it proved
correct that these provinces accounted for most of the newly established
orchards, the cropping pattern in the provinces has been hardly influenced.
Mostly new land was brought under cultivation and only in few cases a shift
from other field crop cultivation was observed. The replacement of cotton
and wheat has been small.
4.5      As indicated earlier, the up-take of  investment  credit  has  been
much   lower  than  anticipated.  Only  1,112  ha  of  orchards  were  newly
established as against the 4,375 ha anticipated (see para 3.19). As a
consequence also the incremental fruit production did not reach expected
levels.
4.6      By  contrast,  the  demand  for  production  credit  exceeded   all
expectation  and  over  the  project  period  23,694 ha  benefitted from the
programme. This compares with a total of 6,250 ha foreseen at appraisal.
4.7      The SAR provided detailed yield assumptions  as  a  basis  for  the
calculation of incremental yields which are compared to actuals in Table 6.
Due to the lack of detailed production monitoring only average production
figures expected to be achieved at full development could be elaborated  for
the four main fruit categories. Following these estimates incremental
production is now expected as follows at full development:
Incremental fruit production at full develonment
(tons)
DQQ  Actual       59g
Citrus fruit           118,000           124,200
Pome fruit              10,000            82,400
Stone fruit             21,000            14,200
Grapes                   6,000             6,300
Total                  155,000           227,100
Veaetabl es
4.8      The  response to vegetable credit was extremely favourable: A total
of 251 ha of glass and plastic greenhouses were newly established (against
75 ha SAR estimate) and over 10,700 ha of vegetable production was supported
by production credit (against 813 ha SAR estimate).

- 23 -
4.9      Also for vegetable production estimates the SAR hAd provided  yield
assumptions which were adjusted based on field observations for the main
categories as provided in Table 7.
4.10     Whereas the SAR gave crop specific yields actual figures  refer  to
an undetermined crop mix following farmers' practice. Furthermore, it has
been assumed that full development in the case of investment credit is only
reached in year 5 and for operating credit in years 2-4, whilst in reality
already in the first year full yields have been achieved by the great
majority of farmers.
4.11     Based  on  the above, the following incremental production has been
achieved under various cultivation techniques:

XI Mission estimate
As the table shows, the most important increments result from improved
plastic greenhouses and open field cultivation.
C. Tncremental Exnnrts
4.12     It  had  been  assumed  that  about  20X of the incremental project
production would be exported and the remainder consumed locally. The main
export markets envisaged were the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Western
Europe. Trade statistics of the project years show that below 5X of Turkish
fresh fruit and vegetable production is exported with citrus having the
major share.



- 24 -
4.13     Inadequate data exist, however, to estimate incremental exports from
the production assisted by the project. The five percent export average
combines great varieties in export shares among different products. It is
also believed that substantially higher shares of green house production are
exported than open field production, given the reduced competition in the
European Community during the off-season. However, statistics were not found
separating export rates between green house and open field production.
4.14     It should be noted that external developments subsequent to the
initiation of the project weakened Turkey's competitive position in exporting
fruit and vegetables. The expansion of the European Commsunity to include
Spain and Portugal reduced Turkey's competitive advantage in this market.
Reduced oil prices and the economic dislocations caused by the Iran-Iraq war
reduced export opportunities in the Middle East. Nevertheless, Bank
calculations of comparative advantage continue to indicate export
opportunities for many fruit and vegetable products.
4.15     The persistent lack of export market intelligence, the absence of a
well established brand name and inadequate export promotion and quality
control continue to hamper Turkey's expansion of fruit and vegetable exports.
Over the longer run, Turkey's success in tackling these problems will
determine the extent to which its fruits and vegetables, including those
supported by this project, can be exported. The Government has adopted a
strategy favoring the development of export trading houses, as being in the
best position to overcome these constraints. It is too early, however, to
judge the effectiveness of this strategy.

0. Nurserv Qevelonment
4.16     It  had  been  antic;pated  that  MAF  and the private sector would
establish nurseries mostly for the production of improved healthy citrus and
non-citrus buds. With the assistance of the horticultural consultants MAF
started some nursery development in late 1984 and only one small private
citrus nursery has been developed.
4.17     This  lack of budwood production has no doubt affected the whole of
the orchard establishment component, as farmers were reluctant to establish
new orchards with unimproved varieties. It, however, also reflects the
overall reluctance of farmers to engage in long-term heavy investment in
long gestation activities, particularly in a period of economic uncertainty.
E. Technoloaical Changec
4.18     The  project  provided  for  the establishment of glass and plastic
greenhouses to improve traditional farming. Atthough the area coverage
amounted to only about one-fourth of SAR estimates, farmers' willingness to
adopt the new technology - especially in the provinces of Antalya, Icel,
Izmir and Adana - was good.
4.19     The  provision  of  operational  credit  allowed farmers the use of
modern farm inputs which demonstrated .to  them  the  benefits  of  improved
management practices. This led to a faster adoption of modern farming as
otherwise possible and is well reflected in imnroved yield figures.
4.20     The  project  had  also  aimed  to  introduce  improved   marketing
techniques. This objective, however, was not achieved (see paras. 3.36 to
3.39 and 3.44 to 3.46).
F.   Environmental Effects
4.21     No negative environmental effect could be identified as a result of
project  activities.  The  fact  that  over 1,000 ha of land were covered by
glass or plastic greenhouses only helps to reduce surface evaporation and
thus water consumption and should, therefore, be considered as a positive
impact of the project. As fertilizers. and farm chemicals are judiciously
used under close extension supervision also from this angle. no negative
environmental impact can be anticipated.
G. Emn1nvment
4.22     It had been estimated that the project would directly benefit 7,082
families (about 49,500 persons) by providing a higher income and a more even
annual distribution of revenues, mostly from horticulture production. In
addition, about 28,300 families would provide farm labour benefitting a
population of some 198,000 persons.



- 26 -
4.23     Under the project  a  total  of  27.014  families  took  investment
(2,333) or production (24,681) loans. This is nearly four times the SAR
projection, mostly due to the substantial increase in production sub-loans.
Consecutively to this increase in direct beneficiaries, also employment
opportunities created increased to about 100,000 families benefitting a
population of over 600,000 persons.
V. TNSTTTIITTONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
A.   Imnlementing Aaencies
5.1      In  accordance  with appraisal, the three main agencies responsible
for project implementation were: SPO, MEYSEBITZ and TCZB. SPO has been in
charge of the overall coordination of the project and had the additional
responsibilities to promote the establishment of the RMCs and CMO and to
implement the study and master plan component.
5-2      MEYSEB/TZ  has been responsible for coordinating the implementation
of the technical support services and training component. TCZ8 has been the
executing agency for on-farm credit aspects and assisted by MEYSEB/TZ with
sub-loan  preparation,  has  extended  sub-loans   to   beneficiaries.   The
management of the agro-industries working capital component has been vested
solely in TCZB.
5.3      As indicated earlier (see  para  3.40)  the  change  in  Government
policy towards greater liberalization of the economy substantially reduced
the powers of the SPO. Besides weakening its authority vis-i-vis other
agencies,   the   SPO   also  proved  to  be  less  enthusiastic  about  the
establishment  of  RMCs  and  the  CMO.  With  regard   to   the   markteting
organizations   the  SPO  furthermore  lacked  the  required  experience  to
successfully start uo the component in a timely manner. This lack of
qualified staff also led to poor guidance provided to the marketing
consultants and the team executing the master plan study. The change in
project coordinator about half way through the project further compounded
the problem. Although the choice of SPO as neutral coordinator was possibly
the right one, the implementation of the marketing component should have
been vested with a technical agency.
5.4      It has been generally agreed that tiht  gradual  reorganization  and
integration of the various agencies involved in agricultural development
into one agency, i.e. MAFRA, has been extremely useful. Unfortunately.
however, this process fell into the project period. which had a disruptive
and retardative effect on the implementation of various project components.
especially during the initial phase of the project.
5.5      Organizational  difficulties  also affected the timely selection of
staff for project supported training programmes (see para 3.31) and also
partly affected the benefits resulting from the provision of expatriate
horticultural production expertise.
5.6      Generally, however, the research and extension capacities of  MAFRA
improved over the project period. The research capacity of the ministry has
been  considerably  strengthened  and  is  now  more  adapted  to   farmers'
requirements. The use of the T and V method of extension has been more
widely adopted and most farmers are now well aware of the benefits of
improved farm maoagement including the use of modern farm inputs and
infrastructure.



- 27 -
5.7      At appraisal it was  recognized  that  TCZB  had  sufficient  stAff
strength and an adequate branch network, to execute the credit component.
witheut requiring further strengthening. This assessment proved correct as
TCZB performed generally well in both credit disbursement and loan recovery.
Initial difficulties (see para 3.20) were gradually overcome as staff
capabilities improved through in-service and external training.
5.8      The experience of collaboration between MAFRA and TCZB has not been
very satisfactory. TCZB never showed full confidence in the ministry's staff
ability to formulate financially viable sub-loan projects. Although it had
been hoped that a more permanent working relation between MAFRA and TCZB
could be established by the project this expectation did not materialize.
Shortly  before  the  end  of  the  project  the  protocol   between   MAFRA
(HEYSEI/TOPRAKSU) and the TCZB was revised. As from late 1985, TCZB credit
officers were permitted to prepare loan applications and carry out credit
supervision. Under the revised protocol, MAFRA was supposed to review a
representative sample of farm development plans (10 of investment loans, 5
of production loans) to ensure that technical criteria were satisfactory.
Input/output prices used by TCZB in farm development plans were to be agreed
at least semi-annually between TCZB and MAFRA (to ensure adequate adjustment
for inflation). TCZB was to inform MAFRA every two months of loans made, to
facilitate 14AFRA provision of technical support services. The review mission
was unable to obtain any information indicating that these consultations
actually took place.
S. Contractors and SuDuliers
5.9      The performance of contractors and suppliers was considered
"stisfactory. Deviations from specifications occurred especially with the
moro sophisticated greenhouses for HAFiA research use, but did not affect
project implementation as a whole. Delays in delivery of imported vehicles
and equipment was mostly due to lengthy customs clearance procedures.
C. Reportin. and Auditinz
5.10     Semi-annual project reports were to be prepared by the executing
agencies and submitted to the Bank through SPO. These reports were to include
sumwrary accounts of the various economic entities such as TCZB, MEYSEB, the
RMCs and the CHO. Audited accounts were to be prepared annually.
5.11     Reporting has been extremely slow and incomplete.  Generally,
semi-annual reports were submitted with delays ranging from 2 to 12 months and
sawe periods were not covered at all. Also auditing has been rather slow
partly due to the need for translation. Some audit reports for two of the
RMCs have not been received yet. (This was not a loan requirement, but had
been requested to enable the Bank to assist RMC institutional development.)
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.12     At appraisal it had been recognixed that the monitoring and
evaluation capacity available at various impleaenting agencies was rather
weak. It had therefore been suggested to include a monitoring and evaluation
specialist in the Bank's first supervision team, to advise on the setting up
of an appropriate system.



_ 28
5.13     Unfortunately this did not materialize and partly as a  conseet,ence
no proper monit4ring of project progress or evaluation of institutional
performance took olace. The lack of basic data impeded adequate planning and
has also affected :he accuracy of ex-post evaluation.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.1      The  basic  concept  of  the  project,  i.e.  to  enhance fruit and
vegetable production through the provision of investment and operating
credit was sound. Also the need to improve marketing especially for export
markets has been well recognized.
6.2      At the time of project preparation it  has  been  also  correct  to
assume that a state supported marketing organization would be an appropriate
instrument to implement a marketing improvement programue. In the time span
between preparation and appraisal, a rapid liberalization programme has set
in. By the time of appraisal it should nave become clear that the RMCs and
the CHO might no longer receive the state support as anticipated and a
different approach should have been adopted.
6.3      The operational programme of the RMCs  was  not  sufficiently  well
enough designed to allow for their smooth development. It has turned out to
have been an error to allocate support service functions as well as trade
functions to one and the same institution as the trade community was
unwilling to trust RMC's with their exports and as a result the RMC's were
in competition with their own members from the trade community. The creation
of the RMCs as stock corporations with nine board members clearly added to
the heavy overhead cost and was excessive, given the reduced activity
resulting from the effect of inflation on the capital base.
6.4      Considqration should have been given to firstly establish  the  CMO
as this would have helped to provide the required coordination between the
RMCs and would have allowed to build up the necessary services such as
market intelligence, overseas promotion and marketing extension beforehand.
6.5      The  selection  of  the  SPO  as  coordinating  agency  of a multi-
disciplinary project was sound in principle. However, the allocation of
technical implementation responsibilities should have been vested in a
technical agency. The idea to force TCZ8 and MEYSEB into a joint working
arrangement has not been appropriate in view of past experience.
6.6      More  base  line  studies  should  have  been  carried out orior to
appraisal to adequatly assess credit needs and uptake. Thus the misijudgement
on loan composition for investment, and operating credit as well as working
capital loan requirements might have been avoided and the unallocated
portion of the loan reduced. The continued persistence of high inflation and
economic uncertainty was not foreseen, nor was the increased difficulty of
export to the EEC with the entry of Spain, Portugal. and Greece anticipated.
6.7      Supervision   of  the  project  by  Bank  was  somewhat  irregular.
Throughout the project period a total of seven supervision missions were
carried out. The period between missions fiuctuated between 6 and 12 months.
Unfortunately the main gaps of 12 months occurred during rather critical
periods of the project, i.e. between April 1982 and April 1983 just when the
project gathered momentum and between July 1984 and July 1985 when the
project would have needed more planning support to make best use of the
funds still unutilized.



- 29 -
6.8      Besides the above-mentinned (see para. 5.13) omission of  the  Bank
to send a monitoring ana evaluation specialist on the first supervision
mission, the absenc? of a marketing expert on all but one mission may have
contributed to the poor implementation of that component.
VII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMtC RE-EVALUATtON
7.1      A  financial re-evaluation has been undertaken for the agricultural
credit component which regresented 73% of total project  cost.  An  economic
re-evaluation has been prepared for the project as a whole. The analysis has
been carried out in 1986 prices with past expenditures converted into 1986
price terms by using the wholesale price index (see Table 8).
A. Financial Re-evaluation
7.2      The project financed about 27,000 farmers. Based on  the  estimated
operating income from the various farming activities the project has proven
to be financially attractive to the sub-loan recipients. At appraisal the
finsncial viability has been established by using a number of models. For
the most representative types of investment credit the comparison between
SAR estimates and actual achievements are shown below:

7.3      At  appraisal  the  rate  of  return  to the economy (ERR) had been
calculated on the basis of nine farm models assumed to be representative of
different sub-borrowers, and six models for sucervised production on
existing horticultural farms. No quantified benefits had been estimated for
the provision of working capital to agro-industries nor for value added
expected of the improved export marketing organization. The benefits from
most of the investments made during the project's four and half-year time
slice were considered conditional on future investment; required during the
last five years of the investment programme's implementation period. The
basic ERR, estimated at 29.7%, had therefore been calculated for the entire
nine and half-year programme.

7.4      To facilitate comparison. the rp-cA1culation of the  project's  ERR
follows mostly the method adopted at appraisal. However. for the re-
calculation of incremental benefits and costs ictual areas improved under
the project's credit reogramme, re-estimatcd incremental yields and 1986
farmgate prices have beet, .sed.
7.5      The re-calculation of the incremental  benefits  is  based  on  the
areas   improved   under  investment  and/or  production  credit,  estimated
incremental yields and 1986 farm-gate prices. In the absence of any
production monitoring under the project (see para. 4.7) the estimation of
incremental costs generated by on-farm investment is based on the four
models prepared by MAFRA for the financial re-evaluation (para. 7.2). The
citrus orcharis model has been applied to all citrus orchard establishment.
The non-citrus orchard model has been utilized for the areas put under pome
and stone fruit as well as for the small area put under grapes. The plastic
greenhouse model has been taken as representative for the incremental area
under plastic greenhouses and also for the small area under high plastic
tunnels.    Benefits  have  been  reduced  by  10%  to allow for field crops
foregone (see para. 4.4). Further differences to the method adopted at
appraisal are:
- The economic life of plastic greenhouses has been reduced to 10
years;
- Incremental costs have been adjusted by the standard conversion
factor (0.79) except for the supervised credit portion which has
been converted with the special conversion factor of 0.72.
- The recalculation of the ERR is based on the four and half-year
time slice only as costs and benefits of follow-up programmes
cannot be quantified.
7.6      On  the basis of the above, the ERR of the project is now estimated
at 38.2% (see Table 13). This increase is mostly due to the higher level of
operating credits which resulted in a faster setting-in of benefits and also
resulted in comparatively higher returns. The lower than anticipated cost
for Technical Support Services and Training as well as for the Marketing
Organization components further helped to enhance the ERR.
VIII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
8.1      Thoi project aimed at the development of  the  fruit  and  vegetable
subsector, through the provision of investment and operating credit, the
improvement of produce marketing and the upgrading of extension and
research. Planning for further development of the subsector was to be
supported with the help of a project financed master plan.
8.2      Although it had been expected that over 50% of the credit  provided
would be used for the new establishmen'. of orchards and glasshouses, only
about 20X of the credit was used in this way, with a respective shortfall in
area development. This reduced uptake reflects mainly the reluctance of
farmers to invest in long gestation activities in spite of relatively high
returns (i.e. citrus orchards IRR 27.9% and glasshouses IRR 44.1%) during a
period of high and fluctuating inflation and economic uncertainty.



- 31 -
8.3      Faster and higher returns could be achieved  by  improving  farming
practices tt.rough use of modern farm inputs and low cost facilities such as
plastic tunnels. This fact has been reflected in the much higher uptake of
production credit (80% of total credit).
8.4      It  had  been anticipated that fruit and vegetable production would
increase  by  227,000  tons  and  16,400  tons  for  fruit  and   vegetables
respectively at full development. The project achieved an increase in fruit
production of 155,000 tons and of 118,000 tons in vegetable production.
8.5      It  had  been  anticipated  that  about  20X  of  the   incremental
production would be exported amounting to export revenues of about USS 19.4
million at full development. This may be over-optimistic but insufficient
data   is  available  to  estimate  exports  as  a  percent  of  incremental
production.
8.6      The employment impact of the project was c6nsiderably  higher  than
anticipated mostly due to the substantial increase in operational credit.
The number of direct beneficiaries increased from 7,082 to 26,371 farmers
and employment opportunities rose from 198,000 to over 600,000 people.
8.7      Due  to  the  consolidation of the extension services no additional
staff had to be recruited, but the service benefitted greatly from the
project through improved mobility. Unfortunately staff training did not
materialize as anticipated and only reduced staff members were trained with
considerable delay. Research capabilities have been er,ianced and a budwood
screening programme initiated. The impact of the foreign consultants on the
improvement of both research and extension was less positive than expected.
8.8      The market support infrastructure established under the project was
not successful. This was mainly due to an economic liberalization policy of
GOT which envisaged a greater role for the trading houses in exploiting
fruit and vegetable export potential and an inadequately designed concept of
operation of the project's marketing component. The master plan for the
horticultural sub-sector only partly achieved its objective to provide
future guidance for the development of this sector.
8.9      In   general   the   project   managed  to  considerably  stimulate
horticultural production. However, the impact on thie 10 participating
provinces has been very uneven and concentrated mostly on operational credit
rather than on longer term investment as originally anticipated.

Lessons learned
8.10     The principle lessons learned from the implementation of the project
can be summarized as follows:
(a)  At times of major economic changes (such as major devaluations) or
major changes in Government economic policies (e.g., adoption of more
liberal, less intervc.ationist policies), ongoing projects should be
reviewed to see whether the project design needs modification in
light of changed circumstances.
(b) When credit is available through several programs, the source
providing the best terms with least difficult requirements is likely
to prevail. If the Bank cannot persuade the credit institutions to
adopt Bank technical requir'vments-as conditions for its regular loan
programs, and if lending terms are similav, it does little good to
open up a separate window under a Bank loan with more strict
technical requirements. Splitting loan appraisal responsibility
between Ministry of Agriculture technical staff and credit
institution fiuancial staff tends to lead to friction. Working to
strengthen TCZB's technical appraisal capability would have been a
preferable strategy.
(c) Farmers are unlikely to make long-term investments (such as orchards)
at times of unstable and unpredictable economic movements.
Estimating credit demand at times of significant economic disruption
(such as occurred in 1980 in Turkey) is extremely hazardous.
(d) Issues of how and in what capacity Government can best promote export
marketing require careful consideration. In this case, having the
Government, through TCZB, on the Boards of the RMCs was ineffective
and possibly gave misleading signals to private exporters as to the
Government's intentions.
(e) At times of high inflation, important requirements (such as the share
capital base of the RMCs) should be stated in foreign currency
equivalents or, if stated in local currency, arrangements should be
specified for adjustment in line with inflation.
(f) When delays take place in some components of a project, the schedule
for other components should be adjusted accordingly. When it became
clear that the RMCs and CMO would not be established by the time of
the intended hiring of the consultants to work with them, either
their hiring should have been postponed or their terms of reference
modified to cope with the revised situation.
(g) When the Bank embarks on a project involving expertise it does not
have in-house (such as fruit and vegetable marketing), it takes on an
obligation to ensure sufficient expertise is maintained throughout
project supervision, not just during project appraisal.

COMMENTS OF T.C. ZIRAAT BANKASI (TCZB) ON THE
DRAFT COMPLETION REPORT OF LOAN NO. 1967-TU
The data and explanations regarding the $ 20 million
allocated to TCZB for agricultural credits are parallel to TCZB
accounts and views-
Nevertheless, the amounts for investment and working capital
credits, and agro-industry working capital realized costs, and as
a result, the realization percentages of these amounts are in
contradiction with TCZB accounts.
Most  probably this discrepancy stems from not  taking  into
account the expenditures made by farmers' own resources in
Section A 1.2 Category (4), and expenditures made by business'
own resources and TCZB resources in Section A 3 Category (5).
Accordingly, cost summary regarding the TCZB part of the
Project should be as follows:
Planned ($ m.)    Realized ($ m.)    X
Investment and Working
Capital Credits
(Category 4)                   56.575              52.423           93
Agro-industry Working
Capital
(Category 5)                     9.225              3.838           42
The above also affects the Project General Investment Amount
Table (Table 1) so that it should read:
I. Total Cost of Investment and Working Capital Credits
TL 26,317 billion and $ 52,423 million;
II. Total Cost of Agro-industry Working Capital TL 2,088 billion
and $ 3.838 million.

COMMENTS OF MAFRA GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF PROJECT AND
IMPLEMENTATION ON THE DRAFT PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT OF
LOAN NO. 1967-TU
Our comments based on discussions with the World Bank OED
mission and review cf the draft report are as follows:
As a result of project implementation, healthy production
emerged as a must to increase citrus production and 5 greenhouses
where modern technolgy was applied were built. Also the existing
Vegetable  Resea,ch Institute in Antalya has been reorganized  as
the Greenhouse Research Institute to develop greenhouses suitable
for the region.
In addition, as discussed in the report, all but one of the
provinces have been included in the 1st and 2nd Agricultural
Extension and Research Project to improve research-extension and
producer cooperation.
The   Ministry  (MAFRA)  is  encouraging  cooperation  among
producers and those already existing firms and cooperatives which
provide packaging and marketing services within the region to
form their own agricultural extension systems so as to provide
inputs for farmers.
It is important to conduct a study to find out which
products  are on demand in both domestic and foreign markets.   A
good information system between farmers and exporters is a
necessity, and cooperation among MAFRA, Ministry of Industry and
Trade and the Export Promotion Center (IGEME) is considered
useful for its realization.
Although  resulting  profitablity was 38 X,  new  production
methods were adopted and both product quality and quantity were
improved as a result of incentives for farmer investments and
lending under project discipline.
