  through: (a) increasing the production of fruits and\n            vegetables in those areas most suited to horticultural\n            production; (b) creating a nucleus of marketing\n            organizations in the private sector to facilitate increased\n            export earnings through fruit and vegetable exports; and (c)\n            formulating a master plan for a further integrated\n            development of the horticultural sector. The project covers\n            the first four and a half years of a nine and a half year\n            development program designed to achieve these objectives. To\n            ensure increased production, the project will support the\n            establishment of 7 new nurseries, 500 citrus and 350\n            noncitrus orchards (2.5 ha each), and 1400 small citrus and\n            non-citrus orchards (0.5 ha each), 100 vineyards and 150\n            greenhouses, besides providing operating credit to support\n            850 existing vegetable farms and 1,500 orchards, and helping\n            integrate applied research with extension to ensure the\n            dissemination of its benefits."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
