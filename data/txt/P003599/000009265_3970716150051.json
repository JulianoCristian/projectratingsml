    of the Yunnan Environmental Project (YEP) and to identify\n            appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts in the\n            project cities.  The objectives of this report are: 1) to\n            summarize the results of the environmental impact\n            assessments for each of the YEP World Bank funded\n            sub-projects; 2) to identify both the critical environmental\n            problems to be addressed, and those produced by project\n            implementation; 3) to assess the merits of alternative\n            solutions to these problems in environmental, social and\n            economic terms; and 4) to evaluate and recommend\n            interventions for mitigation of problems.  Chapter 2 of the\n            report discusses the institutional environment that governs\n            the environment in Yunnan Province.  Chapter 3 describes the\n            components of the YEP.  Chapter 4 describes the baseline\n            conditions in the project area.  Chapter 5 assesses the\n            impacts and mitigation measures required for the various\n            proposed components and summarizes the cost and benefits for\n            each component.  Chapter 6 is devoted to discussions on the\n            alternatives based on the environmental and economic\n            assessments.  Chapter 7 describes the public consultation\n            and participation process together with the results of the\n            surveys carried out.  Chapter 8 gives a brief summary of the\n            resettlement proposals.  Finally, chapter 9 describes the\n            procedures required to monitor the performance of the\n            proposed components to assess their effect on improvements\n            of the environment of Lake Dianchi."}, "docdt": "1996-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
