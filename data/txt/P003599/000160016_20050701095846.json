A\n            number of valuable lessons were learned from the\n            implementation of this project. 1) The Borrower's\n            capacity to implement a project must be carefully assessed\n            and if deficiencies are detected, sufficient training,\n            technical assistance and, most importantly, the necessary\n            time must be allotted before project commencement to\n            strengthen the project agencies. 2) When the confidence\n            level concerning the project agencies' competence and\n            experience is low, project needs to be simplified by\n            reducing components, number of participating cities, variety\n            of activities, and project cost. 3) Procurement processing\n            improved markedly, when the Bank's ICB and NCB\n            processing was switched from Washington, D.C. to the\n            Bank's Beijing Office, owing to prompt reviews and\n            improved communication with and follow-up support to the\n            project agencies in Yunnan. 4)  Utility service adjustments\n            should be made gradually, over a reasonable period of time,\n            taking into consideration whether, for example, a wastewater\n            treatment plant in still under construction or has been\n            commissioned. 5) During project implementation wastewater\n            treatment standards were raised by the Government:  all\n            environmental activities should be required to conform to\n            the highest domestic and/or international standards. 6)\n            China still possesses relatively little experience in modern\n            sanitary landfill design and operation. Consequently, the\n            lesson should be for the Bank to strengthen its project\n            preparation support in this area, including the need to\n            provide specific training to the design institutes\n            responsible for project design. 7) Make design institutes\n            and reviewing consultants, if applicable, more accountable\n            for their work."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
