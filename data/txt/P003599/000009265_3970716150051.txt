1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 General Project Background
The Yunnan Environmental Project (YEP) mainly focuses on Kunming City and the restoration of the
Lake Dianchi catchment which is increasingly suffering from pollution of its water and air resources.
Noise and air quality are also of particular concern in Kunming City as traffic volume. industrial and
residential development all increase annually. The project also includes Gejiu and Qujing
Municipalities which are undergoing similar environmental degradation. Specifically, Lake Gejiu is
polluted with sewage and industrial wastes. and in Qujing the Nanpanjiang is in a similar state. Solid
waste disposal is a problem in all three project cities.
In response to these environmental pollution problems many preventive measures have already been
taken at Government and Municipal level, including legal. administrative, economic, technical and
disseminating measures. Certain improvements and benefits have been achieved but the speed of
rehabilitation in the Dianchi catchment cannot keep pace with the development of pollution. The
beneficial impacts of these interventions have not been very great and pollution has not been brought
under control.
Dianchi Basin. Gejiu and Qujing are the key economic zones in the province especially the Dianchi
catchment area and their economic production plays an imnportant role in the overall economy of
Yunnan. The pollution not only endangers the biological environment in these areas but also poses a
threat to the production activities, livelihood and health of the people. Furthermore, the pollution
poses a serious threat to social and economic development both in these areas and the province as a
whole. Unless actions are tak-en now, by the year 2000 the situation will be bevond control to the
detriment of the present generation and the generations to come.
It is against this background that the Provincial Government is seeking assistance from the 'World
Bank to provide the funds necessary to expedi:e the speed of development and implementation of
pollution control and environmental restoration measures in the project cities.
1.2 Project Objectives
Yunnan Province and Kunming Municipality are pursuing an ambitious economic development
strategy aimed at rapid economic growth and diversification. This strategy will put increasing
pressure on the environment as the demand for scarce natural resources and pollution loads increase.
The stratcgic objective of the YEP must therefore be to provide a sustainable setting for the longer
temi economic and social development of Yunnan Province. while providing a competitive
framework for industrial grow-th.
Under the Y-EP. development requires integrated multi-sectoral plans and programmes designed to
improve environmental management capacities and remove economic disincentives to resource
conservation and pollution prevention. These plans are being developed for the province and for each
of the municipalities. Their emphasis is on preventing environmental damage by increasing
awareness of environmental issues. building stronger institutions and creati._ the incentives for
efficient resource utilisation. waste minimisation and technical upgrading.
The strategic objectives for Yunnan Province and the YEP can therefore be summarised as:
I.  sustain a social economic market economyv
2.   halt and reverse environmental degradation:
3.   protect and improve human health;
4.   protect and conserve water resources;
5.   protect and conserve natural ecology:
6.  improve government and public awarer'.ss ef the environmenL

More specific. directly relevant. objectives can also be identified for the three project cities, in
recognition of their specific problems. namely:
7.   protect Lake Dianchi. Songhuaba Reservoir. Gejiu Lake and the Nanpanjiang River against
further environmental damage;
8.   meet the wvater resource and water supply requirements of the three cities:
9.   protect the Dianchi Catchment and Gejiu City from flooding.
1.3 Overall EA Report Objectives
The main thrust of this report is to define and w-eigh both negative impacts and positive benefits of
the project in terms of the overall objectives of the Yunnan Environmental Projectz and to identify
appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts in the project cities. First. these objectives include
improvement of the water quality of Lake Dianchi. Lake Gejiu and the Nanpanjiang in Qujing to
ensure sufficient future water supplies, and second, improvement in the overall environmental quality
of the Dianchi basin region in general and the three urban municipalities in particular.
1.4    The Geographic Scope of the Project
Yunnan is a province of38 million people and covers an area of 394.000 km2 (Figure 1.1). The north-
western area is dominated by the south-eastern Himalayas. where the upper reaches of three great
rivers (the Jingsha Jiang. which discharges to the Yangte River, the Lan Cang Jiang [Mekong]; and
the Nu Jiang [Salween]) flow southwvard barelv 80 km apart. In contrasL the southern areas are
tropical. while central and eastern areas comprise a plateau of red earth and fertile lak-e basins at an
elevation of about 2.000 m. The source ofthe Pearl River (the Nanpanjiang) is found in the north-east
of the Province.
The YEP focuses primarilv on the Dianchi Basin in which lies the Provincial capital Kunming since
this city with a population of almost 1.8 million. dominates the economv of the Province. Two other
important cities are also included: Qujing (220.000) and Gejiu (130.000) each of which support major
industries and confront their attendant environmental problems and impacts.
WVhile rapid population and economic growth in the last 15 years has all but alleviated poverty in the
urban areas of the Province. a hish price has been paid in the rapid deterioration in air and water
qualities in and around urban areas and in substantial rural environmental degradation. The
environment is becoming increasingly stressed and its ability to provide essential environmental
services. such as clean water and air. is now seriouslv threatened. This stress is shown most clearly in
the Dianchi Basin -where wvater resources are under great pressure in terms of both quality and
quantit.
As mentioned above. the YEP focuses primarily on the area surrounding the major city of Kunming.
for which a comprehensive Dianchi Environmental Action Plan (DEAP) is being prepared. It is
intended that the methodology of this management plan can be replicated in other river and lake
basins elsewhere in China. Indeed, similar principles apply to other cities and major towns in Yunnan,
although it is acknowledged that the types of environmental problems and remedial measues may be
different. Similar plans are under preparation for Gejiu and Qujing.
The study of the waters of Dianchi Basin, including the lake and associated reservoirs, involves
consideration of thie all inflows to the catchment area, and the outflow from the Waihai (Figure 1.2)
via its present single outlet Haikou Gate to the Tanglangchuan River. By 1996. a second outflow will
drain the Caohai via the Xiyuan tunnel to the Sahe River a tributary of the Tanglangchuan River. The
boundary of the study area for the Dianchi Basin has therefore been extended to the WVenqing gate. on
the Tanglangchuan River. 10km dow-nstream of Anning. rather than being limited to the actual
boundarv at the Waihai outlet at Haikou (Figure 1.2).

Secon I
1.5 Climate
Yunnan has a northern sub-tropical monsoon climate with extremes of temperature moderated by
altitude and latitude. Precipitation is plentiful and the province is generaliv water rich. Six major river
systems either originate or pass through Yunnan providing abundant water for irrieation and
hydropow,er generation. There are several large lakes of which Dianchi is the largest. However.
regional differences in the balance between rainfall and evaporation. coupled with considerable inter-
annual variations in rainfall. produce areas which are %%ater scarce. The Dianchi Basin is such a water
scarce area. Strong seasonal variations are also important. with dry cool winters and a warmer wet
season extending from May to September whe'. 80% of the annual precipitation falls.
Variations in weather conditions are one of tne most serious hazards in the Dianchi Basin and spring
drouithts can have important implications for water resource supplies and agriculture. Droughts and
floods are a feature of the Dianchi basin: and in drv years (precipitation < 600mm) serious water
shortages affect Kunming.
1.6 Population
The population of Yunnan in 1994 was estimated to be 38.9 million of whom 81% wvere involved in
agriculture. Population density is low 94 people per km (1 18 in China). The eastern half of Yunnan
is twice as densely populated than the mountainous vest.
Population growth rate in Yunnan is higher than the national average at about 2.1% per annum.
Approximately 32% of the population is under 14 years old. Average life expectancy is 65 years.
In 1992 the total population of Dianchi basin *was 1.96 million of which the non agricultural
population was 124 million the balance being engaged in the agriculture sector. The predominant
proportion of the non aerictiltural population (95 per cent) live in Kunming City (1.8 million). The
1994 populations ofGejiu and Qujin- are 132.000 and 220.100 respectively.
1.7 Economic Conditions
The economy of Yunnan Province is expandinm: growxth rates of around 8-9 per cent per year are
currentlv common. Whilst such rates are below that recorded for many Coastal Provinces in the
Peoples Republic of China (PRC). the- do ensure that incomes are dramatically rising and.
importantly. the pressures on the environment arc increasing. Ensuring ihat future economic growth is
mana_ed in a sound environmental wa%- is one of the most urgent tasks facing the government and
people of Yunnan.
In the absence of effective environmental management it is highly liklely that the unsustainable form
of economic srowth nowv occurringz within Yunnan will lead to set further pollution and environ-
mental degradation to the detriment of the environment and the economv. Key economic
characteristics and indicators of Yunnan Province are the:
a.    Dominance of Primarv Production: Relative to the PRC as a whole. the Yunnan Provincial
economy is proportionately more dependent on primary production (agriculture, especially tobacco);
secondary production (manufacturing) accounts for relatively less output in Yunnan than it does for
the PRC as a whole.
b.    Growth of the Tertiary Sector in Kunming Cit : Within Kunming there has been a
significant shift awav from primary and secondarv production tow%ards tertiarv (service) sector
activities over the 1988-93 period: as might be expected for the capital citv of the Province. Current
development plans suggest that this sectoral shift will continue tlhrough to the year 2000 and bevond.
Qujing and Gejiu in comparison retain primarilv industrial-agricultural economies.

section I
c.    Condoned Dominance of SOEs: A salient feature of the industrial landscape in Yunnan and
Kunming Municipality is the continuing dominance of large State Owned EnterpriSes (SOEs).
Although the snare of the SOEs in gross value of industrial output declined over the period 198-93.
they nonetheless still account for about 74 per cent of the gross value of production in Yunnan. By
way of contrast. in the PRC as a whole the corresponding figure was approximateiv 43 per cent. The
importance of the operation and management of SOEs cannot be understated: they are often major
polluters and at least 25 to 30 per cent are loss-making and appear unable to fund pollution control
and prevention measures. However. somie are loss makers through Central Government policy
decisions which regulate input and output prices for the factories well below mark-et prices; two
extremely important SOEs in this situation are the Kunming Chemical Fertiliser Plant and the
Kunvang Phosphate Fertiliser Plant both of which need funds to reduce their direct pollution impact
on Dianchi;
d.    Recent Growth of TVEs: Town and Village enterprises are dramaticaliv expanding in
Yunnan in line with their growth in many provinces of the PRC. These too can and are becoming
significant polluters since thev are mainiv sited outside the Kunming Municipal Master Plan area. The
TVEs are therefore sited where pollution discharge controls are either less strictal or not enforced.
1.8 Broad Problem Definition
Environmental degradation results from a combination of immediate and underlying causes:
* Immediate causes are those which actually produce the physical impact upon the environment.
examples include wastewater and waste gas emissions that pollute watenvays and the atmosphere.
* Underlying causes are mainiv institutional -or administrative in nature and are responsible for
permitting. or not preventing immediae causal factors. The key underlying causes of
environmental deadation include inappropriate economic policy and planning. industrial
deficiencies. problems of the economy, inadequate and fragmented institutions and enforcement
of environmental regulations. and lack of understanding of the actions needed to reverse the
problems.
Box I (page 1-7) provides a more comprehensive list of immediate and underlving causes.
This section introduces the special situation and problems existing within the Dianchi Basin: more
general problems including those of Qujing and Gejiu are then considered.
1.8.1 Kunming and the Dianchi Basin
While rapid economic erowth has all but alleviated poverty in the urban areas of the Province. the price
has been paid in the rapid deterioration in air and water qualities in and around urban areas and throuch
subsuntial rural environmental degradation. The existing environmental problems and concerns are
clear to see. The rivers passing through Kunming and the inner Caohai are dead. yet it is reported that
ten to fifieen years ago people could swim in them. Lak-e Dianchi. and possibly also the Sonehuaba
reservoir. are in increasing danger of going the same way.
Two basic issues are of prime concern and relate to the immediate causes of environmental resource
depletion:
* eutrophication and degradation of water quality of Dianchi Lake as a result of large inflows of
untreated domestic and industrial liquid effluents: nutrient rich agricultural runoff has also been
identified as a contributory source of pollution but the evidence for this is equivocal. thus the debate
on the relative importance of point and non-point pollution sources continues: to a lesser extent these
same concerns apply to the Songhuaba reservoir, and
* potential future water shorLtages due to increasing demand, and the resulting resource management
conflict between adequate water supply stoage and Kumning flood control.

Box No. 1 Immediate and UndelyinsCauses of Fuyvironmental Deradation
A. Immediate causes
1. Domestic sewage (organic and detergent P. BOD) 90% flowing untruead into lales and rivers
L Industry
* effluents flowing unteated into the rivers and lakes (generally low in P. COD + toxins important)
. mining (Dianchi especiallv from phosphate factories on south lake shore; Gejiu from tin mines)
d dust (ditto)
3. Agriculture
. fertilises on farms
. soil ermsion
. deforestation
. TVEs (>20.0W im the Dianchi Basin)
. livestock (minimal impacts)
*  fsh farming (mininal impacts)
I past ovr fishing of the capture fishery
4. Landfill sites and fly tipping
i   leachate pollution of ground and surface aers
5. Dyke construction around the blke for floodprotection coupled with:
 lake reclamation (inlling and conversion to agricultural land); this has resulted in -
O the destruction of the original littoral zone (shoreline area) and its natural ecob_y.
o destruction of the benthic macrophytes and.
c destruction of the fis!- kreeding areas.
* these impacts have possibly reduced the self-cleansing capacitv of the lakc through rcduction of the
retention period
B. Underlying causes
1. Environmental policv
. environmental protection in China has developcd rapidly over the last twenty yars and much anti-
pollution legislation is in place. However. enforcement of these re_ulations is generally ineffective.
. environmental policy cannot bc implemented without close monitoring, the necessary monitoring
institutions exist but data collection. analvsis and utilisation of the data in planning is limited. There is no
monitoring or control of domestic waste disposal and non-industrial wastes. Environmental impact
assessrnents are often weak. tending to be procedural rather than to highliglh: critical issues. Field
monitoring of vater resource volumes and flows is also largely non-eistent.
2. Economic planning and policy
. the transition from a command to a market economy is far from complete and pianning deficiencies are
leading to. or permitting, unsustainable development.
. the implementation of economic tariffs for water supply and waste disposal has not been implemented and
as such, thcse environmental services are under-costed and over-used.
3. Industrial production and mangement defiaencies
. many State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) which are the major polluting industries in Yunnan. SOEs are able
to implement expansion plans to the vitual neglect of their environmental consequences and impacts.
Such industries seem beyond the scope ofthe EPBs to enforce the existng legislation.
. A similar siuation exists in the case of Town and Village Enterprises (TVEs).
4. Institutional deficiencies
.envimmental managemrnt in the project cities is marked by weak and fragmented institutions, lack of
clear lines of authoriny and conflict and lack of co-operation among institutions of all types.
. few of the implementing agencies exercise cost recovery on the environmental services they provide and
are thereby restricted in their acivities by lack of adequate funds.

Section I
These two factors combine to create a potentialiv critical situation which by the year 2000 will slow the
region's economic development through water shortages as well as the increased high treatment costs
for potable supplies.
To addrcss the immediate causes of environmental depletion and degradation a broad range of
mitigation options are under consideration in the Yunnan Environmental Project aimed primarily at
reducing the inflow s of pollutants into water resources with particular emphasis on phosphorus load
reduction, and, securing new or enlarged sources of water supplies. This it is thought will reduce
eutrophication to levels where WVaihai water can be economically used for drinkine water supply.
These interventions are described in Chapter 3 and considered in detail in Chapter 4. In addition. a
range of policv options are also under consideration (Chapter 2). These include institutional
development. improved inter-agencv co-operation. tariff reform. wvater company privatisation and
water conservation: all of which aim to address the causes of resource depletion and environmental
degradation.
WVater Resources
Available water resources in the Dianchi Basin are scarc and large inter-annual variations in supply
are smoothed bv storage. Songhuaba is the main reservoir supplying Kunming with good quality
water. This supply is supplemerted with poor quality water from the Waihai in dry years. Songhuaba
has a considerable volume which could be used to store -best qualitv water for best use' purposes.
However. its primary function is not water supply but Kunming flood protection. Determining the
balance between flood protection and the storage of good quality %Nater for supply is a major dilemma
facing the Kunmine WVater Supply Company and the Kunming Water Conservation Office.
It should be realised that even if Songhuaba were to be used solelv for water supplv this would not
satisfy present or future demands and other sources and increased storage capacity are needed.
The essential aspects of the water resources conflict between quality, quantitv and flood control are
summarised in Table 1. 1.
WVmer Qualirr
In recent years the quality of Lakc Dianchi water has declined from an unpolluted clear water
condition suitable for potable water supplies (Class 11) to Class IV. The Sonehuaba reservoir remains
relatively pollution free and graded as Class 11 but thc signs of incipient degradation are beginning to
appear as algal blooms are reportedly becoming more frequent. Industrial pollution in the
Nanpanjiang upstream of Qujing has reduced water qualirv to Class V: Lake Gejiu is of a similar or
worse quality because of industrial and domestic effluent inflows
The degradation of Lake Dianchi stems:
* fromn industrial liquid and solid %%astes containing pesticide residues. phosphate fertiliser. toxic metals
and highly oxidisable matter.
* domestic and commercial wastes containing high levels of nutients and BOD.
- stormwater runoff.
* leachate from solid waste. and contaminated runoff from rural areas.
Tlhe unabated conveyance of the resulting. untreated pollutants into Lakle Dianchi has produced an
eutrophic water body with probablv anaerobic sediments, which are themselves a pollution source.
Elsewhere in Yunnan. the story is similar. With the notable exception of Lake Fuxian, the major
waterbodies suffer problems which are similar to those of Lake Dianchi or show early indications of
such deterioration. Even at Lake Fuxian the recent development of "tourist facilities is beginning the
process of environmental degradation along the shoreline. Rivers with cities or large towns in their

Inroducnon
catchments generally suffer from chronic pollution. including the Tanglangchuan near Anning. and the
Nanpanjiang downstream of Qujing and Kaiyuan and the Zhadian in Gejiu are appropriate examples.
Water Resources and .Food Control
At present. Lake Dianchi supplies almost half of Kunminges water supply and its continued deterioration
is a serious issue especially in dry years when supplies from Songhuaba are greatlY reduced. Because of
the primacy of Kunming in Yunnan the deterioration of Lakle Dianchi to a state where treatment of its
water becomes uneconomic gives cause for serious concern. This could seriously compromise the
continuing economic growth of the city, especially as its other main source of water, the Songhuaba
reservoir. is showing signs of increased phosphate and nitrogen pollution from agriculture and rural
settlements which continue to develop within the Songhuaba catchment despite its protected status.
Ever increasing demands from agriculturaL domestic and industrial users have led to a situation where
resources barely match demand; initial estimates predict that the Dianchi basin will suffer fomm water
shortages in the near future even during wet years. The present situation is shownn for the Dianchi
catchment in Table 1.2.
Table 1.1 The Water Resources Flood Control Conflict
a.     The Problem
Water demand now exceeds economically sustainable supply in dry years and will do so increasingly in the
future for all years. The problem is manifest in both water quantity and quality shortages.

This increasine demand also produces a conflict between the need to store more water from the wet
season and the need to provide Kunming with adequate flood protection. The ever incrcasing demand for
water is driven by the dual effects of (i) a fall in the real cost of w%ater compared to inflation, and (ii)
incomes increasing at a rate greater than inflation- Industrial wvater use is also high compared to similar
industrial processes in other countries. Although various reports put unaccounted for water at less than
ten per cent of supply. this figure is neither bome out bv inspection which reveals many leaking water
mains. nor by the high per capita domestic and commercial usage: recent unofficial estimates put it as
hliih as 50%. In fact the latter indicates a possible hieh wastage within consumers' premises since there
are few incentives to save watcr.
1.8.2 Qujing Municipality
Qujing City is located in the between the Pearl River and Jinsha River to the north-east of Kunming
(Figure 1.3). Qujing Municipality is newly developed with an area of 17 square kilometres now well
developed; the population is 220.000. Major industries are located within the city and also betwecn
Hua Shan and Zhan Yi along the river.
Water quantity is scarce and adequate water storage capacity is limited in the upper reaches of
Nanpanjiang bordering the Pearl River (Figure IA). The surface water mainly comes from seasonal
storms. In the dry season the Nanpanjiang is often reduced to a series of small pools. Underground
water is also scarce and sources are frequently polluted. Therefore the water resource base in Qujing
Municipality is very poor resulting in absolute supply shortages which are further exacerbated bv the-
lack of suitable sites for storage reservoir development
At present there are 33 industrial effluent sources in the municipality producing 21.000 cubic metre of
effluent daily. Similarly 17.800 m 3 of domestic effluent are discharge daily into the Nanpanjiang
from the city. The lack of effluent treatment facilities in Qujing has reduced the Nanpanjiang in the
municipality to less than Class V qualitv in the drv season.

Iniduction
The development of the municipality has also greatly increases the quantity of solid waste gencrated
daily and landfill disposal or this industrial and domestic waste is becoming an increasing problem.
Associated with solid waste disposal are various environmental problems of which pollution of
groundwater resources is prominent. According to the 1993 statistics the refuse produced in the
municipality amounted to 55.8 thousand tons per annum. The refuse disposal site is a poorly managed
dump and not a formal landfill.
1.8.3 Gejiu Municipality
Gejiu Municipalitv is a Lev industrial area in the southwest of the province with the advantages and
disadvantages of most extensive tin reserves in China (Figures 1.3 and 1.5). Surrounded by mountains
Gejiu City is located in a closed vallev and surrounds Lake Gejiu (0. klm2). This lak-e was formned in
1954 during a severe flood which blockled the original outlet to the valley. Since the citv has no
wastewater treatment facilities for either domestic or industrial waste the lake is the receiving water
for this eMuent and is consequently badly polluted.
Gejiu is characterised as a water scarce municipality: water resource management is difficult as
wastewater flowing into the lakee represents two-thirds of the water supply in the dry season. Flood
control problems are another feature of this city and the threat of flooding constrains the social and
economic development of the citv and its economv. The decades of mining. pollution by metal based
industry and the rapid growth of TVEs have caused great destruction of the Gejiu environment and
have intensified the problems of water supply and soil erosion, and siltation of the lake.
1.8A General Environmental Problems in Yunman
Air and Noise
Air and noise pollution is increasing as industry and traffic gromv. This is reflected in the few data
available to the study team recarding health indicators in Yunnan which shows that respiratory and
circulatorv diseases have replaced infectious and parasitic d;seases as the main causes of morbidity. In
This Yunnan is following the rcst of the country. There have been few analyses of the coSTS to the country
in ill health arising from a poor air quality and stress from excessive noise.
Infrastrructure and Seriice Defrciencies
The effects of the increasing pollution sources are exacerbated by a lack of infrastructure and
environmental services to comprehensively treat the waste produced. Tack-ling these immediate causes is
hampered bv insufficient data regardine the existing situation and historical trends. Much existing
baseline data is either out of date. derived bv calctlations based on unsupported suppositions. or
classified as confidential.
Domestic Wastes
a.     Sewage: In Kunmine only approximately 60 per cent of households are connected to sew%ers.
Much of the population still use communal or dry household latrines. Nightsoil collection from these
latrines plus septic tank sludge goes either to farmers or the city landfills. The lack of integrated
planning is highlighted by the fact that all new developments still have to construct septic tanks although
the sewage may ultimately be treated.
In Qujing and Gejiu all wastewater passes untreated directly to the Nanpangjinag River and Lake Gejiu
respectively.
b.    Solid waste: Within the established urban ares of all three project cities solid waste is
effectively, but not efficiently. collected. The main collection problems are in the rapidly urbanisiag
areas around the cities which have not vet filly established collection systens. The main issue with solid
waste, however, is in its disposal. Existing and recently abandoned sites discharge highly polluted

leachates into nearby water courses with no treatmenst In Kunming. one of the proposed new sites is
outside the Dianchi catchment, the other is not.
The site for the new landfill in Qujing has been selected but not yet approved by the local authorities
because of concerns for local water supplies. No details of solid waste disposal are available for Gejiu
but infilling of the Lake Gejiu with mine tailings is a serious problem reducing the lakes volume and
badly polluting the water..
Indutial Pollatrion
The quantities of both solid and liquid industrial wastes are estimated to be greater than those of
domestic origin. In Kunming industrial and construction solid waste is greater than domestic by a factor
of nine and the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau estimate that between 700 and I A00 tons of
toxic wastes are being produced dailv. The responsibility for industrial waste disposal lies with the
generating industry, and it is doubtful if any treatment is being applied to the toxic waste, or if other
wastes are being disposed of in a sanitary manner, especially as the costs of non-compliance (fines) are
usually less than the treatment costs. The consultants appointed to produce the feasibility study for
domestic solid waste have not been requested to study industrial solid waste disposal. which is much
more of a problem. This major gap requires immediate attention.
Wastewater Treatment and Disposal
Both domestic and industrial liquid wastes are ultimately conveyed to water courses either directly or
via sewers. In Kunming these watercourses are either river channels or old irrigation canals which are
now no more than open sewers. The two existing sewage treatment work-s (Nos. I and 2) treat river
water. and the two further sewage treatment works under construction (Nos. 3 and 4A) will do the same
for the foreseeablc future. The processes proposed in the treatnent plants vary considerably due to the
requirements of the bi-lateral donors. The key issues are whether the proposed treatment works will be
able to produce effluent to required standards, and whether the necessary funds can be found for
effective operation. For example. the existing No. I treatrnent works is understood to operate at two-
thirds capacity due to insufficient funds.
Rsural Environment
Agricultural water dcmand is currentlv estimated to be about 60W of the total demand in the Dianchi
Basin and is used mainly for irrigation.
Rural activities potentially havc a considerable adverse impact on the overall situation of environmental
degradation and rcsource depletion. Run-off from the rural areas can be a maior source of pollution
when intense rainfall and poor soil conservation practices coincide. The pollutants originate both
from agro-chemicals used in increasingly intensive farming. and particulates from mining of phosphate
ores and other minerals. and quarrying activities. There appears to be little or no control over these small
mineral extraction enterprises. which are disfiguring the landscape and potentially contributing directly
to the phosphorus load entering the Waihai.
However. the coincidence of poor farming practices and intense rainfall does not appear to occur in the
Dianchi Basin and the potential for pollution from this source is not realised. It also appears that even if
erosion products were produced through bad farming and mining activities the transport mechanism to
carry particulates to the lakle is often lacking. River flows. which would normally be the transport
medium. are so controlled in the catchment that little surface X ater flows into the lake during much of
the year and especially at times of high soil erosion potential (ploughing and harvesting).
The inference. thermfore, is that the pollution of Lake Dianchi comes mainly from point sources (perhaps
as high as 80%) and non-point sources, such as agriculture are of relatively minor importance.

Section I
Insdtuuions and Planning
The transition from a command to socialist market economy has had serious implications on land use
planning which can impact adversely on the environment The need to encourage private investment has
reduced the power of govenunent agencies to ensure development occurs as planned. Economic and
physical planning. although not fully linked, responded to the targets of the command economy, but this
did little to serve environmental concerns as thev v ere not considered to be a significant issue economic
planning. Tllis highlights the urgent need to link environmental and economics in future planning.
Rizid Master Plans have become increasingly more difficult to implement as land-use initiatives and
planning reforrns have introduced a more demand driven approach to development. The economic
growth resulting from these planning and policv reforms has left gaps in the environmental planning
process. A component of these reforms has been to make more government departments autonomous
and self financing by offering their skills and expertise to the private sector. However, the dual
privateirjblic roles of the key government agencies involved with plannine has led to conflicts
retarding their role as the facilitators / regulators of development or as profit making development
companies. The growth of real estate development companies, many of which belong to government
exacerbates this conflict in government roles of both operator and enforcer. The long term
environmental effects of such policies and the resulting conflict of interests for government employees
could be grave.
1.9 Overall Strategy for the *EP
1.9.1 Clear Objectives
An effective cnvironmental management plan that promotes environmentally sustainab,_ economic
dcvclopment must address both the immcdiate and underi, irg causes of pollution and environmental
degradation. This incorporates objectives for societv and the economy: an understanding of the
environmental problems. their causes and consequences: a programme of interventions, both
-hardware- (infirsructure) and 'softnrare' (policies and institutions): and monitoring and evaluation
Of the effects of the interventions to allow the introduction of corrective measures or updating of the
stratcev as necessary.
Sourec of Problems: a ran_e of measures will be required in the Environmental Management Plan to
tackle each of the followine catezories of direct and underlving causes of environmental degradation:
these have been summarised in Box 1. page 1.7.
Water Demand: the current buraeoning  demand for %water must be checked. In this sector the key
objectives should b6 to:
* implement actions to reduce %'nter demand and consumption;
* protect and improve existing sources:
* idcntify further potential sources;
* ensure an adequate and safe supply of water to all users: and
* ensure cost recovery for water supply from all users.
Waste Control: the effective and sanitary disposal of liquid and solid waste is a major component of
environmental management. Tie current unsustainable trajectorv of waste disposal has to be checked
and reversed. This can only be achieved through an intgrated approach to wgaste   nment to
achieve:
* a deceleration in the growth of liquid and solid waste geneation:
* maximised reduce. re-use. renewal and rcvcling initiatives;
c effective and efficient collection, treatment and fmal disposal. with funding raised according to the
polluter pays principle.
* implement waste minimisation practices

1.9.2 Policy Initiatives and Contlicts
Policy Initatives
Environmental protection in China has developed rapidly as the economy has expanded over the last
two decades. with legislation and institutions established to take responsibility at all levels. Devised
by the National People's Congress, environmental policv is implemented using the -eight systems of
environmental management" under the Environmental Protection Law (1989). The National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) is responsible overall for its supervision ar.d admini-
stration. supported by Environmental Protection Bureaux (EPBs) or Offices (EPOs) at p.-ovincial.
municipal and county level. At each leveL the People's Congresses are authorised to make laws and
regulations to meet local conditions.
In Yunnan Province. the People's Government has committed itself to the environwent producing a
document -Environmental Protection Goal and Task" (No 89) requiring prefecture. municipal and
county levels of government and district administrations, commissions, offices and bureaux to give
environmental protection top priority in furthering economic development. The Province determined
it would control industrial pollution. add domestic wastewater treatment capacity and protect Lake
Dianchi and the Nanpanjiang River. This docunent effectively sets out the policy for the province.
In 1993, the importance of sustainable development to the province was clearly identified at a
meeting convened by the Governor. The provincial policy can be summarised as:
"a policy based on the strong environmental management and protection denmanded
,y socieh. swhich improves environmental qualiay andpronotes the sustainable.
rapid and souwid denelopment of the national social market econonn y:
As a policy for the province as a whole and for the Dianchi Catchmeat. this clearly signposts the need
to implement an economic-cum-environmental planning system. Yunnan Province and the municipal
governments of Kunming. Qujing and Gejiu have already taken a number of positive measures in
support of this policy. The provincial and municipal environmental action plans currently being
discussed and prepared will build on and strengthen these initiatives. The possibilitv of developing
structure plans for the kev urban areas are shortiv to be discussed with the planning authorities.
These would promote a more flexible planning system and improve environmental managernent over
the less flexible mister plan svstem.
The Yunnan Government has requested World Bank and bi-lateral assistance in addressing the
environmental problems of the province. To be suitable for World Bank Group financing, such
projects must bc carefully selected, thoroughly prepared and appraised. closely supervised and
systematically evaluated. The National and Provincial Governments have decided upon a programmc
in which loan funds can be disbursed commencing in financial year 1996.
To achieve disbursement in 1996 priority infrastructure investments are being 'fast-tracked" to obtain
the World Bank's aereement to financial support bv June 1996. This requires limited policies which
focus on the measures required to ensure the success of the chosen priority infrastructure investments.
and which can be implemented in parallel uith the commissioning of the fast-tracked infrastructure
investments. This 'rapid action frarnework" is being prepared at the present time. It is appropriate
that this includes the following, somc of which have also been defined b! the World Bank as
requirements for pre-appraisal and appraisal:
*    setting of appropriate and affordable tariffs for water and wastewater to recover costs:
*    improved rules. regulations and enforcement capability governing industrial pollution to makle
the polluter pay;
FINAL DRAFT                    page 1.17of 22                      03 Februay 1996



Section I
*    changes to the planning system to improve environmental control over development and ensure
provision of priority infrastructure;
*    institutional development and training of the implementing and regulatory agencies to ensure
that projects are effectively implemented, operated and maintained;
*    preventative health care and public awareness programmes to promote water demand
management optimum use of sanitation facilities and public acceptance of proposed tariffs..
Policy Conflicts
Tle underlying causes of a number of environmental prblems in Yunnan are in part a product of
policies operatine at the national level. especially as they relate to resource pricing and agricultural
support policies. such as price controls on fertiliser supply. By implication. the shift towards a more
sustainable development path will require changes to polices implemented outside the region but
having a major impact on the catchment area. The longer term transition to sustainable development
will require chanrges at the national level to resource pricing and agricultural development objectives
and plans.
Others areas of potential conflict include the push for economic growth and the need to protect the
environment. In the short run it is tempting to 'go for growth" and then return to the task of cleaning
up. rehabilitating and protecting the environmenL This strategy is very risky and is unlikely to be
successful given the existing precarious position of water resource shortages and degradation. The
latter will almost certainly put a brak-e on future development if no pollution control measures are
implemented immediatelv. Moreover, within the context of increasing regional competition for
international investment a degraded environment will make Yunnan less attractive and thus limit
opportunities for income and employment growth.
1.9.3 Water Resource Management
The key issue is water demand management In an area of scarce water resources. the first priority
must be to limit demand. This appears to be recognised to a limited extent in locational planning
measures for industrv. but resolute measures are needed in all sectors (domestic. commercial.
industrial and agricultural) to control demand and limit waste. Some of the demand projections
quoted for Kunming appear to ignore this fundamental point. In addition uater pollution prevention
measures keep water economically available: pollution makes it unavailable.
Water dcmand manaiaement interventions include:
* tariffs:
* leak control:
* public awareness campaigns:
x ater conservation measures:
* water recycling in industrial premises.
While water demand manaaement actions can take the form of public education campaigns and other
non-financial intrventions, the only major way to restrict consumption is through the introduction of
tariffs to ensure consumers pay for the cost of the water they consume.
1.9.4 Municipal Infrastructure
The following priorities have emerged:
a water resources strategy incorporating demand management;

Introduction
*  the provision of the capacity to treat sufficient water to potable standards reliably and efficiently.
and to distribute water safely and without wastage;
*  the installation of sewerage systems in Kunming Qujing and Gejiu;
* development of solid waste landfill sites and disposal strategies. including the closure and
restoration of existing dump sites:
* the above measures to be supported bv appropriate tariff structures for cost recoverv.
1.9.5 Industrial Pollution Control
A comprehensive approach is needed which includes:
* an industrial solid and liquid waste disposal strategy:
*  appropriate tariffs for discharges to watercourse and for discharges to sewer of wastewater with
strength greater than domestic sewage:
* sufficient powers allocated to the sewerage authority, solid wvaste authority and/or EPB to check
for compliance with effluent standards and industrial waste disposal criteria. and to deter non-
compliance:
* assistance in the form of financially attractive loans to factories which need to improve their
waste and wastewater treatment facilities and can demonstrate viability under normal mark-et
conditions:
*  closure of loss-maLing enterprises with chronic pollution discharges;
- implementation .: commercial financial management in State Owned Enterprises:
*  agencies capable of enforcement of regulations.
1.9.6 Rural and Agricultural Management Improvements
It is vital that rural managcmcnt improvements are introduced as soon as possible. The particular
issues to address are inappropriate use of fertilisers and irrigation methods. and lack of control of
miineral extraction enterprises. Suggested actions are:
a  improve water use efficiencv in agriculture to reduce water demand:
* establish a rural planning framework based on agro-ecological zoning of watersheds and the
identification of the key environmental degradation issues within each planning zone:
a  change the emphasis from costlyv. low benefit engineering measures to improved agronomic
practices:
*  development of low cost effective soil and water conservation measures in the upper watersheds;
* improve awareness of the value of sustainable use of scarce resources;
* improve efficiency and sustainabilitv of use of artificial fertilisers;
* develop improved water distribution systems for irrigation under changed cropping patterns;
* improve on farn adaptive research measures and demonstration areas;
* introduce greater controls over permissions for and operation of mineral extraction activities.
These are the topics which should be examined and prioritised in the on-going feasibility study for
watershed management and later incorporated into the Environmental Management Plans.

1.9.7 Institutional Development
The objective should be to create the institutions which can guide and accommodate development in a
technically and financially sound manner, and which recognise the resource limitations of the region
and thus the necessitv of improving the environment.
In addition to the specific policy and institutional aspects of appropriate tariff structures and the
establishment of authorities with sufficient autonomy and legal powers. the Rapid Action Plan
includes:
* clarification and rationalisation of the duties and responsibilities of institutions
* improvement of the linkages between physical, economic and environmental planning. including
the use of various development scenarios in infiastru^ture planning:
* adoption of an integrated approach to infrastructure planning;
* management accounting and multi-year financial planning for basic public services;
* computerisation of financial administration and taxation systems:
* the development of an overall environmental monitoring and administration system
1.10 Report Objectives and Organisation
1.10.1 Introduction
The Yunnan Environmental Project has been placed in World Bank Category A for the overall
environmental impact assessment. For this reason all of the sub-components wvhich fall under the
project have also been placed in Category A. irrespective of their content and their potential for
adverse impacts. The Terms of Reference for the overall EIA has been approved by NEPA.
Very few of the potential projects will require substantial resettlement. Nevertheless. land acquisition
and resettlement issues are important in several project and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to
meet the World Bank's standards has been prepared.
1.10.2 Report Objectives
The objectives of this report are:
I to summarisc the results of the ElAs conducted for eacih of the YEP NVorld Bank ftndcd sub-
projects:
to identifi- botb the critical environmental problems to be addressed. and those produced by project
implementation:
. to assess the merits of alternative solutions to these problems in environmental. social and
economic terms:
4. to evaluate and recommend interventions for mitigation of problems:
In addition, it is important that:
5. the World Bank sub-Drojects are evaluated, not in terms of meeting the overall strategy for the
YEP but in terms of their individual impacts and their potential contribution to the overall goals of
the project
6. the report aims to be more than a document intended solely to meet regulatory requirement but one
which proposes a strategy for environmental rehabilitation and protection. that defines its environ-
mental impact and establishes a monitoring programme so that project implementation progress
and environmental improvement can be monitored.

This report is based on the identified scope of the sub-components of the YEP following the World
Bank Pre-Appraisal Mission of IS January to 5 February 1996. During that mission. the basic scope
of each of the sub-components was agreed between the Yunnan authorities and the World Bank. A
number of studies and desisns remained to be completed so that project details can be more preciselv
defined. Vv'here possible. this has been indicated in the text and account has been taken of the
implications of these in the assessment of impacts and mitigation measures.

2. INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1 Introduction
This section sets out the institutional environment within which the YEP is being implemented. It
identifies the different institutions involved and the framework within which they operate. It also
describes the regulatorv programme and puts fornard proposals for the institutional structure required
for project implementation.
There are three categories of institutions considered under the project which 'till impact on changes
in polluting the environment. namelv -
I. Regulatory. Monitoring and Enforcement authorities. such as Kunmin- Water Conservancv
Bureau (responsible for the manaeement and control of water resources wvithin municipal area.
including Lake Dianchi Catchment). and Environmental Protction Bureaux (EPB). which are
responsible to the People's Government at the Provincial. Municipal. Prefectural and County
levels.
2. Implementing Agents (lAs). which can be split into three classes. First are the Provincial and
Municipal Governments which are responsible for solid wvaste collection and disposal. Second are
the quasi-autonomous public utility companies. such as the water and drainage companies. Third
are the private industrial companies and state owned enterprises (often these are owned by the
provinces or municipalities rather than the state) which qualifY for funds for works to reduce
pollution discharges.
3. Environmental Project Ofrices (EPOs). which are temporary offices established at Provincial and
Municipal levels as a condition of the World Bank loan for the specific purpose of facilitating th-
successful completion of the YEP.
2.2 Existing Situation
2.2.1 Regulatorv Authorities
Environmental Impact Assessment spans manv different institutions in both the government and
private sectors. Bv far the most important are those authorities which monitor and re_ulate the
pollution to the environment - the EPBs. The EPBs are responsible for protecting the environment
from pollution.
The existine organisation of these bureaux in the Chinese Government follows the five levels of
administration. EPB offices are established, like other ministries, at all five levels (State. Provincial.
Prcfecture/Municipal. County'District and Towxn & Nleighbourhood). The Peopie's Government at
each level controls the recurrent funding for operating the authorities and bureaux under its control.
including EPBs. This means the primary and strongest lines of management control over the EPBs
are vested in the People's Govemment. whilst communication and controls between EPBs at different
levels is secondary and less distincL In the case of the EPBs. this secondar: communication is
limited to the submission of monitoring reports and the downward transmission of directives and
technical information.
A typical reportine channel for the environmental protection bureaux is shown in Figure 2.1.
Govemment Lines of Communication.
The EPBs at the provincial level and in Kunming and Gejiu report directiv to the Peopl's
Govermment. but Qujing EPB reports to the Urban and Rural Construction Bureau instead of directly
to the People's Government. This is the same arrangement as at the County Administrations.
The existing organisation of KEPB is shown in Figure 2.2.

laboratories and the results are reported to NEPA:
* Management and Supervision Office: Their main responsibility is to collect water pollution levies
in accordance with the State laws: and.
* Institute of Environmental Science: Whose main responsibility is to conduct EIAs for proposed
new developments.
The general armngements of the EPBs is shown diagramnatically in the organoram in Figure 2.1
The EPBs involved with the project recognise they need more skilled staff and have difficulties
collecting the full amount of the levies due to them for industrial pollution discharges. Provincial
estimates are that the collection performance amounts to about 40 % of the levies due. In addition the
existing rates of the pollution levy are small.

Ysunnan Province
In order to control the environmental impact of new developments the provincial government intends
to take tiue lead of setting the policv throuchout the province to approve only those developments
which have a long term sustainable benefit, and which meet the requirements 'of the socialist mark-et
economy. system. There wvill be a strengthening of managzement and supervision of environment
protection which will include the development of increasing public awrareness at all levels of society.
The intention being to proriote sound national development.
T'he National Planning~ Commission and NEPA consider for approval new developments valued at
more than USS 5 million. Anything less is approved by the Province or Municipality.
Yunnan Environmental Protection Bureau (YEPB) is responsible for overseeing environmental
activities through OUL the province. It monitors the water quality of the six large rivers, including
some international rivers which traverse the province. In addition to monitoring the rivers, YEPB
has five other primary functions. These are:
* collection and collation of the results of tests for monitoring the environment (water quality, in
lakes, ground water and secondary rivers. air~ and, noise. submitted by all the monitoring stations
in the proince, with the exception of KEPB, and reporting these results to NEPA;
* training of staff in the environmental protection bureaux within the province:
*environmental researc-h-
*standardise analytical procedures and conducting periodic quality control checks on the analytical
procedures followed by other environmental laboratories in the province. and,
*disseminating policy, regulatory, and tec-hnical information to all provincial municipal EPBs, and
educating and informing the public of the importance of protecting the en-vironment.

Section 2
Kunming Mrnicipaily and Lake Dinchi Basin
Reducing polluted inflows to Lake Dianchi is a prime objective of the project. Success in achieving
this goal, requires a concerted effort to reduce pollution at source which must s.e coupled with the
EPBs being given the resources to enforce the laws and monitor discharges. Polluters must be made
to pay prescribed levies and offenders who breakl the law must be fined.
IKEPB estimate there arc 19 differcnt organisations in the municipality which have some
responsibility towards the quality of Lake Dianchi. These include Lakee Dianchi Protection
Committee and others. Clearly such fragmentation and overlapping of responsibilities is inefficient
and a major cause of the ineffective pollution controls within the basin. This is demonstrated by the
apparent continuation of an upwvard trend of pollution of the lake water
Lake Dianchi catclment covers four Districts within the Municipal Area and four Counties outside
the urban boundaries. Each of these eight areas has separate administrations and independent
monitoring facilities and Supervision Offices as part of the local EPBs. which are responsible for
colleoting levies and fines from polluters. Although KEPB is responsible for co-ordinating the
environmental law enforcement within the municipal boundaries which includes the whole of Lake
Dianchi Basin. the organisational arrangement is unvieldv and unmanageable as the eight subordinate
environmental units report to their respective People's Government and not to KEPB. KEPB supports
the viewv that there is an urgent need for organisational changes.
There are five implementing agents in Kunming Municipal area which will benefit from World Bank
project funding. These are (1) Kunming Water Supply Company which has been trading for S0
years: (2) Klunming Drainage Company. set up in 1995 by amalgamating three organisations
responsible for the collection and treatment of sewage. and (3) Kunming Municipal Government
%%hose Appearance Committee will mana_e the solicd waste projects. (4) and (5) are Chenggong and
Jinnin- Counties whose Urban and Rural Construction Bureaux are installing sevwerage systems.
Qaiing antd Gejia: Cities
The other two cities which will benefit from funding under the project are Qujing and Gejiu.
Both cities have EPBs which are responsible for monitoring pollution discharges of industries in the
municipal areas and collecting the pollution levies and fines. In Gejiu. the EPB reports directly to the
Municipal People's Government. whereas in Qujin- the EPB reports to the Urban and Rural
Construction Committee. This lower status of Qujing EPB and the fac that some of their duties and
responsibilities overlap with the Prefectural EPB have a ne_ativc bearing on the effectiveness of the
organisation.
Qujing has applied lor ftunds for three project including a solid waste management project. sewerage
svstem (sewers and treatment works) and extensions to the water supply svstem.
Gejiu requires funds for sewerage and a sewage treatment works and flood drainage.
2.2.2 Implementing Agencies
For the purposes of YEP the implementing agencies are defined as those agencies who will be in
direct receipt of project funds (foreign and domestic) and be primarilyv responsible for disbursing
those funds on the different components of the project by procuring goods and services. These
components are to contribute to reduction in environmental pollution and sustainable economic
growth.
The implementing agencies may be government administrations at provincial. municipal. or county
levels: quasi-autonomous public utility companies (water and drainage companies) and private
industries or industrial SOEs. which qualify for funding for reducing pollution released to the
environment For purposes of managing the project. the YJorld Bank require each implementing

arrangement is that the Province has formet. .; project leading group commintee chaired by Deputy
Governor Niu. YEPO reports to this leading group.
The main executive project ofrice is Yunnan Environment Project Office (YEPO) and eac-h of the
three project cities have also formed EPOs Figure 2.3 shows the role and linkages between the
Environmental Project Offices. People's Govemnments and the Implementing Agencies.
The overall purpose of the EPOs is to ensure good quality projects and the timely completion of the
project components within budget. Their role is to co-ordinate the design and implenmentation of the
project. and to guide and monitor all the implementing agents to ensure they follow the procedures
and conditions of the NVorld B3ank. During the implemecntation phase of the project, the Project
Offices will be responsible for preparing the financial and progress reports required by the World
Bank. and manaingen reconstruction quality control through the construction management services

Secton 2
All five EPOs have organisations which include a financial management division. YEPO have five
other divisions responsible for Project Management. International Co-operation. Administration,
Procurement, and Construction Supervision.  KEPO have divisions responsible for Project
Management. Engineering, and Planning and Co-ordination and Qujing and Gejiu have organisations
with two other divisions covering Administration and Tcchnical.
2.3 Legal and Administrative Framework for Environmental Management
This section reports on the laws and regulations that are designed to protect the environment and
discusses the role of the EPBs in the province who managed these laws and regulations within the
limits of the project.
2.3.1 Laws and Regulations
National Laws
The State Government of China havc decreed environmental laws and regulations which conform to
United Nations standards.
National environmental legislation appears to be far ranging and covcr the essential issues. The
quality of the legislation has not been reviewed and the extent to which the laws are applicable and
enforceable is not known. It is apparent, however, that the effectiveness of enforcement is inadequate
as evidenced by the environmental degradation occurring in Yunnan and China generally.
Tlie Provincial Government has issued a document called Enrironmenl Protection Goals and Tasks of
tize Present Governnrent Term (1993 to 1998). This document establishes responsibilities goals, and
tasks to be resolved which have been devolved to all government departments and will be co-
ordinated by the leader of those departments.
Tlie overall goals of this legislative cum policy document are to further restrain environmental
pollution trends, improve the environment in the cities, towns, and rural areas, control development in
the region so that it is both in harmony with the environment and sustainable in the long term, and to
lay the foundations for future development.

23.2 Administration
The Environmental Protectiorn Bureaux are responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations. Water
pollution is controllcd throu-h the imposition of levies as detcrmined by the laws. A special section.
the Nlanagcment and Supervision Office. within the EPBs is directly responsible for the collection of
the levies.
Howcver duc to shortages of monitoring equ;pmenL staff and vehicles. the EPBs have difficulty in
prosecuting industries wvhose discharges exceed the permitted pollution limits. This problem is
known to the authorities which have sort assistance throush both a Canadian Aid program and the
inclusion of funding for Environmental Manaeement in the YEP budget.
2.4 Regulatorv and Enforcement Performance
2.4.1 Collection of Levies and Fines
Each EPB is responsible for collectin= water pollution levies and fines as set out in State Laws and
Regulations from industries and other polluters in their area of control. In the case of the Dianchi
Basin. this means there are nine authorities. the eight district/counties and the Municipality itself.
involved with the collection of the various levies and fines.

INS77VOI,ONAL ENVIONMENT
The Management and Supervision Office of the EPBs is the section responsible for collection of the
pollution levies and fines. The collection performance varies from one organisation to the next The
collection performance throughout the province is estimated to be only 40 % of the amount duc. Also
the rates of charges for pollution levies are low.
For these reasons the World Bank has included as a condition for pre-appraisal that plans be prepared
on methods for improving collection of these levies (see Section 2.5.1).
2A.2 Environmental Compliance
The visible evidence of compliance with the environmental laws and regulations in any of the project
areas show littie success. There is. for instance, a regulatory fine for people caught discarding
rubbish on the streets; regulations against the sounding of car homs: and. dumping of toxic effluents
into streams and watercourses. Yet the noise levels in the cities show no sign of abatement.
pedestrians and the nuisance of rubbish discarded on roads and footpaths by individuals in the city is
klept under control bv the streets being regularly swept rather than by disciplining the public The
reported increase in pollution levels of Lake Dianchi also indicate that there are problems in enforcing
the water quality regulations.
Some of these measures. especially the sweeping of streets, used to be effectively controlled by
members of street committees. often retired people. but increasingly these measures are being eroded
by changes in urban housing patterns which are destroying the cohesion of the neighbourhood
systems. Regulation for altemative measures of control exist but the policins and enforcing of the
regulations needs to be reinforced.
2.4.3 Monitoring Facilities
Generally there seem to be sufficient well-equipped monitoring stations throughout the province, yet
analytical results are difficult to obtain and are often incomplete. The problem is apparently poor use
of the available resources that are thought to be due to lack of qualified lboratory and sampling
technicians, coupled with a lack of computerised methods for recordinC and reporting the results of
samples.
Funds are expected to be made available to address some of these problems from both the Canadian
Aid progrname and YEP

2.5 Recommended EPB Institutional Structure for Project Implementation
2.5.1 Water Resources and Pollution
Pollution concentrations of groundwater. rivers and lakes is combination of pollution loads and
dilution. Hence there is a strong argument for combining the functions of water resources and
pollution control by establishin- a single authority with both roles.
An examples of this is the National River Authority in the United Kingdom, whose main functions
and responsibilities are set out in Table 2.4 below.
Table 2.4. Main Functions of the National Rivers Authoritv.
Water Resources                * the planning of resources to meet the water needs of the
countnr;
a licensing companies. organisations and individuals to
abstract water and monitoring the licences.
Environmental   Qualitv   and  * maintaining and improving water quality in rivers, estuaries
Pollution Control                 and coastal seas;
* granting consents for discharges to the water environment;
monitoring water qualit3r, pollution control.
Flood Defence                  * the general supervision of flood defences;
* the carrying out of works on main rivers and sea defences.
Fisheries                      a the maintenance, improvement and development of fisheries
in inland waters including licensing re-stocking and
enforcement functions.
Conservation                   * furthering the conservation of the water environment and
protecting its amenity.
Navipation and Recreation      * navigation responsibilities in three regions- Anglian,
Southern and Thames and the provision and maintenance of
recreational facilities on rivers and waters under its control.
2_5.2 Pollution Controls
There are two types of control of pollution being applied in the province. These are the control of
direct dischargcs to rivers and lakcs and the control of discharges to public sewvers.
First. the national policy of China is to enforce control of pollution discharmes to rivers and lakle.r
through the applications of rines and levies, with occasional closure orders being applied to some
industries. This method of enforcement provides a source of revenue to People's Govemments and
thus there is a dancer that People's Govemments have no induccment to encourage industries to
install effluent treatmenlt facilities. Some of the revenues are however relurned to industries in the
form of grants for effluent treatment improvements and until some other measures of control are
introduces. it is the method that must be used for initial pollution control improvements.
Prior to World Bank pre-appraisal of YEP, YEPB and KEPB are required to:
* prepare time-bound action plans for improving the collection of fines and levies;
- ensure the tvo largest total phosphorus (TP) polluters discharging to Lake Dianchi reduce TP
concentration in their final effluent to I mg/l by August 1996; and
* become actively involved in the control of land use and the siting of industries.
The EPBs have responded to these conditions but it is proposed that technical assistance be provided
to help the EPBs implcment the required changes. This includes assistance from Canrede and funds
that the EPB applies for from the World Bank loan.
DRtAFT                         rpage .10 of 12                         30 Jausary 1996



INSTIUrTONAL ENRONMENT
Secondly. drainage companies are being empowered by the municipalities to charge for discharges to
sewers. Usually the charge is based on S0 or 90 percent of the metered water consmption and
industrial dischargers are expected to remove any substances that are harmful to the severs or the
treatment process through on-site prm-treatment. As yet the quality of effluent discharged from the
sewage treatment works is not being monitored or controlled by the EPB.
2.53 Yunnan Environmental Protection Bureau
The role of the YEPB could be enhanced by introducing proactive management of the other Bureaux
in the province. Developing business. financial and monitoring targets would be an effective
approach with YEPB monthly results against agreed targets
It is recommended that the monitoring of the wrater quality in the six rivers already monitored by
YEPB remains the responsibilitv of YEPB. However. the province would benefit from technical
assistance being provided to YEPO to strengthen the environmental monitoring and reporting
facilities. This would include YEPB assuming a more proactive role in controlling the
standardisation of analytical test.
The environmental protection of Lake Erhai Basin at Dali is managed by an organisation which is
responsible for the environmental protection of the entire Lake Erhai catchment. The Kunming
Institutional Reform Office is studying the management of the Lake Erhai Basin Environmental
Protection Bureau with a view to replicating the organisation for Dianchi Lake. In principle this idea
has merit but requires further development
2.5.4 Kunming Environmental Protection Bureau (Lake Dianebi Catchment)
At present the responsibility for environmental protection within Lake Dianchi Catchment is vested
with the countv EPBs in the rural areas and the KEPB in the urban area.. In theorv the KEPB area of
responsibility includes the whole municipal area. but in practice control is maintained by the People's
Government within the various administrative areas.
Several alternatives for reorganising the environmental control of Lak-e Dianchi Basin have been
discussed with Chinese officials whose preferred option is to strengthen the status and increase the
powers of KEPB. Accordinc to discussions with the Kunming Municipal Institutional Reform Office.
the long tcrm objective is to establish KEPB as an autonomous authoritv responsible for
environmental mana=ement of Lak-e Dianchi Basin. This means the counties and districts transferring
their environmental management responsibilities to the KEPB.
Tihc first stcp in such reorganisation is to rationalise the responsibilities for environmental protection
withiin the existing municipal institutions. This includes transferring the environmental tasks
scattered amon_st nineteen authoritics. includin= Dianchi Lake Protection Committee, to KEPB.
KEPB would nced to establishi a new internal division. called Lakle Dianchi Bureau. with the sole
responsibility of monitoring and reducing the pollution entering Lake Dianchi. One of the tasks of
the new division would be to centrally monitor watercourses at countY boundaries which will allow
the tracing and stopping of extraordinary pollution.
By increasing the resources (staff training, vehicles and equipment) of KEPB, it will be able to
perform the following additional functions:
* more efficiently enforce pollution control regulations through the application of fines, levies and
closure orders:
* to be activelv involved in the planning of newv industrial developmentL especially if given the
powers to veto plans that have the potential of causing long term environmental degradation:
* able to reassume the pollution monitoring currently undertaken by others, such as the Kunming
Traffic Department who currently monitor traffic noise:

Section 2
* beter control die disposal of hazardous waste, and to include the monitoring of the new solid
waste landfill sites;
* monitor pollution discharges from individual factories. if better equipment is supplied: and.
e report laboratory test results accurately and quicklv if better equipped.
The second stage of institutional reform for the KEPB would be reviewing the experiences of both
Lake Erhai Basin Management Committee, Dali. and Gejiu EPB and using these to further extend the
basin wide powers of KEPB.
The third stage would be to consider giving KEPB further autonomy in the Lake Dianchi Basin. such
as establishing a new autonomous Lake Dianchi River Authority responsible for regulating both water
resources and pollution control within the Lakle Dianchi Catchment.
2.5.5 Qujing and Gejiu Environmental Protection Bureaux
Neither Qujing nor Gejiu EPBs require any changes in their institutional structure specifically to
improve monitoring the impact of the project works. Both have the same problem as reported above
with the compilation and reporting of laboratory results. Qujing EPB would also benefit from
The efficiencv of the Qujing EPB w%ould be enhanced by allowing the QEPB to report directly to the
Qujing People's Government like Gejiu EPB instead of thmugh the Urban and Rural Construction
Committee and reviewing and revising the role of the Prefectural EPB. The two are reported to have
some overlapping responsibilities.

3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.1 Introduction
The Yunnan Environmental Project (YEP) is a multi-component programme designed to curb and
rectifr the environmental deeradation that has occurred and continues to spread throughout Yunnan
Province. It focuses primarilv on three major urban centres, namnely Kunming (including the Lakle
Dianchi catchment). Qujing and Gejiu. A list of the programme sub-components is given in Table
3.1.1. which also indicates the relevant funding agencies. Other environmental remediation projects
that are proposed under the YEP are also included.
This section then describes the background and content of the projects to be funded under the World
Bank loan. in particular giving details of the components of those projects with the most significant
adverse environmental impacts. i.e. the solid waste collection. treatment and disposal.
3.2 The Overall Objectives of the YEP
The overall objective of ihe Project is to tackle the immediate and underlying causes of environmental
degradation in the Project cities and to improve water supplies where necessary.
In Kunming and the Dianchi Basin. the overriding concern is to protect Laklc Dianchi from further
pollution and consere its utility as a raw water source for drinking water supply to Kunming. The
reduction of plant nutrients. and especially phosphorus is the prime objective in this respect If
eutrophication of the water continues the costs of wrater treatment from this source will rapidly become
uneconomic.
To reduce the nutrient load on Lake Dianchi. the following project components are proposed:
- Kunmine Urban Sewvage Treatment and Sewerage - to ensure the capture and treatment of both
domestic and industrial wastewater
* Industrial Pollution Control - aims to reduce the P load on the lake originating from specific fertiliser
factories in the W aihai catchment: in addition a selection of factories producing highly toxic wastes
are also to be targeuted.
* T n smaller project components. Small Towns Sewerage and Rural Sanitation will also address the
pollution control issue. These projects are designed to reduce the pollution loads to the Waihai and
Songhuaba Reservoir respectively.
In Gejiu. protection of the lake's amenity value and improvin" flood protection for the city are of
particular importance. In Qujing. the need to prevent untreated wastewater polluting the Nanpanjiang
River is paramounL and enhancing the limited water supply quantity and assurance are also important.
3.3 Rationale for Intervention
While non-point sources are acklnowledged as a cause of pollution. the project components are mainly
targeted at alleviating point source pollution. The reasons for this are:
a)   It has not been conclusivelv demonstrated that non-point sources axe a major source of pollution
to the water bodies. Whilst the ratio of total phosphorus generated by point and non-point sources
in the Lake Dianchi catchment is estimated to be about 50:50. the ratio of the loads which actually
reach the lakle is thouaht to be more like 80:20 because of the way the rivers within the catchment
are managed;
b)   Analysis has shown that reducing point sources provides a better unit rate of return on the
investment:
c)   There may be additional benefits accruing from urban infrastructure and industrial pollution
control projects which should be reflected through reduced morbidity combined with enhanced
economic development.

ProjeCI Dtscipdoi
The interventions also require substantial support in the key areas of institutions and finance The YEP
will consolidate and enhance the environmental protection initiatives already in place. It will also
provide technical assistance for institutional development in water supply. environmental sanitation,
industrial pollution, control, environmental monitoring and water resource management in the Dianchi
Basin and the secondarv cities of Qujing and Gejiu. Envimnmental monitoring in the province
requires reinforcing through the provision of both hard-ware and software to the monitoring stations.
3.4 Dianchi Basin Projects
3.4.1 Kunming Sewerage Projects
The key objective of the YEP is to tackle the immediate and underlying causes of environmental
degradation. Kev interventions are through environmental sanitation and industrial pollution control.
supported by institutional strengthenini. In Kunming these interventions focus on Lake Dianchi to
ensure its continued use for potable wvater supply. While non-point sources are known to contribute a
small amount to lakle w-ater quality deterioration. the projects mainly address the treatment of municipal
and industrial effluents point sources which current data indicate are by far the most significant.

Profect Docriplon
The existing sewerage system has many deficiencies, in particular most of the city centre is sewered
but only about 10-15 per cent of the sewage is fully treated. though much of the remaining sewage
passes through septic tanks.. Much of the problem in the deterioration of Lake Dianchi and its
tributaries stems from the conversion from nightsoil to sewcrage which allows untreated septage and
sewage to enter the water bodies. This has been compounded bY increasing water use, the
introduction of washing machines using phosphate-based detergent and a rapidly expanding
population.
Objectires
The overall objective of the Kunming Was-teawr Management Project (see Annex Al of the Project
Report) is to ensure the capture of all wastew-ater being generated in the urban area (both industrial and
non-industrial) and prevent it entering watercourses untreated.
This will be achieved throus-h four klev integrated strategies:
1. Constructing trunk sewers to convey the wastewater direct to the treatment works;
2. Reticulating the currently unsewered suburban areas and developing networks to collect both
industrial and domestic sewerage;
3. Comple;ing the WWTW construction programme to ensure that each drainage district has a
treatment plant with treatment to GoPRC standards. In particular achievine effective nutrient
removal.
4. The success of these first three interventions xwill depend upon maximising the number of
connections to the cxisting scewerage system and extending it into the expanding suburban areas
The above vill be also complemented wvith necessary support to the agencies responsible for wastewater
management and regulation.
Table 3.4.2 belonv compares the volume of v aste. ater flows being currently generated in the various
drainage areas in the Kunming urban area with the amount collected divided into the part of Laake
Dianchi into which the final effluent discharges.

a) Trunk Sewer and Sewerage Network Comoponent At present. only the city centre of Kunming
is sawered. This component will link the STWs to the sewerage networks either by trunk
conveyors or by culverts. It will also involve rehabilitation and infilling of the city centre
seweragc and its extension to the unreticulated suburban areas. In total. I8 I km of sewers will be
constructed.
b) Sewer Connection Component: The number of existing connections to the sewerage svstem is
unknown. although the KDC estimate it at around 40 per cent. While new developments are
linkled into the network, it is important that existing propertics are also connected to the system.
This component complements the trunk sewer project and will aim to ensure maximisation of
connections to the system, by providing financial and technical assistance to the KDC. These two
components are summarised in Table 3A3 below.
Table 34.3 Summary of Kunming Sewerage Interventions.

svstems. The total length of the suburban network will be 15 k;ms. All sewers will
be linked directly to STWs.
Connection   By-passing of existing septic tanks and connecting into the sewers. Converting
Programme   public latrines, currentlv utilising nightsoil collection into flush systens linked to the
sewers. In the city centre - transferring existing connections from combined sewers
to new separate foul sewers.
c Sewage Treatment Plant Project: ICunming presently has two STl's and nvo under construction.
;-EP will upgrade the existing works later extended it and twvo additional works uill bc
constructed. hiis n ill bring the treatment capacitv to 510.000 m-/day and ensure that all the
drainage areas of Kunming city havc a STWN. Table 3.4.4 summariscs the Kunming sewagge
treatment project interentions.
The design objective of the proposed STWs. in conjunction with other YEP interventions, is to reduce
the total effluent load on Lake Dianchi and promote its recovery to Class Ill standard. Implementation
will also greatly benefit the water courses passing through Kunming which are carrently little more
thaii open sewers. To achieve this end. total phosphorus. the Ley pollutant. is to be reduced by 75-
RO0e. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Solids (SS) will be reduced by about
90% and nitrogen by 60%.
Effluent Qualt Standards
Phosphorus removal is seen as the most important parameter in STW effluent in order to safeguard
Lake Dianchi as a supply source for drinking water.
It has been suggested that sewage effluent which is discharged to the outer lake. the Waihai. should
be treated to meet the Grade I standard of Category 11 of the Chinese Integrated Sewage Discharge
Standard, GB8978-88. This includes a total phosphorus limit of 0.5 mngl.

Biological treatment processes can be designed to satisfy an effluent consent standard of 1.0 mgti
total phosphorus. An STn  designed to meet this standard on a 95 percentile basis would actually
liave to produce effluent containing an average of around 0.5 mg/I. In order to satist- a discharge
consent of 0.5 mg/I total phosphorus. however. an additional stage of chemicaliv-assisted
precipitation would be required.
It is not certain that an SN' effluent consent standard lower than 1.0 mgtl total phosphorus will be
necessarv to protect Lake Diazv'hi. Therefore, the large Kunming STWs discharging effluent to Lakle
Dianchi will emplov biological treatment designed to meet an initial effluent standard or 1.0 mg/l
[otal phosphorus. However. their design will mak)e specific provision for the later addition of
chemical treatment. if required.
If experience shows that it is necessary to apply the lower total phosphorus limit set by Chinese
Standard GB8978-88. Grade l. Category 11. chemical treatment can be added in the future.

Two recent surveys of per capita pollution loads in Kunming indicate figures of 0.7 and
1.7 g TPlcapita/day. For design purposes. 1.45 and 1.5 for Years 1995 and 2000 have been suaested.
Since a majority of the population are not connected to the sewver system the effective load per capita
to the STW can be assumed to be less than 1.5 g TP/capita/dav, designs will be based on
I g TP/capita/day until the connection rate wanrants a higher figure.
On the basis of these data the development of the proposed STWs is expected to reduce the potential
Kunming TP load on the lak;e from the present 330 metric tonnes per year (Waihai 210. Caohai 120)
to 160 tonnes per year of which 90 tonnes will go to the WVaihai.

d) Industrial Effluent Control Progamme: much industrial effluent passes diretly to sewers or
water courses without any treatment. This component aims to capture all industrial liquid wastes
and to ensure pre-treatment of toxic wastes prior to disposal to sewers The programme will
encourage industries to pm-teat toxic or hazardous wastes on-site by effective pricing of untreated
discharges and ensure full cost recovery for treatment at municipal facilities. Major polluting
industries will also be encouraged to locate or relocate outside the Dianchi catchment.
e) Stormwater Drainage: the intention here is to prevent flooding and control urban mn-off to
reduce the adverse effects on STWs of excessive fluctuations in crude effluent concentration and
volume. For this to be effective consideration of storrnwater drainage must be integrated in the
overall planning of the urban areas. especially those flat low lying areas bordering the lake.
Technical assistance to the KDC is proposed which will clarify responsibilities for stormwater
drainage and update the existing stormwater drainage master plan to incorporate land-use
planning.
f) Institutional Development: the hardware interventions described above can be made ineffective
by weak institutional control and management during the operations phase of the project. It is
therefore essential to strengthen the aeencies responsible for waste management, particularly the
newvly formed Kunming Drainage Com-pany which is responsible for sewers, sewage and its
treatment. This development will comprise technical assistance in compiling condition inventories
of KDC assets and a database of the existing sanitation situation through supply of experts and
equipment. Sewver cleaning and safety equipment will also be supplied.
Cost recoP-ely
-The mechanism for cost recoverv is still under discussion but it is likely that a sewerage levy will be
included in the proposed water tariff: this will have the benefits of reducing administrative costs.
promoting water conseration and providing immediate finance to the KDC.
3.4.2 Kunming Water Supply and Estension Projects
Eristlg Sitationt
l:xpansion of the water supply capacitv is being proposed under YEP for Kunming and Qujing:
currenti only the Kunming project is considered for World Bank funding (see Annex Cl of the
Pmject Report).
Thc objective of the extensions to tl.e water supply and the distribution network is to better meet the
incrcasing demands in Kunminm from all consumers. domestic. commercial and industrial, where
projections indicatc a doubling in demand by the year AD2020 from 538 to 953 million m3/year. Per
Onpitia demand is expected to rise during the same period from 305 to 355 litres per person per day.

Project D    _Ciiptn
Total water demands in thu Kunming Master Plan have been estimated by multiplying the total
populations by the fespective per capita demands given in Table 3.4.6 above.
At present. the three water treatment works (WTW) supplied from Songhuaba (Nos. 1, 2 and 4) are
regularly operated at throughputs in excess of normal capacity during periods of good raw water
quality and together produce a total of 280.000 m3 per day. Although the overall YEP includes sub-
projects to reduce the pollution load into Lake Dianchi it is expected to be many years before lake
waxer quality shows anv signs of recovery.
In the meantime and in order to meet national standards for drinking water quality (GB 3838-88. see
Table 3.4.7). it is intended to exploit fully the resources of Songhuaba. Those with intakes from the
Waihai are increasingly suffering from .operational difficulties due to poor water quality especially
from the impacts of dense alpal growth. WTW No 3 is understood to be shut down for this reason.
The WVT  No 5 (production 200.000 m3fday) uses Lake Dianchi water which is contaminated with
heavy algal growths and other pollutants. It uses dissolved air flotation instead of settlemenL and
dual media filters (anthracite coal I sand) instead of single raedia sand. The partially constructed
W-' W No. 5B will, when completed, use ozonation to control algal activity and powdered activated
carbon to reduce other micro-organic materials.
A further 15.000 m3Id are obtained from groundwater sources bv the Kunming Wlater Company. The
total daily production is therefore 495.000 m3. This figure is 58.000 m3 per day short of the 1995
demand fieure. but since some industries have access to further groundwater which is not supplied by
the Water Company supplies currently meet demand.
Project Components
To achieve the necessary increase in future supply and achieve the necessary quality standards, it is
proposed under the YEP for Kmaming that the World Bank will fund the following new elements
designed to supply Songhuaba water to the city:
raw water pipelines to convey the additional water to the new treatnent facilities:
- extend the existing capacity or %VTlW No I from 80.000 to 150.000 m3 per day:
- construct a new wTW' in two phases of 100.000 m3/day each at Beijiaochang in the north of
lKunming:
* provide resenoir and connections and extensions to the distribution network comprising:
; extensions to the existing 1200mm ring main around the second ring road:
- installation of additional branch lines alon- main cit roads.
Treatment Processes
The proposed new waterworks will use the same basic process technology as in the existing works
supplied with water from Songhuaba. but with modifications to improve process treatment, hydraulic
efficiency, particularly because of fears that the water qualitv of Songhuaba may deteriorate in time.
due to lack of proper control of agriculture and rural developments within the catchmenL
The basic trament process at Songhuaba treatment works can be summarised as follows:
I. chemicallv assisted flocculation:
2. tube-module settling tanks (often bypassed when water quality is good);
3. rapid gravity sand filters:
4. chlorinatior. (gas):
i. treated water storage:
6. high-lift pumps to distribution network..

PPejecDescriscn
It is proposed that the contract for supply of the process equipment for the WTWs will contain
stipulations regarding the range of raw water quality conditions which may occur. and the treated
water quality standards which have to be complied with. The contractor will be allowed some
latitude to propose alternative processes whilst at the same time offering lower overall capital /
operating costs. but he will be required to provide guarantees of satisfactory treatment process
performance. within the above framework of water quality standards. Any alternative processes must
be fully evaluated and the process contractor wmould be required to bear the cost of any re-design work
necessarv.
The expansion of capacit% is dependent upon supplies from the Songhuaba reservoir being increased:
confirmation of the extra yield is still under discussion. The average water yield of Songhuaba
Reservoir. based on data from 1954 to 1991. has been estimated to be 200 million m3/vear. In a wet
year. the available yield can be as high as 270 million m3r,year. At present the reservoir level cannot
be raised to increase its storage capacitv until compensation for land has been paid to local farmers.
An altemnative approach to maximising runoff from the Songhuaba catchment is the construction of a
new dam at Huaneshivan. This option is disadvantaced by the high unit cost of the wvater supplied.
A further development which will have. as yet unquantified. impacts on water supply costs and
benefits is a proposal to install a dual supply svstem-. This has the objective of ensure that the
limited supplies of good quality water from Songhuaba are used for domestic and other potable water
supply purposes and not for low grade industrial and agricultural uses.
Cost recoverv for these developments is expected to be achieved through increased tarifft. a higher
percentage of customers billed and reduction in losses of revenue due to leaks with concomitant
reductions in power costs. In addition. improvcd efficiency in treatment operations will result in
reduction of process chemical costs.
3.4.3 IKunming Solid Waste Management
'nt.roduction
Overall responsibility for the collection and disposal ordomestic. market and commercial solid waste
and street sweepings in IKunming rests with the Kunming City Appearance Committee (KCAC) and is
carried out tinder the niunicipal Environmental Sanitation Section (MESS). The collection and
transfer of solid iiasle to the dumps is currentlv undertaken by the District Environmnntal Sanitation
Sections (DESSs) in the tuo urban districts of Panlong and Wuhua. and sub-urban districts of Guanda
and Xishan.
NIost domestic. marl;et. street sweepings and commercial wastes from Panlong and Wuhua are
collected but this is not so, in Guandu and Xishan. In these suburban districts. large amounts of
uncollected wastes lie on the edge of the roads, causing visual and otiher forms of pollution.
In 1995. there %%ere eight Small Transfer Stations (STSs) in Kunmine. each capable of handling 3D
tonnes of waste in a i-6 hour day. Waste is collected to them by tricycles. handearts and small
vehicles and transferred to containers for onward transport to the dumps. Currently. twro waste dumps
are in opcration. both of which are unhygienic and unsatisfactorv. A further five dumps containing
large quantities of waste have been virtually abandoned. These give rise to continuing leachate
pollution and require urgent remediation.
Disposal of industrial solid waste is the responsibility of the generating enterprise under supervision
by the KEPB. Nearly 9.000 tons/day are generated of which 3.000 is recycled and the balance
disposed of informally. It is estimated that the quantitv of hazardous waste disposed of informally is
between 700 and 1.400 tonnes per day. Approximately 400 t/d of this hazardous w%aste (both toxic and
hospital) are incinerated in Anning. An industrial and hazardous waste study is proposed to be
undertaken as part of the project.

Project Report Annex Dl provides further details of the proposals for solid waste management for
Kunming.
Project Obijc ives and Dejinern
The kev objectives of solid waste management investments are:
a)   the effective and efricient collection and disposal of both industrial and domestic solid waste.
particularlv in the peri-urban areas:
b)   the safe disposal of toxic wvastes from industries and hospitals;
c)   to encourage reduction. re-use, recovery and recycling of waste;
d)   the development of suitable sanitary landfill sites and transfer stations which minimise haulage
costs:
e)   the control of pollution from existing dutmpsites.
These objectives will be achieved through the following interventions:
a)   upgrading and extension ofthe municipal collection, transfer and haulage facilities by:
*   introduction of an appropriate containerisation programme.
*   provision of additional small and new medium size transfer stations:and
-   purchase of large and small vehicles;
b)   the development of 2 new sanitarn landfill sites:
c)   capping and control of existing dumpsites;
d)   insititutional strengthening of MESS and the DESSs; and
c)   the provision of technical assistance and training programmes.
Future Waste Generation
Future forecasts of ovcrall solid waste generation have been considered for a ten-year horizon. They
also take account of provision of a solid w%aste management service in areas which are currently not
served and the effects of the programme of conversion from coal to gas fuel for cookinz. The
predicted numbers of people using gas for cooking in the vears 2000 and 2005 have been based on the
Kunming Master Plan. Table 3.4.8 sets out the predicted generation of domestic-commerical-street-
institutional solid staste and approximate figures for industrial solid wastes destined for the municipal
landfill sites.

landfilling. one to the north west of Kunming outside of the Dianchi Basin at Hongshuitang. and one
to the east at Baishuitang. These sites are to be developed in parallel and serve their respective sides
of the citn. Basic details of the two sites are summarised in Tabl 3A.10 and site plans are given in
Figures 3.4.3 and 3.4A. They will be developed in phases. Both projects will include the following

The Hongshuitang site is located 19 km to the north west of Kunming in an area of fissured limestone
and MESS has alreadv made investments in land acquisition. surface water control. dams. site access
roads. weighbridge and offices. Some concern over the Honeshuitang landfill has been raised since
the site is a source of spring water supplying potable water to local inhabitants. This in itself does not
preseat a big problem, but the site is in an area of }arst limestone. there is evidence of fissures.
tunnels and voids and a fault line bifurcates the site. The area is subject to seismic activity.
The Baishuitang site is located about 20 km east by south east of Kunming. This is an area of small
grained quartz sandstone and shale: there is a fault line at the southern end of the site. A condition of
the Icase is that MESS construct a new 1.5 km access road from Baishuitanc villa2e to the landfill site
off the existing eastern highway. Tihe villagers intend to convert the site to agriculture. as the capping
and top soiling proceeds.
The landfill sites will be partially lined with an overall 600mm thick double geo-membrane. sand and
claY lining in the base. with an overall 400mm lining with a single geo-membrane in the sides.
Leachate will be collected by gravel drains to a leachate collection pond and recycled onto the landfill
for disposal bv evaporation. The drainage system will also be used to collected gas which will be
flared off. Surface water will be diverted around the landfill sites bv peripheral cut off drains.
The landfills will be filled in 2.5 to 3m layers and coVercd with a 0.2m blinding layer. Upon
completion. thev will be covered with 0.4m of soil and 0.15m of topsoil before being planted.
Rteabiiltation of Existing Dump Sites
The seven existing dumps will be graded. sealed and capped and restored to agricultural or other use.
Leachate will be recirculated and monitoring will be provided. In addition. sanitary industrial wraste
management will be introduced and enforced. including safe disposal of toxic wastes through
strengthening of the Environmental Protection Burmaux.

3.4A Small Towns Sewerage Project
The Small Towns Sewerage project (see Project Report Annex C4) will provide STWs in two
expanding counwty towns situated on the banks of Lake Dianchi into which their effluent presently
passes untreated. Existing drainage ditches will be replaced by separate foul sewer systems leading to
newvly constructed wmastewater treatment works. Connection programs will be developed in a manner
similar to Kunming. Chenggong, about 25 kilometres south east of Kunming. will have a sewage
treatment works capacity of 25,000 m3/day fed by a new sewerage network. Jinning. at the southern
end of Lake Dianchi, will receive a similar project. The STWs for the two small towns will be
designed to meet the same effluent standard as Kunming.
3A.5 Rural Environment Improvement Measures
Three pilot areas have been identified in Dianchi Basin in the villages of Dounan and Wulong in the
north eastern sector of the Waihai and Xiaohe in the Songhuaba catchment (see Figure 12). In these
pilot areas a range of measures designed to make improvements to the rral environment have been
proposed. The concept being to create community based model villages where the practical benefits
of such environmental improvements can be demonstated. The proposals are summarised in Table

3.4.6 Industrial Pollution Control Project
Introduction
Industrial pollution is a major cause of environmcntal degradation in a majority of Yunnan cities and
no more so than in Kunming and the Dianchi Basin. Air and water quality have been seriously
degraded in recent years to the point where rapid and effective remedial measures are urgentlv
needed. Industrial discharges harmful to the laLe and its catchment area include trace organics. toxic
metals. phosphate. BOD. and emissions of SO2 and NO,. Improper solid waste disposal management
practices are another enviromnental problem characteristic of the industrial sector which further
pollutes the lake and rivers in the municipality.
Control of industrial effluents will be crucial to the success of the entire YEP: the means of control
are largely institutional and regulatorvy the necessary discharge and emission standards already exist
and must be enforced and. additionallv, the 'polluter pays' principle7 implemented effectively.
Project Report Annex B I describes the Industrial Pollution Control (IPC) element of the YEP in more
detail.

Key Pollutaing Industries in Dianchi Basin
The ongoing economic reform process is stimulating further industrial growth in the Dianchi Basin
and is likely to exacerbate the already unacceptable level of pollution particularly if policy and
regulatory refonns and other mitigating interventions are not introduced and enforced in the very near
future. The majority of polluting industries which contribute the bulk of the pollution are State
Owned Enterprises7(SOEs).
KEPB identified 43 kev industrial contributors to water pollution in the Dianchi Basin in a 1993
survey (based on an extended catchment to include the upper reach of the Tanglangchuan River). Of
these. 23 discharge directly to the Caohai. the remaining 20 to the W'aihai. Of the latter. 8 factories
are estimated to account for 90-95% of the total pollution load in the Basin. based on an assessment
(set out in more detail in Annex BI) usine a modified Chinese Pollution Source Index to rank the
factories. Of these 8. seven have wastewater treatment facilities but suffer from either a lack of
capacity or inadequate technology. or both. Four of 20 firmns discharging to the Tanglangchuan River
are also considered to be major polluters.
IPCStrfVeg
An IPC Management Plan is being implemented by the EPBs. It is expected to cover both specific
measures tO reduce pollution. by process changes and wastewater treatment. and non-specific
measures. like resource pricing and regulatory reform. to facilitate investment in pollution control.
T*he overall strategic objectives of the IPC projects are to:
I. mitigate industrial pollution entering Lake Dianchi and the Tanglangchuan River.
2. encoura_e existing and future industries to comply with pollution control re_ulations.
J. create the right incentive structure to encourage enterprises to invest in pollution prevention and
waste minimisation through provision of loans. and
4. encourage enterprises to link commercial improvement (industrial upgrading) with improved
environmental management practices.
5. closure of loss-making enterprises with chronic pollution discharges.
The primary and secondarv objectives are:
I. to introduce pollution control and prevention measures to the target industrics which discharge
phosphorus into the lake. and in particular, into the W aihai. since this is a primary source of water
for KIunming.
2. to limit discharges of toxic and other harmful substances which seriously impact wvater qualitn in
the basin.
IlPC uill bc based on the follou ing guiding prir.;-iples and concepts:
I. Polluter Pays Principle (PPP): polluters pay in proportion to the volume and strength of the waste
discharged.
2. Cost recovery on environmental services: industries wvill be charged an economic levy for
discharging wastewater to sewers and solids to landfills.
3. Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Recover (4Rs Principle): designed to reduce the quantity of waste
produced rather than simply treat % hatever is produced.
4. Affordability and adjustment periods: industries wili require time and financial resources to con-
form to the new situation of pollution control: these should be provided to encourage compliance.
Industrial wastewater control will ensure capture and treatmncn of a greater proportion of industrial
liquid wastes. The major nbjectives are to:

Setion 3
* capture all wastewater originating from urban factories and convey it through to treatment works;
ensure at-source treatment of hazardous toxic waste:
* outside the sewered area. encourage industries to treat their own wasteCvater.
* introduce mechanisms to ensure that the cost of discharging untreated toxic wastewater is much
greater then the cost of pre-treating at the factory;
e ensure full cost recoverv:
e increase the cost of indo-rial water to encourage treatment and recycling.
It is proposed that a sector approach is adopted which will initially cover three industries:
1. Chemical indusiries: especially those contributing phosphorus and toxins to Lake Dianchi;
2. Paper mant:factiurers: due to their output of BOD and acids;
3. Mletal indius:ries- since these are primary sources of toxic metals.
Polluting industries will be either financed directly be a specific loan as part of the YEP or allowed
access through a line of credit and a small revolving fund to finance pollution reduction measures.
The main industries selected for improvements are highly polluting iron and steel factories, fertiliser
factories. pesticide facorfies and paper mills.
Pollution reduction will consist of process upgrde: improved liquid and air emission treatment; and
waste minimization measures. Specifically, this includes targeting the fertilizer companies to reduce
significantly the levels of phosphorus in their wastevater effluent, the smelters to reduce the metals in
their discharges and the pesticide factory to curb the emission of organic toxins direct to Lake
Dianchi. This will be accomplished mainly through investments to improve the wastewater treatment
processes and recycle treated water. Process upgrades in these aaeing factories will also reduce
wastage. improve profitability and reduce pollution levels.

Kun)mng Phoshate Fertiliser Plant
The Kunvang Phosphate Fertiliser Plant (KPFP). a 40-year old SOE owned by the Provincial
Chemical Industry Department, located in Jinning County close to the southern shore of Lakle
Dianchi. produces twenty-four products based on phosphate ore from its ow%n mine. Products include
phosphate and superphosphate fertilisers and other products. The 300.000 tonnes annual production
eives rise to wastewater containing a mixture of process effluents and cooling water. Although some
wastewvater treatment is provided, the plant currently discharges 4.1 million m3/yr containing
504 tonncs(^T of suspended solids (SS). 56.5 tonnes/T of total phosphorus (TP) and 22.9 tonnes/yr of
fluoridc (F) to the WVaihai of Lake Dianchi.
Following a feasibility study by the Yunnan Chemical Industry Design Institute (YCIDI). the plant
management has proposed production changes which include the modification of a 40,OOOtlyr H2S04
plant to provide a feedstock for the production processes. Production will also be moved away fron
certain of the phosphate products (calcium magnesium phosphate) into fine chemicals (high value
food grade phosphates): there wvill be improvements to a number of production lines and increased

reduction of the overall TP load to the lake. The proposed project includes the following specific
elements. in a phased approach:
*     modification of the 40.000 tonnestyr H2SO4 Plant;
*     modifications to the existing production processes:
*     modifications to water recycling systems:
*     segregation of drainage.
*     new vater treatment facilint;
*     new two-stage wastevater treatment plant and discharge pipeline.
The proposals will result in a reduction of overall production from 300.000 tonnes/yr to
200.000 tonneslyr. with a move into higher value-added products. The labour force will be reduced
by 323 from the current level of 2800.
Kunming Chemical Fertiliser Plant
The Kunming Chemical Fertiliser Plant (KCFP). a 30-year old SOE owned by the Heavy Industry and
Chemnical Industry Bureau of Kunming Municipality, located in Jinning County close to the south-
eastern shore of Lale Dianchi. produces nitrogen and phosphorus products which include ammonia.
phosphoric acid. NPK and NH4HCO3. The 185.000 tonnes potential annual production gives rise to
wastewater contining a mixture of process effluents (some containing ammonia. others containing
phosphate) and cooling water. Production of the phosphoric acid is intermitently suspended because
of a limited supply of H2SO4 feedstock. Wastewater treatment is provided separately for the
astewvater from the two principal areas of the factory. Overall, the plant currently discharges 4.83
million m'/)T containing 35 t/tT of TP and 555 t/yr of ammonia (NH3-N ) to the Waihai of Lake
Dianchi.
Following a feasibilitv study by the YCIDI. the plant management has proposed production changes
which include the addition of a new 80,000tt H2S04 plant. This will allow the phosphoric acid
facility to be operated continuously, thus reducing the significant pollution problems arising from the
current stop-start operation. The recycling of process and cooling water will be improved and there
will be an increase of recover of raw materials from the w%astewater. The capacity of the existing
trcatment facilitv for phosphoric acid/MAP wvastewater will be increased from 5 m'lhr to 10 m3/hr
wvitil the treated wastewater being returned for re-use in the production process: the recycling systen
of the ammonia production line will be increased from I 20m/hr to 390ml/hr. the effect of increased
recmcle will be to reduce discharges to Lake Dianchi from 550 to 60m3/hr.
The proposed improvements to the production processes would result in a reduction of the wastewater
discharges to 59m3/hr carrving a total of 4.3 tvr TP and 85 t/yr NH3-N. With the proposed
improvements to wastewater trealnenL the discharges to Lake Dianchi would be further reduced to
an estimated 0.425t.4r TP and 10.621/yr NH3-N. This equates to an overall reduction of about 35
tonnes/year of TP and 545 tonnes/year of ammonia. Overall. the worliforce will be increased by 72
fronm 888 to 960 for the H2S04 plant and additional wastewater treatment. The proposed project
includes the following elements, in a phased approach:
*     new 80.000 tonneslyr HzSO4 Plant:
*     modifications to the existing production processes;
*     provision of facilities to permit sulphur recoverv
*     modifications to water recycling systems:
*     modifications to drainage;
*     expansion of wastewater tratment for phosphoric acid/MAP
*     new wastewater treatment plant for ammonia production wastew aters.

3.5.2 Wastewater: Collection and Tratmen in Qujing
Qujing is an industrial citn which. according to its Municipal Master Plan, is expected to develop very
rapidly. Its population is predicted to more than double before 2010 (Table 3.5.1.). (see Annex A2)
The Municipal Master Plan shows that the development is intended to occur in the new western zone
or the city which is separated from the existing eastern part of Qujing by a railway line and
embankment. However. in the absence of a water supply to the new western area. development is
currently taking place in the existing city which is also being extended towards the north.
Qujing lies in the catchment area of the upper reaches of the Nanpanjiany (Pearl) River (see Figure
1.4). Tributaries of the Nanpanjians river flow around three sides of the existing developed area of
Qujing. These are the Baishi River. wvhich flow%s from wvest to east throughi the Northem part of the
city and turns south to flow along the Eastern side of the citv. and the Xiaoxiang River which flows
along the south side of the city. The water in these rivers is relatively clean as they approach Oujing
hut bccomes heavily poliuted as thev pass the city. At the Xiangshuiba Reseroir. (Figure 1.4. Table
4.2.3) 25 knm below Qujine water qualitv has improved considerably.
1The Nanpanjianc Rivcr itwelf is heavily polluted by large industries located close to the Huashan
reservoir north of Qqiinc. Tberefore. sewage from Qujing city does not liave a severe further
detrimental effect on the quality of the Nanpanjiang River itself.
Evistin, Sewerage Situatioun
rhc seweragc system of Qujing discharges untreated sewage into culverted and open watercourses,
most of which pass through the town from wvest to east and slow into the Baishi River. Sewage is also
discharged directly into this river and also into the Xiaoxiang River. These two rivers converge
immediately downstream of Qujing and, approximately 5 lm further downstream. flow into the
Nanpanjiang River. Thne current and future sewage flows are given in Table 3.5.2. below.

Combined sewers and open ditches predominate, particularly in the older pats of the city. Some
separate sewers have been constructed beneath a small proportion of the recently constructed roads in
the newly developed areas, the remainder being provided only with combined sewers.
The standard of construction of the existing sewers is poor. They are constructed fromn plain ended
concrete sewer pipes with mortar joints. Manholes are constructed from poor quality brickworki with
a thin mortar rendering on the internal surface. Leakage from the sewerage s!stem is likely to occur
at joints between pipes and also from manholes.
Proposed Sewrage S,ystemJ
Interventions are required in Qujing to prevent unmtreated sewage entering the rivers and to provide
effective sewage treatment including:
1. The existing open watercourses through the citv will be culverted. This work is intended to be
completed prior to commencement of the sewerage worls under the YEP:
2. An interceptor sewer will be constructed alongside the Baishi River into which the effluent from
domestic and industrial sources in the existing combined sewers and culverted watercourses will
be connected. Overflows will be provided to discharge excess storm water from the interceptor
sewers into the river.
The interceptor sewer will cross under the Baishi River to the STW site which is adjacent to the
junction between the Baishi and Xiaoxiang Rivers.
3. New separate sewers will be constructed in the northern part of the city. These will also discharge
into the main interceptor sewver.
The present plans do not include any sewerage for the western development zone. However, it is
likely that significant development willoccur in this area before 2010. The DRA Consultants have
proposed that the development in the western zone during this period should be assumed to be half as
much as predicted by the Municipal Master Plan. the remainder of the predicted development beine
assumed to occur instead in the existing eastern part of the citv and its northern development area.
Conrfirmation of this assumption has been sought from Qujing Municipality. If confirmed, separate
sewerage for the eastem part of the western development zone 'uill also be included in the YEP.
Sewage Treatment
The STW  has been designed for an initial capacitv of 100.000 m3/d with provision for future
extension to 150.000 m /d. It has been designed to allow full treatment in the future when the qualitv
of the Nanpanjiang River is improved.
Initially. onlv preliminary trcatrncnt and enhanced primarF settlement will be provided. Prcliminarv
treatment will includc grit removal and fine screening and chemical flocculation is proposed to
improve the performance of the primary settlement tanks.
Sludge will be thickened and dewatered using belt presses. Sludge cake will be disposed to the
landfill site to be developed under YEP.
In the future, the chemical dosing will not be required and an activated sludge process will be added
to provide secondary biological treatment.
Benefds
The main benefits of the initial stage of the project will be the prevention of sewage discharges to the
rivers flowing through and around Qujing, thus improving their quality and consequently improving
the quality of the water flowing from Qujing into the Nanpanjiang Rivcr.
Due to the planned development of Qujing. the total quantity of sewvage generated will increase
substantially. Therefore. the pollution load reaching the Nanpanjiang River will not be substantiallv
reduced until the second stage of biological treatment is added.

Qujing IVater Sources
Rivers
Qujing is located in ile headvaters of the Nanpanjiana River. The threc rivers in the area have a total
catchment area of 3.690 km but. due to the -ver seasonal pattern of rainfall. river flow-s often decline
to verv low Icvels. Storage in impounding reseroirs is essential for water supplv purposes.
Three impountding reservoirs are used. the Xiaoxianz. Xihe and Niuguohe. These were constructed
primarily to supply irrigation water and are also used for flood control purposes. Therefore, only a
small proportion of their ful I storage capacity can be relied upon for public water supply purposes.
Two further reservoirs exist in the area, the Huashan and the Du Mu. These also have the primarv
purpose of providing irrication water but also have secondarv roles of hydroelctric energy generation
as well as flood control. The Huashan reservoir supplies water to a chemical ferti!iser factorv and a
chemical factorv but neither of them are currently used for public water supply purposes.

Natural recharge of aquifers in the area of urban Quijing is equivalent to an average of 3,829 m3/d
according to the Survey Report on Regional Hydrogeology. Groundwater is abstracted from a
number of wells and boreholes which ar  mostly owned by industries and commercial firms.
Until the introducti'on of a licensing/charging scheme in 1990. the aquifers were being over-exploited
and the water table fell rapidly; 27 pumped wells are reported to be operating in the urban area.

3-5.4 Solid Waste Management
Intrduction
Overall responsibility for the collection and disposal of domestic. market and commercial solid waste
and street sweepings in the 47 km2 of the Qujing City area rests with the Qujing City Appearance
Committee (QCAC) and is carried out under the Municipal Environmental Sanitation Section
(MESS).
The collection and transfer of about half of the solid waste from r: - three districts of the city (Eastern.
Westem and Zhanvi) to the three existing dump sites (of which two are in use) is currently undertaken
by the staff of t%%o environmental sanitation divisions. There are currentiv no transfer stations, this
half of the refuse beinz collected from one thousand 250 litre streetside bins and transported direct to
two existing dump sites by 5 tonne trucks. The other half is understood to be taken direct to the
existing dump sites by the enterprises which generate it.
Disposal at the existing dump sites has given rise to serious pollution problems and contamination of
the ground. A further 12.6 tonnes/day of nightsoil is also transported and disposed of. A compostine
plant was completed in 1992 but does not operate as it is envisaged that it will cause environmental
problems in an adjacent residential area. Infornal recycling already tales place and collestors and
purchasers have set up their owvn operational centres throughout the city.
Disposal of industrial solid waste is the responsibility of the generating enterprise under supervision
bv the OEPB. However. specific information on the quantities and nature or industrial solid waste.
including toxic and hazardous wastes and hospital wastes. is not available.
Project Report Annex D2 will provide further details of the proposals for solid * aste management for
Qujing.
Project Objectives and Definition
The key objectives of solid waste management investments are:

Future forecasts of ovetall solid waste generation have been considered for a ten-year horizon. They
also take account of provision of a solid waste management service in areas which are currently not
served and the effects of the programme of conversion from coal to gas fuel for cooking.
The existing composition of the waste is affected by a number of factors. mans of which are in the
process of change. Domestic waste amounts will be significantly influenced by the change from coal
fuel to gas fuel for cooking. although surveys show that ash remains a significant proportion of the
refuse as only a few residents use gas at present. The conversion to gas fuel will begin in I 99. with
utilisation rising to 40% b the year 2000 and 73% by the year 2010. Waste generation, composition
and density vill then vary signiricantly.
Table 3.5.7. which is based on 1991-92 data given in the feasibility stud% report. provides the
assumed composition ofQujing's domestic solid waste up to 2010.

Soumre: SMEDI Preliminary Design Report
Future forecasts of overall solid waste generation have been considered to a horizon of 2010 and are
presented in Table 3.5.8. The slowly increasing predicted daily rate of generation of refuse over the
design period to 2010 takes account of the changes in the economy of the city. Specifically, as the
andard of living increases. refuse quantities can be expected to increase by about one to two per cent
year. However. the programnme of conversion from coal to gas fuel for cooking will result in a
Lradual reduction of refuse production of the same order. As a result of the changes. there can be
expected to be a significant reduction in refuse density. In the future. the collection of nightsoil will
gradually be pihased out as water closets are introduced.

Fawe Waste Coelct;g, Twsuport and Thrafer
Waste collection from high-rise flats and narrow streets will use tricycles and carts discharging to
small urban transfer stations in the two urban centres. Commercial and household waste will be
collected from collection bins and casual storage heaps using eight to ten tonne capacity self-loading
vehicles. The bins will be located in local refuse collection buildings to reduce the visual impact of
streetside storage.
Six small transfer stations have been initially proposed. one to serve Zhanyi and five to serve Qujing
city. Three different systems of collection will operate. Based on an analysis of the housing types in
Qujing. it has been estimated that the percentages of refuse collected by each of the three is as
folloWVs:
I Sixtv per cent of refuse will be brought to the transfer stations directly by others using small
vehicles (tricycles carts. etc.) travelling a maximum of about I kim:
. Thirt five per cent will be collected from street bins or refuse collection buildings by self-loading
vehicles and be carried direct to the landfill site: and
3. Five per cent will be collected by the "bellr system.
The six transfer stations are designed to handle 30 tonnesld in the short-term and 55 tonnecsd in the
long-term and they will each serve an area of 2 - 3km2. Sealed refuse containers at the transfer
stations. if built. will be of eight tonims capacity
The stations will be served by the follo&ving equipmnent for collection and haulagce provided under the
project:
a) tricycles:
b) mini-trucks;
c) Fore and Aft Trucks;
d) container carrying trucks
e) plastic containers for high rise apartments. refuse bins, containers for STSs.
Modifications will be made to refuse chutes of buildings and concrete compounds built for I m refuse
bins.
Fazawe Landfill Site
A new landfill site (see Figures 3.5.1 and 3.5.2). to be developed progressively in two stages, will be
established in Dagou behind Taihc Hill in Xiaopo Village at an elevation of up to 1.990m above sea
level and occupy a total area of 195mu (I 16mu in the first stage). The site already has a good
covering or clay and site investigations indicate that further lining will not be required to prevent
groundwater pollution from leachate. Table 3.59 provides the predicted quality of the leachate from
the landfill.
A 1 7m high. 120m long main dam will be constructed initially to retain the solid waste. with a second
5m high dam planned for the second phase. Below the site there will be a 6.5m high. 60m long dam
to iniercept leachate providing a storage capacity of 7.500m3. The first stage of the landfill will have
a senice life of 9 - 10 years and the second section 7 - 8 years, depending on the precise scheme
option selected. The overall life of the landfill is therefore some 15 - 17 yeas.
The effective capacities of the two sections are identified in the prelimitary design as 0.63 million m3
and 1.14 million m3 respectively. for a total capacitn of 1.77 million ml. The landfill will require an
estimated 0.13 million m3 of soil covering placed in a 0.2m layer over the compacted refuse layer of
2.5 to 3m. A new 2.5km long. 8.Om overall wvidth access road will be constucted to the site. The
landfill w*ill be returned to agriculture as the capping and top soiling proceeds.

Scrtion 3
Water from Pumping Station No I discharges into a stone-lined channel which is partly open and
partlv covered by concrete slabs and in some places passes beneath roads and buildings. The channel
lakes the flow along a dead-end valley to Pumping Station No 2 from which it is lifted to the Zhadian
River. This pumping station vas constructed around the same time as Pumping Station No I and is in
a similar condition.
3.6.2 Proposed Sewage Project
Sewers u ill be constructed alont botih sides or LaLe Gejiu to intercept sewage flows before thev enter
the lake (see Ficure 3.6.1). It is proposed that the interceptor sewers will bc constructed within the
IIkC and a strip of land approximatelv 2.0 m wide will be re-claimed in order to provide access to the
new set% crs.
A nc" pumping station will bc constructed between the existing Pumpin- Station No I and the lake.
lI'iis %%ill contain ttso w%et ' ells. one reeiving sewage from the interceptor sewcrs and the other
receiving storm i%ater from the lake. One pumping main is proposed for sewage and two for storm
water. The sewvage pumping main will discharge into a new gravity sewer which will carrv it to the
sevate treatment works. The storm vater may discharge into the existing channel. which would be
renovated. but it is unlikely that the existing channel's capacity will be able to be increased
sufficicntlv and a ne,s route may also be required for a gravity sewer to carry some or all orthe storm
%ater.
A 1.3 km long tunnel %% ill be constructed to replace Pumping Station No 2. This will be a 2.0 m wide
concrete lined archi uhich will carrv stornn water and also contain a separate foul sewage gravity
pipcliie. The foul sewer '-.ilI pass through the tunnel to Gejiu STU' wz hich n ill be constructed close
to the do% nstream end of the tunnel. The proposed sewage treatment capacit% for the first stage of
dcvelopment is 25.000 m.-'d which will be sufficient to treat the design flows and loads predicted until
about 2008.
T11c STW site which has been chosen is on a hillside alongside the main dual carria_eewav road north
of Gcjiti. The current land use is agricultural. with maize being growvn in the summer and wheat in
tlic %intcr. Thew site is at a hiieher elevation titan the road but existing trees provide some visual
%creening of the site from thc road.
'I'le STW %%ill provide preliminary treatment. includine tine screening and grit removal. and
chemicallv-enhanced primarv settlement. Thc degree of treatnment provided xwill be sufficient to
;llou tie treated cftluent to be re-used for irrigation purposes. Provision will bc madc for biological
secondarv treatmcnt to be added in the fuittirc and also for a future increase in llou to 35.000 m3/d.
3.6.3 Futurn developments
As the niajor roads of Geiiu arc progressively reconstructed it is intended that separate sewers will bc
constructed. Everitually, the existing combined sewerage system in Gejiu will be replaced by a
separatc system. When this has been completed. the interceptor sewers around the lake will collect
only thei sewage from thc separate foul sewers and storm water will be allowed to discharge direct to
the lake. Hov^-ever. this is only a declared long-term objective and no definitc prorammc has been
proposed for this work.
3.6.4 Water Balance of Lake Gejiu
Whilst additional pumping capacitv is required to prevent flooding of Gejiu during the rainy season.
interception of the combined sewage flows  which drain to the lake throughout the year may cause the
water level in the lake to fall to an unacceptably low level towards the end of the dry season. This
situation will be improved as the surfacc w%ater and foul sewage floxs are progressively separated. but
accoint needs to be taken of the diversion of combined sewvage flows away from the lak-e in the short
term.

A'Vea DescRi
A study has been commissioned into the effect which the proposed interceptor sewers will have on
the present water balance of Lake Gejiu. A report is expected at the end of February 1996. Prior to
receipt of this report, it has not been possible to verify that diversion of combined sewage away from
Lake Gejiu wvill necessarily cause an adverse environmental impact.
Among the proposals arc channels to permit the re-use of STV effluent for irrigation purposes.
Effluent re-use in areas which are currently served by the Baiyun water supply and irrigation system
would correspondingly reduce irrigation water demands from that svstem. thus increasing the amount
of water which would be delivered to the Gejiu WTW. Water which is surplus to the requirements of
the WTW is by-passed to Lak;e Gejiu and would therefore help to maintain the wvater balance of the
lake. However. it is not yet known whether all the effluent from the STSV would be used in areas
which are currently irrigated by the Baiyun water supply system.
3.7 Environmental Monitoring and Data Management
A key component or YEP is the development of improved environmental monitoring and data
management (EMDM) capabilities. The EMDM Component of the YEP has been prepared by
Canrede Inc.. funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The purpose of
the EMDM Component was to evaluate the existing monitoring facilities within Yunnan Province and
to develop a strategic plan and investment program for enhanced monitorine operations and data
management. The work included:
I .   evaluation of existing facilities and the development of a plan to upgrade monitoring programs
and protocols, and laboratorv and computer facilities at selected monitoring institutions
associated with the YEP.
2.   assessment of the need for an improved environmental monitoring and d3ta management
system. and the institutional capacity to operate and manage it.
3.   dcevlopment of an integrated state-of-the-art environmental qualitv monitoring and infornation
management system on a pilot scale for the candidatc cities in the YEP. that could be
applicable to the rest of Yunnan Province.
4.   development of a plan for institutional strengthening and human resources development to
enable the effectivc evaluation and management of environmental conditions and water
resources in Yunnan Province.
5.   consideration of social and environmental issues related to the implementation of the
recommendations associated withi the EMDM Component.
Tro ensure that environmental monitoring is carried out effectively and efficienti. three components
need to be concurrently developed in a balanced manner, these are:
* collection of accurate and representative samples from key locations.
e laboratory analyses of these samples with due attention to quality control,
v management ofthe monitoring data to ensure its maxirum utility and distribution to all concerned
parties at regular intervals.
Provincial, Prefectural and Municipal monitoring stations in Yunnan will be provided with laboratory
and analytical equipment. and in some cases field transport to enable them to meet the increased
needs for monitoring tie YEP.
To maximise the utilitv of the increased data flow from the laboratories. a computer database and data
managrement system will be installed and appropriate training provided for the computer managers
under the World Bank project.

Secla  3
In addition., the facility for spot checking water and effluent quality in the field will be provided for
compliance monitoring purposes and to allow detailed surveys of water qualitv changes over short
(hourly) intervals of time.
Fuil details of the EMDM can be found in the Canrede document Needs Assessmient aird Upgrding
Plan.
3.8   Institutional Development and Training
Three sources of funds will be available in the project budget for Technical Assistance to facilitate
institutional strengthenine of the organisations involved in the implementation. operation and
regulation of the YEP. These are:
I. Construction Management Services (CMS)
2. Institutional Development and Training (IDT)
3. Environmental Management (EM)
These funds will be spent on inputs to four Technical Assistance packages consisting of:
I. Packagc A - Pr6jcct N1anagement and Construction Management Services:
2. Package B - Institutional Development and Environmental Management
3. Package C - Other Components
4. Package D - Training
Package A - An amount equivalent to 2.5 % of the construction costs is provided for the employment
of professional impartial supervision durirg the constuction of new facilities. This will include
inputs from foreien resident engineers who will assist in construction supervision of the major works
such as the new water and sewage treatment works. These engineers will also be expected to transfer
skills to C hinesc construction mananement staff so that they. in the future. can supervise construction
. o tk.
It is proposed that a small percentage of the CMS funds pays for the running costs of the project
office %%ho are responsible for the overall pronress of the project and the management of overseas
training:.
Package B - This is to be funded from the budget for EM and IDT. less a percentage for overseas
training and study tours.
The IDT funds are to assist the Implementing Agencies improve their financial performance thus
helping them to have surplus revenues to pay the charges for on-lent loans. IDT funds will be used to
strengthen the financial management of the lAs. provide technical assistance to set and monitor
business related performance targets. Thesc funds will also provide technical support for specific
activities such as preparing asset registers. reducing water losses, developing secvcr flushing and
cleaning routines. managing solid waste landfill sites and developing appropriate solid waste
collection and transfer vehicles.
The Environmental Management component of Package B is specificaliv to improve the ability of the
EPBs to analvse. record and report the results of samples taklen to monitor environmental trends. The
funds are intended to be spcnt on project components recommended in the CIDA project for revising
the environmental monitoring methods in KEPB.
Peckage C - is for inputs yet to be identified.

nakfd acnb
Package D - is for the funding of overseas training and study tours. Money for the component will be
taken from the IDT funds and the training programmes will be managed directly by the Project
Office. It is proposed that trining for operators of new works (for exampick WTWs and STWs) that
are financed by World Bank funds will be included as part of the hardware contract.

4.1    DIANCHI BASIN
4.1.1 Climate
The Lake Dianchi Basin belongs to the north sub-tropical zone monsoon climatic zone. Annual
average temperatures are 14.7C. Hotvever the predominantly plateau area has an annual temperature
variation of betwveen 11.7°C to 13.3C. Average annual rainfall (Figure 4.1.1) varies from 1,007 to
797 mm. in average wet and dry years respectively, there is a predominantly dry period between
November and April. Rainfall is characteristically of low intensity and of short duration, its abilitv to
cause severe soil erosion is thus limited to e.cceptional storms. Evaporation from land surfaces in the

basin is high ranging from 2.120 to 1.870 mm in average and dry years respectivelv. The main wind
direction is south wesx with an average speed of 2.2 to 3 0 mIs. This is sufficiently strong and
persistent to leep Dianchi lak-e water wel! mixed throughout the year. Frost free days avcrage 227 per
annum.
Variations in weather conditions are one of the most serious hazards in the area and spring droughts
can have important implications for agriculture records since AD1332 show that 50 such droughts
have occurred. Severe floods are an occasional hazard in the wet season with 90 major floods
recorded in the period since 1254. Cold spells can occur at almost any time of the year which can
particularly affect the rice crop although modern farrning techniques have helped to ameliorate this
situation.
4.1.2 Landforms
Topogra,phy
Within the Dianchi Basin there are some 21 sub watersheds. The landforms consist of the down
faulted lakle basin at about 1.800 m surrounded by mountain ridges rising to 2.826m at the highest
point in Sanjian mountain. The valleys draining into the lake cmerge from narrow valleys in the
surrounding hills and mountains and open out onto the extensive lakleshore plain. The lake is the
largest plateau lakle in Yunnan Province and the sixth largest fresh water lake in China. It covers an
area of 306 km and is divided by a man-made barrage into a small inner lake. the Caohai (8km2) and
the much larger outer lake, the Waihai. Its average depth is 4.4 m with the deepest point 1OA m. The
Waihai has a single southwestern exit through Haikou flood control structure imo the Tanglangchuan

River. In the near future with the completion of the XiYuan Tunnel. a second exit to the Sahe River
will be opened from the Caohai.
Gealopj'
The predominant geological strata in the basin are ancient basement rocks and more recent
bcdimcntarv strata mainly shales. sandstones, limestone and basalts. In conjunction with tectonic
uplift and mountain building these have produced a high altitude hilly terrain resistant to significant
ueathering. The strata have produced a variety of soil types depending on elevation and the period of
development.                                                             I
The basin is volcanicallv active producing hot springs. and earth tremnors are frequent.
Tu'o consequences of the geological history of the area and its lithology are of particular importance:
1. fc%% sites suitable for dam construction have been produced; either the impounded area is small
u ith little volume. or the presence of fissured limestone causes permeability problems.
2. a 'uide variety of mineral and ores have been produced, many of which are now commercially
exploited: thcsr include tin, iron and aluminium ore, plus coal and phosphate bearing shales; of
thcse phosphate ores are the most significant economically and ecologically.
soils
There are five principal soil types:
I. .tlountin red soils: mainlv developed from the basaIts. This is a deep red soil distributed
principally in the Azhivun to Maidichong area of the Songhuaba Reservoir.
2. Foresw reeJ .'uil: developed on both basalts and clastic rocks below elevations of 2.200m. It has
been subject to erosion and is often of shallow depth:
.. Firesi browni and recdsoil: distributed between 2.200 and 2.400m:
4. RedJ limestunite soil: developed over the extensive areas of limestone rocks and most extensive in
slic Baoxianghe valley:
5. Rice soils: developed in the lovv lying alluvial areas especially on the lakeside plain to the north.

4.1.3 Lad Use and Resourcs
Lundiuc
'lie distribution of the land use types and vegetation classes in the Dianchi Basin and landuse chanees
between 1986 and 1994 are showrn in Figure 4.1.2.
llte data on current land use and vegetation cover indicates that on the whole the Dianchi Basin has
relativelv well protected watersheds with a high percentage of natural vegetation cover. However.
environmental degradation in the basin has occurred as a result of significant past changes in
vegetation cover which are only now being rectified. The on-going rapid expansion of rural
aericultural activities responding to the change from state controlled production quotas of food crops
to free market production of cash crops which has led to radical changes in the approach to farming
techniques especially in terms of intensification of cropping and increased applications of artificial
and natural fertilisers.

Agricalture
At present approximately 22 per cent or the basin is occupied by cropped land. Within this area
significant changes in cropping pattems have included a growth in the areas under both vegetables
and cut flowers produced ror both local and export markets. The present land use is given in Table

Five significant trends in agriculture are evident in the Dianchi Basin, these are:-
total cultivation area is decreasing. partially due to the encroachment of urban areas into paddy
lands'. the total area is now 850.000 mu. It is estimated that by the sear 2020 about 12,000 ha or
land around Kunming will be urbanised in this way;
i double cropping is increasing. from 150% to 175%;
e cconomic (cash crops) are increasing mainly at the expense of rice; principal crops are vcgables.
cut flowers and tobacco: cash crops are now grown on 40.000 mu especially around Chenggong
and Guandu Counties on the eastern shore ofthe Waihai;
, the increasinghl licavv use of synthetic and organic fertilisers in cash crop areas is a potential
tihreat to thc Waihai. especially from phosphorus and nitrogen inputs:
* numbers of large livestock (pigs and cattle) have also increased giving rise to largest manure loads
to both land and %'atcr.
Fervs:y aInd J'egaemaion
The Dianchi Basii tforests consists predominantly of sub tropical evergreen broad leaved species but
also includc arn:i of deciduous broad leaved forest. temperate pine foresL shrub grassland with
scattered trees. bamboo forest and grassland. Eucalyptus globulus forest has been introduced from
Australia as a plantation species and occurs throughout the basin.
In the past. degradation of the forestry sector has occurred during three main periods:
I. during the -Great Leap Forward" from 1958 to 1960 when timber was used to fuel the rural iron
foundries:
2. during the Cultural Revolution from 1967 to 1975 when the government lost management control
over the forests. and.
3. between 1984 and 1986 when collective lands were allocated to households and, owing to land
tenure conflicts and boundary markling confusion, large areas of natural forest were illegally felled.
In addition:
4. the rapid growth in population has led to increased demands for fuelwood and construction timber,

S. similarly, the expansion of the tobacco industry has increased fuelwood consumption for drying
and curing the leaves;
6. there has also been serious pest damage to the local Pinus yunanensis forests by Blastophags
piniperdaL.
However despite the combined impacts of these events the area of forest cover of all classes wras
altmost dresane in 1993 as it itas in 1975 al 37Z°.
A1ineral Resources
The Dianchi Basin contains a considerabkc imalth of mineral reserves not all of which are currently
exploited. These resources are distributed in Guandu District and Chenggong and Jinning Counties.
The principal metal and non-metallic minerals ame listed in Table 4.1-2.

Phosphorus, coal and limestone are of particular concern because of their adverse environmental
impacts. either at the point of extaction or during utilisation of the manufactured product, are.
Phosphorus ore extraction and the production of synthetic fertilisersm especially in Jinning County. is
the most significant in the basin and developments are anticipated which will double production
within the next five years. Most of the ores are extracted bv open cast mining techniques which. in
the case of the smialer undertakings are often poorly controlled and potentially cawse significant
pollution from erosion and runoff. The larver State Owned Enterprises (SOEs. now mainly owned by
the Province or Municipality) such as Kunyang Phosphate Fertiliscr Plant (Figure 1.2) operate open
lo.nwall mining techniques which arc both more economic and much easier to restore when the load
becomes exhausted.
Coal mining in thc Songhuaba catchment has some implications for water quality in the reservoir but
these are not documented. More significant is the impact of burning soFt, brown and sulphurous coal
as industrial and domestic fuel in Kunming and other cities, and its major contribution to air
pollution.
Limnestone deposits are extensive in the northern part of the basin and there are many small quarries
producing aggregates and lime dust for cement and other construction purposes.
4.1.4 Aquatic Resources
Between the late 1950s and 1985. the fish species diversitv of Dianchi declined from 53 species
(including 3) introduced species) to 27 due to a combination of adverse enAironmental impacts. Most
significantly, the construction of the protective dyke system designed to ameliorate flooding of
lakeside farmland. and the associated land reclamation together destroyed most of the shallow water
bays in the lak;e where fish would normally breed and have nursery grounds. Major land reclamation

Sectioa 4
has reduced the Caohai from 20 to 8 km2. Similarly. the regulation of river inflows to the lake has
also had a negative impact on those fish species which synchronise their breeding with increased river
inflows. In addition. intensified competition from the introduced species. excessive fishing pressure
and water qualitv deterioration have further impacted the fish populations.
Of the 27 surviving species. only the 8 listed arc now of commercial importance.

In addition to fin fish, shrimps and molluscs are also harvested and the capture fishery is
complemented by a productive and growing pond culturc fisherv (Table 4.1.3.).
Despite the substantial loss of species the annual yield from the fin-fishery has declined less
dramatically according to official statistics (Table 4.1.3.). Mollusc catches hare declined the most
whilc shrimps have increased in recent years. Mollusc catches declined more through lack of demand
than demise of the species which may well be a good thing since shellfish efficiently concentrate
toxic heavv metals which are present in the sediments. especially within the Caohai. To conserve fish
stocks. fry of the 5 most common species are released to the lake annually b the Municipal Fisheries
DLepartment: in addition. control of net mesh size, the numbers of fishermen. the use of powered
rishing boats, and seasonal fishing restrictions are imposed at intervals.

In the past. Lakle Dianchi produced more than 50% of the annual Provincial capure fishery yield, but
this has dwindled over the last 4-5 jers to less than 39%; demand for fish is ecpected to rise as
population rises in the catchmenL Nevertheless. the lake remains the largest single fish producer in

Yunnan and as such represents an economic asset to be safeguarded for both water resource purposes
and fish yield.
The decline in lake fish production has been more than compcnsated for by the eight-fold increase in
farmed fish production during the past 10 years especially in Guandu and Xishan suburban districts
and fmm Chenggong. Jinning and Songming counties. The potential for further increase in fanned
fish production is not known but appears to be considerable, but perhaps only at the expense of rice
production.
The economic and social impacts of changes in the lake fisherv have brought about a reduction in
cmployment from 9.630 (1992) to 7.380 (1994). This might have had serious social consequences but
it is understood that the majority of fishernen are also farmers. who. having access to farmiand, fish
on the lake for only part of the year. usually for no more than 3 months. According to KMFAMD only
350 of the 1992 fishing labour force were full-time fishermen and most of them still continue to
operate. The status of the Dianchi fishery in 1994 is shown in Table 4.1.4.

The capture fishery is presently in an unstable condition and further deterioration in water quality or
reclamation or shallow water breeding sites for agricultural user will only put further stress upon this
once thriving industr to the detriment of both fishermen, consumers and the economv.
Aquaculture is concentrated in ponds around the lake: approximately 2ha of intensive culture cages
y ieldine 1.800 mt/iT are found in the lake. Over 3.000 farmers raise fish in 670 ha of ponds that are
filled with Dianchi water and are therefore susceptible to any further water qualitv deterioration. The
annual yicid has increase substantially since 1985. from 1.132 to 8.717 metric tonnes. The yield and
cash benefits to the farmers now exceeds that of the lake fisherv.
4.1.5 Population and Economics
Environmental pressure is increasing in Yunnan. As the population around Lale Dianchi has grown.
the economy has changed from primarily agricultural towards industrial. putting pressure on natural
resources and leading to environmental degradation.
The Dianchi Catchment is the most highly urbanised part of Yunnan Province. with a population
estimated at 2.3 million in 1993. excluding some of the floating population. Population density is
relatively higii in the catchment at 415 persons/lkm2. much higher than the Province and Kunming
Municipality. because of Kunming City (see Table 4.1.5).
The registered population of the City grew at 3% per annum (1988 -1992), the growth rate of
Kunming Municipalitv having been a fairly constant 1% for that period. The Urban Master Plan
suggests the population of the city will double to 2.68 million by 2010. but high density residential
developments could give rise to a larger population than predicted by that Plan. The three altnative
growth scenarios shown in Figure 4.1.3 suggest that the 2020 popultion could be between 2.7 and 4
million.

4.1.6 Water Resources and Hvdrology
Introduction
The Dianchi Basin is experiencing acute water resource shortges and accelerated water quality
deterioration. Kunming has been officially declared a 'water needy city" and the per capiw supply is
extremely low, the basin is one of the most water short areas in China.
T/a setere absolute itter supply shortages in the Dianchi basin are revealed in Table 4.1.6 u*ere
per capita runoff is shoswn to be only 35 of the *world mean, and 5% of thatfor Yunnan Prvince. The

basin is a critical warer stressed area: implymg thar good management of this vital resource is of the
highest prioritv. The volume of rwuoff in average and dry years rs 560 and 159 million m3
respectively

Renewable water resources of 31 1m3 per capita at the present (assumed population of 1.80 million)
will decline to 200 m (population base of 2.80 million) in 2020. For a current drought year (rainfall
below 500 mm) the per capita supply could fall to 90 m3 (242 litres per day): by 2020 renewable
resources would barelv supply domestic demand alone. Storing water from wet years and repeated
use (recycling) of Lake Dianchi water will have to continue as the means to balance supply and
demand unlcss water is imported into the basin.

Water demand exceeds supply by between 177 and 578 million m annually in average and dry years
respectively. The typical basin resource data for an average and dry years are given in Table 4.1.7.

The wiater resources supply-demand deficit is made up by recycling, mainly untreated city effluent via
Lake Dianchi. The deteriorating water quality in the Caohai (inner lake) and the Waihai (outer lake)
caused by effluent inflows is seriously jeopardising the water supply function of the lakle and
increasing the costs and difficulty of treating Dianchi water. Today WTW No 3. designed to draw
water from the westem side of the Waihai near the Caohai barge, is out of action due to the low
quality of the lake water. Costs of treatment at WIWW No 5. drawing water from north eastem Waihai.
are considerably higher than at the works treating good qualitv water from Songhuaba Reservoir.

Absolute water shortage is therefore increasingiy exacerbated by relative shortage due to poor quality
and an economic cost is already being paid for water quality deteriomtion in the lake.
The water supply situation is affected by the considerable inter. and intra annual variations in
precipitation and runoff. Supply is further affected by the need to balance water supply rtcuirements
against those of flood control. One of the critical water resources management issues in the Dianchi
Basin is that the majoritv of the storage capacity of Songhuaba Reservoir (%%hich has good quality
Class II water) is reserved for flood control purposes rather than for Municipal water supply storage.
This management decision then forces the use of poorer qualitn Lake Dianchi water (Class IV) for
municipal water supplies to Kunming.
Seasonal l'ariationr
The available water resources are not only scarce but also widely variable %ear by year. Figure 4.1.3
below shows the historical monthly mean inflows into Lake Dianchi. The graph illustrates that the
inflows fluctuate in a wide range (S to 60 m3/sec), 80 per cent of the total rainfall is concentrated in
four months. Mav to August. Lake Dianchi Catchment therefore relies heavily on reservoir storage to
smooth and regulate the basin water resources.

water distribution system. Further good sites for lare reservoirs are lacking due to geological and
topographical conditions. The one site proposed for a further development for Kunmiuig is also in the
Songhuaba catchment at Huangshiyen but this will be an expensive option on a unit cost basis
according tot Kumning Water Company officals.
* .Sorage of Water in the Diancki Basin
(a)    Songhuaba Reservoir
Water supply depends heavily on resersoir storage and Songhuaba (Table 4.1.9) is the prime source
of potable water for Kunming providing Class 11 water to domestic, industrial and agricultural users
afker suitable treatment. It provides about 10 million m3 irrigation water each year to 11.740 mu (780
ha) of land. The 1993 expansion increased the flood storage capacity of the reservoir from 35 to
131 million m3. The future aim is to substitute Songhuaba water with Dianchi water for irrigation and
industrial uses and conserve the better quality Songhuaba water for drinking water supplies.

The reservoir is understood to be capable of providing 128 million m3lyear with a 95 per cent
assurance rate. The ac:ual operating water level is at present 1.5 metre below the required operating
rule curve because compensa;,on paymen's to farmers who will lose their land have not yet been paid.
The Songhuaba catchment contains 325 villages and seven townships. There are 160 springs in the
catchment. among which 1 7 are of high water yield. It is estimated that an average runoff volume of
198 million min a %ear drains into the reservoir. Because of its signiricance as a water resource. the
Songhuaba catchment has been designated by the Yunnan Provincial Govemment as a Water
Protectiout Zone since August 1981. However. continued and unchecked urban. agricultural and
mining development in the area is believed to be leading to deterioration in the water quality, and thc
reservoir is now classified as mesotrophic with serious adverse w%ater treatment cost implications if
this trend continues. The YEP has targeted this catchment for special attention under the Rural
Sanitation sub-project to remedy the deterioration in water quality.
(b)    Lake Dianchi
The lake prcsently provides 480,000 m3/day, just over 60% of Kunmings water supply. No.3 NV .
in operation since 1980 (originally designed to treat groundwater, but now closed because of low lake
water quality). has its intak-e on the west side of the Waihai near its boundarv with the Caohai and
supplied the western suburbs. WTW No.5. commissioned in 1990 draws water from the north-east
side of the Waihai.
Net overland flows into the Lak-e Dianchi are estimated at 561 million m3lyr while direct rainfall
onto the lake is 273 million m3Jyr. giving a total inflow of 834 million m3lyr. Effective storage in
Lakie Dianchi is calculated at 570 m  m3yr.
Untreated effluent inflows to the Waihai are very large and the total storage replacement rate for the
lake is verv lowv (1.5 to 3 years; 0.7 years for effective storage). The accumulation of toxins, oxygen
demandine materials and nutrients in the sediments poses an increasingly serious threat to the

continued security of the Waihai as a source of potable water. The Kunming Environmental
Protection Bureau (KEPB) issued a notice in 1992 stating the lake war quality at WTW intakes in
the Waihai exceeded Class III of the water standard, the minimum for potable water supply. The
quality situation has. unfortunately, further declined since then.
* Rivers. Flom, Regzdaiion and WVter Qaflftv
The rivers and channels which pass through Kunming are grossly polluted and totally unsuitable to
supply water for any use; they are effectively open sewers receiving over 200 million m3/year of
untreated domestic and industrial effluents and considerable quantities of solid waste from the
industrial and municipal sectors. Elsewhere in the catchment. the rivers are generally in better
condition but all are highly regulated to conserve water for irrigation and local use.
Control structures on the rivers are opened and closed to distribute water as demand requires. Control
is so intense that the rivers only have tvater surplis to requirements for an average of 50 days per year
during and soon after the rainy season when demand from irrigation is reduced and all storage
reservoirs have been recharged. Flowus in rivers which enter the lakee are normally recorded only in
September to November but storms in July and August ca i produce high flowbs into the lake for short
periods.
Flow control and its consequences for lakeshore catchments are described in the following
paragraphs. Within the Songhuaba catchment river flow control is far less developed though
diversions are present in the major rice irrigation areas.
It is clear from Figure 4.1.6 that rainfall intensity and river runoff are vert poorly correlated. This is
believed to be caused by the vety cxtensive water control practices in the basin. The objective of
water control is to retain as much of the rainfall in the upper catchment as possible for water supply
and irriuation. Water that reaches the lake is 'lost' and the pumping costs of returning it to the upper
catchment are high. River control managenent aims to avoid these costs.
The first peak in rainfall seems to be 'consumed' by recharging groundwater reseres, by paddy rice
irrigation water demands (for this is the rice growing period) or in refilling the thousand or more
small storage reservoirs in the catchment which would normally be drawn down afTer the preceding
dry season. At this time. the many control gates on the rivers are closed and the river channels
effectively become linear reservoirs. Return water from the irrigation schemes is released into the
rivers but much is then pumped back to the head of the system to be reused.
During the period the gates are closed. the river water between the gates 'aries considerably in
quality: it has been observed that some sections remain clean and are used for recreational purposes:
others become grossly polluted and entirely anaerobic because of organic pollution. for example from
slaughter houses; other become duck farms.
At this time also it is possible to observe the rivers flowing apparently uphill back into the catchment
as upstream water is either removed by pumping and replaced by in flowing lake water or the lakle
level rises due to heavy rainfall in another part of the catchment. This phenomenon is in part a result
of the artificial raising of the lakle by the control gate at Haikou plus the construction of the dykes
which causes the lake to backl up the channelled river courses. Gates on the rivers are opened to catch
this back up water, or closed to prevent flooding.
The consequences of storage of water in the river channels are important since. with the gates closed,
the channels effectively become natural oxidation ditches in which biological and physical treatment
of the polluted water tak-es place. More monitoring of conditions during this period is required to
ass-ss whether, in the long term. this is beneficial or not.
Some'-  :r is pumped directly from Lale Dianchi alongthe Panbong River valle for irrigation use to

In all but the wettest years, the fist rains do not generally produce a runoff excess which can be
released to the lake. The second rains complete the recharging of groundwater and reservoirs, but
since the rice growing period is over and irrigation water is no longer needed. these rains more often
produce a surplus which flows into the lake.

Latc in the year, after the rice has becn harvested the winter crop of beans. wheat and rape is planted;
but these crops relv on rainfall and not irrigation. With the coming of the second peak in rainfall this
lack of irrigation demand is mainly responsible for the production of a surplus of water such that
some can be allowed to flow into the lake;. River flow-s to the lake are therefore most frequently
recorded in October and November. Such flows are usually related TO storn events and consequently
water flows and quality data obtained at these times (i.e. as during the 1988-89 survey) cannot be
used to estrapolate to other times of the year. Since the volume of water discharged to the lake at
these times is unknown so also is the nutrient and sediment load to the lake.
A further complicating factor hindering the understanding of the impacts of river borne pollution
loads on the lakle is the fact that much river water quality samplingz has been carried out well inland
from the lake edge. water monitored at these sites often then has to pas throtch irrinated areas where
its chemistry may well be greatly altered. The fewv data available suggest the water quality actually
improves. in terms of its phosphorus content, during this passage. Thus addinz further support to the
conclusion that loads on the lake should not be calculated from data obtained at these inland sampling
stations.
Once the dry season sets in and rainfall is scarce the rivers soon cease to flou., the gates are once
again closed. Bv such regulation and recycling of water in the catchment it is probable that water
flows into the lake on no more than 50 davs each year on aveage. Hard data to quantifv this
observation. however. are few but urgently needed if the complex hydrolon- of the lakeshore
catchments in Dianchi Basin is to be fully understood and the corect management of its vital
resources assured.
* Grounater Resources

Baiduic CGUdi*ns
groundwater reserves is 147,000 m3lday (53.7 million m31yr), much of this is abstracted from wells
and boreholes directly by industries for their own manufaturing and domestic uses. The potential for
increasing groundwater supplies is therefore limited.
There are two springs, the Haiyuansi and Bailonpan. in the City's water supply network and together
tnev supply an average of 15.000 m3/day (5.5 million mtlvr). The Bailongtan source mainly supplies
water to the Kunming Brewery. The source water quality meets the national drinking water standard.
The Kuuning area is rich in thermal water resources. The thermal groundwater layer in the Kunming
area of the basin is at a depth of between 80D m to 2.000 m. The water temnperature is between 43°C
to 52tC. The current exploitation reserve of thermal water in the planning area is 6.771 m3Iday.
IValer Resources Supply and DemndAnalysis
a Flood Cojtrol and Conflict writh later Supplj Storage
Both Songhuaba Reservoir and Lak-e Dianchi provide significant flood storage. The capacity of the
flood storage in Songhuaba Reservoir after recent expansion has increased from 35 million m to 131
million m3, enough to accommodate a I in 100 year flood. The increased flood storage has improved
the capacity of the Panlong River in Kunming suburbs to 120 m3ilsec. and to 150 m31sec in the urban
ara between the reservoir and Lake Dianchi.
Downstream from Kunming. flooding is first atenuated by Lake Dianchi and then discharges to
Tanglangch- mt River via the lake's only outlet at Haik-ou. Due to the restricted channel capacity in
thc Tanglangchuan River. the maximum flood release at Haikou is 51 m31sec. To improve the flood
reclease rate in Lake Dianchi the flood capacity ofthe Tanglangchuan is being increased and a second
outlet. the Xiyuan Tunnel. constructed at the south-west corner of Caohai; this is not yet
commissioned. The XiNuan Tunnel will be able to discharge up to a maximum of 40 m3/sec of Cachai
.water through the W'est Mountain into the Shahe River. which dmins into Tanglangchuan River ncar
Anning. The flow will also be controlled between the Caohai and Waihai at a recently constructed
barrage via a lock gate. At present. Lak-e Dianchi is operated at a level of 1886.8 metres above mean
sea level (masi) instead of 1887.1 masl during the flood season to prevent flooding in the lowland
areas around the lake where the dvkes are either breached or too low. This is an cffective loss of
storage capacity of 90 million m-.
After a major flood in October I968. when the lake level rose to 18873 masl and caused a major
disaster. the construction of flood protection dvkes commenced along the banks of IL-ake Dianchi bI
individual farmers or irrigation districts for flood and wave protection purposes. However. their
design. construction and heights are generall inadequate and they are consequently ineffective.
especially on windward shorelines. As a result, it is not possible to operate the lake at its regu!ation
opreating level stipulated by the lak-e protection ordinance without causing flooding in some areas
around the lakEe shore.
* I'ater Resource Utilisation in the Di;nchi Basin
The water resources of the Dianchi basin have been developed for supply to agriculture industnv and
domestic consumers: in addition flood control measures are also an important consideration in water
resources management. The present total demand in the catchment from all consumers in the Dianchi
is estimated at 737 million m3/n r, and supplied from all sources including groundwater inputs to
industrv and the urban area of Kunming.
Tnh current water demands from the three main consumers in the Dianchi Basin are estimated to be:

(a) Agricultural Water Use
As indicated in Table 4.1.10. agriculture is the largest consumer of water in the Dianchi Basin and in
the past has used much w%ater from the Songhuaba Reservoir giving rise to a conflict between use and
water qualitv. To reduce the quantity of good quality Songhuaba water used for irrigated agriculture.
a series of 5 pumping stations has been installed in the Panlong River vallev to pump irrigation return
w%ater plus some Dianchi water to the head of the irrigation schemes for re-use. The balance of water
for irrigation comes mainly from the many small and medium size reservoirs in the basin which have
been constructed specifically for this purpose (Table 4.1.8).
Agricultural water use is highly seasonal and concentrated in the period May to June (Figure 4.1.7).
This is the main rice planting period in the months prior to the main rainy season.
(b) Industrial and Domestic Water Use
Six WTX's supply an estimated 181 million m3l/ear, 66% for domestic use and 34Ye for industrial
supply in 1995. The industrial supply has a recyclc rate of 570. In addition. industries utilise 53
million m3/year from groundwater sources.

From Table 4.1.6. three verv significant points emnerge:
I. Lakee Dianchi will not supply enough water to meet water demand in the near future without
futther development projects in the Soaghuaba-Dianchi Basin; these projects are briefly described
below.
2. Even if the current development plan is implemented smoothly. water resources balance in the
basin could be maintained only till 2005 and the balance has to be based on a water recycling rate
of I000/o for Lakle Dianchi: and
3. Beyond the year 2005. water resources shortage will occur to some extent and the water supply
assurance rate will decrease in the basin.
In summari. the tiree inter-connected priorin issues facing water resource nianamers in Dianchi
Basin are:
* Absolute water shortage compounded by deteriorating quality.
v Annual variation in precipitation and runoff. and limited options for large scale reservoir
storage to smooth supplies. resulting in low assurance levels in drv years:
* Flood control versus water supply storage conflict in Songhuaba and Dianchi.
WVater Resource.Sys*em Improvement Measures
* 'ater Ircatment capacify erpansion
Preparation of the Dianchi Basin Water Resources Master Plan (DBWRMP) wtill recommend various
options for water resources improvement. Current measures under construction are considered below.
There are presentlv 6 water treatnent works (NVTWs) w-ith a combined design capacity of 480,000
m3Id in Kunming City (though these often work beyond their design production capacities). WTW No
6 north branch was recentiv completed and commissioned.
Futurb total capacity rhen on-going developments are commissioned, but excluding No. 3 WTVWs,
will be around 600,000 m;ld; with 290.000 from Songhuaba. 310.000 from Lakle Dianchi and I5,000
from groundwater resources. In addition to water supplied by the Kunmine Water Company from

Phase 11 extensions to WTWs No.1 will add 70.000 m3/day-, and a new water works will be developed
in two phases of 100.000 m3lday each. Phase l w%ill be included in the YEP - World Bank programme.
This will bring total treatment capacity to approxin,ately 785.000 m3/day after project
implementation.
Table 4.1.12 shows the importance of Lak-e Dianchi as a supplier of raw water and equally imporant
the fact that water fi ualitn in the Waihai is already adversely affecting treatnent efficicncy.

S Son:huaah-Dian,ci Ctonjuncri r Use Projects
The Son--Dian joint regulation and control projects aim at:
*   increasing the regulation capacity for water supply to match uater demand of industrv.
agriculture and Kunming bI the year 2000:
*   raisine the flood control standard for urban areas from oncc in 20 -ears to once in 100 vears:
and
*   maximisings the supply of good quality Songhuaba water for urban use.
To achieve these aims the following two main project components and four supportine projects need
to be implemented as a matter of priority. The two main project components are:
I . The enlargement of Songlwaba Reservoir
The reservoir storage capacity has already been increased and the people affected rehoused
elsewhere. The wvater level, however, remains at the original maximum operating level because
the relocated farners have not been paid compensation for their land and crops When payment is
made the water level mray then be raised 1.5 metres adding 13 million m3 of storagec However,
the inundation area includes critical grain (rice) crop land at the head of the reseroir and unless
this area can be protected from flooding pernissiGn to raise the water level may not be

BaErwle Conditions
. Optimum regulation of the water levd of Lake Dianudi
To meet the requirement of the key function of Lake Dianchi for water storag, while also paying
appropriate considemtion its other functions. optimal regulation will be derived from the
following S specific water levels:
a) t887.5 masl: highest flood level. return period of once in 20 years:
b) 1887.4 masl: at normal high water level: storage capacity  1.56 x 10m3:
c) 187.1 masl: limited flood level during flood period; storage capacity = 1.25 x 106m3:
d) 1885.5 masl: the lowest working water level: storage capacity = 0-99 x lObm3
e) 1385.2 masl: the critical low water (drought) level. storage capacity = 0.90 x I0'm3.
The two main Song-Dian components cannot by themselves resolve the water supply problems facing
the Dianchi Basin; four supportive components must be implemented to complement the Song-Dian,
these are:
J. Irriga*om water project with a S-stage psmp station sptem on the Paniong nven to increace
the effective yield of Songhuaba for drinking water, a scheme consisting of 4 barrges and 5
pumping stations has been designed and partially constructed to substitute DWanchi waler for
Songhuaba water for irrigation purposes. This will entail abs- !ing water from the Panlong
River or Lakec Dianchi for irrigation of 3,400 ha of land presently supplied from Songhuaba. This
scheme is expected iofrJe 30 million m3/yearfor spplv to Kwming.
2. The proate  dyke project along the Dianchi lakeshore a dyke wall has been constructed over
the past 10-20years to protect the farmland beside Dianchi lake from flooding and to increase the
storage capacitn of the lakc. The existing dylce is incomplete and too low and in places too weak
to perform its design Function. The dyke project aims to rectify these shortcomings to allow
Dianchi lakec to be operated at its maximum potntial for both water supply and flood controL
Tk. The channel improvement project on Haik-oe-Tanglangdtawt riv  HaiEou is the sole natual
outlet channel from Lake Dianchi and because of its limited discharge capacity (50-85 m;ls) it
cannot cope with flood flows exceeding this volume and flooding of the lakeside (where dykes
are inadequate) and more importantly of Kunming have occurred in the past. This sub-project
aims to incrcase the capacity of the Haiiou and Tanglangchuan rivers to reduce flood risLk.
4. iYruan Tuinnel Phase I: the short term dual purpose for the construction of this tunnel (in
conjunction with the barrage which separates the Caohai from the X'aihai) is the diversion of
flood and wastewater drainage fimn the Waihai to the Tanglangchuan- The advantages for water
quality protection in the Waihai are considerable but are offiet in part by the loss of water volume
from the catchment which cannot be afforded. Careful management and use of the tunnel and the
gateway through the barrage should be able to mitigate this impact
W fter Demand Management
To forestall the impending supply-demand deficit, the demand for water can be managed and reduced
through interventions on both the supply and the demand side. options are:
* Supply side
a) increase the number andfor size of reservoirs e.g. at Huangshiyen
b) increase Dianchi storage but raising the dyke level
c)  recycle wastevater through Dianchi
d)  import water from another catchment
e) reduce water distribution losses; leak detection and repair

seedo,, 4
* Demand side
a) charge economic tariffs
b) improve irrigation efficiency, possibly by tariff
c) implement public awareness and education. water conservation
d) impose requirement for industrial in-house treatment and recycling
* Flood Control
By allocating a larger proportion of the storage capacity available in Songhuaba Reservoir to water
supply and reducing the current provision for flood protection (within acceptable limits) the assurance
rate of water supply will be increased while the need to build further vater works capacitv wili be
reduced.
4.1.7 WVater Quality
Water quality is a serious issue in the Dianchi Basin since deterioration in qualitv can reduce the
available water for supply by making treatment too difficult or uneconomic as evidenced by the
closure of WTW No. 3. With the natural water deficiency situation in the basin already a critical
problem. further reduction in water supplies through water pollution cannot be permitted. Prevention
andfor reduction of pollution in both the Songhuaba Reservoir and Lake Dianchi is imperative.

The Som!huaba Reservoir water is currentiv classified as Class 11. ho-never. a recent watershed
monitoring report has stated that the water is now mesotrophic. and suggests that it may be verging on
a cutrophic state. The trend towards greater eutrophication is shown by increase in the concentration
of both phosphorus (at 0.025 mg/I) and nitrogen (0.75 mg/I) in recent years. However. the data on
vhich this trend is based are fewv and further monitoring is urgently required to confirn this trend
and to idcntif- the sources of pollution to pernit active reduction of fuither pollution inflows.
Although the Songhuaba Catchment has been designated by the government as a Water Protection
Zone since 1981 the continuing lack of effective watershed control as evidenced by the unchecked
farming activities and rural township expansion in the area. Clearly the Sonehuaba Reservoir needs to
be protected effectively so that it can continue to be used for human consumption after minimum
treatnent.
The significant deterioration in water quality of the Waihai over 10 to 15 years has also been caused
bv increased nutriets particularly phosphate (0.24 mg/I in 1994) and nitrat. and also by dissolved
organics and toxic heavy metals. The current classification is worse than Class V. These hiph
phosphorus levels have stimulated the groth of algae in the lake. The algae in tum. have resulted in
difficulties with operation of water treatment processes at WrWs 5 and 3. The latter works is now

are few and finr-det, mome intensive monitoring is required.
DiachiLake: EcoliogicalDegradadion
To understand the reasons for the deterioration of lakle water quality in Dianchi it is necessary to
appreciate the significant developments that have occurred in the catchment during the last two or
three decades and the environmental impacts they have had. These impacts derive mainly from the
expansion of the urban population in the catchment and the ever incrreasing humnan control and
intevention in the natural water cycle, some policy deeisions have also had their impaeL Water
quality degradation has resulted from a combination of events and factors - physicaL chemical and
biological: their causes and consequences are tabulated in Table 4.1.12 below and their interactions
illustrated in Figure 4.1.6.
Hisaoy of Lake DianchiDegradeon
In the early 1950s. Lak-e Dianchi was classified as an oligo- to mesotophic clear water lake. Sediments
were larely covered by macrophyte  The fish comimunity consisted mainly of indigenous species and
zooplankton wer sufficient to suppress algal growth. T'he sloping shores msulted in difFrent zones of
littoral macrophyte communities that contrbuted fish breeding sits to lake cleansing and a lare
biodiversity.
Increased human activity in the 1960s and 1970s lead to domestic and industrial pollution, land abuse,
erosion processes, land reclamation at the shores. over fishing and introduction of exotic edible fish
species. As a result the lake ecosystem changed into a turbid waterbody. the fish community became
diominated bw carps, and the algae by blue-greern tpes. Average chlorophyll-a values increased to 120-
150 uel for the Caohai and 20-50 ug/l in the Waihai. The area of the Caohai has been reduced firom 12
to 8 ktn for urban land reclamation. Caohai sediments are heavily polluted. especially with industrial
heavy metas.
Macrophyte coverage has reduced drastically; today there are almost no submersed macrophytes at alL
Only in a few western parts of the WVaihai is macrophyte coverage adequate for fish to spawn and grow.
nTe inner Caohai is often choked by water hyacinth, closing off large parts of the waxaer column from
light and o.xygen. Clearing of the hyacinth imposes financial burdens on the City and lak-e users, and
reduces the lakes tourism potential.

Srction 4
The main rivers and canals in the Kunming urban area are grossly polluted with untreated domestic
and industrial eMuents and solid waste. The inner Caohai waters in particular are extremely
polluted and anoxic; the risk of water borne disease to lake users is not to be under-rated. More than
half of Kunmings effluent enters the Caohai untreated; though this water body reprsents only 2-3%
of Lak-e Dianchi.
In the rural areas of the Dianchi Basin and especialiv around the WMaihai, control of the rivers has
drasticallv altered the quantity and timing of flow into the lake. For much of the vear water is held
back in the rivers for irrieation purposes and to refill resenroirs. During this stagnant phase the pools
between the control gates often become polluted. mainly with liquid and solid a-Astes from villages
and farms. This water then enters the lake as a plug flow when the gates are opened during heavy
storms or when rainfall exceeds agricultural irrigation dernand. usuallv in September to November.
Although the Caohai w"ill not be required as a source of potable w%ater, there is a need to restore
reasonable water quality to maintain it as a source of industrial/cooling water. to manintain the
existing cage culture fishery. to meet aesthetic requirements and to support tourism and recreational
activities. With the compiction of the Xiyuan Tunnel Phase I it will become important to reduce the
substantial pollution load that will be exported to the Tanglangchuan catchment.
Lake Dianchi qualitv has to be improved by whatever are the most appropriate intervention measures,
as serious deterioration in recent yrears has occurred. The water quality of the strams that discharge
into the Songhuaba Reservoir needs to be protected and preserved at its present level, while those that
flow into both the Caohai and the Waihai. need to be returned to an acceptable quality.
Phosphorus
Phosphorus has been identified as the limiting nutrient for the Waihai. The potential phosphorus
loads reaching Lakee Dianchi are estimated at just over 700U) tonnes/year. about 600 of which come
from point sources (domestic and industrial solid and liquid wastes), and only 100 from non-point
sources (air. agriculture. mining, rural sanitation). These figures exclude any loads from the Town
and Village Enterprises (TVEs) for which there are no data. Table 4.1.13 summarises the estimated
key potential phosphorus loads fromn various sources based on 1993, an aveage rainfall year.

only become evident with the collection and analysis of substantially more samples as part of the
proposed Environmental Management and Monitoring sub-component
The water qualitv of the Caohai has also deteriorated rapidly over the same period and is now worse
than Class V. total phosphate concentrations reaching 0.9mg/1 in 1993. Total nitrogen levels have
varied significantly, with values up to 7.5mgI. The trend of these is also upwards. When the Xiyuan
Tunnel is complete. pollution in the Caohai wvill have virtually no effect on tke Waihai, but wrill affect
the Shalke River and the Tanglangchuan River dowrnstreamn. particularly in drnv weather. The latter is
already badly polluted by industrial discharges. and also has a quality of worse than Cass V. The
%zater. wl-ich is used for irrigation, is polluted with toxic materials and vegetables from the area
contain high levels of lead.
If Waer QuaUy Aloenisering in thC Waihai
The ability to model effectively any of the three lkey water bodies of the catchment (Songhuaba
Reservoir. Lakle Dianchi and the Tanglangchuan River) is dependent on a clear understanding of each
of the systems concerned and the availability of sufficient data on tempotal and spatial variation in
hydrological condiLions and water quality covering all relevant physical. chemical and biological
parameters. The complexity of the systems. in particular Lake Dianchi. and the limited extent of
reliable data. for both hydrological and quality issues, suggested that simplified modelling of one or
tvo kev parameters was likely to be the most that could be achieved in the short-term.
'Nith completion of the barrage and lock-gate construction. Lake Dianchi will be divided into two
separate parts: Caohai and Waihai. The Waihai is the main and largest part of the lake and presently
a significant water source for Kunming water supply. The protection of the Waihai and the
rehabilitation of its ecology is a long-term key target of the local governments. However, regardless
of the absolute water quality objectives which are actually set for the lake, it remains important to be
able to predict the improvements in Dianchi water quality which the environmental projects proposed
under the YEP arc expected to bring about.
'%Vaihai mater exhibits TNN to TP ratios (as the nutrients that are causing the eutrophication problems)
above and below 9:1(see Figure S.l). depending very much on the time of year The water can
therefore be classified as being both phosphorus and nitrogen limiting and so. while intervention
measures to improve wvater qualitv should be focused mainly on the reduction in phosphorus loads
entering tlic WVaihai. control of the levels of TN may also have to be considered. The current trophic
status of the Wailiai uaters is cutrophic. Initially. therefore, a simple TP water quality model based
on loads was dcvclopcd to reflect existing water quality behaviour and predict the future water quality
in response to **no interventions" or other specific interventions proposed as pan of the YEP.
The Waihai TP water quality model suggests that it will be difficult to bring the annual average TP
concentration belowv 0.03 mg/l. the Catenory Ill standard for la;kes that had been established as an
objective for the Waihai as a drinking water source. It also appears that it could also be difficult to
achievc thc standard of 0.2 mg/l required by Categories IV and V. for use for industry,. agriculture and
recreation.
By implementing all possible TP rmductions in domestic sewage, industrial wmstewater and runoff. it
appears that the futuTe TP levels could. at best, eventually be brought backl to the current levels of
around 0.2 mg/l. However. it is probably unrealistic to think that magor non-point source
intervention(s) could be implemented to achieve the neccessary 75 per cent reduction given the fact
that much of this load could be a natural occurence and not anthropogenic in orgin. Also the raising
of the lakles surface water level and the construction of the dykes is believed to have had a major
effect on the lakes natural ability to absorb TP. This conftnns that the water in the Waihai is unlikely
to meet national standard for use as a drinking water source in the future, and this would support the

political decision to abandon Lak-e Dianchi as a drinkling water source. It should be noted that the
non-achievement of the prescribed TP standard does not, in itself, make the water unwholesome.
Furthermore it should not be concluded that deterioration of the Waihai '-ater qualitv is being
permited, on the conrtray, considerable interventions will be needed to maintain the water quality at
its current status or improve it slightly in the future. It is obvious that it will require at least dtree
years for major engineering facilities to be chosen. designed. constructed and made totally operational
and a further period (of up to five or six hydraulic retention times in the lake) for the anticipated
environmental response to become apparent. This means that a total time period of perhaps 9 to 11
wears will elapse before the full environmental response is achieved in the Waihai.
Current Water Qualit in the Songlstaba Reservoir
Present Songhuaba Reservoir water quality data are presented in Table 4.1 .18. Water qualith sampling
is camed out very infrequently at Songhuaba and the results are therefore onlv a rough guide to the
quality of surface water. All parameters in the table fluctuate between years but oniv TN shows any
evidence of increase; TP has renained relatively constant It is difficult from these data to justify the
concern over water quality deterioration which has been expressed. All rservoirs like Sorighuaba
have a natural tendency towards nutrient enrichment inrespective of human inteentions. so some
decline in quality is inevitable, the rate of decline only is open to discussion and human intervention.

Rim water quall!y
Onlv limited data are available on river water quality; these data give the concentration of specific
parameters but without corresponding flow data. It therefore not possible to determine the pollution
loads actually entering the lake. As mentioned earlier, the flows in the rivers entering the lak-e are
highlv regulated and permined to enter the lake only when all land-based demands have been mce.
Thus water only enters for approximatelv 50 days per year. mainly during September and October
when there is no irrigation demand and the rains continue. The quality of the water entering the lake
at this time is thus affected by storage in the rivers and irrigation channels and is highly variable.
Typical river water qualitn data are presented in Table 4.1.19.

Pollution problems are growing rapidly as population and the economy ex pand demanding more
water. consumc more raw materials ard produce greater volumes of eMuent to pollute both the air
and water resources.
Domestic Sanitation
While much of Kunming City centre is snewred. almost all of these sewers discharge into water
courses without any treatment. Much domestic sewage is treated in septic tanks and are not
connected to the sewer network. The citn has but a single treatment works: three more are under
construction. The present situation is summarised in Table 4.1-22.
Accordine to the Kunmins Public Utilitv Bureau. there are 253.2 kms of sewers and drains which
dives a ratio of 14.3 kms per 100.000 population which is well below the 1991 urban China average
of 32.3 quoted in the 'Urban Environmental Service Management" Report of the World Bank, 1994
(Table 3.6). This figure agrees with the Utban Environmental Sector Study Report for Kunning,
(World Bank. May 1994) which states that there are 135 km of sewers and 130 kms of open channel
drains. There are also 21 pumping stations. ten for sewage only. two for rainwater and nine for both.
The traditional Chinese practice of night-soil collection from household and communal latrines in the
Kiunming urban area has reduced over the past 20 years as a result of the introduction of water sealed
latrincs as old arcas are redeveloped and houses upgraded to high density. multi-storev apartmcnts.
The %%aste"ater Lencratcd is discharged to water courses. usually after passine through septic tanks.
resulting in thcsc surface "aters bcoming open sewers. The settlement of the faecal solids contained
in these slow-moving waters has produced putrefvin= sediments. malodours and unsightly surface
conditions.  In the %%et scason the scouring action of the incrcased flowb rate has resulted in the
sedimcntcd solids being carried into the Caohai where they have resettled and formed an increasingly
thick sludge laver, such material being amalgamated with similar solids originating in the discharged
%"astes from industrial sources.
With the introduction of the water sealed latrine and economic prosperity. there has been a rapid
incrcase in the number of washing machines: soap has been replaced by synthetic phosphate based
detergents. The total phosphate load to the Caohai and Waihai has thereby been increased.
Furthernore. in the urban area most sewers have been constructed to comney both dty and wet
weather flows. i.e. a combined system. Consequently some of the pollutant loadings transported into
Lalc Dianchi are due to the first flush effect of the intense rains, washing a considerable amount of
particulate matcrial off the urban ground and roof areas.

Sewage Treatment WorAs
The rivers passing through the city are on the verge of. or have become. anaerobic; their base flow is
almost entirely wastewater. Kunming has one Sewerage Treatment Works in operation and three
under construction. Several more are planned. Thev will all treat river water into which sewage and
other effluents have discharged. The installed capacity of No.J STW treats nearly 30 percent of the
effluent produced in Kumning. Many residential areas are connected to septic tanks; these are
emptied every three to four months and the sludge disposed of at selected sites around the city.
The present sanitation situation in Kunming can be summarised as follows:
*  Approximately 60 per cent of the population in Kunming are served by household or communal flush
toilets - with disposal to septic tanks whose effluent eventually discharges to rivers or ditches.
*  The remaining 40 per cent have dry "bucket type" latris, cither in-house or communal, with the
nightsoil disposed at landfiDl site
a  Septic tank sudge is removed from septic tanks for disposal at landfill sites by the agencies responsible
for solid wase
*  Sewage treatment plants are being constmcted which treat river water by the agencies responsible for
sewage and its treatnent ic. the Public Utilities Bureau:

*  STPs I (and 2. 3. 4a now under construction) in Kunming and the proposed municipl treatment
works elewbere are based on many different trestment processes.  is is a resuk of the preferences of
bi-lateral funding agencies. Expertise in the operation of sewage treatment can only be gained with long
experience. In view of the recent introduction of large scale sewage treatment in Yunnan. the number of
different process variants should be strictly limied. In additon to reliability of operation. commonality of
design offers economics in mntenance coss
* Liquid industrial waste is eventually discharged untreated to water courses;
* Hazardous industrial waste is supposed to be treated but as the cost of non-compliance is less than the
treatment cost this is often not done.
Industrial Wastewater Plloation
Industrial pollution in the Dianchi Basin is serious. Industry accounts for around 50 per cent of
wasteuater discharges wiithin the Kunming Master Planning Area - the majority of which is
discharged untreated. The problem relates to both the quantity of wastewa-er discharges as well as
pollution concentrations and loads.
Industrial sources of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) account for a significant
proportion of the overall loads of these pollutants entering Lake Gianchi and are important
contributors to the eutrophication process. In the case of TP. industrial sources have been estimated
to account for 21 per cent and 12 per cent of TP pollutant loads in dry periods in the Caohai and
Waithai respectively. Th: problem of industrial pollution is not confined to excessive nutrient
loadings of Lake Dianchi. also important are tavic discharges such as arsenic (As). lead (Pb) and
various other metals and substances. To date. there has been limited success in controlling and
mitigating industrial effluent discharges in the Lakee Dianchi Catchment and in Y unnan as a whole.
The Major Polluting Indusries and Firns
Some 87 factories in Yunnan were amongst the 3.000 worst polluting industries in China. The
principal industries contributing to deteriorating water quality problems in the Lak-e Dianchi
catchment are chemicals (fertilisers). metals (ferrous and non-ferrous) and paper products. The four
main polluters arc:

Based on a 1993 KEPB survey of major point source discharges. 43 major firms were identified as
the Lev contributors to pollution problems in the Lake Dianchi catchment There are approximatel!
20 industrial enterprises discharging directly into the Waihai. of which 8 factories are estimated to
account for 90-95% of the pollution load. The Kunming Chemical Fertiliser Factory is the single
most important contributor to pollution problems in the Waihai. Seven of these eight major polluting
factories havc wastewater treatment facilities. although their oprational effectiveness is in doubt
The 12 remaining dischares are from much smaller enterprises. There are 20 firms discharging to
the Tanglangchuan River. of which 4 firms are considered major polluters. Among these the
Kunming Iron and Steel Works (KISW) is the most significant and contributes nearly 45% of the
pollution in the Dianchi Basin.

Baselnw CindWens
The Tanglangchuan River is used for irrigation. The heavy pollution load in the river has a
substantial impact on downstream agricultural areas. According to an Environmental Impact
Assessment of the Kunming Iron and Steel Company (prepared for ODA. March 1995). the lead
content in soil at Muyangcun Village (downstream of EISW) is 133 mg/i and cabbages have around
9.5 mgt/ lead content.
Pollafion in Rural Areas
In the rural areas of the Dianchi Basin pollutants entering the lake originate from several distinct
sources; rural towmships. farming. Town and Village Enterprises IVEs) and State Owvned Enterprises
(note: SOEs are now owined by either the Province or the Municipality). Rural townships. of which
Chenegong and Jinning are prime examples. have the same effluent characteristics as Kunming but
with a considerably higher proportion of domestic to industrial content and solid waste
SOEs: are mainly industrial concerns but from the lake pollution perspective two are of particular
importance; these are fertiliser factories and are potentilly large contributors of phosphorus lo the
lake. In addihion. phosphate ore mining is carried out bv other SOEs and TVEs in the southern region
of the lake basin with unquantified impacts on the lake.
TVEs: a significant problem and feature of TVEs is that they are developing rapidly in areas where
there is relatively weak planning controls that is. in areas outside of the Master Plan areas. Equally.
establishing a TVE is often done without clear controls on the location and nature of production
undertaken. wuater use, effluent discharges and air emissions. Enforcement of environmental
regulations is limited. although factories do generally pay somc pollution levies.
Farming: as the availability of night soil from urban areas decreased. farmers began using chemical
fertilisers to boost the crop yields (newspaper reports indicate that increases of 40% in crop yields
have been achieved w%ith such additions). It has been assumed. but not adequately demonstrated from
field data. that the increasinc use of synthetic fertilisers would inevitablv lead to increased quantities
of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) reaching the lake prornoting further cutrophication.
Recent surveys of the P and N loads in the river water actually entering the lake do not support this
view: further studies are required. but at present it seems unlikelv that agricultural runoff is either a
primary or significant source of nutrients into the lake. The reason for this lies in the fact that rivers
flow into the lake for only 50 days on average per year. for the remainder of the vear they are gated
and controlled for vater conservation or irrigation purposes. Also. much of the agriculture around the
lake margins is rice paddy, where the paddy acts as a natural wetiand svstem filtering nutrients from
the water rathcr than contributing them to it.
Keq Pol/tanvs : Inmpacys and Soces
Domestic liquid effluents are mainly organic in nature and readily biodegradable in STlVs: industrial
effluents are in contrast more varied and complex depending upon the specific industry. Many
processing organic raw materials e.g. food processing. brewers, paper manufacturers have readily
treatable wastewaater. other like smielters and chemical factories have little organic load but often
contribute inorganic wastes and toxins.
There are four major types of pollutants entering Lake Dianchi; each with differnt impacts but
derived from varving sources. These are summarised in Table 4.1.23 below-

4.1.9 Wastewater Quality
Crude effltrfnt
The uastewater generated by the domestic and industrial sectors in Kunming is discharged either to
lakes. rivers or irrigaion ditches. Only a portion from the northern suburbs is subsequently abstracted
from the Chuanfan River and treated by ST' No I which returns its treated effluent to the Caohai.
The receiving waters contain effluent plus stomiwater flows and thus the strength of the wastewater
entering the existing ST% and all future SlWs which treat river watr is ven variable on a daily and
seasonal basis. This poses problems for design capacities and effcctive biological treatnent when

Sludge Compesitien
The plant nutrient content of dewatered sludge produced at STW No I is show%n in Table 4.1.26.
These data indicate that the sludge would be valuable as a fertiliser for agricultural or forestry usage
since the levels of toxic matrials in the sludge do not exceed the GB 428444 standard for agricultural
use of sewage sludges. However, sludee is generally disposed to solid waste sites because there is no
market demand for dried sludge in and around Kunming where cheap synthetic fertilisers are
preferred or night soil used in the more rural areas.

4.1.10 Sold Waste
Kw,mning
Background
Solid w-aste is generated in all human settlements: in rural'areas it is not usually a problem. In cities.
however. high population densitY and often greater affluence generate large v: imes of waste in veiy
restricted areas. When urban wamste collection systems fil environmental and u :ablic health problems
soon follow. The city of lZunming with an estimated 1995 population of about 1.76 million is no
exception.
Overall responsibilitn for the collection and disposal of domestic. marlet and commercial solid waste
and street sw-eepings in the Kunming City Master Plan Area of 320km- area rests with the Kunming
City Appearance Committce (KCAC) and is carried out under the leadership and guidance of the
Municipal Environmental Sanitation Section (MESS). The collection and transfer of solid waste to
the dumping grounds is currently undertaken by the District Environmental Sanitation Sections
(DESSs) in the two urban districts of Panlong and Wuhua. and sub-urban districts of Guandu and
Xishan.
Most of the waste is generated in the densely populated urban districts of Panlong and Wuhua. and
the suburban districts of Guandu and Xishran as shown below. Most of the domestic, market and
commercial waste plus sureet sv%eepings generated in Panlong and Wuhua are collected. This is not so
in the suburban districts of Guandu and Xishan where large quantities of garbage line the roaodsides
and river banks causing visual and water quality pollutionL
Exking IVaste Generation
Per capita collection rates in the urban and suburban districts are markedly different as shown below
using the 1993 data in the Table 4.1.28.

I. the efficiency of the collection system. which in the suburban areas is seen to be ineffcient and up
to 300 tons of waste per day may go uncollected. and,
2. the proportion of the waste contnrbuted by coal ash. which because of its bulk and weight graty
skems the collection data. Table 4.x.x. below provides information on the composition of solid
wastes collected from Kunming separated into coal burning and gas using zones.
* Existing wase composition
The composition of solid waste is affected by a number of factors. all of which are in the process of
chan_e. Domestic -waste amounts are significantly influenced by the change from coal fuel to gas fuel
for cookling (see Table 4.1.30).

The solid waste situation in Kunming is fast changing in a number of significant ways, namely.
I. population size is growing
2. population densitv is increasing as traditional housing in the city is replaced by high rise apartment
blocks
3. the change from coal fuel to gas is occurring rapidly reducing total waste tonnage
4. affluence is increasing the proportion of paper and plastics in domestic waste.
Data for Januarv 1995 showed generation rames varying betwen 0.15 and 0.87 kgfperson/day, the
overall average being 0.48 kgpersonldav. 'he inorpnic contst varied between 2.96% and 50.91%.

Section 4
Fatere Waste Genaeron
The volume and weight of domestic waste generated will continue to increase in the future in
response to growth of population and wealth- estimates of this increase are given in Table 4.1.31. The
population projcctions are those of the Kunming Municipal Master Planning Office. In addition. with
the proposed increase in sewage treatment plants in Kunming the quantity of sludge and other solid
wastes from this source wvill increase substantially. Night soil once taken by farmers for composting is
nou being slowly replaced by synthetic fcrtilisers; thus morc night soil vill find its way to landfill
sites in future. These data also takc account of provision of a solid waste management service in areas
which are currently not served and the effects of the programme of conversion from coal to gas fuel
for cooking

wrinting Solid Waste Recqcling. Disposal eund Treatment
Infornal recvcling already takes place and collectors and purchasers have set up their own
operational centres throughout the city. Tihe percentage of the waste recycled is not known.
TIherc are currently numerous (>100) small dumps and seven of larg capacitn around Kunmine:
these seven refuse sites receiving approximately 1.000 tones of waste per day from the citv. all the
dumps are within the Dianchi lake catchment. Approximately 2.5 million tons has been dumped at
these sites between 1984 and 1993, mostly in an uncontrolled manner. At the two major operational
sites at Lao Huashan and Wan Long Qing over two million tons has been dumped in the last 10 years.
Neither of these sites offer proper landfill disposal, both are unhygienic and unsatisfactory,. neither are
registered or monitored.
Solid waste disposal has traditionally taken the form of open dumping which has caused the leachate
problems. In addition, since dumps are not covered with soiL there is wind blown pollution from
surface erosion in the dry season. Gas emissions are also likely. Disused sites in the catchment have
not been capped and existing sites are unlined and unregulated

Baseine CodWons
Solid waste disposal is thus a major problem in the Dianchi basin, though it must be recognised that
from the viewpoint of Lake Dianchi pollution the phosphoms contribution to the lake from landfill
sites is likely to be very low and thus immediate solid waste interventions are not a high priority for
water supply protection. Nevertheless. for public health and aesthetic rmasons proper and effective
disposal is totally necessary.
In addition to Municipal solid waste matter, solids and sludges from sewa;ge trcatment works and
water works are also produced daily. At present the method of disposal is uncertain. For the new STPs
solid wawste disposal to landfill sites is proposed. The quantities and composition of these wastes are
given in Table 4.1.28 and 29.
Environnranato consequences of inadequate solid waste collection and disposal
a) water resource pollution: leachate from dumps and landfills probably infiltrates local aquifers
and water supplies. No data on leachate volume from Lao Huashan and WVan Long Qing are
available but BOD5 and COD both exceed 3,000 ng/l.
b) environmental degradation and visual pollution: within the two urban districts of the city, solid
waste does not pose much of a problem as the collection is effectively carried out by the district
sanitation departments. In the urbanising counties of Xishan and Guandu there is a problem as
large quantities of waste (perhaps up 140 tons per day) to are not collctted by the formal sector
and disposed of by the communities themselves eg. by paying peasants to take it away when in
many instances it ends up dumped at the roadsides or along river banks after useful items have
been recvcled. In addition farmers have been seen persuading (or paying?) waste truckers to
deposit waste alongside the road which is then left to rot and decompose and form composL The
farmers rak-e out the plastics and other solids and put the residue in their land. There is
consequential visual pollution m-ainly fromn plastic film which gets blown about and ends up
sticking to trees and fences and much fnds its way to nearby water courses.
* Fut,  Landfill Sites
The Municipal Environmental Sanitation Division (MESS) has identified tmo sites which they
consider suitable for sanitary landfilling: one 19 km to the north west of Kunming (and out of the
Dianchi catchmenti at Hongshuitang and one 19 km to the east at Baishuitang. Both sites have
undermone environmental assessment.
Some concern over Honeshuitang has been raised since the site is a groundwater recharge area; the
aquifer supplying potable water to local inhabitants. The site is locataed in a fissured karst limestone
area which contains man1 voids and has a fault-line running along its length. The lining of the
landfill with a stroniz impervious material will be essential if groundwater pollution is to be avoided.
MESS has alrcady made investments in land acquisition (f 8.5 million). surface water control, dams.
site access roads. weighbridge and offices. (I 4.0 million) at Hongshuitang. The approach road
however between Dapuji and the landfill site will need improvement to facilitate use by large trucks.
MESS is currently negotiating for tle use of the site at Baishuitang. A 30 year lease is under
discussion at an annual rent of Y 150,000. A condition of the lease is that MESS construct a 2 km
access road from Baishuitaig village to the iandfill site; the % llagers intend to convert the site to
agriculture, as the capping and top soiling proceeds. Baishuitang. located about 20 km cast by south
east of IKunming. is in an area of small grained quartz sandstone and shale.

4.2 QUJING
4.21 Introduction
Qujing is the second largcst urban centre in Yunnan Province covering 18 km'. and is expected to
grow to 47 km: by the year 2010. Qujing City lies 157 km to the north-cast of Kunming and is a
rapidly expanding centre of population and industnr with major industrial satellites along the
Nanpanjiang river between Huashan and Zhanyi. Recent growth has been impressive; between 1990
and 1994 population grew over 5% and industrial output by 19% per annum. The area of the city has
increased from 500 ha in the carly 1980s to over I S00 ha today. The population in the citv masterplan
area in 1994 was 220.100. this is expected to rise to 550.000 by 2010. The anticipated growth of
population in the Qujing Masterplan Area is shown in Table 4.2.1.

The economy has been traditionally based on agricultural and natural mineral resources including
iron. zinc. copper. phosphorus and most importantly coal. As the population of Qujing has grown the
cconomy has moved increasingly towards industry. although agriculture remains important writh rice
Jnd tobacco predominating. Around 70% of households are still engaged in farming.
Industrial development is based on cigarette makling. non ferrous metals. chemicals. automobile and
food processing industries and porver Coal reserves in the municipality stand at 3,750 million
tonnes.
lic ctccts of both population and industrial growjth are to put increasing pressure on natural
resources, leadinu to environmental degradation.
4.2.2 Water Resources
The major resource in Qujing is the Nanpanjiang river and the various reservoirs on its tributaries.
The rivers flow is controlled by hydraulic gates at the source of the river at Huashan reservoir. During
the dry season the ates are closed to conserve water for irrigation and the river is reduced to a series
of small reservoirs or pools. In the rains the gates are opened and river floss up to 214 m3/sec have
been recorded at Zhanvi.
The otlier main river which passes through Qujing is the Niulanjiang River. whilst the Xiaoxiangjiang
River and the Baishijiang River are to be found on the edge of the city.
Qujing City has two service reservoirs Xiao Xiang and Xi He which provide a total effective capacity
of 65.2 million mr/y%ear. groundwater provides a further 4.4 million m3/year. These sources are
insufficient for existing and future demands. Twso other resenvoirs in the municipality may provide

The current project proposal (November 1995) of the Qujing Municipal Govemnent is to bring water
to Qujing from Du Mu. Yields at Du Mu are 142 million m3/year in a mean year and 117 million
m3/vear in a dry year 180 percentile). and it has been calculated that there are reliable surpluses of
50 million m nyear over present demand. The minimum quantity stored at Du Mu since its
construction is 70 million m)
Water Treanment and Suppiy
Water is supplied to almost the entire Qujing population from three treatment work-s with a design
final capacity of 123.000 ;i'/day, currently installed is 95.000 m3/day. However daily supply has been
limited to c.50.000 m3/day due to distribution system deficiencies and a lackl of rav water. In 1994 it
is estimated that onlv 600f% of urban demand was met. Rav watr shortages occur in dry years e.g.
1992-93 when only 30 Vperson/day was available. The abstraction of 5.000 m'/day from groundwater
"% ill cease since it is resulting in land subsidence and a declining water table.
Per capita dailv consumption from all sectors has been estimated at 160 I/person in 1993 and this is
expected to rise to 200 litres by 2010. The need to expand both raw weter supplies and the
distribution system are therefore of high priority. It is expected that industrial water consumption will
continue to increasc relative to domestic use from the current 40% to 80%
Existing water resource and managenent problems include:
*    shortage of supply during dry months of drv years
*    low capacity of parts of the distribution network
*    declining groundwater levels and associated stability problems
*    increasing demands, particularly in the industrial sector

Rood Control
It is understood that flooding is currently not a significant problem in Qujing Citv. A limited area in
the low-lying eastern fringe (currently agricultural land) is susceptible to flooding in exceptional
storms.
1'nater Qrualit
Water quality in the Nanpanjiang deteriorates immediately below the Huashan Reservoir from Class I
to Class V due to discharges from industrv (Table 4.2.3). Below Qujing water quality improves to
Class 1X. tlistorically the Nanpanjiang was suitabic for potable supplies but increasing pollution has
pmhibited its continuing use as a water supply except for - industrial. agricultural and flood
alleviation purposes.
The Xiangshuiba Reservoir was constructed in 1958 to supply water for irrigation, industry and rural
suppl! and to improve flood control. Since the 1970s the water quality has deteriorated to the extent
that it is generally Class Ill (with some parameters exceeding Class IV standard).
Water quality at Xiaoxiang and Xihe Reservoirs is Class 1. and the water quality on the Xiaoxiang
River remains good as far as the outskirts of Qujing City. The quality at Du Mu. however, is only
Class IIl as a result of local mining activities. The pollutants exceeding the standards are ammonia
and. on occasions, manganese. In addition to industrial use the reservoir is used as a source for small
local potable supplies.
Historically. the water of the Nanpanjiang River was of a sufficient qualinv to permit is use as a
source of potable water. However, increasing levels of pollution have now precluded this uses and
its main uses at present are industrial. agricultural and fishery; flood control is also a function of the
river.
Mleasures to improve water quality in the Nanpanjiang have so far been unsuccessful due to
increasine pollution from industrv and agriculture. The Municipal Government's stated objective is to
improvc the rivers qualitv downstreamn of the Huashan to Class IV by the yar 2000 and Class tIl by
2010.

IVater Reworces: Funrre Prospects
Water quality in Qujing s existing service reservoirs is Class l; but Du Mu is Class III due to impacts
from mining in the catchment. However. proposals to construct a thermal power station, holiday
homes and cxpand the chemical industries wvithin the Huashan catchment do not bode well for the
maintenancc of high quality reservoir uater in the future. For this reason. Du Mu is finroured as the
source for expanding supplies to Oujing despite its lower water quality and grater distance from
Oujing.
4.2.3 Wastevater Treatment
To date there are no domestic wastewater treatment facilities in Qujing which accounts in part for the
polluted state of the Nanpanjiang River. Today wastewater flows are estimated to be 142 million
m3/year. rising to 32.8 million m3/year over the next ten years. A Sewerage Master Plan is in an
advanced state of preparation which also includes industrial waste control. A major difficulty is the
verv great seasonal variation of flow in the Nanpanjiang which will be the receiving water for the
final effluent. Flowss fall to verv low levels during the dry season when control gates hold back water
for irrigation. At this time serious pollutionn levels mav well occur in the reduced river.
To adequatelv protect the Nanpanjiang River an STW will also be required for the satellite town of
Zhanyi but is not included in present projet proposls.

4.24 Industrial Pollution Control
Without adequate control of existing and future polluting industries. and with out onsite pre-treatment
prior to discharge to the STWs, further water quality deterioration of the Nanpanjiang is to be
expected. The major targets for present control include:-
* Zhanyi Chemical Fertiliser Factory
* Qujing Paper Mill
* Zhanyi Phosphate Fertiliser Factory
To date no proposals are included in the YEP for addressing this issue.
42.5 Solid Waste
Qujing is a rapidly expanding city with a population of 220.000 and an annual solid waste output of
around 56,000 metric tonnes (153 tonnes /dav) and a per capita output of 0.76 kg/tday. These numbers
are pmjected to increase to 503.000 people. 156,000 tonlyear and 0.85 k;g/capita/day by the year
2010. At present the municipality and individual industries transport approximately equal amounts of
waste to the disposal sites.
Ex!itg  Collection and Dispesal Serwce
Overall responsibilitv for the collection and disposal of domestic, market and commercial solid waste
and stueet sweepings in the 47km of the Qujing City area rests with the Qujing City Appearance
Committee (QCAC) and is carried out under the leadership and guidance of the Qujing MESS.
The collection and transfer of solid waste from the three central districts of the city (Eastern, Western
and Zhanvi) to the existing official dump site about 7km south-west of the town is currently
undertaken by the staff of two environmental sanitation stations. Refuse is also disposed at unofficial
sites and fly tipping along the roads outside the city is common. None of these sites uses proper
landfill techniques and are known to be causing secondary pollution impacts on aesthetic, air and
water resources
There are currently no transfer stations, half of the refuse being collected from one thousand 250 litre
street side bins and transported direct to the existing dump site by S tonne trucks. The other half is
understood to be taken direct to the existing dump site by the enterprises which generate it.
Existing WVaste Composition
The presenm composition of urban domestic waste is given in Table 4.2.5. In addition to this domestic
waste is a further 12.6 tonnes/day of nightsoil. The composition of the waste is affected by a number
of factors. many of which are in the process of change. Domestic waste amounts will be significantly
influenced by the change from coal fuel to gas fuel for cooking, although surveys show that. at
present. ash remains a significant proportion of the refuse.

Futare IVasre Generation
Forecasts of solid waste gencration have been considered to a horizon of 2010 (Table 4.2.6.). As the
standard of living increases. refuse quantities can be expected to increase by about I - 2% per year.
However. the programme of conversion from coal to gas fuel for cooking will result in a gradual
reduction of refuse production of the same order. As a result of the changes. there can be expected to
be a significant reduction in refuse density. In the future, the collection of nightsoil will gradually be
phased out as water closets are introduced.

4.3 GEJIU
4.3.1 Introduction
Gejiu lies some 200 km south of Kunming. The city is situated in a closed valley 7 km x 2 km (Fig.
4.3.1 spo p.2.25) and has a population of 132.000 living in an urban area of 0.8 km2. Population
growth rdte is low% in Gejiu compared with Kunming and is wlil belonv the Provincial average.
Forecasts of population growth in Gejiu are shown in Table 4.3.1.

Environmental pressure is increasing in Gejiu Municipalitn and especially Geiiu City. In the urban
area current environmental management problems include: flood protection. air and noise pollution.
w%ater quality in Gejiu Lak-e and demand for additional water resources in the city and in the satellite
towns of Ji Jie and Da Tun. The Municipal Government has expended considerable resources to
reduce the impacts of pollution with some success, particularly in reducing air pollution from
domestic cooking.
lihe city continues to developed and grow around the tin mining and processing industry (the largest
in S.E Asia at 7.000 tonnes/day) producing around 60% of the PRCs total annual output. This industy
is. however. one of the main sources of environmental problems in the area. Industries based on local
lead and zinc resources and fertiliser factories are also in operation.
Development plans assume the Municipal population will increase at approximately 1% per annum
with faster rates of growth in the satellite towns of Da Tun, Ji Jie. Ka Fung and Lau Cang.

43.2 Water Resources and Flood Control
Two major river systems dorninate Gejiu Municipality (Figure 4.3.1). the Nanpanjiang (Pearl River)
and the Hong He (Red River). Both are sufficientlv far from Gejiu to be outside consideration as
water supply sources or receiving waters for effluents.
Gejiu currently utilises the following raw water sources for potable supply:
I. three reservoirs to the south of the citv supplying 9.000 m3/day (mean dry season) equal to 30% of
the demand.
2. groundwater from two sources. 3.900 m3/day
3. spring water from two sources providing 3.600 m3/day
In addition. 22.800 m 3dav is abstracted from Lakle Gejiu for industrial use. this is balanced by
untreated sew%age flows into Lakle Gejiu from the combined drainage ditches.
Lake Gejist
Lake Gejiu was formed during a severe flood in 1954 when the discharge capacity of the natural
outlet from the valley was exceeded and the lower parts of the city inundated. Subsequently the
original outlet was dammed and drainage water now fills the lake which has an area of 0.76 km and a
catchment area of 28.6 kIm2 and a natural capacity of c. 5.67 million m3. Because of sedimentation
from industrial tailings this volume has been reduced to 3.8 million m3 and over the last 20 years over
2.3 million m3 of sediment has been dredged from the lake. Dredging ceased in the late 1980s because
available spacc in approved dumping areas was exhausted and this has worsened the problem of
flooding.
FReod Control
WVhen flooding threatens 4 pumps (rated at 350.GW1 m3/d. and installed to supply water to industry)
iift water to adjacent northern catchments: but flooding is not anways prevented successfully. One of
the major Municipal development projects is to improve flood control in the city.
The favoured proposal to reduce the flood hazard is to increase the capacitY of the northward flood
discharme channel. This u'ould require enlargement of the existing channel and the flow capacity of
the Zhadian River into which it discharges. Both enlargements face significant design and
construction difficulties.
Components to achieve improved flood protection include:
I. increased capacity of flood control pumps
2. river training to increase flow capacitn of the Zhadian river into which the pump'd flood water
will be discharged
3. sediment removal from the lake to produce a storage volume of 5 million m3.
4. rehabilitate old storage ponds to full capacity after closing uncontrolled mining and ore dressing
activities
5. cut a multi-purpose (flood and road) tunnel towards the town of Da Tun.
Valer balance of Lake Gejiu
In the drv season (six month period) the water available from Lake Gejiu comprises:
1. 1.8 million m3 of storage capacity
2. 3.8 million m3 of industrial and domes.ic effluent.
Wastewater is thus two-thirds of the available supply in the dry season. Since industrial abstraction is
already > 4 million m3 during the dry season. this inflowv is vital tc the waster balance of the lake.

Da Tan Lake
Da Tun laklc straddles the border between Gejiu and Meng Zhi Municipalities. Although of gratcr
area than Lakc Gcjiu it is very shallow and provides only limited water supply resources and does not
provide adequate flood storage for the Da Tun area. Da Tun . the main agricultural township of the
Municipality. therceore. suffers from water shortazes.
Da Tun Lake is polluted to Class IV standard: the objective is to raise it to Cass Ill.

4.3.4 Water Supply
The citv has threc  T%Vs which supplv 17-18.000 m3/d (c.60Ye of their capacity); this is
suipplemented b! 5-1 n0.000 mId supplied by the Tin Company to its residential facilities in the town.
In 199314 Gejiu City t.tal daily demand (excluding the rin Company) was between 22-25.000 m/d:
and the daily- domestic demand is calculated to be 127 llperson/dav.
In the dev-eloping satellite towns present water consumption. excluding industrial self-supplyv is 3.000
miday in both Ji Jic and Da Tun.
Waler supplv and du:mand in the Municipality are at present balanced but shortges are common in
particularly dnv ycars. With continuing population and industrial expansion these shortfall will occur
at greater frequency ir supply interventions are not implemnented. Currently expansion of supplies in
thc satellite tnwns of Da Tun and Ji Jie are the main foci of water resources developmentL These
projects are not included on the World Bank list of projects but are understood to be included in the
9thi 5-year Plan.
4.3.5 Pollution Sources and Surface Water Qualit.
Since the city has a limited combined waste and stormwater collection system and no STP (though
domestic effluent does pass through septic tanks before discharge) the lake is now badly polluted
(worse than Class V) by both domestic and industrial wastes and is anoxic and black in appeuarnce
with contam inated sediments. Nonetheless the lake is still used for industrial water supply and limited
flood control. The qualitv of Lake Gejiu and the Zhadian River are shown in Table 433.

Lake GejiJ Restoration
The proposed project (not World Bank supported) aims to restore the lake volume and wvter quality
by sediment removal and effluent quality control. Problems faced include the safe disposal of the
dredged sediment and the source of funds for the project Obviously without further reductions in the
sediment volume entering the lake and substantial reduction in toxic effluent restoration is
impractical.

The treatment and disposal of wastewater from industry and the domestic sector is the crucial issue
for the environmental improvenent of Lake Gejiu and the city in general and the satellite townships.
The selection of a suitable site for a STW in Gcjiu is difficult because of geographical and urban
restrictions. Various sites have been assessed. The daily sewage flows are showpi in Table 43.6.

4.4 AIR and NOISE
4.4.1 Kunming
Air polluction - Introduction
Good qualitv air is fundamental to life. It is essential for good health and vital for sustaining food
msources. Air pollution has a major impact upon the environment, affecting the quality of life at a
global. national and local levels.
Human activities are responsible for most atmospheric pollutants in Kunming. the exception to this is
possiblY the levels of total suspended particulates (TSP). which may be generated from wind blowing
over exposed areas of dr gound. This mav have been originIly caused by mans activities  he main
sources of air pollution arise from power geneation. industrial and commercial fuel combustion, and
transportation.
The naturem extent and distribution of air pollution has altered in recent years. Domestic pollutants
smoke and sulphur dioxide (SO.), prevalent in the first three quarters of this centnny, have diminished
whbile the growth in road traffic has resulted in a substantial incease in vehicular pollutants wehich pose a
serious threat to health and the environment. International concern has focused upon emissions of
chemical pollutants that esult in global warming, acid rain, and the deterioration of the ozone layer.
The location of mnissions their modes traport and dispesion. volume and nature of pollutnts and
weather conditions all influence the extent and impacts of atmospheric pollution. wiether global,
national or local. Pollutant com posto  concenrnaton and emnission rates determine the level and flux
of a pollutant in the environment at anv given time. Theaefore the levels of pollution, and hence air

quality. are highly variable and often transient Moreover. the assessment of air quality is relafive. as
long-tenn trends may mask short-temn. daily or hourly peaks variations
Not all air pollutants occur in the gaseous state. SmaIl solid particles and liquid droplets collctively
called particulates or aerosols. are present in the air in great quantities and often constitute a serious
pollution problem. Some pollutants react togeher to produce synergistic pollution effects This occurs
when tuo or more chemical pollutants react together to create grater pollution potntial than that posed
by any of the pollutants individually. This is particularly relevant to air quality in the City of Kunming
%%,here temperature inversions in the basin exacerbate the problem.
Prevailing wvather conditions have a marked effect upon air pollution pattems and concentrations in
Yunnan and Kunming. Besides the affects of locaL regional and national sources of air pollution. the
qualitv of the air mass abone the city could also be affected by the movement of air across the Provincial
borders from other provinc s and countries in South East Asia and the pollutants emitted in other
countries. Under certain meteorological conditions a build-up of pollutants could occur in Kuming
causing severe air pollution. The city lies in a basin surrounded on three sides by steeply rising hills
where temperature inversions cause poor dispersion of pollutants entering the atmosphere. This
effectively traps pollutants for relatively long periods of time allowing their accumulation.
Vehicle emissions are probably at present the third most important source of air pollution in Kunming.
In Yunnan Province the number of vehicles rose from 150.000 to 450,000 in the decade up to 1992; an
average annual increase of 12 per cent. This rapid increase in vehicle use is a cause for concern. Gases
and particulates emitted from vehicles in the City contribute significandy to the buildWup in
concentrations of certain pollutants.
The rapid increase in petrol and diesel v-ehicles in Kunming and other cities in recent years continues
unabated. A strategy to curb such increases is urgently needed. an example being through
introducing means to encourage the greater use of public transport. This is likely to be a central
feature of the Transport Master Plan which is currently being prepared by the Kunming Municipal
authorities with Swiss technical assistance.
The air pollution data provided , both written and from discussions with reievant parties. gives a
general view of air quality throughout Yunnan. It is clear that without intervention the quality of air
in the major citics of the province will deteriorate significantly as industrial output and the use of
motor vehicles continue to increase. It should also be noted that localised industrial sources of
pollution in rural areas may also cause a marked decease in the local air quality. although it is
accepted that this is likely to be less pronounced than in urban areas. Generally. two major activities
appear to be the causc of such localised pollution. namely the use of inefficient coal fired boilers and
quarrying.
At present it is difficult to fully appraise air quality, although third class quality standards are
frequently exceeded. However. this is tempered by the fact that these exceptions are predominantly
for TSP lcvels. which as previously stated may be due to reasons other than industrial pollution.
Notwithstanding, the levels of SO2 and NO. combined with small particulames does give rise for
concern as to adverse respiratory impacts and may warrant reductions in the enission limits for the
acid gases. Chronic respiratory and obstructive pulnonary disease, which is linked to fine
partieulates and SO.. has been quoted as being a major cause of premare death in Yunnan.
The current ambient air quality monitoring programme gives a good basis to understanding indicative
trends in air pollution within the Province and its major conurbations. Linking this with information
concerning waste gas emissions fiom the principle industries provides a-sound basis to review, and
possibly alter. air quality objectives by reduction in the current emission standards. It should be noted
that the figures provided for waste gas production may need to be altered to reflect the total emissions
to atmosphere. The present figures do not include fugitive emissions or non-process waste gases.
This can give rise to a gross untderesmation of the total emissions to atmosphere, with a
comsponding underestimation of environmental impact.

Exi sung siuaion of air qafity in Kin uxig
The air quality of the Kunming area may be described as somewhat better than that of many Chinese
cities. However, this does not mean that air quality is not a cause for concen, because:
the general air qualitv in the city is below the desired standard for residential aeas - most
monitoring results in the urban area are understood to indicate that the quality is worse than Class
2 (see Appendix A for classification):
* stack emissions impact upon localised areas:
* during visits to many factories it has been observed that there are considerabie fugitive/ leak-age
emissions within the work place.

the watershed of Lak-e Dianchi. the amount of discharged waste gas wvas 18.7 billion m3 in 1994 an

Ntoise - Introduction
Increased construction activities and rapidly growing traffic volumes are the main contributors to
noise pollution in the Province's cities. Since 1990 written complaints regarding environmental
problems have grown at an average of 45 per cent per annum. indicating a growing public concern
and awareness. For the Province as a whole atrnospheric pollution complaints slightly exceeded those
for w%aier supply and noisc. However, in Kunming half the letters received pertained to noise
pollution.
Noise in Kuinming
Urban transportation improvements have not kept pace with the rapid development ofthe city and the
growth in population. Urban noise in the environment has been increasine. and noise pollution in
general has become a serious problem and was the top listed environmental problem in a recent DRA
survev of Kunming residents.
In 1993. the average equivalent sound level (leq) in Kunming City was 56.8 dB. 1.8 dB higher than
that of Grade I standard stipulated by the State. The range was between 40.1-78.1 dB. The principal
source is transportation, while other major sources w,ere construction and industries. Various traffic
improvement measures have been introduced to lessen noise. These include one way traffic systems, a
ban on horns (conspicuously ineffective) and on trucks entering the ring roads and renewal of several
major trunk roads in urban areas.
The areas and population exposed to levels above 55 dB are 29.0 km' and 242,000 respectively. This
accounts for 46.6% of the monitored areas and their population. Despite these interventions road
sections exposed to greater than 70 dB reached 65% of all roads and trafftc noise from increased flow

and greater traffic congestion is still a major problem. Monitoring has revealed that, during the day.
noise limits were exceeded in 81 per cent of the residential districts adjacent to major tr_nspottion
links and in 86 per cent of business districts.
Since January 1994. firecrackers have been banned in Kunming City'. and noise pollution is
somewhat reduced during holidays. festivals and opening ceremonies of business enterprises and
units.
Construction noise has impacted heavily on people's life as old urban areas undergo renewal and new
developments arise.
4.4.2 Qujing: Air Quality and Noise
The problems air quality and noise experienced in Qujing are similar to (although generally some-
what less severe than) those in Kunming.
Qujing has lower traffic volumes than those in Kunming. so that ambient air quality and noise levels
are less of a problem.

About 28% of road sections suffer from noise levels in excess of 55 dB. Noise pollution is more
serious in the old urban areas and business disuicts, and part of the residential regions in the new
urban areas suffer heavilv from industrial noise because they are too near to factories
4.4.3 Gejiu: Air Quality and Noise
Air quali:v problems in Gejiu relate principall to traffic and to a limited number of industries. As a
result of actions alken by the Municipality most of the city's industries do not create major air
pollution problems. The porcelain plant is a polluter, but their expansion plan includes a move away
from coal fired furnaces. Emissions via chimneys are understood to generally conform to
requirements, but site inspections indicated that there are considerable fugitive/leakage emissions
within the work place.

Sore YIES EA Repor
Noise pollution in Gejiu City has become quite serious, not because of vey large volumes of traffic
(the city is not on a trunk traffic route) but because of its topography, as it is closely surrounded by
mountains. The Leq of ambient noise in daytime and night-time are respectively 56.0 dB and 46.4
dB. The major sources are transportation and industries, while construction noise is also a significant
contributor. Some residential areas suffer considerable noise pollution from nearby industies.
tape recordings of frecraers are now substiuted for the real thing.

4.5 OVERALL LONG TERM TRENDS
4-5.1 Introduction
Identification of the overall long-term trends in environmental impact. i.e. if no changes are made to
current policies, plans and institLtions and no intemventions are made to avoid continuing
environmental deeradation. is used as a basis for the comparison of options. This section summarises
the key long-term trends in the three project cities.
Longterm trends can often best be identified b) adopting the Do Nothing'- scenario approach. This
approach describes what will happen if no additional action is taken to address the issues of existing
and potential environmental degradation. It represents a warning of the consequences of inaction. and
can be used a basis for the comparison of options as v.ell as the identification of longterm trends.
Prospects under this scenario are described below for the various project sectors in Kunming. Qujing
and Gejiu.
4.5.2 Kunming and the Dianehi Basin
The predicted growsth of population of betwvees. 2.7M and 4.OM. and the increase in urban, rural,
industrial, agricultural and other activities would impact on water resources and water quality, flood
control. w-aste collection. generation and disposal, air pollutionk noise pollution and rural
environmental degradation. In turn. this would give rise to increasing health problems for the
inhabitants of the Dianchi c4achmenrL
HVater Resaorces. Demand and Quality
Average annual renewable w%ater resources of 300m3 per capita at present would decline to 195m3 per
capita by 2020 (based on a projected population of 2.8 million). In drought years. these would fall to
130 and 80 rr-spectively in 1995 and 2020. Storing water from wet years and re-use of water frwn
Lake Dianchi usill remain the means of balancing demands unless water is imported. By contas,per
capita 'uater consumption is projected to increase by 40%fe. from 130 to 250Udav with an increasing
standard of livine. Existine levels of consumption have been measured as lower than 18OVday,
although water losses may be in excess of 50% in some areas.
Industrial vater demand is also expected to increase significantiv. Agriculture should remain the
largest user and. althoueh its demand is thought unlikely to change overall. the possibility exists that
agricultural developmcnt could lead to more irrigation in some areas. However. the shortage of water
and the increasing demand. giving an overall average water deficit of 280 million m3. will
significantly increase concerns over the balance of water use.
Developmcn 'sill also give rise to increasing levels of pollution in Songhuaba Reservoir and LaLe
Dianchi and the %%atcrcourscs of the catchment. Total phosphorus has been identified as representing
the key environmental pollutant of Songhuaba Reservoir and Lake Dianchi. A prelimiarr rater
qualit( "odel of Lake Dianchi has predicted that. if no action were taken, thze total phosphorus levels
in Lake Diuncii *rovld rise to >0. 4mg/ by 2005 and >1.Omg/i hr 2020( ) These levels increasingly
promote the grow th of alzae in the lakc. At total phosphorus levels somewhere between 0.35mgel and
0.5mgJI. the levels of algae which occur in the laklc wvater can be expected to makc it virtually
untreatable for water supply by conventional water treatment processes. The cost of supplying
drinkine water from Lake Dianchi would become prohibitive. This will occur between 2000 and
2005, although the effects of this phenomenon have already begun to be felt.
As Kunming already relies on Lake Dianchi for water in dry years, the ovemall shorlage would
become increasingly serious for Kunming and the Dianchi Basin.
more recent data have cast some doubt upon the validity of this conclusion: the situation will not be resolved
until further water quality analyses have been conducted

Rasdhge Conditios
Waste Coflecdon, Ttmcnt and Disposl
Waste generation will continue to grow with collection and treatment facilities increasingly unable to
meet demand. W7hile local government agencies may continue to collect solid and liquid waste with
reasonable effectiveness. in the absence of an overall strategy, the sanitary disposal will continue to
be difficult to accomplish. Ensuring sanitarv disposal of industrial waste, which curently constitutes
the largest proportion of waste. will be a major problem. Toxic and hazardous wastes. in particular.
alread!y poses a problem and continued uncontrolled tipping of this waste could have serious
consequences. especially as the city expands and informal disposal sites are built.
Flooding
The impervious area will continue to increase as Kunming as develops. Without mitigation measures.
storm runoff from the urban area will also increase and cause greater flooding. Designs of flood
control projects will need to takle account of future urban hydrological conditions rather than existing
development conditions.
Air and Noise
WVithout intervention. the quality of air in Kunming and in the Dianchi Catchment will deteriorate
significantly as industrial output and the use of motor vehicles continue to increase. Localised
industrial sources of pollution in rural areas will continue to cause a marlked decrease in the local air
quality. although this is likely to be less pronounced than in urban areas. Two major activities are the
cause of such localised pollution, the use of inefficient coal fired boilers and quarrying/mining. The
mining, and associated fertiliser manufacture in the southem area of the catchment will continue to be
a significant source of airbome phosphorus pol'ution. Increased construction activities and rapidly
growing traffic volumes will con%inue to be the main contributors to noise pollution.
Rural Environment
The causes of degradation in the rural environment are usually multi-sectoral and can be caused bv
vegetation disturbance. land use, soil erosion potential. physiography. sediment transport or a
combination of these. Without effective enforcement of the Lake Dianchi Ordinance, rural activities
could give rise to deteriorating water quality .-'m agriculture inputs and reduced productivitv due to
the physical and chemical effects of soil erosion. Increasing but unregulated phosphorus mining
activities could give rise To significant erosion, further increasing already excessive phosphorus levels
in Lake Dianchi.
Heali, Implications
The main causes of mortality in Kunming are circulatory and respiratorv diseases, cancers and
injuries/poisons. Pollutants contribute to the ;nvironmental riskl factors for all of these causes of
death. Environmental health risks are likely to increase, in particular. from  the increasing
contamination of water sources with heavy mnta1s and other toxins (causing direct and indirect toxic
effects). and faecal contamination from untreated sewage (giving rise to w%ater-bome diseases). Air
pollution will have rising acute toxic effects and longer-term respiratory, carcinogenic and
cardiovascular problems. Environmental stress in the urban area as a result of noise can increase the
incidence of cardiovascular disease.
4.5-3 Qujing City
Introduction
In parallel with thie predicted growth of population in the urban area of the Municipality by over
1OWe to some 550.000 bv the year 2010. the economy would continue to grow, with an increase in
both urban and rural. industrial, agricultural and other activities. These would impact on -.ater

resources and water quality, flood control, waste collection, generation and disposaL air pollution.
noise pollution and rural environmental degradation which. in turn. could give rise to increasing
health problems for the inhabitants of both Qujing Citv and Qujing Municipality.
Oveall, the effect of taking no action could eventually lead to the restriction of the economic
developmeit of Qujing as the capacity of the environment is exceeded. in panicular the utilisable
water resources.
FValer Resources and Sspply
Average annual renewable water resources would continue decline as the projected population rises
and per capita water demand increases with thc standard of living in the citv. There are already
shortfalls in supply and in drought years there would be an increasing lack of sufficient water to
supply the city's growing needs.
Industrial demand is also likeily to increase significantiv. Shutdowns by industries can be expected to
increase as the shortfall increases. The shortage ifwater and the increasing demand uill significantly
increase concems over the balance of water use.
Increasing development, industrial activity and agriculture will also give rise to worsening levels of
pollution in the Nanpanjiang and Xiaoxiang Rivers. The quality of the vwater in Xiangshuiba
Reservoir would continue to deteriorate, further damaging its use as a water resource for the city.
Other reservoirs which currently are of high quality may deteriorate because of aericultural activity in
their catchments.
Tooad Protection
Flooding of the city from the Nanpanjiang River and its tributaries would continue to occur on a
regular basis because of the lack of capacitn of the existing channel. Further urbanisation of the
municipal area would lead to gradualiv increasing flows of stormwater into the river, resulting in an
increase in the frequency of the flooding.
FV'aste Generation. Collection. Treamnnt and Disposal
Waste generation will continue to grow as the city develops. W'hile local government agencies may
continue to collect both solid and liquid waste with reasonable effectiveness. sanitr disposal of solid
waste will become increasingly difficult to accomplish and pollution from the solid %vaste dump can
be expected to continue to create problems. Liquid domestic and industrial w%astes will continue to
pollute thc rivers of the municipality prcsenting an increasing health hazard to the population and
causing problems for agricultural use.
Ensuring satisfactory sanitary disposal of industrial waste, which constitutes a significant proportion
of waste. can also be expected to become a major problem. Toxic and hazardous wses, in
paticular, can be expected to pose an increasing problem and their uncontrolled tipping could have
serious consequences. especially as the city expands and informal disposal sites are builL
Air and Noise
Without further intervention. the qualitv of air in Qujing will deteriorate significantly as industrial
output and the use of motor vehicles continue to increase. Localised industrial sources of pollution in
rural areas will continue to cause a marked decrease in the local air qualit.v although this is likelv to
be less prolounced than in urban areas.
Increased industrial activitv. construction and rapidly growing traffic volumes will continue to be the
main contributors to noise pollution. particularly in new industrial areas close to industrial
development.

Rual EnviMmt
The causes of degradation in the rural environment are usually multi-sectorai. caused by vegetation
disturbance, land use. soil erosion. physiography. sediment transport or a combination of these.
Without continuing effective enforcement, rural activities could give rise to deteriorating water
quality frorn agriculture inputs and reduced productivity due to the physical and chemical effects of
soil erosion.
Healh inmpliations
The water supply and sanitation projects could have benefits in reducing water-related diseases.
especially Hepatitis A. dysentery and typhoid. This assumes that safe water supply and sanitation are
widely accessible to the population, and that basic hygiene levels are good. The solid waste project
component could help to reduce injury and poisons as causes of death or sickness by improving safe
disposal of potentially har.nfuil and toxic materials. Without the proposed investments, these benefits
will not be realised. No quantitative health data are available to provide possible orders of magnitude
for benefit achievement. The health services are currently very under-resourced compared to other
Yunnan cities. including preventive, curative and health surveillance activities. This could well
restrict the realisation of benefts.
4.5.4 Gejiu Municipality
The predicted growth of population in the Municipality by 25% to some 500.000 and the increase in
urban and rural, industrial. agricultural and other activities would impact on water resowces and
water quality. flood controL waste collecionL generation and disposal. air pollution. noise pollution
and rural environmental degradation which, in turn. could give rise to increasing health problems for
the inhabitants of the Gejiu Municipality.
IVatter Resources and Supply
Average annual renewable water resources would continue decline as the projected population rises to
500.000 and per capita water demand increases from 127 MIhead/day to the order of 200 Vhead/day as
the standard of living in the city increased. In drought years. there would be increasing shortfalls of
-.water supply.
Industrial demand is also likely to increase significantlv. Shutdow ns by the Tin Company and other
industries can bc expected to increase as the shortfall increases. The shortage of water and the
increasing demand will significantly incease concerns over the balance of water use.
Increasing development and industrial activity will also give rise to increasing levels of pollution in
Gejiu Lake. and Da Tun Lake, and in the w atercourses of the catchment. in particular the Zhadian
River. The quality of the water in Gejiu Lak-e would continue to deteriorate. further damaging its
potential as a recreational lake for the city.
Flood Prtecfion
Flooding of the city. in particular the low-lying enstern part, would continue to occur on a regular
basis because of the lack of capacity of the existing flood protection pumping stations. Further
urbanisation of the municipal area would lead to gradually increasing flows of stormwater into the
lake. resulting in an increase in the frequency ofthe flooding.
Waste Genermion, Collection. Treamne and Diposal
Waste generation will continue to grow as the city develops. While local government agencies may
continue to collect both solid and liquid waste with reasonable effectivenes sanitary disposal of solid
maste will become increasingly difficult to accomplish and pollution from the solid waste dump can
be expcted to create significant problems. Liquid domestic and industrial wastes will continue to

Section 4
pollute the lakles and rivers of the municipality. presenting an increasing health hazard to the
population and causing problems for agricultural use.
Ensuring satisfactory sanitary disposal of industrial waste. which constitutes a significant proportion
of waste. can also be expected to become a major problem. Toxic and hazardous wastes, in
particular. can be expected to pose an increasing problem and their uncontrolled tipping could have
serious consequences. especially as the city expands and informal disposal sites are built.
Air and Noise
Without further intervention. the quality of air in Gejiu will deteriorate significantly as industrial
output and the use of motor vehicles continue to increase. Localised industrial sources of pollution in
rural areas will continue to cause a mark-cd decrease in the local air quality. although this is likely to
be less pronounced than in urban area'  Two major activities are the cause of such localised
pollution. the use of inefficient coal fired boiers and quarrying/mining. The mining. and associated
processing industries uzill continue to be a significant source of dust pollution.
Increased industrial activity, construction and rapidly growing traffic volumes will continue to be the
main contributors to noise pollution.
Rsirol Em'ironment
The causes of degradation in the rural environment are usually multi-sectoral. caused by vegetation
disturbance, land use. soil erosion. physiography. sediment transport or a combination of these.
WVithout continuing effective enforcement. rural activities could give rise to deteriorating wvater
quality from agriculture inputs and reduced productivitv due to the physical and chemical effects of
soil erosion. Increasing but unregulated mining and related activities could give rise to further
erosion problems, and result in increasing problems of siltation and water quality in Gejiu Lake.
Health Irmplications
The main causes of mortality in Gejiu are circulatory and respiratorv diseases. cancers and
injuries/poisons. Pollutants contribute to the environmental risk factors for all of these causes of
death. Environmental health risks are liklely to increase, in particular. from  the increasing
contamination of w%ater sources with heavy metals and other toxins (causing direct and indirect toxic
effects). and faccal contamination from untreated sewvage (giving rise to w%ater-borne diseases). Air
pollution will have risint! acute toxic effects and longer-term respiratory. carcinogenic and
cardiovascular problems. Environmental stress in the urban area as a result of noise can incrcase the
incidence of cardiovascular disease.

S. IMPACTS AND MmMCATIoNS
5.1 Introduction
All development projects will ha"e environmental impacts on the locality in which the  are
implemented. These impacts include the intended design benefit of the project and negative or
advcrse impacts %%hich arc unintended and unltanted.  The term  -environmental impact"' has
traditionallh been interprcted in the past to mean only adverse impacts: this discussion broadens the
definition to include also the beneficial impacts of project implementation. The YEP sub-projects
supported h! the World Bank will generate extensive economic. social and en% ironmental benefits for
the three project cities In V'unnan and for the Dianchi Basin in particular. These far outweigh the
costs and relatively minor negative impacts. The World Bank funded interventions are by nature
environmnentallK iriendli and designed to improve environmental quality: this they will do.
P'roject intervention, can be categorised as either hardware or software interentions. Hardware
interventions are those including substantial constnuction works: soft%%are interventions include
trainin-g institutionial. policy or administratitc changes. The Litter do not normally generate negative
cnironmental or %Lcial impacts. oniv henefits. However. wihile the hardware projects will remove
substantial pollition loads to the environment. some adverse side effects h3ae been identified and
niitiative measurcs proposed during the EA process.
This section addresses the implications of the -Do Nothing'' scenario on the environment and then
con%iders thclle ke   ater qualit% issues in relation to Lake Dianchi. In this approach. the costs or
implemnernion (taking account of the economic. social and environmental benefits u%hich accrue) are
n%einhed against the cost antd consequences of doin= nothing. i.c. not implemcnting the V'EP.

5.22 Key Water Quality Issues in Lake Dianchi
Tne crux of the YEP is to reduce and if possible reverse the current downward trend in surface water
quality which is being experienced throughout the Province. The three project cities have the most
scrious problems in Yunnan since they face both water quality and water quantity limitations on water
sbupply to industri. agriculture and the domestic sector. The need to consene quality as a means to
mninimise relative and absolute quantity shortaze is imperativc. In particular. the decline in w ater
qualit% of L.ake Dianchi and Son"huaba Rescrvoir are two of the most pres:ing issues for Kumning
ln ironmental mana-ement toda%. I-lies a'pects are discussed in detail in Annex L of the Prqiect
Report.
A simple "%ater qualiw' model has been developed by the YEPO and the DRA ConsultantL using water
qtualit% data supplied by the kunnming Monitoring Centtre and other monitoring atid research institutes.
\lthough the accuracy of its predictions is tempered by the Iimited extent and quality of the basic
data. it appears to demonstrate that under the --do nothin=  scenario the quality of Lake Dianchi
cspecificall% the lWaihai) stater %ill detcriorate to a point at which it becomes prohibitively expensive
amid technolonically difficult to treat it for potable water supply hy about thc year 2005. The
reductioti in w%ater qualin is attributed primarily to nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen compounds)
contained mainly in point source effluent inflows coming from domestic 1primarily IKunming) and
industrial (mainly phosphate ore processing factories) sources. Tne Ialke's talue for fishery and as a
tourist and recreational amenity can also be expected to decline.
A further conclusion from the model is that it will not be possible to bring the TP concentration in the
WVaihai below O.Omg/l (the Grade Ill standard for surface water for drinking water supply). Even
with the YEP interventions. future water qualitv will. at best. only recover to around its current
quality. This conclusion is based on the beneficial impacts of P removal alone: it may be anticipated
that with the combined impacts of all YEP interventions the prognosis for the future may be brighter.
Phosphorus is itself neither a hcalth hazard nor a direct problem for water supply. The problem fbr
the WVTWs fed from the Waihai is the clogging of filters by suspended solids in the lake wL-ter.
Dissolved organics from the algae may be a subsidiary problem giving ri,c to tri-lialo methane
FIAL DRAFT                         page 5.3 of 14                           GIS February 1996



Sction 5
(THM) when the water is chlorinated. The suspended solids comprise mainly algae. The large
quantities of algae result from the presence of nutrients in the water, of which phosphorus is believed
to be the most important. nitrogen the second. The target nutrient concentration required is that
which reduces the algal populations (or suspended solids) to a level which does not produce filter
clogging problems. It is not known from data derived from the Waihai precisely what this
concentration is. but there may be significant danger at TP concentrations in excess of about 03mg/I.
However. it is certain that reducing the nutrient concentration in the lake %%ill dccrease both algal
nlumbers and the difficulties and costs of w-ater treatment. To achieve this reduction. the STV and
IPC sub-projects must go ahead.
It should also be borne in mind that the problem with treating water heavily laden %%ith algae is not
unique to KIunming and such water is successfully treated elsewvhere in the wtorld using technology
different to that installed in the WTWs presently fed from the Waihai. It needs to be asked, therefore.
%licther the technology at these WTWVs is still appropriate (given the relati%ely recent and rapid
decline in Waihai water quality) for treating water of the present low quality and whether the
wzaterwsorks are being correctly operated.
If. however. the technology is appropriate and properly operated: and. as predicted by the water
quality model. the proposed wastewater treatment interventions will not lower the lakee P
concentration to a level which reduces algal populations below the nuisance threshold. then. the
%Vaihai could have to be abandoned as a source of water for potable supply and alternative good
quality water sources located and exploited. The cost of inter-basin transfers and the construction of
the Huangshiyan Reservoir within the catchment of the Songhuaba Rcsenoir. might. under these
circumstances, become more attractive and acceptable: as may the use of a greater proportion of the
Songhuaba Reservoir's storage capacity for water supply despite the implied increase in flood risk to
Kunming.
53 Classification or Impacts
Impacts may be classified orl the basis of their timinL duration and natuire. Impacts may occur during
ihe project constructinn phase and the operations phase. Construction impacts may bc temporary or
permanent and short-term or long-tcrm: operations phase impacts are aenerall pcnnanent and long-
term except nhere due to abnormal operating conditions (imecilanical failures or maintenance
periLds. Impacts can be ftiriher categorised b*ased oln the target impacted: suJi targets includc thosc

5.5 Project Impacts
5-5. Constnretion Phase Impacts
Since construction impacts result mainly frorn basic cnidnecring activities suchi as site clcarance.
levellint pile driving, building works. etc.. they are common to many different project components
and their impacts can be considered together as a m hole.

Impacts andM iaton Mesures
Common Construdion Phka Adverse Impacts:
a)    Perm anent Adierse Imparts
* Land acquisition and compensation to affected people (APs)
* Resettlement and compensation of APs
* Relocation of affected enterprises
* Destruction or disruption of the natural ecolo_y or communities it a sreen field site is to
be developed.
h     Teemporoay Adrerse Impacts
* Dust from earth works. etc.
* Noise and vibration
* Impaired access to temporarily project occupied land
* Disposal of spoil
* Groundwater impacts
* Potential traffic congestion and diversion during pipe layina especially during sewer and
water network installation
* Loss of eamings and/or trade during construction especialiv by shops during sewer and
water network instllation.
Principal Adrerse Construction Phrase Impacts
In addition to the impacts common to many projects listed above. the World Bank funded sub-
projects have the following specific potentially significant impacts.
a)     raFter and Seswage Xetirork Installaiton
* The disruption to traffic. pedestrians and businesses during the installation of wvater mains
and sez%ers in urban areas is the most significant adverse temporary impact during the
construction phase of the World Bank supported YEP sub-projeCts.
* l)amauc to. and disruption of underground sen-icc lines. existing mwater mains. smners.
telephone and clectricitv cable. is an avoidable but likely further adverse impact of
netrmorl installation.
h)    Ih, .16 Aque.tlitcr - Qi#king
IDisposal or. preferably. rcuse of thc spoil from tunnelling ancl the pipelinc trencl wvill
require careful consideration to mninimise impacts and maximise benefits. Re-usc for
tunnel lining, pipeline foundationibcddine and the constrnction of access roads is possible.
Specific plans need to be prepared detailing ho'u surplus excavation spoil will be dispcsed
of and how the pipeline route will be re-vegetated.
c)    S771-r aind 11771Js - runming. CJyinsg and (Cekie
. People affected by the project. resettlementL relocation and land acquisition are all
important impacts where significant land is required. This involves the preparation and
implementation of Resettlement Action Plans. The present evaluation of the social impacts
resultin= from project implementation is given in Table 5.4.

Impacts and Mitigation Measure
Operations phase impacts are not comnmon to all sub-projects. Each sub-project potentially has a
unique combination of impacts and mitigation options. These are discussed individuallv by sector.
IVater SupptrProjecis
The major environmental impacts related to the operations phase include:
* disposal of wastestaters (domestic sewvage and process backwash wlateri.
* disposal of process sludges from clarifiers and filters:
* use and handling of hazardous chemicals (chlorine, ozone and ferric chloride):
* noise from pumps and blowers.
Wlrt-ewater AManagement Projecrs
The major environmental impacts related to the operations phase include:
*   treatlent and disposal of screeninis. grit. sludges and odours from  treatment uorks and pumping
stations:
*   noise from  the STU's. principal lv from  the aeration system:
* impacts on the utater balance and water quality or the receiving wnater (thoueh these will be
substantially teduced than under the no-STW scenario):
* health hazards to ST' wvork force if health controls not properly implemented:
* impacts of abnormal final effluent discharges due to breakdo%nns or ntaintenance stoppages (again
less ihan the no-STW scenario):
* impact% on the STW due to crude effluent quality disrupting the treatment process caused by
illegal or accidental discharges to sewer otr watercourses.

continuing production and impacts of leachate on ground and surface waters, and continuing gas
emissions. These effluents require post-closure monitoring by the relevant authorities.
5.6 Mitigation Mleasures
Many of the adverse impacts of project implementation can be reduced or eliminated during the early
stages of planning bh careful site selection and choice of technologies. Prevention is better than cure.
I'o this cnd. particular atientioni has ben paid during V'EP-World Bank supported project prepration
to minimising the negative impacts of land acquisition and resettlement by careful consideration of
site locations for WTWVs and STNW's and solid waste landfills. These are the only projects whichi have
significant social impacts of this kiind.
In addition. a Resettiement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared which addresses the issues of
reettlernenm. relocation. land acquisition and compensation for lost land. property. crops amid incomc.
Tlhe RAP sets out the procedures ftor compensation amid resettlement and incorporates the existing
Chinese standards fo;r cormpensation payments. Implementation of this Plan -oiuld go far in reducing
the sowial costs and distress of involuntary resettlement.
Some adverse impacts are often unavoidable. in tthicli case the objective is to minimise the extent
and severity of the impact through the implementation of mitigation measures.  To ensure the
mitigation  mcasures identified and proposed in this Report for each project are carried out the
prop.osals should be incorporated in the contract documents along! with appropriate penalties for noni-
compliance  In addition. tic World Bank %xill seek such assurance from the Y'PG during negotiations
that it uill carrn otut or cause to be carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. the mitigation
plans specificd.
Mitigation nicasures for the main impacts identified by the EA process l;r all YEP-World Bank
fInded components arc listed in lable 5.6 on a project by project basis. Tabic 5.7 summarises the

SEC7rON 6                                                 REVIEW OFALTRATIVES
6. REVIEW OF ALTERNATIVES
6.1 Introduction
The Yunnan Environmental Project is an umbrella programme comprising 19 sub-projects which
together will begin to tack-le the w%orsening problems of environmental degradation being faced in
Yunnan. The YEP comprises two major hardware intervention categories: Water Resources
Management and Pollution ManagemenL The hardware interventions are supported by two software
components; Environmental Management and Monitoring. and Institutional Development and
Training.
This section discusses the consideration of alternatives in the development of the overall YEP and in
the selection and preparation of individual sub-projects.
The major logical and fundamental option or alternative for the Yunnan Government was the decision
to either "do nothing7 about the state of the environment, or to act and implement the necessary
hardwvare and software interventions to bring the rate of deterioration under control and hopefulty
achieve some degree of environmental restoration. The choice was made for action and the YEP is
the vehicle for that action.
6.2 The Selection of YEP Sub-projects
At the inception of the YEP. its objectives were defined and an initial list of sub-projects compiled
aimed at resolving various aspects of the major problems of environmental degradation in Yunnan.
After discussion and review. 19 sub-projects were selected for inclusion in the YEP. Some projects
were subsequently dropped from the list and others added. All the sub-projects are listed in Table 6.1.
Those to be funded by the World Bank are shown shaded.

Section 6
The scope of the YEP includes Kunming and the Dianchi Basin and the cities of Qujing and Gejiu and
the town of Dali and Lijiang. The bulk of the project funds was assigned to the Dianchi Basin where
environmental problems are most severe; Qujing and Gejiu remain in the YEP with waste and water
supply projects: Dali and Lijiang will have their projects funded by the Nordic Development Fund.
The initial ranking and selection process for inclusion under World Bank funding was based on the
criteria shown as assessment priority' in Table 6.2. These criteria are defined as follows:
* Objectire: that the sub-project will achieve the strategic objectives of the YEP and. where
relevant. those of the Dianchi Basin Action Plan. or the equivalent plans for Qujing and Gejiu.
* Lake: achieves the objective of cleaning up Lake Dianchi. or the Nanpanjiang. or Lakte Gejiu.
*  Implenieniation: ease with which the project can be implemented bv the agency responsible.
* raldue: that thc project represents good value for money. and is the least cost alternative.
* Ready: readiness of the project for design
* Bankatble: the project is acceptable to the World Bank and other Funding Agencies: this includes
the abilitv of the implementing agency to repay the loan.
In addition. priority is given to sub-projects that deal with the cause of the problem they address and
not the symptoms:-thev must not bs quick-fix solutions which are either effective only in the short-
term or. simply alter the problem, or, move the problem eisewhere.
Those sub-projects with the highest scorcs wer included for World Bank funding up to the point
wlhere the total cost of the selected projects exceeded the funding available. The World Bank
supported sub-projects have a base cost of Y2.500 million. distributed in all three project cities. Bank
funded projects focus particularly on pollution abatement through solid and liquid waste treatment.
reduction of pollution production by industries, and strengthening of regulatory institutions to
enhance pollution control and enfcrcement.
6.3 Sub-Project Alternatives
6.3.1 (;eneral
The majority of decisions "here alternative options are available concem proposed hardware
interventions. i.e. where construction is involved. The usorks proposed under YEP are sevwage
treatment 'uorks. nater treatment works, their associated networks. solid %%aste collection. transfer
and landfill sites. and IPC sub-projects.
For construction interventions, the following categories of alternative (options) u ere considered:
* .4pprou rtwre e/lhnology: appropriate for the taskl in hand. also appropriate for China in terms of
local availabilitv. sophistication. operations and maintenance support:
* Ch1ioice ofcapacinv: treatment capacity at WTWs and STWs particularly:
* Phasing of sub-projects: choice of order in which sub-projects will be implemented:
* Phasing of expansion within sub-projects: WTWs and STWs and their networks can be
progressively expanded as demand for their serices increases with population and economic
groiwth:
* Site selection: where alternative sites are available. and availability is often scarce. the choice is
for the least cost and minimal environmental and social impacts.
* Minin.isation of enrironmen:al imnpacts including LAR issues: usually resulting from site selection,
* Process options ivithin a wor*s: choice of degre of flexibility in plant operations. the ability to
bv-pass process when operating conditions permit. to reduce costs, or varying chemicals used.
* Mitirgation options: assessing and selecting the best means of mitigating adverse impacts.

6.32 Sewage Treatment Works and Sewerage Networks.
The decision concemring which basic wastewater tratment technologies to adopt for sewage
treatment. e.g. between oxidation ponds or conventional, intensive treatrnent sYstems. was made in
favour of the latter on the basis of the excessive land requirements and cost associated with ponds
designed for climatic conditions in the project cities.
Kwu1MINw
The two key factors to be compared were the number and location of STWs and the detailed selection
of processes. The location of tihe STWs had already been approxiimately fixed by the existing
Sewerage Master Plans. However, other potential locations were also identified and comparison
analyses carried out.
To a large extent, network layout has been determined by four factors:
* topography of the area:
* keeping trunk sewer construction to a minimum by designing Ihe network to flow to the trunk over
the least distance.
*the location of the receiving STW; and
* existing and proposed development.
Tnus comparison of network layouts was based more on utilising existing severs in the city centre or
in reticulated suburban industrial estates and in ensuring the most economical pipe size was used.
Citr Centre
Within the citv centre. the kle issue lay not so much w%ith the network arransement. but whether to
convert the existing combined sew%ers into a separate system. The municipal agencies are cager that a
separate svstem be constructed. This will ultimately reduce treatment costs as STW capacities can be
limited as they will only treat sewage flows and not river flows as thev do at present. The
construction of a separate sewer svstem also has advantages in that it reduces large sewer size and
should minimise pumping. especiallv in a region with large seasonal rainfall variations.
Process Sdection
The key selection factor "as to achieve the most cost effective method for phosphorus rernoval which
is of prime concern especially in the Dianchi Basin. Secondary factors include nitrogen. BODJCOD
and suspended solids remo al. The processes adopted are those believed to be the most suitable to
achieve the phosphorus objective without compromising the secondary objectives. In addition. the
selected processes have the advantage of being technologies already operating in China.
Sloidge disposal
De-atered sludge w%ill be disposed of to one of the landfill sites being de%eloped under YEP. The
alternative for agricultural use has not been pursued due to the lack of market potential and potential
difficulties with contamination.
QUJ,r.G
Site location: two alternative sites were considered for the ST%NW. In addition to the selected site. a
site further dowimsiream 'from Qujing close to the Nanpanjiang River was considered. This would
have had the advantage of permitting further development of Qujing towards the east. as shown in the
current master plan of Qujing for development beyond 201D. However, the land in that area is prime
agricultural land. It was also decided that the additional cost of the longer inlet sewer to the
alternative STW site could not be justified. There is scope for revising the Master Plan to avoid
further developmcnt beyond the selected STW site.
F IVAL DRAFT                         pge 6.4 of 8                    05 Febrary 1996



Review efAhradws
The selected site has been chosen as the site for treatment of all of Qujing's sewage. An alternative
of providing a second STW to serve the westemn development ares was also considered. A site vas
selected adjacent to the Baishi River at the eastern side of this area. After comparison of the
alternatives, it was decided to construct a pumping station instead of a second STw at this location so
that all the sewage could be treated at one location. The major benefits of this choice are that overall
construction and operating costs will be reduced. sewage treatment operations will be confined to
only one site and all treated sewage effluem will be discharged into the river downstream of Qujing.
Process options: several alternative sewage treannent processes were considered. Contact
stab:iisation ponds were ruled out because of the large area of land which they would require, the lack
of suitable waste land and the high cost of the agricultural land which would have been required.
Alternative designs of activated sludge processes were considered. A two-stage process was
preferred because a poorer initial eMuent standard could be pennitted prior to the imposition of more
stringent quality standards for the Nanpanjiang River. The first treatment stage alone would suffice
to meet this effluent standard. This would considerably reduce the cost of the initial STW
development
A two-stage activated sludge process was proposed, the first stage providing a very high rate process
with a short retention time and sludge age and the second stage comprising a triple ditch system in
which flow would be alternately reversed between thrce ditches. In this system. the two outer ditches
are provided with high rate surface aerators which are used when they are the first tank in the
sequence and also with automatically adjusted outlet weirs for use when they are the third tank in -he
sequence and oprate as settling tanks.
The suitability of the high rate activated sludge stage for independent use was questioned, particularly
because of the unstable naiure of the sludge which it would produce the difficulty of operating such
an intensive process and the higr. risk of the process being inhibited by industrial discharges.
Therefore, chemically-assisted primary sedimentation has been proposed as the most suitable method
of providing a low cost. reliable and easily operated treatmnent process in the short term.
Chemical assistance will no longer be used and activated sludge treatment w ill be added to meet the
future more stringent effluent standards which will be imposed when the Nanpanjiang River water
qualitv is improved.
GEJIU
The feasibility study for Gejiu considered four possible sites for the STn. Two of these were
alongside the lakee and two were next to the main road north of Gejiu.
Site location: due to the limited amount of land available around the lake for future development and
its consequent high value. it was fek that the lake side would not provide the lowest cost solutions.
Since sewage effluent would be discharged into the lake. it would need to be treated to a sufficiently
high standard for discharge into this enclosed water body, a requirement which would furthcr increase
both capital and operating costs
The two sites to the north of the town offered the advantages of lower land costs and lower final
effluent quality requirements. They also had the advantage that the northern part of the town, which
is outsidc the lake catchinrent aea, could also be drained to them by gravity. A potential disadvantage
of these sites is the !nss of water from the lake basin to the detriment of the water balance in the city.
Site No.1 is a steeply sloping site which would necessitate significant earthworks prior to
construction. Nevertheless, due to its closer proximity to Gejiu and the consequent reduced length of
inlet sewer required, it was selected in preference to Site No2.
Process options: differet sewage treatment processs were also considered. Two-starg activated
sludge treatment was selected by the local design institute in preference to two-stage submerged
biological reaction using aerated tanks containing fixed media. Both of these alternatives offered the

possibility of providing only the first stage of treatment in the initial phase of development
Howev, doubt remined concerning the effeaiveness of the first staoe of tratment on its own and
the difficulty of dealing with the unstable sludge which would be produced.
The alternative of chemically-assisted primary sedimentation. which would be simpler tD operate and
also have the advantage of being less vulnerable to industrial discharges, was also considered. The
alternative of single stage activated sludge treatment is currently under consideration in an attempt to
provide a lower cost full treatmnent solution thn the two-stage activated sludge treatnent process
which has been proposed.
63.3 Water Supply and Network
Kanmiag
WlWs caracitv: the required design expansion volume was determined to be between 120.000 and
170,000 m Iday and several alternative means to achieve this expansion were considered.
Option 1: Extend WVTWs Nos I and 4 on their existing sites by 7D.000 and 50.000 m31day
respectively. a total increase of 120.000 m3/day.
Option 2: Extend WTWs Nos I and 4 on their existing sites by  120,000 and 50.000 m3/day, an
increase of 170,000 m3/day.
Option 3: Extend WTWs Nos I on the existing site by 70,000 and construct a new works at
Beijiaochang with a capacity of 100,000 m3/day. an increase of 170,000 m3/dav. WTW No 4 remains
unchanged at an output of 50,000 m3lday. This site also allows a further expansion of 100.000
m3 /day.
The rationale for the preference for Option 3 over Option 2 was that WTW No 4 was too far from the
city's main supply area and from the larger ring mains. In addition. the elevation of WTW No 4 site
is too high for satisfactory supply from Songhuaba Rescvoir.
The treatment process: at the nwv works will be the same as at the other works supplied from
Songhuaba Reservoir since this technology is tried and tested and known to be suiable.
Network extension: no information on options available as yet.
New raw water mains: no alternatives were considered for the new mains from Songhuaba
Reservoir to the six existing Kunming YVTIVs.
QujJt
Water supply: in the citn is restricted both by limitations of the distribution system and the volume
of water available from the two existing supply reservoirs. Current demand grcatlv exceeds supply
and the capacity of the raw water sources. Two options were considered to resolve this situation.
Option 1: increase supply fronm the existing reservoirs. This was rejected on the basis of excessive
cost and the difficulty of repaying the loan due to the implied high tariff for cost recovery.
Option 2: construct an aqueduct and tunnel from the existing reservoir at Dlu Mu. This is the
favoured solution to the supply shortages as 120.000 m3/day can be assured from Do Mu for the long
termn.
The distribution system: is to be extended. but no details of layouts and designs are available.
63A Solid Waste Managemet
The solid waste generated in all three project cities has a high moisture content which makes it
unsuitable for incineration. It also has a high organic content which suggests that composing is a
viable disposal option.
FINAL DRAFT                         page 6.6 of8                     04 Febraary 1996

However, the almost world-wide failure of conposting schemes to fulfil their design expecaions
mitigates against this option. In addition. local experience suggests that there is no ready market for
compost. possibly because of access to synthetic fertiliser at artificially low prices, coupled with the
availability of night soil in many areas. Therefore, although composting is recommended in the
Feasibility Reports the DRA Consultant was opposed to the idea, and suggested the alternative of
digging out the matured waste after a period of a few years as is practised by small scale farmers and
gardeners. This is a more cost effective and praetical solution.
Asminng
Collection methods: decisions on the size, numbers and construction materials of bins are pending.
Transport: the use of tricycles and small andfor large trucks is still under review as is the suitability
of compactor trucks. Citv waste is sufficiently dense that the benefis of compaction are likely to be
minimal while the costs are very high.
The present use of small trucks in the city to take waste from the city to transfer stations is also
questioned. Small i icks are favoured because the roads are crowded; however, since these truck-s
operate at night this is not a supportable argument and larger (more economical) trucks should be
considerd.
Transfer stations: discussions on tde size. nunber, location and design of transfer stations continue.
Recentlyv problems have been experience when selected sites have been found not to be available for
sale. and local opposition to such sites expressed forcibly.
Landfill sites: a number of locations have been exanined and rejected on environmental. technical
(unsuitable geology) or cost. Several abandoned brick fields were assessed but because of their high
potential for residential or industrial developre.t the land acquisition costs were prohibitive.
Leachate treatment: two options were considered. to provide treatment in oxidation ponds or to
recycle the Ieachate back to the landfill to evaporate the excess fluid. The latter was adopted since
evaporation rates are high and precipitation generally low at the landfill sites.
Qluj lg
Colkection methods and transport: no information is available on the selection process for
collection and transport of %vaste.
Transfer stations: no infornation is available on the selection process for transfer stations.
Landfill sites: a location was required downwind of the ciy since problems from the existing
dumpsite. which lies upwind, have been experienced. A further consideration was to locate a site
which would equally serve both Qujing and the expanding satellite town of Zhanyi to the north and
have sufficient long-term capacity. Several sites w%ere examined but none were acceptable for reasons
similar to those in Kunming. The selected site has the required capacity. accessibility and location in
relation to Qujing and Zhanyi.
Leachate treatment: the same technology will be used as in Kunming for the same reasons.
63.5 Industrial Pollotion Control (IPC)
The IPC programnie aims at reducing the pollution load on Lake Dianchi with particular emphasis on
protecting the Waihai from further eutrophication resulting from phosphorus inputs. The KEPB list of
43 major industries in the Dianchi Basin was assessed in the review process. These industries were
ranked on the basis of their polluting effect using a modified Chinese Pollution Source Index (see
Annex BI of the Project Report) to identiftr the key industries for the funding of direct IPC
investnents or through the Yunnan Enviromnent Fund.
Selection of target industries: Because of the particular water quality problems of Lake Dianchi,
industries were ranked on the basis of the phosphorus load they dischuged to the Waihai On this

basis the Kunming Chemical Fertiliser Plant and the Kunyang Phosphate Feailiser Plant were
selected for process upgrading and wastewaer treatment. No other industries were included in the
direct World Bank funding.
Treatment system options within each target hctorv.
Options for treatment for phosphorus removal are limited. Both factories will adopt the same
technology of chemical precipitation which is stndard within the phosphate chemical industry as a
whole. No other options have been considered for phosphorus removal.
At Kunming Chemical Fertiliser Plnt, the removal of nitrogen will also be included because it too
plays a part in eutrophication. The existing system is based on a two-stage biological treatment
process with separate s.ages for nitrification and denitrification. Pilot studies will be conducted prior
to full development of nitrogen removal.

7. PUBUC PARTICIPATION
7.1 Introduction
7.1.1 The Purpose of Public Participation
The implementation of the Yunnan Environmental Project will greatly increase the sewage treatment
capacity of the project cities and improve the overall environmental conditions especially of lakes
Dianchi and Gejiu and the Nanpanjiang River in Qujing. Water supplies will be improved and made
more secure from shortages. Reduction in pollution resulting from imnproperly disposedsolid waste in
Kunmieng and Qujing will benefit public heath, amenity value and reduce pollution of land and water
resources. Similarly through the Industrial Pollution Control Sub-Project the effluent load discharged
to air. land and water will be greatly reduced to the benefit of the entire province.
Implcmentation of the many sub-projects wilL however, cause some adverse impacts on the
environment. Some impacts will be permanent these include land required for building purposes and
the resettlement of people who lose their land and homes due to project implementation. Other
impacts will be temporary during the construction phase;
The purpose for conducting surveys and dissemination exercises is to inform the public of the nature
of the project. to explain the reasons for implementation and describe the benefits and deficits of
implementation. Such exercises also give the public the opportunity to air their views, express their
support or opposition to the project and to suggest their ideas as to how the sub-projects can be
modified and improved to minimise the known negative impacts.
7.1.2 Methods of Public Participation
Public Participation activities were conducted during the prepaation of the project-specific EA
reports by local consultine organisations. This report summarises these activities and findings.
The main methods employed were:
* public forum and discussion meetings.
* site visits by YEP personnel. and
* distribution and analysis of questionnaires
Questionnaires were distributed in the project areas by two different methods:
I . YEP staff interceptinp people in the area and asking them to fill in the question form on the spot
2. Copies of the forms were provided to community leaders who were made responsible for their
distribution, collection and rturn to YEP.
Public Participatioui activities were conducted at two levels:
I. general public participation
2. specialist participation
General public participation: involves discussions with non-government organisations (NGOs),
democratic panics, mass orgpnisations (scientific and other associations for example), and those
people or communities directly affected by Lhe proposed developments;
Specialist participation: is undertaken to resolve specific and more complex issues arising from the
sub-projcts.
7.13 Organisation of Public Participation
All components ofthe YEP have been commented on by local experts through EIA meetings and by a
techniques group which was formed by the relevant EEA consultants to provide comments on the

technical format and implementation of the surveys. Opinions were solicited from the Provincial
Peoples' Congess, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties and mass
organisauons as indicated in Figure 7.1. The full list of YEP sub-projects, the frequency of meetings
and the numbers of questionnaires distributed and retumed are summarised in Table 7.1. Examples of
the questionnaires are given in Tables 7.2 and 7.3.
In addition to the general public meetings and specialist participants the surveys ensured peoples from
all walks of life. ages, professions and literacy levels were involved.
Response to the public meetings and especially to the questionnaires was good. For the various sub-
projects within the YEP response rates to the questionnaires ranged from 67 to 100%. The rates for
Bank supported projects averaged 85% representing 1.246 respondents from 1.468 questionnairs
issued. Full details are given in Table 7.1.

The results summarised in Table 7A generally show a high degree of awareness and concem for the
environmental problems and issues covered by the surveys. Water quality deterioration and water
resource shortages in the Dianchi Basin are the main public concern. The use of Lake Dianchi as a
source of drinking water is not approved by 80% of the respondents and only 60% are satisfied with
the current water supply and quality. 91% support the greater use of Songhuaba reservoir for potable
water supply; it is unclear if they appreciate the increased risk of flooding associated with this
suggestion.
The public appear to have a broad understanding of the problems lilely to be caused by
implementation of the YEP (often from hearing about the impacts and mitigation measures associated
with other projects i.e. resettlement of people in the Songhuaba and Caishitan reservoir developments
especially). Land acquisition compensation issues, resettlement are all known and accepted features
and consequences of the project.
Support is not confined to those who will only benefit from project implementation; support is also
expressed by those who will acalyl be resettled or otherwise 'disadvantaged'; personal sacrifice for
the good of the majority appears to be prevalent among those likely to be affected. The improvement
of the quality of life, promotion of the socal and economic development of the project cities takes
first priority over personal concerns. However. some aspects have less support and raise grer
concerns than others resettlement and land acquisition are the prime examples.
Knowledge and support of the resettlement issue are less than for other aspects of project
implementation. 90% of the people stated that they did not know the policies relating to resettlement
and only 60% said they would obey the 'order' to relocated if the situation arose. The need for further
public dissemination concerning the policies, regulations and methods of resetlement would seem to
have a high priority. Similarly public agreement with land acquisition is at a lower level (76%)
indicating some weakness in the methods of implementation.
The on-going preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan and the Resettlement Information Book-let
will go a long way to mitigating this present lack of public awareness of the compensation issues
involved with LAR.
The topic receiving the least support (5We) is the introduction of a sewerage charge; no questions
appear to have been asked concerning the proposed water tariff.
7.3.1 Public Response questions and suggestions
a)   Many respondents felt that since the project was so important. especially the components
addressing water quality and supply issues that further public awareness dissemination should
take place to reach a wider audience, thereby gaining greater support for the project.
b)   Concern was expressed about dust, noise and public inconvenience during the construction
period and mitigation through better management was proposed.
c)   Secondary pollution caused by improper solid waste disposal was raised as an issue; most
people agreed to support a domestic refuse chage and suggested a levy of under 1.6 Yuan per
month.

8.    LAD ADCQUISTION AND RESETTLEMENT (LAR)
LI Introductfon
This section addresses the socialiy adverse impacts of YEP implementation with particular reference
to land acquisition, resentlement and relocation of APs. It also sets out the framework for mitigating
these impacts through compensation schemes. Procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of LAR
mitigation measures to ensure proper and timely payments of compensation are outlined. The
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the Resettlement Information Booklet being prepared under the
YEP are briefly described.
Involuntary resettlement which often. but not always, accompanies land acquisition is a complex
issue. Lost income sources such as farmiland, forests, pastures, and other production resources, must
be replaced, or equally productive alternative assets provided. if affected people are to reconstruct
their lives and economic productivity.
Most of the Feasibility Studies prepared for the YEP included some analysis of land acquisition and
possible resettlement, as part of the identification of project options. Wthilst the selection between
options was mainly based on technical and economic criteria, the potential impact on affected persons
was considered in some cases where practical site alternatives were available. For example, the
Kunming Water Supply and Solid Waste projects have endeavoured to select sites further from
concentrated populations that minimise disruption to communities. Minimisation of LAR impacts is
the preferred option to mitigation.
With the exception of the Institutional Development and Training (IDT) comnponent, all World Bankc
funded sub-projects have some land acquisition and&or resettlement impacts. None of these impacts
are considered to be substantial but all are open to mitigation.
Of the overall YEP sub-projects only the Xiyuan If intervention on the Tanglangchuan River, which
includes three medium size reservoirs, will there be substantial LAR. lree villages will be inundated
and 1.500 people resettled; this sub-project is not included in World Bank funding. Relocation
impacts for the 16 sub-project components being proposed for Vorld Bank funding are minimal -
around 21 people. This estimate may be revised, in either direction. as project preparation continues;
however. the final estimate is not expected to differ significantly from the figure quoted.
8.2 Project Impacts
Impacts of resettlement affect both the people who are involuntarily resettled and also those living in
the area to which they are relocated.  In the receiving area. population density and pressure on
natural. economic and social resources will risc. The practice in China of reallocating land within the
village or community. a forn of internal resettlemenL may not produce such adverse effect but a
regulation minimum area of land per capita is stipulated. if by internal resettlement, per capita land
area falls below this level (0.5 mu, 0.33 ha) then the relocated persons will be offered job and
residential opportunities in urban areas.
The anticipated LAR impacts caused by the implementation of the of the 16 YEP World Bank sub-
projects are summarised in Table 8.1.
8.3 Project Census Survey
Implementation of the 16 sub-projects will require land acquisition. together with rehabilitation
and/or resettlement of the people affected. In order to determine the extent of the impacts of project
components on affected people and property each project implementing agency has, or will conduct a
census survey of affected persons and properties and to collect basic socio-economic data. The
census work commenced in July 1995 and is continuing as project preparation defines sites and scope
mor- clearly.

d)   Two water supply issues were raised:
*    guarantee ofsuply, water supplies should be made moe reliable
    water tariff, most respondents stated that they agreed with the water charge and
expressed their ability to pay twice the current price; they suggest the govemnment
should fully consider the ability of the people to pay. and to set water prices for
industrial, agricultural and domestic users.
e)   The gratest concern with the implementation of the YEP as a whole was exprcssed over the
Xiyuan Phase 11 sub-project since this involves substantial land acquisition, compensation, and
resettlement of 375 households (1,2e5 people). Most of the people who would be resettled
involuntarily disagree with and are unsatisfied with the "Resettlement Plan for Phase 1I
Engineering7 and hope to see it revised according to their many comments and suggestions.
f)   The overall environmental and social impacts of Xiyuan 11 are far gter than the combined
impacts of all the other sub-projects under YEP. Xiyuan 11 is not included in World Bank
funding
g)   The overall YEP will requisition 588 ha of land (240 ha high yield farmiand); most of this is
for the Xiyuan 11 sub-projecL

Preliminary survey results are summarised as follows:
* The total area of land required permanently is estimated to be 225 hectres.
* 100 hectares will be required termporarily,
* At least 5 houses with an area of approximately 0.12 hectares will need relocation
* The total number of APs affected by LA will be around 3.400.
* 70 workers and 4 firms will be affected, and the fifns relocated (some of these are offices of the
client agency-. i.e. the WTW.
Socio-economic data are being collected. An independent monitoring study was carried out in
December 1995 on three sites where land had already been acquired. Recommendations are being
implemented to bring the compensation and resettlement packages up to agreed YEP policy
standards. A Rapid Rural Survey is being unoertakcn to assess the impact of land acquisition on
ethnic minority nationalities.
Studies on LAR elsewhere in China do highlight the need to pay adequate compensation levels and to
makle timely provision for new jobs to minimise the adverse impacts and inconvenience for APs.
Before each sub-project contract is initiated an appointed institution will conduct detailed socio-
economic surveys to establish the 'before-project' baseline conditions relating to income levels and
sandards of living. These data are necessary to assess the effectiveness of LAR mitigation and
compensation iterventions and to ensure the basic objective of LAR policv that "the stan&rdr of
living and income levels of all cxegories of affected persons are improved. or ar least restored, after
land acquisition and resettlemenit" is achieved.'
As part of YEP preparation two key documents are being produced to improve the quality and
effectiveness of LAR implementation in Yunnan. These documents are:
I The Resetdement Action Plan (RAP): this Plan is a stipulation of the World Bank and its
preparation is required before appraisal of any sub-projetL It describes the framework for
implementing the land acquisition and resettlement programme within the context of existing
Chinese law. details compensation strategies and levels. and job creation activities. The procedures
for redmessal of grievances and appeals are also descriSed in the RAP. To ensure proper
implementation of the LAR as described in the RAP detailed monitoring and evaluation
methodologies are defined which include both internal and external (independent) monitoring:
with reporting to the local government and the World Bank.
2. A Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB): this will be distributed to all project affected
persons and their local reprcsentative within 2 months of completion of project negotiations by the
World Bank. The RIB will contain the following information or description:
Part 1.
* A description of the YEP and its overall LAR impacts.
* The overall strategy for the LAR.
* List the specific resettlement entitlement of all categories of APs,
* Identify the agencies and institutions responsible for delivervy of these entitlements,
* The implementation schedule for the LAR.
* Describe the detailed procedures for redressal of grievances for APs.
Ofricial compensation rates have not been increased for a very long time and no longer reflet real market
price- and are far below what is actally being paid; unless these rates are rvised the main objective of this
policy will not be fiilflled. The speed and uncerainty of payments reaching the APs is also of oncenL

Part 2.
Will desribe the resettlement entitlements and compensation anounts payable to project affected
households in detail.
In addition, a notice of LAR will be given to each affected household after a project is approved by
the World Bank. The borrowing agencies. assisted by local government, will inforn affected
households about the project, the proposed rsettlement and the specific entitlements of each affected
household.
To facilitate the dissemination of this information and the RPB. and to resolve grievances, each
borrower agency will be required to locate a field offce, easily accessible to the affected persons,
within the affected area.
8.4 Monitoring and Evaluation
In order to ensure that the implementation of the LAR progran is carried out in accordance with the
provisions of the RAP, detailed monitoring and evaluation, both internal and external. will be carried
out. both during and after project implementation.
84.1 Internal Monitoring
Each implementing agency will be responsible for inernal monitoring of the LAR program and
monitoring activities with YEPO co-ordinating. The YEP RAP Unit's Monitoring Group will be
responsible for conducting rcgular internal monitoring of the LAR program. Monitoring will be
carried out according to the procedures described in the RAP.
The intemal monitoring reports will be prepared every three months. Preliminary monitoring formats
are being prepa-ed and will be provided as an Annex to the RAP. The internal monitoring report will
be submitted to the World Bank every six months. starting the second half 1996. The report will be
discussed in the next meeting of the RAP Leading Group at Provincial and Municipals levels. This
group will also be responsible for recommending detailed follow-up measures.
Monitoriaz Indicators
The main indicators which should be regularly monitored are:
* Payment of statutory compensation to the affected people and enterprises in a timely manner
according to the levels of compensation described in the RAP.
* Allotment of housing in accordance with the options expressed by the affected persons. The
number of people allotted housing on a given date will be recorded. The distance of the nev
housing from old, and. photographs of all affected houses and structures will be taken and kept in
the project files of each affected household.
* Restoration of the public facilities and infrastructure affected by the project,
* Payment of old age pension to eligible persons and other appropriate special measures for their
economic rehabilitation,
* Payment of self employment subsidy for those taking this option,
* Restoration of production and business activities for those permanently and temporarily affected
by land acquisition.
* Timely selection of relocation sites for enterprises,
*   mely payment of salary compensation to worker's in affected enterprises.
* rnely payment of cornpensation for net losses due to stoppage of production due to relocation or
temporay disruption.

Staff Resourcesfor interuananonisorlng
The staff of YEPO's RAP Unit's Monitoring Group will be responsible for co-ordinating thc iternal
monitoring activities. They will collect information in the given fbrmats every three months from
KEPO. QEPO. GEPO. From implementing agencies. concemed townships and District Govermments,
and also the Land Administration and Labour Departments A data base will maintained of
resettlement monitoring information in YEPOQ which will be successively updated every three
months. The Land Administration and Labour Departments of the respective to.mship and district
govemments will assist in the process of data collection and analysis.
Reporting of Monioring
Monitoring reports will be submitted to the World Bank and the following agencies:
a) The leading and coordination group of YEP,
b) Thc director in charge of YEP,
c) Yunnan Province Land Administration Bureau,
d) Yunnan Province Labour Bureau.
e) Vice Governor in charge of the Provincial Leading Group on RAP.
n Three Vice Ma;kors in charge of 3 Municipal Leading groups on RAP.
Internal monitoring reports will be discussed and evaluated by the responsible implementing agencies
in each project city before submission to YEPO. Based on the progress in land acquisition and
resetlement activities. the Leading Groups on RAP at Provincial and Municipal levels will take
whatever steps are necessary to address potential areas of slow or inadequate LAR implemmtation.
In addition to monitoring by YEPO, the Land Administration and Labour Departments will also
regularly monitor the performance of their respective agencies regarding proper implementation of
the LAR agreements signed with these agencies.
8A.2 Exterral Monitoring and Evalustion
An independent aeency. the Research Institute of Foreign Capital Utilisation. Southwest
Communication University of Jiatong. Chengdu, will be contracted to conduct extenal monitoring
and evaluation of the LAR program. In addition to verifying the results of the internal monitoring
reports, this institute will monitor the qualitative indicators listed below. In order to measure the
standards of living after resettlement. this institute will conduct another socio-economnic survey of the
resettled persons 6 to 12 months after sub-project completion.
The methodology for carrying out external monitoring and evaluation is described in the RAP. The
selected external monitoring institute will maintain a data base with files on each affected household,
those will be updated regularly with information collected in successive rounds of monitoring. The
Monitoring and Evaluation Report will be prepared by this institute every six months, starting in the
second half of 1996. until construction of all sub-projects is completed.
The report should then be discussed in the next 3 monthly mecting of the Provincial and Municipal
Leading Groups and specific follow-up measures initiated. The report will review the adequacy of
implenentation measures and report on the perceptions and degree of satisfaction of the affected
persons with LAR.implementation. It will also identify critical issues in implementation and make
recommendations to improve ovemil effectiveness of the reettement program. The report will also
report progress of follow-up activities initiated by the YEPOLeading Group and the implemring
agencies on the recommendations ofthe previous monitoring reports.

9.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
9.1 Introduction                                       %
Halting and reversing environmental degradation and pollution are priority concerns in the PRC and
Yunnan Province. In order to address these concerns direct reference must be made to the way in
which the economy works. Urban environmental management strategy will be effective only if link-ed
to the urban economy: an economic-cum-environmental policy must be devised and implemented
which inextricably binds these two aspects of sustainable development together.  Economic
development too often puts the environment under pressure thereby makling both long term economic
and environmental development unsustainable.
Effective environmental management endeavours to understand the origin. nature and consequencc.
of the environmental pressure exened bv economic development; and with understanding implement
management strategies which blend the needs of economic and social development v th
environmental requirements. The overall aim is to manage the economv and the environment as a
single unit to produce mutually compatible and sustainable benefits. To achieve this aim the
economic-cum-environmental management system will use the 'interest' generated by the
environment rather than, as at present exploit its capital resources. To develop an economy that lives
on its income and not on its capital.
9.2 Institutional Aspects
9.2.1 Provincial Environmental Protection
The Yunnan Environmental Protection Bureau (YEPB) under the jurisdiction of the Provincial
Government is the administrative authoritv in charge of environmental protection of the whole
Province. The administrative structure of the agencies involved in environmental monitoring in
Yunnan are illustrated in Figure 9.1.
The Bureau's multipurpose role and responsibilities are assigned to it under the Chinese National Law
on Environmental Protection and the Yunnan Environmental Protection Regulations. Its role in
environmental manargement includes accepting job responsibilities for environmental management
cstablishing quantitative monitoring parameters for the urban environment to ensure its
comprehensive managemenL establishing licences and enforcing their rezulation for waste disposal.
setting up a system to manage pollution within set time frames. establishing and monitoring w%aste
disposal methods. charging fees for w aste disposal and the evaluation of environmental impacts of
construction projects. Generally these responsibilities are contracted out to the Monitoring Stations
vL ho report back to the EPB.
In the event that monitorinst reveals breaches of the pollution regulations the EPB is empowered to
impose fines on the polluter or refer the matter to the Yunnan Plannine Commission. Fines are
imposed on the basis of non-compliance with set Government standards: wlhere a more appropriate
method would be based on the annual pollution load dischiarged. In practice fewv if any fines are
collected since monitoring intensity is too low and infrequent to catch intermittent iliegal discharges.
The YEPB includes under its jurisdiction a number of other bodies including the Yunnan Institute of
Environment Science, the Yunnan Provincial Monitoring Centre, the Yunnan Provincial Centre of
Propaganda and Education for Environmental Protection. and the Yunnan Provincial Centre for
Research and Endangered Plant Species Breeding. There is an existing environmental monitoring
network with 85 monitoring stations emploring 1.806 staff.
In the YEP area environmental monitoring is also carried out by the Kunming (Municipal)
Environmental Monitoring Centre (KEMC). the Qujing (District) Environmental Monitoring Centre
(QEMC). Qujing (Municipal) Environmental Monitoring Station (QEMS) and Gejiu (Municipal)
Environmental Monitoring Station (GEMS). The Kunming Water Company also carries out

92.2 Existing Policies and Legislation
The Provincial Government has issued a document called "The Environment Protection Goals and
Tasks of the Present Government Term (1993 to 199Sf This document establishes responsibilities.
goals. and tasks to be resolved which have been devolved to all government departments and will be
co-ordinated by the leaders of those organisations.
The overall goals of this policy docunment are to further restrain environmental pollution trends.
improve the environmental quality in the cities, towns and rural areas. restrain development in the
region so that it is both in harmony with the environment and sustainable in the long term and to lay
the foundations for future development.
The provincial government intends to approve only those forms of developmemn which have a long
term sustainable future. and which also meet the requirements of the socialist mark-et economy
system. There will be a strengthening of management and supervision of environment protection
which will include the development of increasing public awareness at all levels of society.
Recent preparations for the Ninth Five-Year Plan have revised some provisions for environmental
protection at provincial level with regards to the original -1722 Projects'. These changes include:
 -total load controlF: the basis for control has been alieted from an eriphasis on concentrationi of
pollutants discharged to air and watet to an annual total permitted load to avoid the problem or
industries using additional uater resources to dilute their effluents to meet the required
conceltration standard.
* individual uater bodies, for example. will have specific annual Lotal loads of Lke paramcters sCI b:
the YEPR. This allowable load will then be allocated among the polluting induistries.
'I'hc load allocated for each %ater body wsill be determined on thc environmental capacitn of that
bods to absorb the allow,ed load of each lkey parameter.
. a ncw L.3S3 Project. updating the previous '1722 Project'. will be introduced in Y'unmani. this
cl nsistes of four objectives -
I  100 major polluting industries within Y'unnan will be identificd and treated to redtice lheir
environmental impacts.
2. a refers to the addtional construction of sevage L-eatment capacitv b; 300.000 mn Id.
3. 3 refers to the protection of three major river systems. the Nanpanjiang (integrated water
pollution control). Lancangjiang and the Honghe River (ecological rehabilitation).
4. E refers tc the cleaning and protection of eight plateau lakes: Dianchi. Jilu. N-iion-

9.23 Specific Goals
Some kley areas have been targeted for specific management measures and all YEP Bank funded sub-
projects fall within its rem;-. Specifically, projects relating to water qualitv improvements in the
Dianchi Basin and Lakle Gejiu (STP and 1PC) and the Nanpanjiang catchment. Bank funded projects
are expected to improve conditions in the cities of Kunming. Qujing. Gejiu. to slow down or reverse
the deterioration in environmental conditions of w%ater and air resources.
Specific targets are set for the quantities of industrial wastewater. the degree of treatrnent of
municipal sewvage. the quality of potable water sources, the atmospheric environment in eight cities
that fall below grade Ill of the Chinese national standard. the treatment and reuse of industrial solid
' aste. the increase of forest cover. and the control of soil erosion. The set targets are often described
in terms of a percentage reduction in pollution parameter concentrations. u-here targets for absolute
load reductions u%ould be more appropriate.
To achievc thesc specific goals. it will be necessarv to:
* to further develop the capabiliti to administer complex development programs vhich may have
significant environmental impacts:
* improve the existing institutions capability to effectively monitor environmental conditions
before, during and after project implementation.
Provided that this is taken into account during the feasibility study stage of project developmenL it
should be possible to:
* strengthen the environmental management capability;
* develop an environmental management information system:
* introducc an effective spatial analysis system: for which GIS a good tool:
* establish a project component related environmental monitoring system. administered by the EPB
and:
* expand the environmental training programme currently run by the YEPB.
9.3 Environmental Management
I-.nmironmental protection in China has developed rapidly as the economy has expanded over the last
t"o decades. In Y unnan. the People's Govemment has committed itself to the environment and
requires all levels of government and administrations. commissions. offices and bureaux to give
em ironmental protection top priority in furthering economic development. The provincial policv can
be summarised as follows: it pravicek a sustainable settingfor tie Iong'er tern, economic aed social
d/ereloamnem of )nputan P.-orince. uwhile providinig a conipetitiirefamcir'irkfi1r induistrial groirth:
Iotever. clianges to the managemcnt of the economy will have to be made for this policy to be
implemented and prove beneficial to the environment and the traditional desire for harmonv with the
environment" re-established.
Changing the way an economy vworVs' is fundamental if the associated society is to move touards a
state of "environmental sustainabilitv-. Applying remedial measures to resolve an existing
envimnmental problem may be vital in the short term. but might be compromised in the long term. if
the urban economic causes of the problem are not minimised or eliminated. Moreover. remedial
measures must be accompanied by preventive measures in order to ensure that the environment can
cope with the remaining pressures place upon it. both presently and in the future'as populations and
cconomies continue to expand. In Yunnan today, also in China as a whole. w%e are witnessing a clear
case of an economy under threat because of the pressure and. ess p=ced on the environment by that
same economv.

Earhv rxWMaagemewi audMoeuoriag
An economy under threat is as important a problem as an environment undee threaL  People's
livelihoods are at risk. A win-win solution, which promotes both economy and environment is
urgently needed so that physical works (hardware) programmes, policy (software) interventions. and
changes in industrial. commercial and agricultural practices lead to more -sustainabIe forms or
production. In addition. equitable alHcation of resourcs needs to be improved, resource conflicts
reduced and employment and income generation opportunities increased. These are the main
objectives of sound environmental management.
9.4 Environmental Action Plans
9.4.1 The Goal of Sustainable Development
The goal of an action plan is sustainable development firmly linking development and environmental
objectives and achieving a cleaner environmen, wealth creation and social equity. This can be
difficult. and. as mentioned above, often requires changes to the way societv and the economy work.
In Yunnan. as elseu-here in China, resources have been undervalued, and prices do not reflect
scarcity. Environmental a%vareness among political leaders goernment officials and the public needs
to be raised. lie action plan should guide the economy towards more sustainable development and
recommend policy changes addressing the underlying causes of degradation.
9.4.2 The Challenge of the Twin Objectives
In order to achieve the tvin objectives of socio-economic advancement and sound environmental
management in the pursuit of ambitious economic development strategies for Kunming. Qujiog and
Gejiu. the separate Action Plans for these Municipalities must be complementary and fully integrated
into economic development policies and initiatives. They must encourage individuals, firms and
public institutions to benefit from positive responses to the environmental challenge. An effective
approach depends upon the support of thDse who actually implement the necessary changes this
approach is characteristicallv from the 'bottom' upwards. Technical upgrading. restructuring. product
improvement and increasing food production mak-e sound commercial sense.
Action to integrate environmental objectives into their activities is needed across all sectors and
instilLions. Industries which cannot afford to protect the environmenL cannot bc allowed to operate.
except in the  crv short-term. The right industries should be encouraged to develop in the right
places: industries depending on large wvater supplies are inappropriate in vater scarce areas.
Fundamental to the action plan is the development of the institutional capacity to design and
implincnt cni ronmcntal policies. regulations and investment programmes which are flexible and
capable of responding to the challenges ortile future. Without powerful and effective institutions. thc
narious plans. proerammes and projects will fail to achieve the desired impact.
9.4.3 Sector Plans
Within the Action Plans for longer term planning needs it will be necessarv to prepare sector
programmes and projects covering the kie sectors of:
* ;water resources and flood control:
* urban infrastructure services (WTIVs. STs + netw-orks + solid waste management etc.):
* industrial pollution control:
* rural environment.
The issues of physical planning, institutional strengthening. finance. socio-economy (including re-
settlement). monitoring. public awareness. etc. should then be addressed under the heading of
enviran:cizial management. The integation of the sector plans into an overall structure plan for the
three Municipalities is fundamental to thc success of their individual Action Plans.

As a first step Action Plans have been prepared as follows:
* Dianchi Basin Environmental Action Plan (DEAP)
* Qujing Environmental Action Plan (QEAP)
* Gejiu Environmental Action Plan (GEAP)
* Yunnan Environniental Monitorine Plan (YENMP)
9.5 Monitoring
9.5.1 The Existing Situttion
One important and unfortunate feature of tnc ex-;ting monitoring programmes is that they are geared
towards satisfying administrative objectives: the! are driven and guided bv procedures and not by
problems. Their goal is to fulfil reporting objectives and not to identif' and solve environmental
problems. A change to a problem oriented approach is fundamental to effective future monitoring.
The following summarv is based on the preliminary findings of CANREDE as recorded in the W'orld
Banks AM04 Annex 3:
* Staff at the monitoring centres are wvell educated and appear eager to take on new responsibilities
associated with upgraded facilities:
a There is significant duplication and redundancy in the monitoring responsibilities carried out by
various levels of monitoring stations:
* Due to the large number of monitoring stations in thc province. government funding has been
insufficient to adequately fund all of these stations. %%ith the result that most of the monitoring
stations are not well equipped. and many cannot meet their mandated responsibilities:
* Productivity and efficiency appear to be low. Very little analytical ".ork -was observed being
performed during visits to most of the centres:
* Tle major cities in Yunnan that perfomi the bulk of routine environmeintal monitoring do not have
adequate sampling cquipment, analytical instrumcnts. or vehicles to conduct their uork:
* Funding to the monitoring centres has not been sulTicient to allon  cxransionI of the monitoring
program to keep pace with industrial and urban growth. to alloe  dcxlopment of analytical
methods and procedures. to conduct research in priority areas, and tm" provide staff training
essential to stay current withl modern procedures and analytical requiremen:s:
* Although thc National Environmental lProtection Admiiiistration (NEPA i has idciltificd a "black
list" of priority organic pollutants. most of these compounds cannot be monitored because of the
deficiencv in analytical instruments to detect these compoLnds. and tbe la.:k of a national mandate
to monitor and report on the occurrence of these compounds:
* Access to data is limited. with little apparent sharing of data with agencies outsidc the Yunnan
environmental monitoring network. leading to further redundancy in monitoring and data
collection. and there appears to be no comparison of similar data collected by various agencies:
* The work load and responsibilities that city monitoring stations are assigned are not reflected in
their position in the monitoring netvork hierarchy or in their funding levels:
* Most centres are either under equipped with computer capabilities or have no computer facilities at
all. Most centres that do have computers are faced with problems such as inadequate disk space.
insufficicnt memory and inadequate CPU speeds to utilise modem programs and operating
systems:

Ea*eambomlManagaea u dM.nimft.
* Most centres do not have modem capabilities and associated softwar  limiting the ability to
communicate electronically with central stations; and
* Many centres do not have adequate office facilities. such as fax machines, copiers or good quality
printers, limiting reporting and communications capabilities.
One further observation mav be made: the several universities in Yunnan do not appear to be involved
in environmental monitoring to any large extent. yet they represent an existing source of expertise
which, through post-graduate research programmes. could contribute substantially to the areas of
monitoring which require the problem solving approach. For example. the provision of funds to
support research on specific water quality issues in Songhuaba Reservoir and Lake Dianchi would
greatly improve our understanding of these invaluable water resources. This research work would be
supplemental to the 'routine' monitoring carried out by the Monitoring Centres and Stations.
9.52 Existing Monitoring Programmes and Schedules for YEP Cities
The present monitoring progammes in the three project cities are summarised in Tables 92.3 and 4.
This table represents the mandated requirements for monitoring: what monitoring actualiv takes place
is less than required because of financial, man-power and technical resource limitations as noted
above.

9;..3 The Role or Monitoring
While manacement aims to provide the software and infrastructure required for sustainabic economic
and environmental development - monitoring provides essential data (information) to management
and this forms the basis for rational decision and policy making. The quality and quantity of data
collected. analysed and reported is important and greatly influences the success and effectiveness of
management. The recent CANREDE report summarised in AM04 states "Ther is considerable
opportunity for improving the focus and effectiveness of mon.toring programmes and responsibilities.
and to improve the quality, value and utility of data obtained from the monitoring programmer.
Strengthening of the existina monitoring stations and programmes is an integral part of the
Institutional Development and Training component of the YEP.
Two levels or typcs of monitoring are of concern (a) monitoring of project performance and (b)
monitoring of the environment: each is considered separately below.
9.5.4 Project Performance Monitoring
All development projects are designed to have measurable benefits. To assess the effectiveness of
implementation a means of measuring the extent to which the project has achieved its stated aims and

9.5.8 Sampling Programme for ev-aluation of impacts of project interventions on Lake Dinchi
Based on experience gained during the sampling programmes conducted by DRA consultants with
staff from the Kunming Nionitoring Centre Station it is unlikely that one team would be able to
sample more than four sample sites in one work day within one river valley. or one river valley at any
one time.
Since there are 9 major catchments which drain into Lake Dianchi. not counting the smaller
catchments on west mountain or the sub divisions of the major rivers. one overall sample site per
river would still require a sizeable investment in human resources (one team wvorkling 108 days
page 913 of 15                           05 February 1996



Section 9
assuming a monthly sampling frequency and an zverage of one sample per team-n retrieved per eight
hours of work). This represents an annual total of 108 samples requirine analyscs for up to 27
parameters i.e. a total of neariv 3000 analyses.
This is only a very basic requirement for river water quality monitorine to satisfy the needs of the
YEP. It is likely that within each of the major river vallev there will be a need to sample at more than
one site to retlect the changing conditions in the channel above and below major pollution points.
Siticc it should be possible to collect such samples during the same 108 days time frame. the
iniplications are that up to 132 samples.could be collected per year assuming a monthly sampling
frequency. for which I  000 sample analyses would be required.
Lake Dianehi
In addition there is a need to conduct more frequent and more representative samples of Dianchi Lake
nater qualitv.  Based on the existing 11 sampling site locations sampled in one day using a
moderately fast boaL a twice monthly sa2rpling programme would require one team working 24 days
a year collecting a total of 264 samples requiring a total of nearly 1000 analyses per year.
77te Kumning Aleniharin,, Centre (KIC)
The fact that it has been recognised in the CANREDE Needs Assessment and Upgrading Plan that the
current laboratory facilities are under-utilised would suggest that the major limitation will not be the

outlined in the above para"raphs.

It should be noted that on the basis of the initial results ichieved for critical zone monitoring sites.
sites can be dropped. added or modified to better quantify the upstream-dowvnstream limits, and hence
the impacts ol' kev. non-point or multiple point pollution sources. The more monitoring sites that
have established staye discharge relationships. the less time intensive imill become the sampling
programme. since vclocitv-area discharge measures 'ill not be necessarv for the majority of samples.
A  nbhjective of the monitoring pro_ramme is to develop a better understanding of the linkages
betucen the level or loadina of pollutants into the Dianchi lakes w-ater contributing bodies and the
impacts on the various ecosystems. Clearly the impacts and linkaees wili show variations from river
'ialle% to river valley hased on the characteristics of the water bodics. their flow. volume and the
ranec and typc of agricultural. urban and industrial activities inventoried for each catchment.
riw *nater quality problems to be addresscd by the programme should be defined in terms of
icasurable stream variables or attributes. The main objective of the programme is to detect changes
diie tlo prroject interventions compared to changes associated with natural *ariability. It is therefore
important in programme planning to select key variables at representative sites that are expected to
respond to management decisions. Selection of variables involves a sorting process based on the
propramme objectives and considering the realistic constraints of monitoring.
The development of the monitoring programme includes compilation of existing information and
collection of data from field reconnaissance to focus the scope of the programme. These factors
*should be included throughout the development of the programme. It is beyond the scope of the
current environmental evaluation to define more precisely the programme requirements beyond those
normallv associated with monitoring the performance of the project components. The exact nature of
the monitoring prOgramme to determine the environmental benefits of the proposed interventions
should obviously be based on an extension of the existing mandatory data collection programme
conducted by the Kunming Monitoring Centre as described in the preceding paragraphs. The
extension to this programme will require further discussion with the monitorinQ centres to form the
basis for a Dianchi Basin environmental monitoring programme linkled to the equipment requirements
outlined in the needs assessment and upgrading report.
