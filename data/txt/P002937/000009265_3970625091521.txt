MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPCED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A
FORESTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.          The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Uganda for SDR 10.0 million (US$13.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
and help finance a Forestry Rehabilitation Project.   Cofinancing of the
project would be provided by EEC (US$7.0 million), DANIDA (US$7.5 million),
UNDP (US$2.2 million) and CARE (US$0.2 million).
2.          Background.  Agriculture in Uganda, including crops, livestock,
forestry and fisheries, which provides sustenance to 14.7 million people,
is the source of income to over 90% of the population and accounts for 582
of GDP and 99% of exports, mostly from coffee. Seventy percent of the land
area is cultivable with 72 of dry land area in forest reserves; there is a
long tradition of smallholder farming and the country is largely self suf-
ficient in food. Formal forest development and management has been under-
way in the natural forest, and in the peri-urban areas of Uganda since the
establishment of the Forestry Department (FD) in 1898.  Over 10,500 ha of
peri-urban hardwoods were established for poles and fuelwood prior to the
1930s and the first formal working plans for systematic forest management
were introduced about the same time.  During the 1960s, and early 1970s,
Uganda earned a reputation for dynamism and excellence for its tropical
high forest management system. Visitation to the natural forests became a
thriving tourist business that earned over US$20 million in foreign ex-
change during this period. Except for a brief period in the early 1980s,
Uganda has experienced 15 years of political instability. Since the 1970s,
the management capability and budgetary support available to the ED have
declined sharply. toss of control of the forest estate by the FD has been
followed by uncontrolled illegal charcoal production and pitsawing in the
natural forest. Managed extraction and sawmilling of wood virtually closed
down during this period. The sawmilling industry is currently operating at
15% of it's 1970 capacity.   If measures are not taken immediately to
reverse this situation, the major energy source, fuelwood, will become
increasingly scarce and crop residue and animal dung burning will increase
with negative impact on agricultural productivity and on the natural rain
forests which contain many unique plant and animal genetic resources. The
impending move (July 1, 1987) of the FD from the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry to the Ministry of Environment will ensure that the forestry
sector receives strong support to manage Uganda's forest resources on a
long-term environmentally sound and sustainable basis.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed credit aims to help the Govern-
ment of Uganda to improve the management of its forest resources to meet
domestic needs for timber, fuelwood and other forest products on a long-
term sustainable basis, while at the same time increasing the area and
improving the management of protected forests. The project would rehabili-
tate and strengthen the FD to achieve the above objectives through a com-
bination of tighter administration and control of forest harvesting opera-
tions, intensified natural forest and plantation management and increased
support to rural forestry.
.,:.

4.        Project Description.  The project would, during seven years,
support:   (1) pert-urban plantations and pilot wood farms:  direct estab-
lishment of 900 ha of eucalyptus plantations for demonstration purposes;
provision of seedlings for establishment by prtvate farmers of 1,000 ha for
production of fuelwood and poles on a pilot basis;  (ii) farm forestry:
establishment of nurseries in rural areas for production of 27 million
seedlings annually by year 6 of multipurpose species to be Planted by
farmers and non-government agencies; extension, farmer's training and agro-
forestry demonstration; (Wi) natural forest management rehabilitation:
redemarcation of 1,350 kms of forest boundaries, encroachment and enrich-
ment planting of 26,000 ha, extension for improved charcoal production,
umproved logging management and revenue collection, management and biomass
inventory for selected natural high forest and plantation areas, expansion
and protection of nature conservation areas from 5% to 20% of natural
forest area plus introduction of restrictions on logging coupled with
intensified forest management over 40% of the natural forest area; (iv)
sofwoodplantationrehabiltation:  rehabilitation of 13,900 ha of soft-
wood plantations and re-establishment of fire-protection systems; (v) re-
habilitation and strengthening of the FD:   rehabilitation of offices and
accommodation, provision of transport and forestry equipment for supervi-
sion of forest activities, technical assistance for planning, procurement
and financial management, and studies on timber marketing; and (vi) train-
ing: rehabilitation of Nyabyeya Forest College, rehabilitation of Nakawa
sawmill and limited study tours. The total cost of the project Is estimat-
ed at US$33.3 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$21.7 million (65%).   A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown
in Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as
well as the disbursement schedule, are given in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Uganda are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.   A map,  IBRD No.
20050, is also attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6427-UG, dated
May 27, 1987, is being distributed separately.
5.         Rationale for IDA Involvement:  This project would support IDA's
country assistance strategy for Uganda by contributing to economic recovery
through rehabilitation of the forest resource base to promote the recovery
of wood industries and to expand fuelwood availability.   In line with our
agricultural and energy sector strategies, the Forestry Project addresses
the problems of deteriorating fuelwood availability and increasing forest
degradation.    It  includes  an environmental  conservation  component--an
aspect increasingly recognized by the Association as key to successful for-
estry development.  The Association will play a catalytic role in mobiliz-
ing cofinancing and coordinating donor assistance to the forestry sector.
6.           Agreed Actions.   Before credit effectiveness, Government has
agreed to complete the following actions:  (a) establish a project account
in local currency and a special account in foreign currency in a commercial
bank; (b) reorganize the Forest Department and finalize staffing plan; (c)
execute cofinancing agreements with respect to cofinanciers; (d) establish
a project coordinating committee; and (e) formally reinstate forest guards
in the staff establishment.   During negotiations,  Government assurances
were obtained that:   (a) counterpart staff for planning, procurement and
financial management acceptable to IDA would be provided; (b) an annual
work plan would be prepared and execution of the project would be carried



out with due regard to ecological and environmental factors consistent with
Government policy on Forest Resource Management; (c) royalty rates would be
increased for Class 1 hardwoods to 15%, for Class 2 hardwoods and cypress
to 10% and for Class 3 hardwoods and softwoods to 7% of the retail selling
price by becember 31, 1988; (d) the existing forestry legislation would be
amended by June 30, 1988, to reflect the revised Policy Statement agreed
during negotiations; and (e) all measures necessary would be taken by Sept-
ember 30, 1988, to ensure that forest harvesting licenses issued include
provision for the use of logging and milling equipment in conformity with
sound forest measurement practices.
7.        Justification.  The main benefit would be the re-establishment of
a sound lnstitutional organization for managing Uganda's forest resources
in an ecologically sound way, while at the same time ensuring production of
wood products to meet the countries' needs.   The area of natural forest
identified and managed as nature reserves would increase from 5% to 20%
during the project period with an additional 30% managed as protective
"buffer zone" with only limited pitsawing permitted.   Logging activities
would Improve through development of working plans for areas to be logged,
stockmapping and tighter control of logging operations.   On the supply
side, production of wood products would be increased, and the need to cut
timber in the natural forests reduced, through wood farming in urban areas
and farm forestry in rural areas (for fuelwood and poles) and through soft-
wood plantations (for timber).   The economic return for the project is
estimated at about  15%.   Other important benefits, but not quantified,
include sustained and increased agricultural productivity by avoiding the
need to burn crop residues and animal dung and via the shelterbelt effect
of farm trees.  It would reduce time spent by women in collection of fire-
wood.  Time saved would yield social benefits through increased time avail-
able  for  child  care,  household  tasks  and economic activities,  through
improved crop cultivation resulting in higher yields.
8.        Risks.  The major risks are:  delay in project implementation due
to a weakened FD, lack of donor coordination, and failure of the Government
to allot forest revenues to meet requirements to sustain project activities
beyond  the project period.   The project would minimize  these risks by
strengthening the FD through provision of equipment, operating costs, hous-
ing, technical assistance and in-service training and by establishing pro-
ject coordination and monitoring arrangements.   It would also secure sub-
stantial increases in forestry revenues above incremental operating costs
that would help the Government to meet its obligation to sustain project
activities.   Security is not a major risk as the planting activities are
not located in areas experiencing extensive civil war.
9.          Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and reconmend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
