"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall objective of the Forestry\n            Rehabilitation Project is to improve management of\n            Uganda's forest resources to meet domestic needs for\n            timber, fuelwood and other wood products on a sustained\n            basis, while at the same time increasing the area and\n            improving the management of conservation forests in order to\n            protect unique ecological systems.  To that end, the project\n            provides for (i) peri-urban plantations and pilot wood\n            farms; (ii) farm forestry; and (iii) natural forest\n            management and rehabilitation.  Furthermore, the project\n            involves (iv) softwood plantation rehabilitation; (v)\n            rehabilitation of the Forestry Department; and (vi)\n            training.  Benefits from the project include increased\n            production of (i) fuelwood and poles in both peri-urban and\n            rural areas; and (ii) timber from both natural forests and\n            softwood plantations.  The project will also result in\n            fodder and fruit in rural areas; protection of unique flora\n            and fauna in natural forests; conservation of the forest\n            resource base; protection of the environment; more efficient\n            utilization of wood; and easier access to wood production\n            for consumers."}, "docdt": "1987-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
