To that end, the project\n            provides for (i) peri-urban plantations and pilot wood\n            farms; (ii) farm forestry; and (iii) natural forest\n            management and rehabilitation.  Furthermore, the project\n            involves (iv) softwood plantation rehabilitation; (v)\n            rehabilitation of the Forestry Department; and (vi)\n            training.  Benefits from the project include increased\n            production of (i) fuelwood and poles in both peri-urban and\n            rural areas; and (ii) timber from both natural forests and\n            softwood plantations.  The project will also result in\n            fodder and fruit in rural areas; protection of unique flora\n            and fauna in natural forests; conservation of the forest\n            resource base; protection of the environment; more efficient\n            utilization of wood; and easier access to wood production\n            for consumers."}, "docdt": "1987-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
