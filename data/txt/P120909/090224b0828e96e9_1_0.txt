Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Project Development Objective is to: (a) contribute to improved food security of rural households in selected poor villages in upland areas in the
 Project Provinces by demonstrating and implementing improved rice-based farming systems, and (b) address recovery needs of cyclone-affected
 households in the Xekong, Saravane and Attapeu provinces.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project Development Objective is on track to be achieved. The risk of achieving the PDO is moderate and it is related largely on external weather
 related factors during 2014 WS. The implementation of the project activities has been generally timely and within the budget. The project remains highly
 relevant in light of continued government focus on improving the food security in upland areas and developing of country’s rice sector. The production of
 good quality seed and support for extension services has a central role in the latter.
 The impact of LUFSIP goes beyond the PDO’s achievement. Being an emergency operation, the project has helped to recover assets of people hit by
 Ketsana, established implementation systems in MAF and strengthened farmers’ capacity to respond to future food price spikes or to achieve more
 stable production volumes which may help to smooth local food price volatility. As a result of the project, the participating farmers received the
 knowledge about benefits of improved seeds or better quality traditional seeds, and adopted them increasingly. Seed farmers have acquired
 multiplication techniques and they can quickly scale up R3 seed production when demand arises. Most LUFSIP villages can now produce their own
 seeds, which is equivalent in quality to seed produced by NAFRI seed stations. For remote villages, locally produced seed remains the only source of
 good seeds. As a result of upgrading and strengthening the NAFRI seed stations and establishment of the National rice gene bank, the production of R1
 and R2 seeds can respond much faster to higher demand than three years ago. The DAFO extension staff has been learning new ways to disseminate
 information and knowledge to farmers and have started to acknowledge the merits of demand-driven services. LUFSIP has been among the first
 projects that used the new extension structures established by the Lao Extension for Agriculture Project (LEAP) for implementation of field activities.
 The acquired experience and knowledge positions the project beneficiaries to respond better to crisis situations.
 The PDO indicator is to increase in rice yields in beneficiary farmer groups by twenty percent (20 percent) compared to the baseline. According to the
 2013 WS benchmarking survey, average paddy yields of farmers who participated in seed multiplication and extension activities were 4.5 tons/ha
 compared to 3.3 tons/ha of 2010 baseline (36 percent increase). When compared to average yield from farmers who are still producing seeds since
 2010 the increase was 25 percent. Rice production of participating farmers in seed producer groups increased from 102,682 tons in 2010 to 121,900
 tons in 2013 or 19 percent, which exceeds the target of 15 percent. As of March 2014, total of 3,279 farmers have been engaged in extension activities
 against the end-of-project target of 2,000 farmers. The 2013 WS benchmarking survey shows that about 90 percent farmers who received seed
 multiplication and extension advisory services have continued to apply the introduced techniques as of 2013 WS compared to target of 25 percent.
 The project implementation progress remains satisfactory. The key achievements include: (i) establishment of institutional mechanisms for better
 delivery of services to target farmers; (ii) continued progress in improving the quality of seed multiplication activities and relevance of extension activities
 to farmers; (iii) completion of the Ketsana recovery activities, especially rehabilitation and construction of irrigation infrastructure, which has restored and
 improved livelihoods for more than 2,000 people; and (iv) completion of agriculture sub-projects under which have contributed to improved livelihoods of
 622 target communities.
