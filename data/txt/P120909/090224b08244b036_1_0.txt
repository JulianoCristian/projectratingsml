                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress toward achieving the PDO remains satisfactory. The project has contributed to improving food security of rural households by improving rice-based farming, including
                         increasing the rice yield from 3.28 tons/ha at the beginning of the project to 4.47 tons/ha in the 2013 wet season which represents a 36% increase compared to the end-of-project
                         target of a 20% increase. The latest field visits in Sephone district, Savannakhet Province in November 2013 showed average rice yield increases of up to 60% due to the switch

                         from traditional varieties to improved varieties along with proper fertilizer applications and farming practices. Extension activities reached 1732 households compared to the target of
                         2,000. More than 560 extension points were established against target of 200. Production of incremental annual volumes of quality seed has increased from 456 tons at the
                         beginning of the project to 993 tons now, exceeding the end-of-project target of 576 tons. In addition, the project has addressed recovery needs of cyclone-affected households. It
                         distributed 300 tons of rice seed to 8,754 households in 318 villages in the affected provinces and 497,124 small animals to 3,088 households in 224 villages over 14 districts and 3
                         provinces. It completed 105 sub-projects which rehabilitated the damaged assets, at a total cost of US$ 3.3 million. This includes 42 agriculture (irrigation) sub-projects (1,637 ha of
                         irrigation rehabilitation and 1,478 new irrigated areas); 29 public works sub-projects (100 km of roads rehabilitated), 31 health sub-projects and 3 education sub-projects. In addition,
                         the project supported 193 agriculture related sub-projects that benefited about 103,550 persons, of which 49,145 are women in 17 districts and 5 provinces.
