                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Under component 1, the project has contributed to improving food security by carrying out renovations of buildings and equipping 5rice multiplication and research centers which will
                         contribute towards increased quality and availability of R1 and R2 seedproduction. Under component 2, the project has multiplied 115 tons of R3 seed during 2011 wet season and
                         additional 53 tons of R3during 2011/12 dry season. Under component 3, 105 sub-projects to improve rural infrastructure have been carried out inagriculture, access roads, potable

                         season. The project has assisted over 2000cyclone-affected households by providing approximately 300 tons of improved seed distributed among 318 villages and by
                         vaccinatingvillage livestock. Distribution of small livestock is ongoing and should be completed by September 2012. Under the community-ledKetsana recovery component, more than
                         2000 households have had their pre-Ketsana production levels restored through rehabilitationof irrigation schemes, access roads, schools and health clinics.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         There is a need to modify or scale down/up some activities in order to better align the project with the Government’s emerging short-to-medium term priorities for the development of
                         the rice sector such and aligning the project more closely with the priority areas of the evolving rice sector strategy.
