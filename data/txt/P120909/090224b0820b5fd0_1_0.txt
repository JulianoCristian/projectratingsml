                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has completed restructuring which included clarification of some indicators and targets. The focus of the reminding of the project is to generate significant positive impact
                         on the livelihoods of beneficiary farmers by building on investments which were undertaken during the earlier years of the project.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
