Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The Project Development Objective is to: (a) contribute to improved food security of rural households in selected poor villages in upland areas in the
 Project Provinces by demonstrating and implementing improved rice-based farming systems, and (b) address recovery needs of cyclone-affected
 households in the Xekong, Saravane and Attapeu provinces.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project will close on December 31, 2014 as planned. The PDO was largely achieved. The final draft project impact evaluation report, which was
 received on December 12, showed that the average rice yield of the beneficiary farmer groups increased by 17 percent by 2014 wet season compared
 to the 2010 baseline, which falls marginally short of the end-of-project target of 20 percent. The recovery needs of the cyclone Ketsana affected
 households were largely met. The key project outcomes are the following:

 1.       The average paddy yield of farmers (684 in total), who participated in R3 seed multiplication and local seed purification, increased by 25
          percent in the 2014 wet season (WS) compared to the 2010 baseline.
 2.       The average paddy yields of farmers (3,000 in total), who participated in extension activities, increased by 15 percent.
 3.       The weighted average end-of-project rice yield increase of the above two beneficiary farmer groups was 17 percent.
 Other key achievements include:
 4.       About 3,000 farmers participated in extension activities and 684 farmers engaged in seed multiplication and purification activities. The final
          impact evaluation survey shows that although farmers participating in extension activities succeeded to increase their rice yields by only 15
          percent between 2010 and 2014, they fared much better than non-participants from the same villages, whose average yield remained largely
          unchanged in the 2014 WS compared to the 2010 baseline.
 5.       Cyclone Ketsana-affected households’ livelihood recovery needs through provision of inputs and small animals were met, albeit with some
          delays.
 6.       Project fully rehabilitated the irrigation and other rural infrastructure damaged by Ketsana.
 7.       The project has strengthened farmers’ capacity to respond to future food price spikes or to achieve more stable production volumes, which
          may help to smooth local food price volatility through training farmers in seed production techniques and introduction of new technologies and
          farming practices.
 8.       As a result of upgrading and strengthening NAFRI’s seed stations, production of R1 and R2 seeds can respond faster to higher demand than
          three years ago.
 9.       Rehabilitation of the National Seed Gene Bank enables country to preserve its diverse rice seed genera material for the plant breeding
          purposes.
 10.      The project remains highly relevant in light of continued government focus on improving the food security in upland areas and developing
          country’s rice sector. The production of good quality seed and support for extension services have a central role in the latter.

               Largely achieved. The indicator is measured in metric tons per hectare. The increase was 17%, falling marginally short of the planned 20%
               increase. The beneficiary farmer groups include farmers participated in (i) seed multiplication and purification, and (ii) extension activities.
               The average yield increase of the first group was 25%, and the second group was 15%.
               The actual (previous) value reported the average yield of only farmers who participated in seed groups, which is higher than the weighted-
               average yield for seed and extension farmers, which should have been reported. The actual (current) value is the weighted-average for both
               farm groups.

               Achieved, exceeding the original target by 15%. Incremental seed production from 2010 to 2014 was 138 tons
               compared to the target of 120 tons.
               The actual (previous) value was wrongly calculated as it showed total, not incremental production. The actual (current)
               value shows the correct number.

               Achieved, exceeding the original target value by 10% points. The average paddy yield of farmers engaged in R3 seed multiplication
               increased by 23%, and the average yield of farmers engaged in seed purification increased by 26%.

               beans and Stylo (fodder crop) and the rotation systems; (ii) R3 seed multiplication; (iii) local seed purification; (iv) R3 seeds with and without
               fertilizers; (v) local rice seeds with and without fertilizers; (vi) sustainable rice intensification; and (vii) broadcasting.

               collaborative projects included: (i) seed broadcasting in Luang Namtha, involving NAFRI and DAFOs; (ii) seed
               quality control involving NAFRI and DOA; (iii) coordination of R1&R2 seed production with the demand for R3; (iv)
               promotion of conservation agriculture technologies, including intercropping of upland rice with Muang bean and Stylo
               (fodder crop) and rotation system technology, involving NAFRI and DAEC.
