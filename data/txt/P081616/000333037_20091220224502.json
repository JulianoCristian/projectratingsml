services in targeted cities, rayon\n            centers and rural areas and support adoption of a strategic\n            framework for an efficient payment system infrastructure.\n            The major changes include: (i) reformulated project\n            development objectives (PDO), outcome and component\n            indicators and targets to more closely measure the outcomes\n            of the original and restructured project expected by the\n            closing date; and (ii) reduction of the scope of the\n            component two and alignment of its description with changes\n            during implementation. The minor changes include: (a)\n            reallocation of credit proceeds between disbursements\n            categories to meet the project needs; (b) revised project\n            financing and costs to reflect changes during\n            implementation; and (c) a revised disbursement schedule to\n            reflect the initial implementation delays and the recently\n            extended implementation period. Expected outcomes include:\n            (1) increased efficient access to financial services in\n            targeted cities, rayon centers and rural areas; and (2)\n            adoption of a strategic framework for an efficient payment\n            system infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2009-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
