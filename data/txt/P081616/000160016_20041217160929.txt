A.      STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1.      Country and Sector Issues

In the second half of the 199Os, Azerbaijan launched a comprehensive and successful
stabilization program that has resulted in a strong recovery with a cumulative growth rate
o f over 40 percent. Despite these advances, poverty in Azerbaijan has remained
widespread.    The poverty is especially serious in smaller urban and rural areas. The
Bank's Poverty Assessment prepared in 2001 indicated that almost 50 percent of the
population (including about one million refkgees or internally displaced people) lived in
poverty, consuming less thanUSD25.8 equivalent per capita per month.

Since 2000, the strong growth trend has continued. In 2002, real GDP expanded by 10.6
percent reflecting both sound policy environment and high oil prices. In2003, there was
11.2 percent real growth, due to highoil prices andsignificant growth ofinvestmentsinthe
oil and gas sectors, combined with an increasingly good economic performance in other
sectors. Azerbaijan i s now facing a period o f great opportunity and challenge. The GDP
growth, boosted by oil revenues, is expected to continue for the next 20 years. This
window of opportunity must be used to build the country's capacity to develop the
privately run non-oil sectors and to compete in the regional and global markets, which
would provide a reasonable foundation to maintain a strong economy beyond the end of
the oil boom.

Itis especially important to ensure that the disadvantaged parts o fsociety, i.e. the poor, the
rural and the underdeveloped regions get a fair chance to benefit from these opportunities.
Inorder to take advantage of such opportunities, a number ofissues relatedto the general
lack o f access and the lack of infrastructure needed for economy and market development
needs to be addressed. The key issues identified in a number of private sector surveys
include shallow financial markets and lack of access to financial services and credit,
problems with electricity supply and access to other utilities, and poor business
infrastructure andweak institutions resulting ina highcost o f doingbusiness, especially in
rural areas.

Lack of Access to Financial Services. The banking sector, with 45 licensedbanks andtotal
assets o f about USD1.l billion as o f end 2003, i s the most developed segment o f the
financial system. The sector is small, even by the standards o f transition economies, and
with significant structuralproblems'. The sector is strongly dominatedbythe International
Bank o f Azerbaijan (IBA), a state-owned bank that accounts for about 55 percent of total
bankingsystem assets. IBA's business interests are concentrated inthe oil sector and large
state-owned enterprises. Formal limits to the entry o f foreign banks applied untillate 2003,
so there are, as yet, no international banks. There i s also a large number o f so-called
"pocket banks" - assets o f the smaller 26 banks average about USD4 million and o f the
smallest ten USD2.3 million. A banking system with such a structure is not effective in
supporting growth o f a market economy.

Banks have not been interested or active in the provision o f financial services to the
economy at large, especially to the poor and SMEs, and in rural areas, which is clearly
indicated by financial ratios, such as credit to the private sector or deposit mobilization as
percentages o f GDP. The penetration rate i s extremely low, with only about 70 bank
branches active in the non-Baku area. In2003, the ratio o f population to bank branches
was about 39,000 in Baku and about 71,000 in urban centers except Baku. None o f the
villages and most o f the country's smaller municipalities do not have access to formal
financial services. The payment systems operated by the NBA do not reach remote parts
o f the country. Social security payments in rural areas are handled by the postal system
andmanual deliveries are the norm. Access to credit inrural areas is provided mainlyby
donor-funded micro-finance institutions (MFIs). At the end o f 2003, the total micro-credit
portfolio was less then USDlO million. Attempts are under way to stimulate the creation
o f credit cooperatives.

The lack o f access to financial services for the SMEs and the poor, especially in rural
areas, i s a key challenge for asset accumulation, security, job creation, poverty reduction
and rural development. Inability to collect on utility bill payments has also resulted in
problems with electricity, water and other utilities in areas underserved by the financial
system (as discussed below). A platform for the provision o f access to payment and other
financial services is one o f the key prerequisites for the development o f banking and
financial markets, with an impact on regional development and for stimulating savings,
credit and growth inrural areas.

Incomplete Payment System Infrastructure. Another prerequisite for the development of
financial services and o f regional economies and markets is the completion o f the national
payment system architecture, operated by the National Bank o f Azerbaijan (NBA) to allow
for effective coverage o f the entire territory o f the country and effective payment risk
management. The national payment system infkastructure was initiated under the Bank's
Institution Building Technical Assistance (IBTA) project, with a large value payment
system (MIPS) installed in 2001. It continued under the Financial Sector Technical


' InAzerbaijan, banking system assets as of end2003 amounted to about 17percent of GDP. Intransition
economies in central Europe, banlung system assets typically amount to 30-40 percent of GDP. In EU
accessioncountries, the percentage is about 60-75. InEUcountries, it is about three times the GDP.

Assistance (FSTA) project, where two other major components were developed: a small
valueibulk payment and settlement system (BCSS) that became operational in late 2002
and a Card Processing Center (CPC) that will be completed in late 2004. While the key
elements o f the payment system architecture are already there, some additional modules
are needed to integrate the system and create an efficient and comprehensive functional
architecture that ensures technical and legal consistency and meets the international
standards for systemically important payment systems.

Inadequate Utility Services. Access to utility services, especially electricity, figures
prominently in all private sector surveys as one o f the key issues preventing private sector
development. Conversely, utilities seem to be in a perpetual financial crisis triggered by
low collections, low tariffs and lack ofmaintenance. Collection rates are generally poor; at
best 30-40 percent o f billed amounts are actually collected from customers and even that
with considerable delays. In rural areas, the capacity to collect on utility payments is
seriously limited and the situation i s even worse. Due to the lack o f funds, maintenance
has been largely neglected. As a consequence, service quality and reliability has dropped
sharply. There seems to be a vicious circle, where deteriorating service makes consumers
reluctant to pay the bills andwhere, inturn, the lack o f tariff revenue prevents maintenance
and causes service to deteriorate still further.      One o f the important prerequisites to
improve the quality and reliability of utility services, especially in rural areas, is to
improve the capacity for effective and timely collection o f utilitybills.

2.      Rationale for Bank Involvement

The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the 2003-05 period comprises three
inter-related prongs with the key objective o f supporting the Government's State Program
on Poverty Reduction and Development (SPPRED) implementation. The three prongs
include: (i) assistance to improve management o f the oil windfall; (ii)      support for job
creation and non-oil sector growth, especially in rural areas; and (iii)     improving social
services and infrastructure.     Based on past experience, the Bank's CAS priorities in
Azerbaijan focus on areas inwhich the Bank is deemed to be able to have the most impact,
takinginto account the activities o fAzerbaijan's other externalpartnersanddonors.

This operation will be one o f the vehicles insupport o f the second and third prongs o f the
CAS, that is, the private sector development and non-oil sector growth in rural areas and
the improvement o f social services delivery channels. The objectives o f this project also
addresses one o f the key issues identified by the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), which i s the lack o f access to financial services in rural areas. In addition, the
project aims to provide for basic business infrastructure needs, such as telephones, fax, e-
Mail and Internet.       The Bank has an advantage in building the financial sector
infrastructure, especially because the key infrastructure component under the proposed
project will provide continuity to the project work initiated under the (very successful)
Financial Sector Technical Assistance (FSTA) project. The availability o f such financial
sector infrastructure will also facilitate public sector reforms. Other intemational financial
institutions and donors are encouraging the Bank to go forward with the project, since it
would create an enabling environment for their planned projects and activities.

3.      HigherLevelObjectivesto Which the ProjectContributes

Azerbaijan's PRSP, known as the "State                  Program on Poverty Reduction and
Development" (SPPRED), envisages the following basic objectives: (a) maintenance o f
macroeconomic stability,        improvements in the business environment (including
governance and anti-corruption), and sustainable and balanced growth, outside the oil
sector and the Baku area; (b) strengthening o f the social safety net, notably through
reforms o f the pension system and targeted social assistance; (c) buildingthe infrastructure
necessary for a market economy or reversing deterioration in infrastructure, including
energy sector reforms; and (d) strengthening o f the institutional framework for poverty
reduction, including measures aimed at eliminating corruption and improvingtransparency
and access to information. The project will directly contribute to the successful realization
o f the SPPRED by creating tools to facilitate provision o f financial services and access to
basic business related infrastructure inrural areas.

B.      PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.      LendingInstrument

This project will be supported by an International Development Association (IDA) credit
extended under standards terms. The total project cost is estimated at about USD 17.75
million2, including physical and price contingency.            The proposed IDA credit is USD
12.25 million equivalent.

2.      ProgramObjective

The program objective is to assist the Government to implement the Poverty Reduction
Strategy (SPPRED) and facilitate development and growth by improving access to
financial services and by making basic business infrastructure available in smaller urban
and rural areas. It will also assist with implementation o f the 2004-2006 National Strategy
for the Payment System and complete the payment system architecture to allow the
geographical integration andthe introduction o fmodern electronic payment instruments on
the whole territory o f the country.        Better financial infrastructure and access will also
facilitate other Government reforms, such as taxes, pensions and social assistance. Once
implemented, this platform will be able to provide, without any additional investments,
services known as "e-government"            to citizens and businesses in the whole country,
including rural areas.

(i)    A componentfor the Azeri Post, the national postal operator, to create the financial
       service capacity in rural areas that are presently underserved or not served by
       Azerbaijan's banking system and for delivering government services.            The
       institution building program supported under the project includes operational


                                             5

        management, accounting, financial and risk management, operational functions,
        marketing and enlargedproduct and services infrastructure.

        o The interconnectivity o f the Azeri Post system (with currently about 1200post
            offices) will be accomplished by employing a satellite-based interconnectivity
            platform supported bythe project.

(ii)    A component for the NBA, to finalize the development o f the National Payment
        System Architecture, including the introduction o f electronic payment services and
        management o f payment risks, interface with the large billing systems o f utility
        companies and integration o f rural areas (including the capacity to use electronic
        payment instruments and card-systems).

(iii)  A project management component, to allocate efficiently and supervise use o f
        project finds.

The following are more detailed descriptions o f project components. Further details are
provided inAnnex 4.

Component 1:Azeri Post Platform. The project will significantly improve institutional
and service capacity o f Azeri Post, the national postal operator, focusing on its capacity to
provide access to financial services.       The type o f financial and business management
capacity andthe level o f IT support o f the "new'.' Azeri Post will be comparable to that o f a
small bankproviding simple depository services. Once the business h c t i o n s and systems
are modernized and the branch network is interconnected, the new services would include:
(i) financial services, including electronic payments (e.g., pensions, social security,
remittances) and collections (e.g. o f utility bills, taxes), deposits (sight and time deposits),
selling o f other savings products, upgrading the money order and transfer systems, issuing
debit cards (backed by customer deposits), etc.; (ii)     electronic-based government services,
such as issuance o f various certificates and business and personal documents by the local
and central Government, payment of taxes, fees and other dues to the central and local
government authorities, etc; and (iii) electronic-based business services, such as electronic-
commerce, cyber-post and e-Mail address, Internet access, access to information, as well as
to electronic markets (known as B2B and B2C portals). It i s expected that the new Azeri
Post platform will be deployed inphases.

(i)     The first phase will include building the service and data processing and
        management capacity for all new functions and services at Azeri Post headquarters.

(ii)    The second phase will extend the new services and functions to 40 regional offices
        that are already interconnected via an optical fiber network. This phase will also
        serve for pilot testing o f new h c t i o n s and services inthe regions and to help plan
        and build a large-scale deployment capacity.              It will include defining and
        developing capacity for training, technical assistance and maintenance needed for
        deployment to local post offices.




                                                  6

(iii) The third phase comprises the installation of the interconnectivity hub at
         headquarters and the deployment o f the new technology, functions and services to
         about 200 local post offices.      This is a pilot phase for the future deployment
         envisaged.

(W       Thefourth andJ;fth phase will each include interconnectivity o f an additional 500
         local post offices and the deployment o f new.technology, functions and services.
         At the end o f the fourth phase, the platform will include 700 points-of-service in
         local post offices. At the end o f the fifth phase, the platform will include all 1,200
         currently existing local post offices.

The total estimated cost o f the Azeri Post component i s USD15.81 million, o f which
USD3.26 million for headquarters, USD0.64 million for regional offices (already
connected by optical fiber) and USDll.91 million for the postal network o f 1,200 offices
(i.e., 1,200 locations that would be able to provide financial andbusiness services). Of this
total, IDA fundingwould cover about USD10.93 million andthe reminder will be covered
by counterpart funding. The majority o f counterpart funding is for postal offices' site
preparation needed for installation o f modern technology and equipment. Further details
on cost estimates are provided inAnnex 4 andinTable 17.2 o f Annex 7.

Ineach phase, the post offices selected for modemization will be a mixture including: (a)
post offices that are already generating strong income and are expected to generate even
more, in order to raise funds for repayment, cross-subsidization and new investments; (b)
post offices, where it appears likely that the modemization would stimulate business
development and which are likely to become financially self-sufficient fairly fast. An
example would be rural areas where micro-finance organizations are active, or where rural
infrastructure projects and other Government initiatives are being planned; and (c) post
offices in areas that are truly "back-water", but where a broadened spectrum o f services is
needed due to social concerns. Modernization will also include the purchase o f certain
machines related to mail services, where necessary. The first 200 post offices will be
selected before the bidfor the satellite interconnectivity closes.

Table 2 provides a summary o f planned investments at Azeri Post headquarters, including
technical assistance and training, application software systems and the necessary hardware
and office automation investments, and for branch offices. Annex 4 provides a detailed
description o f the Azeri Post component, including: (i)   business and financial management
functions, including accounting and performance management; (ii)        cash and liquidity risk
management; (iii)    asset management and network operations; and (iv) management and
provision o f financial and other services.         The Azeri Post investment program and
technical assistance needed to build its headquarters functions are further discussed in
Annex 4, Component I,Part 1.

Component l.A.      - Interconnectivity for the Azeri Post Platform. The Azeri Post
system currently comprises 67 regional offices and 1,291 local post offices. The existing
optical fiber backbone provides an adequate connectivity platform for about 40 regional
offices. Of the 1,291 local post office, about 1,200 are not connected in a way that would
allow them to offer financial services. The main reason for this is the inadequacy of the
domestic "last mile" network, which is poorly developed outside the few main routes.
Adequate connectivity is also the key prerequisite to interface the NBA's payment system
infrastructure and for financial reliability andsecurity risk management.

Adequate interconnectivity is the critical requirement to be able to provide access to
financial services and to improve infrastructure in rural areas. Therefore, the project also
includes a solution that will provide adequate interconnectivity for the entire Azeri Post
network, allow growth and be able to accommodate other potentially relevant functions,
such as e-government. The solution for fast and cost effective interconnectivity will be
providedbyVSAT-satellite- based IPbroadband overlay network.

Technically, the VSAT solution will be based on DVB (Digital Video Broadcast) satellite
network with broadband outbound TDM (Time Division Multiplex) carrier and multiple
inbound TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) carriers. This network can be
implemented with symmetrical or asymmetrical configuration (that                  are easily
interchangeable) over Ku Band. The network services will be integrated over the Intemet-
based IPpZatform. The network will be configured as a "Star NetworK'. This solution is
able to accommodate up to 20,000 locations. A detailed description o f the VSAT solution,
as well as capacity and cost calculations, is provided inAnnex 4, Component I,Part 2.

The interconnectivity through the VSAT system will be deployed over threephases, which
will cover 200 postal office locations, plus additional 500, plus additional 500 point-of-
services (Le., post offices), respectively. It is estimated that monthly operational costs per
remotepost office inthe phase one will be USD85, inphase two USD49 and inphase three




                                                8

USD413. Due to the economies o f scale, the best cost efficiency would be achieved once
the 1,200 terminal network i s deployedina short time-period.

The cost o f the broadband hub inAzeri Post headquarters is estimated to be USD930,OUO.
The rural access capacity will include full provision o f all financial .services, plus
converged data, facsimile and voice (on a broadband platform).                        Communications
equipment cost (including communication equipment, fax and telephone needed to support
provision o f financial services and basic business infrastructure) i s estimated to USD3,500
per post ofice. The office automation investment for post offices includes a PC computer
(with needed software to inter-relate to headquarters functions) and office productivity
enhancement tools (high speed printer, scanner, copy-machine). Office automation cost is
estimated to USD2,500per post ofjce. It i s estimated that the sitepreparation cost will be
about USD3,OOU per location.             This includes improvements o f physical sites o f the
individual post offices (floor, paint, windows, doors, furniture and locks) and will be
funded byAzeri sources. Table 3 summarizes the costs o f the Azeri Post network.

 This difference is mostly determined by fixed operational costs, which are not dependant on the numbero f
operational VSAT terminals. These services are related to the central hub operational services and remote

Component2 -NationalPaymentSystemArchitecture. The total estimated cost o fthis
component is USD1.2 million, with an estimated funding need o f USD933,000, as
summarized in Table 4. Modules o f the national payment system infrastructure to be
completed under the project include:

(i)    Payment Risk Management System (PRMS) would include risk management
       software, including the capability to store information regarding rejection o f
       payments due to lack o f funds. Information on delinquent payees will be provided
       to banks andmerchants to enable them to avoid acceptance o f payment instruments
       (cards) that might not be honored.

 i) Interface to Large Non-bank Systems will support direct system-to-system
       interfaces o f the BCSS to large sources o f small-value payments (e.g., large utility
       companies such as telephone, electricity, water, gas, etc). Also, interfaces will be
       developed for Government and quasi-Government entities that create large number
       o fpayment transactions, such as central and local tax payments, customs payments,
       pension and social security payments. Once this module is completed, the banks
       and Azeri Post (once its new systems have been installed) will be able to directly
       interconnect to the systems o f large creators o f small-value payments and it will be
       able to exchange information on bills to be collected, and amounts collected. This
       will facilitate collections andimprove the quality o fbillingservices.

(iii)  Azeri Post Interface will provide direct interface o f the Azeri Post system to the
       BCSS, thereby integrating the platform for provision o f payment services in the
       rural areas with the national payment system architecture. The precondition for this
       interface i s that the Azeri Post internal processing and transaction management
       systems should be able to meet the technical criteria establishedbythe NBA.

Component 3 - Project Management. This component will cover incremental cost
related to project management.      The project management structure includes a Project

5. LessonsLearnedandReflectedinthe ProjectDesign

Postal Systems as Important Providers of Financial Services. Inmany areas o f the world,
postal systems played a prominent role in providing financial services to the poor and to
mobilizing savings in rural areas4. The postal financial services revenue is often a cross-
subsidy for the inefficient traditional mail delivery operations, thereby allowing continued
existence o f traditional mail services in sparsely populated rural areas. The design o f this
component included a careful review o f key features o f some major postal systems
engaged infinancial services provision anddeposit collection, notably inChina and Japan.

Implementation Arrangements.              During the FSTA project implementation, significant
efforts were made to develop PMU capacity to manage implementation o f Bank projects.
The FSTA implementation has been very successful, as the project will be implemented
about two years ahead o f schedule. The same unit will manage implementation o f this


  The model o f postal financial services was fust tried in industrialized countries, at the start o f
industrialization, for example inthe UnitedKingdom (1861), Canada (1868), Belgium (1870), Japan (1875),
France (1881), Austria (1883) and the UnitedStates (1910). As o f2000, 60 countries usedpostal systems for
the provision of financial services, with 45 o f these in developing and transition countries. They maintain
over 700 million savings and giro-accounts and process over USDlO billion in money transfers and 100
million internationalpayment transactions on an annualbasis.

project, including disbursements and hnd management, financial management and
oversight o f the procurement process. Relevant lessons from other Bank operations inthe
region include: (i) need for training and technical assistance, i.e., for investments
                       critical
to increase institutional capacity; (ii)phased approach and realistic timetable for
implementation; and (iii)     need for active involvement by Government agencies and all
other counterparts inproject implementation.

6. AlternativesConsideredandReasonsfor Rejection

The lack of clear commitment and/or of institutional capacity to implement the component:
The project design was modified after the initial concept review and industrial parksmodel
was dropped, due to lack o f institutional capacity and clear evidence o f ownership.
Insisting on inclusion o f this component would have jeopardized the overall project
preparation schedule, and the component was likelyto create implementation delays.

Try to use some of the banks with large network as a vehicle to expand services to rural
areas: However, none o f the banks has the network that could even remotely compare to
the postal system network. For example, BUS Bank, a state owned bank with the largest
presence in areas out o f Baku, has a network which is an order o f magnitude @e., more
then ten times) smaller then the postal network. Other reasons to favor the national postal
operator based solution included: (i)    the critical issue will be to develop the necessary
skills to operate a computer terminal inrural offices, and it was felt that this will be easier
to do if the offices already exist; (ii)  the much broader range o f services that could be
offered by post offices, including business services and e-government, that would allow
better utilization o f the investment andbetter chance to earn income necessary to cover the
operating cost; (iii)   Azeri Post has better capacity to cross-subsidize the slow starters in
rural areas; and (iv) the importance to create competitionto IBA.

How many of thepost offices should IDAfund? Azeri Post currently has 1291post offices
and, ultimately, all should be interconnected to the system. Initially, the proposed IDA
funding currently was to cover only the first 200 locations. Azeri Post was encouraged to
seek alternative funding sources, but it was not clear where the funding for the remaining
1,000 locations would come from. A follow-up project was considered as an option. In
the end, one o fthe project components was droppedto allow for IDA fundingfor the entire
Azeri Post network.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. PartnershipArrangements

The concept for the project has been developed in cooperation with the National Bank o f
Azerbaijan (NBA) and the Ministry o f Communications and Information Technology
(MOCIT). From the NGOs, the keypartners inthe dialogue were the BankingAssociation
andthe Azerbaijan Confederation ofEntrepreneurs. A number ofstate agencies andNGOs
active inthe related areas have also been consulted, as well as some o f the larger bilateral
donors (e.g., USAID, BP). Some donors have expressed interest in providing parallel
financing mainly for technical assistance. In particular, UN Universal Postal Union has


                                               12

expressed an interest and is willing to provide donor assistance and to include Azeri Post
into its international network for remittances. The Swiss Government has expressed an
interest in financing TAs related to implementation o f the Azeri Post component. The
International Association o f Postal Banks with headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, has
indicated possible availability o f assistance in an advisory or training capacity for Azeri
Post.

2. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

The Bank will maintain a direct relationship with all project participants. The project team
will have regular consultations with the Ministry o f Finance, Ministry o f Communications
and Information Technology and other parties interested inimplementation of the project.
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be located in the NBA. The P C U will be
responsible for the financial management and fiduciary aspects and for overall credit
administration, such as disbursements, financial reporting to the Bank, filing and auditing
project accounts, and general procurement planning. The PCUwill also be responsible for
implementation o f the NBA-related component. The PCUi s already functioning as Project
Management Unit under the Bank's Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project. This
arrangement will significantly speed up the start o fproject implementation5.

In addition, a Technical Implementation Unit (TIU) will be established in the MOCIT.
The TIU will be responsible for procurements related to the Azeri Post Component and,
together with Azeri Post, for implementation o f the respective component.                     The TIU
responsibilities will include preparing terms o f reference for consultants and training, as
well as technical specifications, management o f applicable biddingprocesses, evaluation
and selection of most successful bidders androll-out planning, organization and execution
o f training programs for the postal network. The TIU staff will be adequately trained in
Bank procurement procedures.

The consultations between PCU and TIU will include agreement on operating procedures,
preparation and updates o f annual procurement plans and implementation programs,
disbursement planning and maintenance o f procurement files. The PCU will submit all
procurement matters for Bank's no-objection.                It will thus provide a primary quality
control for all procurement actions that require Bank's no-objection.

The Project Coordination Unit is already fully operational. Its financial management and
procurement capacity are generally satisfactory, although some improvements are needed.
The table o f contents for the Project Operational Manual (POM) will be agreed at
negotiations. The POM should be completed, agreed upon by the PCU and TIU and
approved by the Bank by credit effectiveness.               A computerized Financial Management



 The NBA is currently implementing Financial Sector Technical Assistance. Therefore, it already meets the
minimumrequirements for fiduciary functions and has the necessary capacity for disbursement and financial
reporting, credit administration, auditing and procurement planning and procurement oversight. Buildingo f
this capacity inthe NBA took about 18 months and investments inproject monitoring and financial reporting
software.


                                                      13

System should be completed before Board presentation. The project accounts need to be
set up before project effectiveness. The TIUs should also be operational before
effectiveness.

Funds Flow. The total project cost estimated at USD17.75 million will be financed from
the IDA Credit o f USD12.25 million, and an estimated counterparts' contribution o f
USD5.5 million. The Credit would be disbursed using traditional disbursement procedures
(i.e., direct payments to third parties, reimbursements, replenishments and special
commitments) with administration o f the PCU. The Special Account will be opened in a
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. It is expected that the main source o f counterparts'
contribution will be the operating income o f Azeri Post, and funds provided by the NBA
andMOCIT. The Azeri Post or the MOCIT andthe NBAwould make paymentsdirectly to
their respective suppliers, consultants and contractors for project expenditures financed
with counterpart funds and keep separate records from their other activities. As the PCU
would be responsible for consolidated project accounting, disbursements and financial
reporting, it will be informed on regular basis o f sources and uses o f funds on various
project components that the counterpart funding has been provided, as necessary.

3. MonitoringandEvaluationof OutcomesLResults

The monitoring and evaluation o f outcomes will be performed on the project level, and on
the sector/macro level. Further details areprovidedinAnnex 3.

At theproject level, outcomes will be regularly monitored and evaluated by the Working
Groups that have been formed in each o f the beneficiaries, by Bank supervision missions
and by the respective Boards (for Azeri Post and NBA). The indicators that will be
monitored include: (i)   Azeri Post Component: financial condition (earnings, return on
equity) volumes and types o f financial and business services available inregional offices;
numbero fregional offices offering comprehensive services; volume andtypes o f financial
and other services available in local post offices; number o f locations in rural areas
offering financial services; and (ii)   NBA Payment System Infrastructure: number o f
components o f the national payment system that are fully hctional; number o f payment
transactions registered in the bulk payment system; number o f failures to complete
payment transactions, as an indication o f the effective management o f payment system
risks; number o f cards issued; percentage o f transactions where electronic payment
instrumentswere used.

At the macro level, the monitoring and evaluation will be performed by the Bank, in its
regularpolicy and project supervision work, by the National Payment System Council of
the NBA in its regular monitoring activities, by the PRSP team o f the Government and
through national statistics. The indicators that will be monitored include: share o f the non-
oil private sector in the economy; regional growth rates for non-oil sector activities;
number o f private enterprises in smaller urban and rural areas and private sector
employment figures; transaction cost for various types o f financial transactions and
instruments; percentage of the cash-based transactions inthe economy, etc.

4. Sustainability

Both project components are sustainable in the long run. Azeri Post is a well-capitalized
institution with strong revenue and net income growth during 2003. Total capitalization
was 72 percent o f total assets as o f December 31, 20036. Azeri Post earning capacity is
expected to further increase as a result o f project implementation. There will be significant
multiplier effects in the larger economic spectrum, namely in improving the business
environment and creating conditions that would support growth, especially in rural areas.
More specifically: (i)      Azeri Post will be able to provide existing services more effectively
and to introduce new services with higher value-added. This will improve its earning
capacity; and (ii)satellite interconnectivity will provide a basis for Azeri Post to
significantly broaden its outreach to rural areas. Additional services will also become
available, both fee-based and o f public interest, such as savings mobilization and services
known as e-government. Again, this should also positively reflect on Azeri Post earning
capacity.

Issues that could negatively impact Azeri Post financial condition and sustainability
include: (i)   inadequate managerial autonomy and insufficient managerial accountability.
However, the MOCIT has been asked, in the context o f signing o f the subsidiary credit
agreement, to provide assurance that the Azeri Post governance arrangements would be
modified to provide better autonomy inoperational matters, as well as more accountability
for project results; (ii)    failure o fAzeri Post to buildandmaintain institutional andtechnical
capacity in the post offices network that is necessary to effectively and safely provide the
new types o f financial services andto manage the associated risks. This i s addressed inthe
technical assistance component.             Early actions to develop a stronger service-oriented
corporate culture and image and a training center for the postal network are also being
undertaken; and (iii)      inadequate capacity o f Azeri Post to cross-subsidize the slow starters
in the post offices network in rural areas, that is, offices where the earnings are not
sufficient (or have not increased fast enough) to cover the increased operating and
depreciation cost. Any situation or action that would negatively affect Azeri Post's cross-
subsidization capacity would directly impact sustainability. However, the number o f rural
post offices needing cross-subsidization is expected to relatively quickly decline after the
first one-to-three years o f being able to offer the increased range o f financial and other
services. The MOCIT is also expected to provide additional counterpart funding, when
andwhere needed.

The sustainability o f the national payment system architecture operated and supervised by
the NBA is not inquestion.




  Azeri Post's financial statements, including balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement as of
December 31,2003, are discussed inAnnex 9.

D. APPRAISALSUMMARY

1. Economicand FinancialAnalyses

1.1EconomicAnalysis

The project is expected to result inmultiple benefits at the country level. The keybenefits
include increased competition for banking services, broadening access to financial services
and deepening the outreach in rural areas. This is expected to dramatically improve
economic opportunities o f the currently disadvantaged population strata, and produce a
number o f related systemic benefits.
Financial Sector Aspects:
Means to MoveAway From Cash-BasedEconomy: The Azeri Post platform is expected to
contribute to economic development byfacilitating non-cash operations. It will facilitate
introductiodexpansion o f smart-card systems and other electronic payment means by
providing access for remote point-of-sale outlets in smaller urban and rural areas. It will
stimulate the development of the financial sector: (i) providing a means for deposit
                                                          by
mobilization in rural areas; and (ii)   by offering a means to expand new products and
services offered by the formal financial sector.

Reduced Risk in the Financial System: Positive effects in terms o f reduction o f systemic
risk are expected from: (i)  the payment risk management system which will be completed
to store and exchange information on delinquent clients and provide clues to banks and
merchants to avoid acceptance of payment instruments (cards) that might not be honored;



                                               17

(ii) facilitating payment discipline; (iii)
                                          increased liquidityas a result o f broadening access
to the national payment system; and (iv) collecting the payment history within the postal
provision o f financial services, thereby facilitating risk management inthe banking system
once these clients approach banks for credit. Availability o f payment history normally
facilitates access to credit.

Savings Mobilization: Azeri Post financial services could ultimately provide an effective
means to mobilize citizens ' savings from rural areas. Recent surveys have indicated that
citizens by-and-large keep savings in physical assets (convertible to cash) or in informal
mechanisms. These informal means o f savings that dominate householdportfolios inrural
areas are, inprinciple, inferior to financial instruments, in terms o f safety and returns and
also in terms o f macroeconomic impact.         Attracting even a fraction o f informal non-
earning assets and savings held in physical forms would have multiple beneficial effects
for the holders of such assets, as well as for the economy at large.

Increased Outreach and Increased Access to Financial Services: Improved access to
financial services and provision o f other services that couldwould be introduced through
the Azeri Post platform will help integrate rural households and poor into the national
economy, open the doors for new opportunities and for private initiatives inthe currently
disadvantaged areas, and facilitate competitive market development (with all sorts o f
positive feed-back effects).

Improved Market Functions:
Improved Monev Order and Transfer Systems: including remittances, and introducing
broader range o f instruments and linking them to similar local, regional and international
systems (such as bank networks and giros), including linkages to the payment, settlement
andclearing andpayments systems operated bythe NBA.

Increased Access to Basic Business Infrastructure:         The project i s expected to have a
major positive impact on the cost o f financial and commercial transactions.        The Azeri
Post platform will include telephone connections and faxes that are currently not available
inmanyrural areas.      Even in areas where such services exist (at the cost o f 10 cents per
minute for intercity calls inAzerbaijan), the cost is expected to be significantly lower, due
to the much lower cost o f satellite connections andmaintenance. Inaddition, services such
as e-mail, access to'electronic markets and the Internet will become affordable.

E-Commerce: Azeri Post platform will be able to provide access points and integrated
support services for e-commerce, especially for servicing the requirements o f micro-small
and medium-sized companies and enterprises and small-scale dealers - which comprise
about 60 percent o f economic activity in Azerbaijan. Such services could include: (i)
provision o f E-Mail address; (ii)  provision o f connection points necessaryfor widespread
utilization of smart-card technology throughout Azerbaijan for individuals and small
traders to download (inreal time) the transactions memorized on their off-line end-devices
(thiswould beone o fthe critical functions); and (iii) toInternet inareaswhere there
                                                         access
are no commercial Internet access providers. Access to Internet could provide access to
information, as well as to electronic markets (known as B2B andB2C portals).



                                                18

E-Based Government Services. The Azeri Post platform will provide the communications
infrastructure to interconnect with Government systems that are currently being developed
(tax, system, social security, customs system). In fact, the Azeri Post would be able to
deliver access to e-based government services, such as: payments o f taxes, fees and other
dues to the central and local government authorities; account-based payments o f pensions
and benefits, wages, salaries, etc; issuance o f various certificates and business andpersonal
documents, etc.

1.2 FinancialAnalysis

Azeri Post is a well-capitalized institution with strong revenue and net income growth
during 2003. Azeri Post's financial statements, including balance sheet, income statement
and cash flow statement as of December 31, 2003, are discussed in Annex g7. Total
capitalization was 72 percent o f total assets as o f December 31, 2003. There are no
outstanding debt obligations. Return on assets was 14 percent and return on equity was 19
percent for the year ended December 31, 2003. The net profit margin in 2003 for the
major postal codes inlarge cities was very high: 46 percent for Baku; 40 percent for Ganja;
and about 33 percent for Abseron and Lenkaran.                In general, the cross-subsidization
capacity o fAzeri Post originates from non-traditional services and large service volumes in
Bakuand other large urbanareas. The financial highlights for 2003 are presented inTable
6.

Total Azeri Post revenue growth was 23 percent in 2003. However, this growth rate may
not be sustainable in the fiture. A more conservative growth rate o f 10 percent has been
used for the 5-year projections presented in Annex 9. As o f end-2003, traditional mail
services account only for about 12 percent o f the total income o f Azeri Post. In major
cities, Azeri Post has traditionally provided pension and social security payments, which

'TheAzeri   Post financial statements shown in Annex 9 are IAS based. They have been derived from the
Azeri Post financial statements developed according to the national accounting rules. The discussion in
Annex 9 includes details on how the financial statements were transposed into IAS-based financial
statements.


                                                  19

accounted for 19 percent of its income in 2003. Steady revenues derived from financial
transactions are critically important for sustainability o f traditional mail services in
sparsely populated rural areas o f Azerbaijan.      Offices in remote rural areas are cross-
subsidized.

Government Entities. Government and quasi-Government entities that create large
number o f payment transactions, such as the Ministry o f Finance (for tax and custom
payments) and local tax authorities; Pension Fund (pension and social security payments)
will have a direct interface to the national payment system. Increased outreach will be
brought by the Azeri Post platform. This i s expected to have a number o f positive effects,
including: (i) reduction o f transaction cost related to payments to citizens (pensions, social
security); and (ii)   reduction o f transaction cost and increase o f efficiency related to
collection o f payments from citizens and businesses (taxes, custom payments, fees) and
other revenues.      This will positively reflect on the financial condition o f government
entities, both at the central andlocal level.

Utility Companies. Financial impact o f the project is expected to reflect positively on
financial condition o f utility companies, such as telephone, electricity, water, gas, etc.
Improved outreach provided by the Azeri Post platform and direct interfaces with the
small-value payment system (BCSS) available for large creators o f payment transactions
will facilitate bill collections andimprove the quality o fbilling services. This is expected
to result in significant improvement o f collections, and thus the financial conditions of
utility companies.

1.3 Fiscal Impact

The project i s expected to have a generally positive fiscal impact. As mentioned, the
Government intends to ask the beneficiaries to commit to repay the amounts extended to
them under the project. On a broader canvas: (i)      increased number o f payment and other
financial and commercial transactions will result in higher tax revenues; (ii)increased
economic activities and exports are also expected to result in higher tax revenues (both
transaction-based sales or service taxes and corporate profit taxes; (iii) increased collection
rate for various corporate and citizen payments; and (iv) cost reductions related to payment
to citizens and collections, as explained above.

2. TechnicalIssues

There are no technical issues per se, although this will depend on implementation details.
The proposedinformation technology investments are considered sound from the technical
and operational perspective. The hardware, system software, application software, data
processing and storage systems and communication architecture and systems will be
selected to meet industry standards, to be cost effective, secure, modularly expandable and
properly supported with technical assistance and maintenance services. Detailed technical
analyses for the Azeri Post component, including the Azeri Post interconnectivity
component are provided in Annex 4 and Annex 9. Further details are available inproject
files.

3. FiduciaryAspects

A country procurement review (CPAR) was carried out in 2002 and finalized in 2003.
Although some progress has been mades, CPAR concludes that further progress is needed.
The general problem for Bank-financed procurements for public agencies i s mainly due to
the State Procurement Agency's insistence that National Procedures be followed'.                      Also,
some PIU directors (and procurement staff) were unable to act effectively or make timely
decisions due to constraints applied by the State Procurement Agency. Misapplications o f
the PPL may also include political interference in contract award decisions. Consequently,
the CPAR concluded that Azerbaijan should be rated as a high-risk country in respect o f
the public procurement system. However, the Project Management Unit in the National
Banko fAzerbaijan, which hasbeenresponsible for implementationo fthe FinancialSector
Technical Assistance and will be responsible for financial management and procurement
arrangements under this project, has not experienced any o f the above notedproblems.

The project procurement arrangements would ensure that the PCU could properly fulfill
fiduciary obligations, as described in Paras. 13-15 o f OP 11.00 on Procurement.
Development o f a Project Operations Manual (POM) satisfactory to the Association i s a
condition o f effectiveness. The POM will define a modus operandi, whereby adequate
coordination would be maintained between staff working at the P C U (responsible for
fiduciary arrangements) and the TIU in the MOCIT. The PCU should have a suitable
filing system for maintaining project and procurement records, details o f which will be
described in the POM, and take over responsibilities for procurement planning and
monitoring.

There are four issues that have been identified to create problems for Bank-financed
procurement:         (i)taxation and customs procedures; (ii)interference of the State
Procurement Agency in the procurement process; (iii)                  problems with bid securities; and
(iv) knowledge o f international contracting concepts. These issues will all be addressed in
a comprehensive capacity building program for the PCU and the TIU, which will be
completedbefore the first procurements.

The PCU staff will include a procurement officer that has already received training in
international procurement.          An action plan has been agreed to further strengthen the
procurement capacity, which may include the hiring o f an additional procurement officer
with IT background. In addition, further training will be provided, and the POM will


'Azerbaijan    adopted a Public Procurement Law (PPL) in 2001, which clarified and consolidated two
previously-existing but contradictory pieces o f legislation and is based on the UNCITRAL model. However,
there are several significant areas where the provisions o f the PPL vary from the Bank's Guidelines.
Subsequentto the passing of the PPL in2001, there was a Presidential Decree signed inJanuary 2002.

  Inparticular, this appearsto be causedbythe fact that the PPLis not specific concerning contracts financed
by donor funds. However, Constitution (Article 151) specifies that in cases where there may be conflicts
between donor Guidelines and the PPL, the rules o f the donor agencies rather than local procurement rules
should apply.



                                                       21

include guidance and details o f contract approval and supervision procedures.
Procurement supervision will be extremely intensive at the start o f the project, including
for contracts subject to post review. The Bank's procurement specialist will arrange for
quarterly supervision in the filed, followed by on-the-job training in matters where
weaknesses have been noticed.

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment diagnostic work carried out in 2002
recommended accounting and auditing (regulatory and institutional) reforms to increase
accountability and good governance inthe country. The proposedreforms are addressed in
the proposed three Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs). Inparticular, enactment
o f the new Accounting Law and related secondary regulation mandate the use o f
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for public interest entities and
govemmental enterprises and International Public Sector Standards (IPSA) for the public
sector. The Law will assure greater transparency and accountability o f public funds. In
parallel, the enactment o f the new Audit Law and establishment o f regulatory and
institutional frameworks for the Chamber o f Accounts, the country's supreme audit
institution, and the Chamber o f Auditors, the audit profession's regulator and standard-
setter, will provide greater transparency and comparability o f financial data.

The Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) of January 2002 identified some
generic issues affecting Bank-financed projects in the country.               Except for the
recommendation to establish a centrally coordinated group to oversee development and
management o f multiple financial management systems at the many project implementing
units implementing Bank-supportedprojects inorder to minimize risks and costs, all other
CPPR recommendations have been met and addressed in the design o f the project's
financial management arrangements.

Financial Management Arrangements. The financial management arrangements for the
project meet minimum requirements acceptable to IDA. The conclusion is based on the
assessment o f financial management systems o f the existing P C Uwithin the NBA that has
successfully implemented the ongoing FSTA project. The financial management system
includes accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, auditing arrangements and
staffing. The 1C accounting and financial reporting system is already producing Financial
Monitoring Reports, but requires revision o f the Chart o f Accounts to accommodate the
proposed project. The Accounting and Procedures Manual will be updated accordingly.
The PCU will have the overall responsibility for administrative and fiduciary functions o f
the project. A time-bound Action Plan to execute the necessary modifications to the
systems was discussed with the PCU and will be substantially implemented before the
Project i s presented to the Board. Fullimplementation o f the FM systems is a condition o f
effectiveness. Annex 7 provides further details on financial management aspects.

4. Social

The project is expected to have positive effects on the population at large, by providing
access to basic financial services to a large share o f the rural currently underserved by the




                                              22

 financial system, thereby ensuring improved economic linkages and better provision o f
 basic services, from utilities to pensionpayments.

 5.      Environment

 The project will not have direct environmental impact, since it includes no civil works but
 only equipment, technical assistance, and ICT. Hence, the "C" rating assigned inthe ISDS
 at PCD stage is consistent with the final project design andis assumed as maintained.

 The project complies with all applicable World Bankpolicies.

 The PCU is deemed ready for implementation. For the TIU, a new project team needs to
 be appointed. These staff are expected to be appointed and hired after Bank's Board
 approval. Assistance and training by the project team and the PCU will start immediately
 thereafter. Fullreadiness o fboththe PCUandTIU is a condition o f effectiveness.

       AZERBAIJAN: FINANCIAL SERVICESDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

Following the break-up o f the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan faced difficult initial conditions
that resulted in serious macroeconomic imbalances and a dramatic output collapse. Inthe
first half o f the 199Os, the economy experienced a cumulative real GDP drop o f about 60
percent, accompanied by hyperinflation, sharp currency depreciation and nearly depleted
foreign exchange reserves. Duringthe second half o f the 1 9 9 0 ' ~Azerbaijan registered a
                                                                        ~
strong recovery and the cumulative growth rate was more than 40 percent. Starting from
2000, the economy has registered a strong, broad-based economic growth across sectors,
including in agriculture.      Public finances have been considerably strengthened and
restructured, as revenues have grown and the deficit has been reduced.                Overall
consolidated budget deficit, excluding the Oil Fund was 2.9 percent o f GDP in 2003,
comparedwith 3.6 percent in2002.

Economic Outlook;         A positive factor has been the increasing inflow o f foreign
investments into the domestic oil and gas sectors and the resulting windfalls for the public
purse from the production sharing agreements with big international oil companies. The
oil and minerals sector has boosted economic growth in the country to an average rate o f
9.1 percent per year in 1997-2001 and has come to represent an increasingly large share in
GDP (about one third by 2002). In2002, real GDP expanded by 10.6 percent reflecting
both sound policy adjustments and high oil prices. In 2003, this upward trend continued
with 11.2 percent o f real growth, reflecting high oil prices, significant growth in
investments inthe oil and gas sectors, combined with good economic performance inother
sectors. A lower growth inthe oil and gas extraction in2003 is expected to be followed by
a temporary contraction o f output in the oil and gas sector in 2004, with stronger growth
thereafter.

However, the window o f opportunity i s limited: based on known reserves, oil extraction is
expected to peak in 2011 and decrease rapidly thereafter.          Within this timeframe, the
government needs to carry out a large array o f reforms to overcome the remaining soviet
legacy o f centralized organization, obsolete technologies, inefficient productions and
environmental neglect, and set the foundations for a well-hctioning market economy led
bynon-oil private sector activities-from   institutions to infrastructure.

The government has been effective to date in managing conservatively the economy,
restraining expenses and setting up an offshore State Oil Fundto sterilize the effects o f the
growing oil revenues on the economy and smooth income over a longer timeframe. Yet,
the Azeri GDP still stands only at about 60 percent o f its 1989 levels, nearly half o f the
population remains below the national poverty line with deteriorating health and education
standards, the size o f the non-oil economy is negligible, with some signs o f recovery, and
the current account balance is weighed down by huge flows o f imports and services,
including all equipment and goods usedbythe oil and gas industries.

Even presuming a continuation o f "careful macroeconomic management o f the oil
windfalls and a steady implementation o f structural reforms, the non oil sector i s projected



                                             24

to grow at about 9.1 percent annually during 2003-05 and then to moderate at about 5
percent annually by the end o f the decade, as oil-related FDIdries up". The gap between
non-oil and gas exports, which today accrue to only about USD300 million per year,
against imports o f goods which reach about USDl.5 billion, is expected to continue and
actually widen over the next few years. The development o f the non-oil sector in
Azerbaijan is o f key importance for poverty reduction. The non-oil sector comprises
mainly small, medium and micro enterprises (SMEs)." The SMEs are mainly active in
trade and services sectors, as these are more resilient and normally require smaller
investments for start-up.         The enabling environment for SME growth is cost-effective
access to payment and other financial services, savings mobilization and loans to expand
employment and facilitate growth o f the real sectors o f the economy.

Financial Sector. The banking sector inAzerbaijan i s small, with deposits and total credit
equivalent to about 8 and 7.5 percent o f GDP, respectively. The total assets o f the banking
system at end-March 2004 amounted to AZM 5,506 billion, or about USD1.2 billion. The
system has 45 commercial banks, with individual bank's assets amounting to an average o f
about USD8.4 million, excluding the two largest state banks. There is still a large number
o f so-called pocket banks andniche operators (assets o fthe smaller 26 banks average about
USD4 million ando fthe smallest ten USD2.3 million).

The development o f the banking sector has been negatively affected by the lack o f
competition. The lack o f competition is primarily due to the monopoly position of the
largest state-owned bank. The International Bank o f Azerbaijan (IBA) accounts for
55 percent o f banking system assets and 63 percent o f banking system deposits. The
second largest bank (BUS Bank) is also state owned, and accounts for 5 percent o fbanking
system assets and 6 percent o f deposits. However, the bank does not have a full banking
license. The total assets o f the four largest private banks that are potentially the strongest
IBA competitors amount to less then a quarter o f IBA's assets. A banking system with
such a structure is not likely to spur competition andefficiency.

Azerbaijan's economy is cash-based and access to financial services is inadequate. The
total number o f bank branches operating out o f Baku is smaller then 100. Access to
financial services in rural areas is largely non-existent. Cash is prevalent in trade and
payment transactions. This is due to a number o f reasons: inconveniences in access to
other payment instruments, lack o f confidence in the banking system, higher cost
associated with other payment instruments, higher risks related to non-cash payment
transactions and lack o f confidence in the judicial system. Improved access to non-cash
payment services, reduction o f risks related to non-cash transactions and better cost
effectiveness for non-cash payments is the first, critically important step to opening the
doors to a market economy, especially inrural areas.

The sources o f SME finding include banks, micro-finance institutions (MFI) and
cooperatives and the National Fund for Entrepreneurship (NFE). Of the intermediate



loAccording to the State Statistics, as of January 2003, there are 59,130 number of registered enterprises.
Approximately 70percent of SMEs are inBaku and 30 percent are inregions.

sources, banks are the largest source o f credit with a total credit volume o f AZM 3,204
billion as o f end-March 2004, followed by micro-finance institutions and credit
cooperatives with AZM 392 billion and the NFEwith AZM 49 billion. Ofthe total credit,
about 68 percent is denominated in foreign currency. The cost o f credit is high, reflecting
high-risk premiums charged inthe credit market. SME lending i s mostly based on foreign
funding to avoid maturity mismatches. Business loans extended by banks are
predominantly indollars and some inmanats, with 1-2 years' maturity with annual interest
rates averaging about 13 percent for the domestic currency and 18.5 percent for foreign
currency credit. Collateral o f up to two-to-three times the loan amount is required for all
but the smallest loans. A typical term for small and consumer loans is interest rate o f25-
30 percent with up to 3 years' maturity. The MFI loans are smaller with average interest
rates between 30-40 percent, andwith an average maturity between 6 months to 2 years.

Financial Sector Infrastructure.    The basic elements o f the national payment system
infrastructure were recently completed.       The Azerbaijan Interbank Payment System
(MIPS) fully meets international standards for systemically important payment systems.
The Batch (Low Value) Clearing and Settlement System (BCSS) was completed in 2002
andmeets international standards. The BCSS is intendedto be used to clear and settle, on
a net basis, recurring payments such as salaries, pensions and utility bills and non-urgent
payment orders.       Yet, the number o f transactions cleared is still low compared with
potential since the banks and utilitycompanies have not yet agreed on common approaches
to bill presentment and collection. For similar reasons, the system is not yet effectively
used for disbursement o f salaries and pensions.          The agreements leading to better
utilization o fthe payment infrastructure are critically important, as this would leadto better
capacity to integrate areas out o f Bakuand rural areas into the rest o f the economy and to
provide them with better economic andmarket opportunities.

Another critical element o f a modern payment system infrastructure is a clearinghouse for
e-based payment instruments, such as credit or smart cards. To create conditions for the
rapid adoption o f card-based retail payment services, the NBA has decided to organize a
state-of-the-art Card Processing Center (CPC). The CPC will first be operated by the NBA
and eventually transferred to the Banking Association, with a governance structure in
which all banks can participate on equitable terms and that provides transparent
management andNBA supervision. With IMF andBank's technical assistance, the NBA is
currently working on implementing the CPC.

The NBA i s in the final phases o f payment system reforms. Access to payment services
outside the Baku area remains a major issue. Despite the recent openings o f new bank
branches, the bankingsystem branch network out o f the Bakuarea is very small, with less
than a hundred branch offices.      A draft "State Program for the Years 2004-2006 on
Enhancement o f Reforms and Other Activities for Establishment o f the National Payment
System in Azerbaijan Republic" has been prepared to enlist the full backing o f the
Government for the next phase o f payment system reforms. Azeri Post is expected to play
a critical role o f providing payment services in areas not served by bank branches. It has
1600 offices o f which 1400 are out o f the Baku area and has already started to provide
various payment services to rural areas, such as Money-grams (money transfers), pension
payments andbill collections on behalf o f utilities.

Poverty Reduction Strategy. Azerbaijan's PRSP, known as the State Program on Poverty
Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED), identifies six strategic pillars: (i)an
enabling environment for income-generating opportunities; (ii)  macroeconomic stability;
(iii)quality of and equity in access to health and education; (iv) infrastructure
improvements (including roads, utility services, and irrigation); (v) social protection
reforms to serve the vulnerable areas more effectively; and (vi) better conditions for
refigees and displaced persons. The project i s expected to provide an important tool that
would facilitate implementation o f SPRED.

WorldBankProjects:

FinancialSector TechnicalAssistance (FY2001). This is a Bank project aiming to assist
with banking reforms, to build the institutional capacity o f the central bank and to
complete the key pieces o f the national payment system infrastructure.        The project is
being successfully implemented and is expected to be completed about two years ahead o f
schedule. The key elements that have been completed and are related to this project
include a small value payment system (BCSS), a credit card settlement and clearing system
(CPC), a credit risk register, introduction o f a new I A S based chart of accounts for banks,
andthe relatedtechnical assistance.

PovertyReductionSupport Credit (FY2004). This is a structural adjustment operation
that includes certain conditions relevant to the project. The key condition i s the enactment,
through a Presidential Decree, of the Strategy for National Payment System Architecture
2004-2006, which provides the policy underpinning for this project. Conversely, this
project will provide an important tool to facilitate implementation o f the Government's
Poverty Reduction Strategy.

Rural Investment Project (FY2004). This is another project addressing the issues o f
disadvantaged rural and poor areas. The project aims to improve the living standards o f
the rural population by providing funding (micro-finance) to build or improve the basic
infrastructure in rural areas.     The initiatives for improvement are to be taken by
community-based organizations.

       AZERBAIJAN: FINANCIAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                               ComponentI       - AzeriPostPlatform

Smaller urban areas and rural areas inAzerbaijan do not have access to payment and other
financial services and are not served by banks. Basic payment services in Azerbaijan,
especially outside o f Baku and in rural areas, are mostly provided by Azeri Post. Azeri
Post has over 1,000 post offices inareas outside o f Baku, which compares to less then 100
bank branches.       Therefore, Azeri Post could be used to create a platform that would
dramatically improve: (i)     access to-financial services and savings mobilization; (ii)         access
to basic business infrastructure, such as telephone, and fax, Internet and e-mail; and (iii)
provide a platform for introduction o f e-government services.

Inmanycountries, postal systemshavebeenusedasthe mainvehicle for theprovisionof
access to financial services for the poor in rural areas. The expected benefits are much
broader then access to financial services. Income from financial services will significantly
contribute to thefinancial sustainability of thepostal system by providing steady revenues
derived from the processingo f financial transactions. Therefore, this is critically important
for the sustainability o f traditional mail services in sparsely-populated rural areas o f
Azerbaijan.     In addition, modernization o f the Azeri Post is expected to contribute to
economic development byfacilitating non-cash operations and to the development o f the
financial sector through improving public confidence and facilitating the expansion o f new
products and services offered by the formal financial sector.

ManagementStructure and Governance. Azeri Post has been registered in 1999, as a
state-owned enterprise operating under the Ministry o f Communications According to the
Azeri Post charter, the Minister appoints the General Director, who selects the General
Manager and the two Deputy Directors with operational responsibilities -- one with
management responsibility for Technology and Policy and the other for Organization and
Operations. While this was a welcome first step in the postal reforms, this governance
structure is less then adequate for the new role o f Azeri Post envisaged by the project.
Azeri Post currently does not have an autonomy that is deemed necessary for the
successful completion o f the project and for direct participation in the national payment
system. There are also operating-cost-related, conflict-of-interest concerns regardingAzeri
Post relationships with other enterprises operating under the MOCIT.                    Consequently,
governance arrangements for Azeri Post are deemed to be less then satisfactory.

The legal status and governance arrangements for Azeri Post should be changed, and it
should be provided with the necessary autonomy -- management should be fully
accountable for its financial and operational results. The branch offices and local post
offices should formally become an integral part o f the Azeri Post system. Azeri Post will

be expected to operate on commercial principles and be free to use its earnings inpursuit
o fpriorities agreed.

Financial Condition. Azeri Post i s a well-capitalized institution with strong revenue and
net income growth. Total capitalization was 72 percent o f total assets as o f December 31,
2003.12 Return on assets was 14 percent, and return on equity was 19 percent for the year
ended December 31, 2003.               O f its total assets o f USD10.8 million, investments in
buildings and equipment comprised USD 6.9 million, or 64 percent o f total assets. Total
revenue growth was 23 percent in 2003 (compared with 18 percent growth in 2002)
resulting in gross operating margins o f 35 percent (compared with 32 percent in 2002).
However, this growth rate may not be sustainable in the future, unless a significant
investment to improve its organization, technology and service capacity takes place, as
envisaged under the project.

Azeri Post is deemed to have an adequate capacity to meet its (significant) counterpart
fundingrequirementsunder the project, as well as for the cross-subsidization needs that are
expected for post offices in some rural areas where business could be slow to develop. It
could also take leverage to finance modemization, if so decided by its regulatory
authorities, but the terms o f credit will (significantly) affect its counterpart funding and
cross-subsidization capacity. The medium-to-long term outlook is positive, with increased
earning capacity due to better capacity to introduce higher value-added products and
services and in much broader area in more locations (i.e., in the whole network o f 1,200
post offices). It is expected that the increase o f income over the life o f the project will be
around 30-500 percent for the bill collection, which now comprises less then 10percent o f
the total revenue base, and 20-100 percent for other non-traditional new products and
services to be introduced. ,Detailed projections with "before" and "after" the project are
provided inAnnex 9.

Current Products and Services. Azeri Post currently has a number o f product lines.
This includes:        (i)traditionalpostal services such as mail and parcel delivery; (ii)
facilitation services, such as provision o f access to telephones for inter-city calls or fax and
copying services; (iii) o f various types, from traditional stamps to modern sim-cards;
                            sales
(iv) financial services, such as money transfer services, and pension payments; and (v)
payment collection services, for telephones, gas, electricity, etc. and other business
services. A detailed list o f current products and services is available in project files.
However, the capacity o f Azeri Post to provide financial services i s rather basic. Inmany
locations, there is no interconnectivity, so even the basic services cannot be provided in
rural areas.

Payment Services. Azeri Post has already introduced payment services, although the
speed and method o f delivery vary. Azeri Post applies a combination o f communication
equipment using fiber optic lines, terrestrial lines, vehicles andperson-to-person to deliver

flow statement as ofDecember 31,2003 are provided inAnnex 9

its current postal products and financial services within its market areas, with varying
speeds, safety and times o f delivery.

(i)     Utility Payments. Azeri Post provides the traditional billing and collection o f
        payments from subscribershsers for the monthly charges and billings o f Aztelcom,
        for the domestic and international traffic, Barmec (electricity), gas, water and other
        utilities.  These services are not provided in rural areas, where there is no
        interconnectivity needed to support the billpayment systems.

(ii)    Domestic and International Money Transfers, payments and remittances which
        have been growing significantly inboth volume and value over the past 18 months
        since the "money-gram" product was introduced. Remittances are transmitted and
        delivered both electronically (using the optic fiber and terrestrial lines, where
        possible) and through personal delivery by post mail carriers, where electronic
        delivery i s not feasible. Electronic remittances are delivered within 15 minutes o f
        transmission, while non-electronic delivery may take 1or 2 days, depending on the
        area o f delivery and location o f the recipients' present financial services.

(iii)   Pensions and Social Security Payments and Other Payments for Governmental
        Authorities. Azeri Post also provides delivery o f monthly pensions, social security
        allowances and other allowances to recipients designated by the Pension Fund. It
        also provides services to other entities, such as collection o f fines imposed by road
        police and/or tax payments. These are available in all Azeri Post offices, except
        that inareas that are not connected, the delivery is person-to-person andmay take a
        couple o f days.

N e w Functions and Services. Azeri Post has already started to make important first steps
to expand its scope and to start providing access to services needed by citizens ana
businesses in areas where there are no other service providers.             This is a critically
important first step. It shows that, with adequate support and technical assistance, Azeri
Post might easily further expand the range and quality o f its services to provide a primary
infrastructure through which the smaller urban and rural areas could gain access to
financial andother government services.

There are a number o f requirements that must be met in order to expand the Azeri Post
capacity to comprehensively provide a full range o f financial services to the entire
network. This includes: (i)     improved functional capacity in headquarters, especially for
functions related to the provision o f financial services (such as cash and liquidity
management, transaction support, and capacity to maintain account-based relationships
with clients); (ii) adequate IT support for all key functional areas, including full control
over IT services, modem equipment and application software (e.g., relational databases,
real time updates, MIS systems and management tools); and (iii)        interconnectivity over the
entire post office network. Table 7 summarizes the needed strengthening o f institutional
functions and IT support to be providedby the project.

New Financial Services that could be considered for introduction, once the new systems
andIT support is available, include:

(9        Deposit Mobilization (sight and time deposits). Azeri Post would be required to
          surrender the collected deposits to the NBA. The NBA could invest the deposits
          into Government's securities or place the deposits in the inter-bank money market
          and certain savings schemes.




                                                              35

(ii)   Selling other savingsproducts, such as certificates o f deposit or depository receipts,
       issuedbythe bankingsector.

(iii)   Upgrading the money order and transfer systems, introducing broader range o f
       instruments and linking them to similar local, regional and international systems
       (such as bank networks and giros), including linkages to the payment, settlement
       andclearing andpayments systems operated bythe NBA.

(iv)   Issuing smart cards backed by customer deposits, thus providing fully secured
       access to micro-finance. Initially, these should be debit-cards. Intime, Azeri Post
       might also be allowed to issue credit cards, providing that they are fully
       collateralized bydeposits heldwith Azeri Post.

E-Based Government Services. The postal system already has access points and could
build the communications infrastructure to interconnect with Government systems that are
currently being developed (tax, system, social security, customs system). Infact, the Azeri
Post would be able to deliver access to e-based government services, such as:

(i)    Account Based Payments o fpensions andbenefits, wages, salaries, etc.

(ii)   Issuance of various certijkates and business and personal documents by the local
       andcentralGovernment.

(iii)  Collection of payments for taxes, fees and other dues to the central and local
       govemment authorities.

E-Commerce. An equally important function that could be developedis to provide access
points and integrated support services for e-commerce, especially for servicing the
requirements of micro-small and medium-sized companies and enterprises and small-scale
dealers - which comprise about 60 percent o f economic activity in Azerbaijan. Such
services could include:

(i)    Provision of E-Mail address.

(ii)   Provision of connection points necessaryfor widespread utilization of smart-card
       technology throughout Azerbaijan for individuals andsmall traders to download (in
       real time) the transactions memorized on their off-line end-devices. This would be
       one o fthe critical functions.

(iii)  Access to Internet in areas where there are no commercial Internet Access
       providers. Access to Internet could provide access to information, as well as to
       electronic markets (known as B2B andB2C portals).

the table shows separate price estimates, for the accounting and related business systems,
integrated packages, rather then individual application packages, are available, such as:
SCALE, NAVISION, RJ REYNOLDS, EXACT, etc. Integrated packages are a better
choice because the new data supplied in one application automatically updates all other
related applications andbusiness processes.

This will not only provide a demonstration effect, but it will also be a testing and refining
ground for service providers and access operators to ensure that the interfacing systems, as
well as organizations and stakeholders, are aligned and provide value-added services to
citizens.

Broadband Satellite Solution for access to financial services in rural areas has been
designed to deliver not only financial, but also basic business services, such as data,
facsimile and voice on a broadband platform. Inthe beginning, the broadband network is
envisioned as a mostly symmetrical network supporting current base applications.
However, new services that are to be integrated (financial services related to savings and
deposits, smart-card support, public e-mail support, e-government service facilitation,
internet service facilitation, financial services to banks, etc.) are asymmetric in nature,
where the query or request size i s very small as compared with the response. Thus, a fairly
highbandwidthwill be requiredduring downloads, incomparison with uploads from any
location. At that point, the network will become asymmetrical in nature. Therefore,
particular attention was devoted to the network's reconfiguration flexibility.

The most suitable satellite based network design to address these particular needs i s a
Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) satellite network with broadband outbound Time Division
Multiplex (TDM) carrier and multiple TDMA inbounds carriers. This type of network can
be implemented with symmetrical or asymmetrical configurations (that are easily
interchangeable with future needs). It is also judged, from economics and the size o f the
electronics point o f view, that Ku-band is preferred for an operation o f this type. All
services to be carried over the network will be integrated over the IPpZatform. Satellite
network will be configured as a "Star Network". DVB/TDMA broadband platform
provides the following benefits:

        Satellite bandwidth sharing betweennetwork terminals andDynamic bandwidth
        allocation for optimal utilization;
        Small VSAT terminaldantennas and low costs VSAT equipment. Small satellite
        bandwidthrequirements;
        Easy scalability. The broadband out-route from the Hub could be configured for
        various speeds (up to 45Mbs);
        The broadbandcarrier i s upgradeable to higher bandwidths without visiting the
        remote sites;
        The out route should use concatenated Reed-Solemon andViterbi encodingwhich
        provides an excellent bit error rate performance;
        The out route should have unicast and multicast traffic handling capabilities. The
        out route should providespoofing for TCP connections required for Internet
        applications;
        The data on the broadbandout-route should support compression, which should
        increase the overall throughput;
        Data shouldbe encrypted for security.

IPVSAT network converge data, voice and fax services into an IP stream via the VSAT
terminal, which provides an Ethernet LANinterface for all services. The benefits are the
following:

        Low overhead;

        "Ethernet" interfacebuilt into VSAT terminal;

        Direct compatibilityhnterconnectivity with central office LAN;

        Fullintegrationo fdata, voice andfacsimile services over IPprovides ahigh
        bandwidthutilization;

        Full compatibility with Intemet, so the same setup canbe also usedfor Intemet
        access;

        Simple security protection (built into VSAT terminal);

        Simplifies services distribution at Central Post Office.
Network Components

The VSAT network components include: a Central Satellite Hub, a Network Management
System (NMS) for monitoring and controlling VSAT network and remote VSAT
terminals.

Central Satellite Hub will be located at the top o f Azeri Post buildingto avoid any costly
inter-city loops. The hub will operate on the Ku-bandfrequencies with 4.5m-antenna size
and will act as a concentrator for VSAT traffic. The hub components are broadly divided
into three groups:

0       RF Subsystem includes all RF electronics required to run the network, which will
        primarilybe comprised o f a 4.5m antenna and a 50 W radio frequency transmitter
        (RFT). The size o f the antenna and RFT power has been estimated based on a
        detailed link engineering analysis using the INTELSAT-904, 60 Degrees (East)
        Ku-bandsatellite transponder. The RFT electronics sizing at the hubwill be able to
        support the upward scaling o f the network needs. The RFT system at the hub will
        also contain uplink-converters to convert the incoming signal from IF in the
        transmit chain and downlink-converters to convert the signal from RF to IF in the
        receive chain.

(ii)    TheIF Subsystem includes interface to the RF Subsystem on one end and Baseband
        Subsystem on the other. This subsystem is primarily responsible for IF distribution  .
        andmodulationo fthe out route anddemodulationo fthe inroute.

(iii)   Base-band Subsystem includes three main components: (i) (ii) Gateway;
                                                                    DNCC;     IP
        and (iii)Satellite Gateway.      DNCC converts the IF signal coming from IF


                                              42

       distribution to IP packets and forwards it to IP Gateway which does the required
        switching and forwards the packets to the Satellite Gateway which encapsulates the
       data and sends it to the modulator inthe IF subsystem.

The Broadband NMS System is interfaced to the IP Gateway. The NMS works on a
UNIXplatform andis capable of controlling andmonitoring the BroadbandVSATs at the
remotes.

Remote VSAT Terminals. Remote VSATs will be equipped with 1.2m Ku-band
antennas; l w RFT and a VSAT IDU. VSAT IDUwill contain built-inrouting capability
and will supports analog phones for VoIP fbnctionality. Each terminal will be equipped
with an "Ethernet" interface for IP connectivity. For this project it is envisaged that there
will be approximately 1200remote sites inthe network.

Local PostOfficeConfiguration

There are an estimated 1200 local post offices inAzerbaijan, which will form a network to
bringdata, voice and facsimile accessesto under-served areas around the country. Most o f
the local post offices are currently rented from the Government or from local authorities on
an annual lease basis. Ifrental premises for post offices continue to be used, at least a five-
year lease would be requiredbefore IDA-financed investments could take place. However,
in2003 inanticipation ofthe project, Azeri Post completed the buildingor retro-fitting of
over 200 local post offices invarious regions according to the adopted "national standard".
Additional 200+ will be completed in 2004. The deployment to the local post offices
envisaged by the project i s not likely to start before late 2005. At that time, physical
modernization o f an estimated 600-700 offices should be completed. All existing post
offices will be modernized by the end o f the project. Funding for the physical
modernization o f post offices is expected to be provided as counterpart funding by Azeri
Post. The modernizedoffices are expected to stay under Azeri Post ownership.

Inaddition to interconnectivity equipment, modernization o f a localpost office includes a
PC, a telephone, a smart-card terminallreader, a printer, a scanner, and a fax machine.
Mail processing equipment or other special purpose equipment (such as code readers)
would be included, where needed. The PC will provide for facilitation o f various current
and future services, future access to the Intemet or access to basic government services
such as certificates delivery, tax collection, ID card applications, etc. Telephone and
facsimile will be used for domestic and international PSTN service.         All services are
`manned' and it is envisioned that the persons working in local post offices, in addition to
assisting people, will collect money from them for the use o f the services.

The data, voice and facsimile are converged into an Tp stream via the VSAT terminal,
which provides an Ethernet LANinterface to local postal centers and communicates to the
central VSAT hub infrastructure in Baku. At the beginning o f VSAT integration, the
satellite capacity required to support services would be 32Kbps in the inbound direction
and also 32Kbps in the outbound direction. Ifneeded, capacity can be changed "on-the-
fly" with a minimal system disturbance. Figure 2 shows the typical configuration for a
post office.

Deployment Plan for Post offices. The deployment will start in the third phase of
implementation o f the Azeri Post component (of the total o f five component
implementation phases). Deployment is planned to be executed inthree phases, which will
include 200, 500 and 500 remote locations, respectively. In each phase, there will be a
mixture o f post offices selected on the basis o f financial, business and social policy
concerns. The mixture will include: a) post offices that are already generating strong
income and are expected to generate even more in order to raise funds for repayment,
cross-subsidization and new investments; b) post offices, where it appears likely that
modernization would stimulate business development and which are likely to become
financially self-sufficient fairly fast.   An example would be rural areas where micro-
finance organizations are active, or where rural infrastructure projects and other
government's initiatives are being planned; andc) post offices inareas that are truly "back-
water", but where the broadened spectrum o f services is needed due to social concerns.

Implementation o f the first two phases o f institution buildingcapacity inheadquarters will
greatly facilitate the selection o f locations to be included in each phase o f deployment.


                                              44

The first 200 post offices will be selected before the bid for the satellite interconnectivity
closes (in phase three o f Azeri Post component implementation, as explained in Part B.
Section 4 o f the report). The selection process for the next two groups will be improved
based on lessons learned.

Cost Estimates. The total cost o f the project has been estimated for the entire Azeri Post
network o f 1,200 offices using a VSAT technology solution. The VSAT system capacity
i s estimated by separately calculating voice requirements and data requirements, as
summarized inAnnex 9. However, some o f the local post offices may have a fiber-optic
connectivity option.         Where applicable, the investment and operating costs o f
interconnectivity (via VSAT versus via optical fiber connection) will be evaluated for the
respective post office locations. The decision on the type o f interconnectivity to be used
will be made on the least-cost, adequate-functionality basis for each postal office location.
For locations where optical fiber connectivity is available and less costly to use, this
solution will be preferred.

InvestmentCost Estimates. Table 11contains the cost summary for the Central Office's
hub equipment. These cost estimates also include equipment spares, installation and
activation services as well as training services for staff operating the hub.

Table 12 summarizes the costs for interconnectivity-related equipment, including
installation services and basic training for the hub. It is assumed that VSAT network will
contain 1200 terminals. As per Table 11, total communications equipment investment
costs for this project are estimated do be USD4.2M, which translates to USD3500 per
remote post office.

Monthly OperationalCost Estimates. It is estimated that monthly operational costs per
remote post office will be: USD85 inphase one (with 200 offices interconnected), USD49
inphase two (for 700 offices interconnected), and USD41 inphase three (for all 1,2000
offices interconnected).      Further details on operating cost calculation are provided in
Annex 9. The operating cost difference is mostly determined by fixed operational costs,
which are not dependant on the number o f operational VSAT terminals. These services are
related to the central hub operational services and remote terminals sparing and
maintenance. It is obvious that the economy o f scale factor indicates that the highest
efficiency would be achieved if the VSAT network were to be deployed in a short time
fi-me. Figure 3 shows the dependency o f estimated monthly operational costs per remote
post office on phase o f implementation.

Table 13 summarizes phased investment for the Azeri Post network, including all three
phases o f deployment for the Azeri Post network. As mentioned, IDA funding under the
project will cover only the first phase o f deployment. Phase I1and I11would be funded by
the Government or donors. Ifthe funding fails to materialize, a follow-up Bank project to
complete the deployment could be considered.

 Inter-Bank Payment System Infrastructure operated by the NBA covers key inter-
 bank payment facilities, including BCSS and CPC. These two systems were developed
 under the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FSTA). Their functions include:

    o The Bulk Clearing and Settlement System (BCSS), processes electronic bulk
        transactions generated by all low value payment instruments (checks, cards, credit
        orders, debit orders, etc);

    o The Card Processing Center (CPC) includes facilities for credit card operations
        and for card-settlement and clearing. This system is a basis for e-based payment
        instruments inAzerbaijan.

  Support Infrastructure components include modules that are expected to facilitate
  execution o f bulk payments, to improve system integration and to improve safety and
  security o f the national payment system.        This includes the Credieayment Risk
 Management System (PRMS), Interface to Large Non-bank Systems (ILNS) and
 interfaces to the Azeri Post Platform. These interfaces will be supported under the
 project, as follows:

  (a) The Payment Risk Management System (PRMS) will store information regarding
      rejection of payments due to lack o f h d s in the client's account. The PRMS will
      store information on risky clients and will provide corresponding information to
      banks and merchants and will enable them to avoid acceptance o f payment
      instruments (cards) that might not behonored.

  (b) The Interface to Large Non-bank Systems (ILNS) will support direct system-to-
      system interfaces o f the BCSS to large sources o f small value payments.          For
      example, this will include large utility companies such as telephone, electricity,
      water, gas, etc. Also, Government and quasi-government entities that create large
      number o f payment transactions, such as central and local tax payments, custom
      payments, pension and social security payments will have a direct interface to the
      national payment system. Once the ILNS is completed, banks and Azeri Post (once
      its new systems have been installed) will be able to directly interconnect to the
      systems o f large creators o f small-value payments and be able to exchange
      information on bills to be collected, and amounts collected.       This will facilitate
      collections and improve the quality o fbilling services.

  (c) Azeri Post PZatjiorm would provide access for the provision o f financial services in
      rural areas, and thus needs a direct interface to the BCSS. The precondition for this
      interface is that the Azeri Post internal processing and transaction management
      systems be able to meet the technical criteria established by the NBA.

Funding Needs. An estimated amount to build the needed interfaces with the payment
system architecture for large sources o f payment transactions, including the necessary
technical assistance and training and the development o f risk management facilities, totals
about USDl.2 million. This assumes that all larger potential creators o f small-value



                                              49

payments already have well-functioning billing systems that are capable of meeting the
technical standards o f the BCSS, in order to be able to interconnect. Otherwise, much
higher amount might be neededto improve the technical capacity andparameters o fbilling
systems of such large users (e.g., gas andelectricity companies, AzTelecom, etc.).

All agencies participating in the project (NBA, MOCIT, Azeri Post) will maintain on-
going and direct relationship with the World Bank during project implementation. The
World Bank project team will also have regular consultations with the counterpart
ministries (Ministry o f Economic Development, Ministry o f Finance) and other parties
interested inimplementation o fthe project.

The overall Project Coordination Unit (PCLJ) will be located in the NBA. The PCU will
be responsible for overall credit administration, disbursement and documentation, financial
reporting to the World Bank, filing and auditing o f project accounts, and general
procurement planning. Since the NBA already has the capacity for World Bank project
administration, these arrangements will significantly speed up the start o f project
implementati~n'~.The PCU inthe NBA will also be responsible for implementation o f the
NBA-related component.

Specific activities and responsibilities o f the PCU would include inter alia:                           (i)
coordination o f overall project implementation activities for all components and sub-
components o f the projects, as specified in the Project Operational Manual (POM); (ii)
preparation of all the necessary project implementation documents to ensure effective
planning o f project activities, as well as definition of goods and services to be procured;
(iii)working closely with the TIU on procurement and financial management issues; (iv)
ensuring effective monitoring and evaluation ofproject achievements and outcomes during
the project, and managing a monitoring and evaluation budget; (v) coordinating with other
relevant agencies and beneficiaries involved in project implementation; (vi) preparing
annual procurement plans in agreement with the TIU; and (vii) preparing progress reports
inaccordance withtheprovisions ofthe Credit Agreement.

Inaddition, MOCIT will maintain a Technical ImplementationUnit (TIU). The TIU will
be responsible for implementation o f the Azeri Post component, including procurement o f
goods, evaluation and selection o f technical assistance and organization o f the respective
training programs. Azeri Post management and technical staff will actively participate in
TIU work. The staff o f TIU will include a Project Implementation Officer, who would
also act as component coordinator, and at least one procurement specialist, who would
ensure that procurement is camed out in accordance with applicable World Bank
guidelines.     The TIU staff will be adequately trained in World Bank procurement
procedures, The TIUwill work inclose cooperation with the PCU.

The PCU should be fully operational by Board presentation.                      The TIU should be
established by effectiveness.



 l3The NBA i s currently implementing Financial Sector Technical Assistance. Therefore, it already has the
necessary capacity for disbursement and financial reporting, credit administration, filing and auditing o f
project accounts, and for procurement planning and procurement oversight. Building o f t h s capacity in the
NBA took about 18months and involved investments inprojectmonitoring and financial reporting software.

Financial management assessment was carried out during project preparation and updated
at appraisal. The overall approach to the assessment was to confirm the adequacy o f
financial management arrangements within the existing Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
currently implementing the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FSTA), to
assure that the systems can provide to the Bank accurate and timely information regarding
project resources and expenditures. The financial management arrangements include
systems o f accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, staffing and auditing. The
existing financial management systems at the PCU meet the minimum Bank requirements.
A time-bound Action Plan to hrther strengthen the systems was discussed with the PCU
andwill be hllyimplemented before the Project is presentedto the Board.

CountryIssues

The Azerbaijan Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) diagnostic work
carried out in 2002 recommended accounting and auditing regulatory and institutional
reforms to increase accountability and good governance in the country. The proposed
reforms are addressed in the proposed Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs). In
particular, enactment o f the new Accounting Law and related secondary regulation
mandates the use o f International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for public interest
entities and governmental enterprises and InternationalPublic Sector Standards (IPSA) for
the public sector. The Law will assure greater transparency and accountability in the use
o f public funds. In parallel, the enactment o f the new Audit Law and establishment o f
regulatory and institutional frameworks for the Chamber o f Accounts (the country's
supreme audit institution) and the Chamber o f Auditors (the country's audit profession
regulator and standard-setter) will provide greater transparency and comparability o f
financial audits.

The Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) o f January 2002 identified some
generic issues affecting Bank-financed projects in the country. Except for the
recommendation to establish a centrally coordinated group to oversee management o f
multiple financial management systems at the many project implementing units servicing
Bank-supported projects in order to minimize risks and costs, all other CPPR
recommendations have been met and addressed in the design o f the project's financial
management arrangements.

RiskAnalysis

Risks associated with the Project's financial management systems are not considered
significant enough to warrant inclusion in Section C5 o f the PAD. A summary risk
analysis fiom the Financial Management Questionnaire i s presented in Table 16. The



l4  PreparedbyIdaMuhoho (ECSPS).


                                             54

inherent risk associated with factors arising from the country's rules andregulations, based
on the CFAA's diagnostic work, is considered high for Azerbaijan,                The control risk,
which the project's accounting and intemal control frameworks are capable o f ensuring
that the project funds are used efficiently and for the purposes intended and that the use o f
hnds is properly reported, is considered moderate.

Accounting System, Policies and Procedures. The existing 1C accounting software is
considered adequate for project accounting and reporting. The PCU i s in the process o f
customizing the Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) for the project. The
existing accounting policies and procedures that are an integral part of the internal control
environment would be updated and documented inan Accounting and ProceduresManual
to enable management to monitor accounting transactions at all levels o f project
management.       The scope of the Manual encompasses project financial management
structure and staffing, identification of the accounting standards used by the Project,
project reporting formats and procedures for cash management, asset management,
procurement and disbursements, counterpart fundmanagement, budgetingand auditing.

Reporting and Monitoring. The project will prepare and produce quarterly Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The FMRs will comprise of: (i)Financial Reports; (ii)
Project Progress Report; and (iii)      Procurement Management Report. These reports will
provide informationon the progress of the project interms of financial activity, key output
measures and procurement for the relevant quarter. As for thefinancial reports, they will
include a statement showing periodical and cumulative cash receipts by source, and
expenditures by main expenditure classification, beginningand ending cash balances o fthe
project; and supporting schedules comparing actual and planned expenditures. The
reporting line items inthe FMRs will follow the project's Chart of Accounts.

The cumulative FMRs over the project year will be used as the project's annual financial
statements. As for the physicalprogress report, the project will include a narrative write
up and output indicators linking financial information with physical progress and will
highlight issues that require attention. In procurement reports under the FMRs, such
reports will provide information on the procurement of goods, works and related services,
andthe selection of consultants, as well as compliance with agreed procurement methods.
This report will compare procurement performance against the planagreed at negotiations
or subsequently updated and highlight key procurement issues such as staffing and
buildingcapacity. The reporting andformat ofthe FMRswas confirmedat negotiations.

Auditing Arrangement. The World Bank New Audit Policy will be applicable to this
Project. A single audit for the project's financial statements will be issued. The selected
auditor will, however, review arrangements regardingthe use of the Special Account and
the Statements of Expenditure".         The audit will be carried out by independentauditors in
accordance with standards and terms of reference acceptable to the B a d 6 . This will
include: (i) account audits; (ii) o f Statements of Expenditure; and (iii) o f
            project                          audit                                                 audit
the special account. These reports will be due within six months of the end o f each fiscal
year and also at the closing of the project. The scope of the audit will be determined by the
Borrower in agreement with IDA, and adaptedto project risks. The contract for the audit
would be awarded during the first year of project implementation and extended subject to

satisfactory performance. The cost o f the audit will be eligible for financing under the
Credit. The auditing arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.

Financial Covenants. The PCU will be required to maintain a financial management
system, including records and accounts, and prepare financial statements in a format
acceptable to the Bank, and be adequate to reflect operations, resources and expenditures
related to the project. In addition, they will be required to have these accounts and
financial statements audited each year and an audit submitted to the Bank no later than six
months after the end o f each year audited.

Financial Management Supervision. A risk-based approach financial management
supervision will be conducted at least every six months to ascertain that: (i)      financial
accounting andreporting is adequate; (ii)  fimd flow arrangements o f the project effectively
support the project's objectives; and (iii)the quarterly FMRs and the annual audit reports
(with accompanying Management Letters) are submitted on time and meet legal
requirements.

Impactof ProcurementArrangements

Based on diagnostic work carried out under the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR) issued in 2002, the following key factors have a direct effect on the financial
management arrangements:

    o Legal Framework and Enforcement Regime.            Azerbaijan has introduced a new
       Public Procurement Law (PPL) that is based extensively on the United Nations
        Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model. The PPL has set
       up a three-tier review system that consists o f an internal administrative review by
       the State Procurement Agency (SPA) and a judicial review. Perception o f the
       courts' ability to deal with procurement disputes is poor, thus jeopardizing the
        SPA'S level of confidence andoverall transparency inthe review process;

    o Regulatory Functions. The SPA has been vested with the procurement regulatory
        fimctions and has shown a willingness to ensure compliance with the Public
       Procurement Law (PPL).        The SPA has a competent and well-trained staff,
       however, some projects have been experiencing difficulties where conflicts
       between the PPL and Bank's Guidelines occur, despite assurance through the
        Constitutionthat the Bank's Guidelines should prevail.

The PCU at the NBA is staffed with a procurement specialist who is experiences inBank
procedures and requirements. The Project Accounting and Procedures Manual would
establish the links between procurement and financial management/disbursements
procedures.    A procurement assessment o f the Project was performed by a Bank
Procurement Specialist. It has been classified in the high-risk category, which is mainly
due to the generally low procurement capacity within the country and the fact that the
procurement process will be managed in a distributed fashion.         Therefore, successful




                                             59

procurement will be dependent on adequate coordination between the P C U and the TIU in
Azeri Post.

DisbursementPercentages

Standard Disbursement Percentages are established according to the Cuidelines for
Implementation of Bank Policy on Not Financing Local Income Taxes and should be
applied to expenditures on consultant services and the salaries of PCU staff financed from
Bank loans, credits, and certain types of grants for which invitations to negotiate were
issued on or after March 1, 2002. The standard disbursement percentages proposed for
Azerbaijan are shown in Table 17.1.              A detailed deliberation used to derive standard
disbursement percentages is available inthe project files (listed inAnnex 12).

Use of Statementsof Expenditures(SOEs)

SOEs would be used for expenditures under contracts for: (a) goods costing less than
U S D100,000 equivalent per contract; (b) for services of individual consultants costing less
than USD25,OOO equivalent per contract; (c) for services of consulting firms under
contracts costing less than USD50,OOO equivalent per contract; (d) training; and (e)
incremental operating costs.


                                                     60

Supporting documentation for SOEs would be retainedby the Borrower, made available to
the Association during project supervision, and audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Association. Disbursements for the expenditures above these thresholds
would be made against presentation o f full documentationrelating to those expenditures.

Special Account

To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government would establish
a Special Account (SA) in a commercial bank to be operated by the PCU under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. IDA would, upon request, make an authorized allocation
of USD500,OOO million. Initially the allocation would be limited to USD250,000, until
disbursements have reached SDR 3.0 million, at which time the full authorized allocation
could be claimed. Applications for the replenishment o f the SA would be submitted at
least every three months and would have to be supported by the necessary documentation
including the S A bank statement and a reconciliation o f this bank statement to the project's
accounting records. Independent auditors acceptable to the Association would audit the
S A annually.

       AZERBAIJAN: FINANCIAL SERVICESDEVELOPMENTPROJECT

Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out inaccordance with World Bank
Guidelines dated May 2004, including "Guide1ines:Procurement Under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits" and "Guide1ines:Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers", and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement.         The various items
under different expenditure categories are described ingeneral below. For each contract to
be financed by the Credit, the applicable procurement methods or consultant selection
methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and
time-frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually, or as required, to reflect the actual
project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in the January 2005 issue of
Development Business, announcing goods and consulting services to be procured and
inviting interested eligible suppliers and consultants to express interest and to request any
complementary information from the Borrower. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) will
be published in the on-line edition o f Development Business for all ICB contracts, and in
the printed edition at the option o f the Borrower. For goods to be procured through ICB,
individual bidding opportunities would also be advertised in a major local newspaper on
the same date (or within 5 days) o f the on-line publication. The local advertisements will
be in the English language and, at the option o f the Borrower, will also be in the local
language. For consultants' contracts above USD200,000, SPN/Request for Expression o f
Interest will be advertised in the on-line edition o f Development Business and in at least
one major national newspaper with wide circulation (in the national and English
languages). Civil servants can be hired as individual consultants or as members o f a team
with financing under the Loanprovided they are on leave o f absencewithout pay and they
have not been working for any o f the Beneficiary Agencies immediately prior to taking
leave o f absence.

Procurement of Works: It is envisaged that all works procured under this project, which
would include refirbishment and preparation works for local post offices and in
preparation for the satellite interconnectivity equipment under Component 1, would be
financed bythe beneficiaries.

Procurement of Goods: Goods to be procured under this project would include: (i)          IT
hardware and software under Component 1 to strengthen and expand the central functions
and the service provision capacity o f Azeri Post. Significant procurement o f IT hardware
will also be made for the regional and local post offices;               (ii)satellite based
interconnectivity equipment for both the hub and the post office network; and (iii)

hardware and software under Component 2, most likely specialized packages which will be
procured and customized to the need o fthe NBA.

Procurement will be normally done using the Bank's SBD for all I C B and National SBD
agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank. However, for the supply of Interconnectivity
equipment (earth station and associated hardware) an LIB procedure will be used. This is
justified because there are only a limitednumber o f firms who can provide this equipment

         International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Computer equipment and software under
         all components o f the Project for contracts above USD100,OOO equivalent per
         contract will be procured using I C B procedures in accordance with the Bank's
         Procurement Guidelines.

         Limited International Bidding (LIB). Bandwidthfor the satellite interconnectivity
         system will be procured under LIB as there are only a limited number o f known
         suppliers o f Ku-band communication services.            This procedure will be
         implemented inaccordance with paragraph 3.2 o f the Procurement Guidelines;

         Shopping (SH) procedure will be used for readily available off-the-shelf goods,
         including office and computer equipment for the beneficiaries and for minor
         computer equipment for the PCU. All items would have standard specifications,
         estimated to cost less than USD100,OOO equivalent per contract. This procedure
         will be based on obtaining and comparing price offers from at least three suppliers
         and at least two different countries in accordance with paragraph 3.5 o f
         Procurement Guidelines. It is recommended that the World Bank shopping site
         should be usedto draw up shortlists for simple computer equipment.

         National Competitive Bidding (NCB). Goods estimated to cost less than
         USD100,OOO equivalent per contract will be procured according to N C B
         procedures in accordance with paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 o f the Bank's Procurement
         Guidelines.

         Direct Contracting. Where certain goods are available only from a particular
         supplier or in cases where compatibility with existing equipment requires that
         goods must be procured under Direct Contracting (Single-source) and have
         obtained prior approval from IDA (in accordance with para. 3.6 o f the Procurement
         Guidelines)

 Procurement of non-consulting services: At this stage, the procurement o f any non-
 consulting services is not foreseen.

 Selectionof Consultants: Contracts for Consulting Services will bepackagedto combine
 related skills and services in order to make them attractive for competition and reduce the
 number o f contracts to be administered, taking into consideration the size o f the PCU and
 its limited capacity to administer a large number o f contracts. To the extent practicable,
 training activities would be incorporated with consulting services contracts. Consultant



                                              63

services consist of short- and long-term assignments to be contracted to firms andor
individuals (national and/or foreign or jointly) depending on the nature and duration of the
assignments. Selection procedures will generally be managed through competition among
qualified short listed consultants. The shortlists for consultant services contracts with firms
shall comprise six firms with a wide geographical spread, and with no more thantwo firms
from any one eligible country. The procurement o f consultant services contracts financed
under the Credit will be in accordance with the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines.
For consulting assignments exceeding USD200,OOO equivalent per contract, expressions of
interest will be obtained by advertisement in the Development Business (on-line),
supplemented with notices issued inthe nationalpress.

Shortlists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than USDlO0,OOO equivalent
per contract m a y be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the
provisions ofparagraph 2.7 ofthe Consultant Guidelines.

The following procurement procedures will be used for selection of consultant services:

        Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) procedures, as described in Section 11,
        paras. 2.1 to 2.31 of the Consultant Guidelines will be used if necessary for
        assignment under all Components ofthe Project;

        Least Cost Selection (LCS) procedure would be used for selection of an auditor to
        carry out audits o f the Financial Statements of the Project.

        Selection Based on Consultants ' Qualifications (CQ) will be used for contracting
        firms for certain assignments under all three components of the project for which
        the value o f the assignments is estimated to cost less than USD100,OOO equivalent
        per contract and where it is considered that a small team o f specialists would be
        more beneficial than a single individual.

        Individual Consultants (IC). Many specialized activities where specific skills are
        needed for short periods of time at scattered intervals, and which would not be
        practical to package with assignments for consulting firms described above, would
        be best served through the recruitment of individual consultants (both foreign and
        national).   For example: (i)for Azeri Post, resident advisers and short-term
        consultants to develop technical specifications, or to strengthen the core functions,
        or to assist in the development of new h c t i o n s (Component 1); (ii) NBA, to
                                                                                   for
        develop technical specifications, or assist in managing integration, or to develop
        payment risk management systems (Component 2); and (iii)        to assist the PCU/TIU
        invarious technical tasks (Component 3). Selection o f individual consultants will
        be carried out in accordance with Section V of the Consultant Guidelines.
        Individuals will be selected on the basis of their qualifications for the assignment
        by comparing the CVs obtained in response to an advertisement in the national
        press or Development Business.         Additional PCU staff could be selected as
        individual consultants; and




                                               64

(v)    Sole Source (SS). This method will be used for certain individuals with the prior
       approval of the Association inaccordance with paras. 3.9 to 3.13 o f the Consultants
       Guidelines;

Training Activities: Training is an integral element o f the project's capacity-building
objective. The Credit will finance training programs, including training workshops, study
tours and local training. Such training programs would be included in larger TA contracts
with firms to reduce the administrative burden on the PCU.            The P C U would be
responsible for administration o f a small number o f local workshops (including project
launch, mid-tenn and completion workshops) and a number o f study tours for beneficiaries
and PCUspecialists. Expenditures related to such training activities include: (a) for local
training and workshops - per diems for participants to cover transportation, lodging and
subsistence, minor organizational expenses (stationery, handouts, training materials, coffee
breaks); (b) for international study tours - international travel and visa costs, per diems
(lodging and subsistence) and course-related expenses (fixed tuition or participation fee).
Design o f the training courses and study tours will be done by the specialists contracted as
short-term consultants under relevant QCBS, CQ and/or I C procedures depending on the
value o fthe assignment as described above inthis Annex.

The PCU would be expected to prepare an annual training plan satisfactory to the
Association. The estimated budget, list o f participants and draft agenda for each training
event will be subject to prior review. Expenditure items for training activities, including
study tours, would be reported under SOEs. The status of the training plan would be
included as part o fthe quarterly progress reports, andwould be updated and/or modified as
maybe mutually agreed between the coordination units andthe Association.

OperatingCosts: Incremental operating costs incurred by the PCU for communications
and office supplies would be financed under the Credit for the duration o f the project. In
addition, recurrent costs related to operating andmaintenance o f equipment provided under
the project for the PCU and generated by the project, including the day-to-day operational
costs for office equipment and maintenance and consumables, will be financed by the
government.

Others:No Special Arrangements

The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as
model contracts for works and goods procured, are presented in the Project Operational
Manual.

Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement
Country Issues. A country procurement review (CPAR) for the Republic o f Azerbaijan
was carried out in2002 and finalized in2003. The CPAR concludes that, although certain
progress has been made and procurement reform has been highlighted as a priority in
Azerbaijan in the last two or three years, there i s still significant progress that could be
made. In 2001, Azerbaijan adopted a Public Procurement L a w (PPL), based extensively
on the UNCITRAL model. However, there are several significant areas where the
provisions of the PPL vary from the Bank's Guidelines and recent findings have shown
that the differences have caused problems inBank-financed operations. This is mainly due
to the State Procurement Agency's requirements that National Procedures are followed. In
particular, this appears to be caused by the fact that the PPL is silent concerning contracts
financed by donor b d s despite the fact that, in cases where there may be conflicts
between donor Guidelines and the PPL, these should, in accordance with the Constitution
(Article 151), be subject to the rules o f the donor agencies rather than local procurement
rules.

Subsequent to the passing o f the PPL in 2001 there was a Presidential Decree signed in
January 2002 comprising implementing mechanisms. Nevertheless, it is still common to
observe misapplication o f the provisions of this Law which result in dubious practices and
excessive political interference in contract award decisions in Azerbaijan. This has had a
delaying effect on Bank-financed procurement where some PIU directors (and
procurement staff) were unable to act effectively or make timely decisions due to
constraints applied by the State Procurement Agency.             The CPAR concludes that
Azerbaijan should be rated as a high-risk country in respect of the public procurement
system.

There are four issues that have been identified which appear to create problems for IDA-
financed procurement:
    (a) taxation and customs procedures - although there is a clear policy on taxation and
        customs duties for IDA-financed projects, this process is not always evident to the
        customs and tax officers and there are no clear procedures as to how apply this
        policy;
    (b) interference of the SPA in the procurement process - this has been described
        above;
    (c) problems with the issue and implementation of performance and bid securities, in
        that many o f the local banks are not familiar with the issuing of Bid securities and
        offen try to edit the standard IDA forms, which may lead to rejection of otherwise
        adequate bids; and
    (d) inadequate knowledge of international contracting concepts such as those
        governing Joint Ventures on the part of the PIU, or of managing Civil Works
        contracts;
Strengths and Weaknesses. The strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project
procurement management system include: (i)       project procurement independence through
the establishment of a dedicated PCU with a suitable staffing structure; (ii)       PCU has



                                              66

already gained experience with World Bank Guidelines and procurement requirements;
and (iii) is a general perception that Bank-financedprojects are fair intheir handling
         there
o fprocurement.

The main weaknesses o f the project procurement arrangements are that the PCU will be
located at NBA (fiduciary as well as implementation responsibility) and also at the
Ministry o f Communications and Information Technology (implementation responsibility).
There is some concern over the efficiency o f coordination for procurement activities. It is
intended to furtherbuildthe capacity o f the PCU staff at the NBA.

Procurement management is the responsibility o f the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
staff in the NBA. The PCU has a full-time procurement specialist in place, who is
experienced in World Bank procurement procedures under the Financial Sector Technical
Assistance Project. In addition to the Procurement Specialist, the PCU Director also has
experience in World Bank procurement.          The procurement capacity i s satisfactory;
however, there i s room for improvement in a number o f areas. In particular, the P C U
procurement capacity needs to be strengthened regarding procurement o f IT equipment in
anticipation of ICB tenders for computer and satellite equipment and software. The PCU
procurement and financial management staff would work closely with the TIU staff, and
would be expected to have regular weekly meetings in order to ensure that a proper
coordination o f activities is maintained.

A series o f workshops, initiated bythe Project Launchworkshop scheduled around March
2005, would be the initial vehicle for training staff at MOCIT and at Azeri Post, who will
charged with the preparation o f all Technical Specifications for the project.

Inanticipationofproject implementation, the PCUisworking to finalize the POMwhich
will include a detailed description o f procurement methods and*proceduresto be used by
the Project. The POM will be reviewed and approved by the Association as a condition o f
effectiveness. Any changes in the procedures set forth in the POM will be subject to the
Association's approval, prior to implementation.

An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to put into practice
procurement actions for the project has been performed by the Procurement Accredited
Specialist (PAS) assigned to the project during appraisal in April 2004. The assessment
reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction
betweenthe project's staff responsible for procurement and for administration and finance.
The key identified issues and risks concerning procurement include the limited capacity o f
the procurement specialists concerning more complex IT procurements. A second issue is
that MOCIT and Azeri Post staff have no experience with IDA-financed procurement, thus
placing greater pressure on the PCU capacity.       Corrective measures which have been
agreed include attendance at a Regional Procurement Workshop prior to the start o f the
Project, training at ILO, Turin and maintaining low review thresholds for the first year o f
the Project untilbetter capacity has been developed.

The overall project risk for procurement is high.

ProcurementPlan

The Procurement Plan contains all the relevant procurement information, including prior
review thresholds for IDA-financed contracts.       For procurement under the Credit, the
Borrower will use the Bank's latest Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD), Standard Form
o f Consulting Contracts and Request for Proposals (RFP), and Standard Bid Evaluation
Report Forms. The Standard BiddingDocuments for procurement o f Information Systems
would be used for procurements o f all IT equipment estimated to cost over USD100,OOO
per contract These will comprise Supply and Installation o f Information Systems -- Single
Stage Bidding or Supply and Installation o f Information Systems -- Two Stage Bidding
(both the version of March2003 or more recent). Also, the sample procurement documents
and forms developed inECA Region for small value procurement would be adapted to suit
the Project needs for procurement as outlined inthe POM.

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
which provides a basis to decide on procurement methods. The planhas been agreed upon
at negotiations and is attached as to Annex 8. It will be available at the PCU, in the
project's database and in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be
updated annually, in agreement with the Association, or as required to reflect the actual
project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

Inadditionto theprior-review supervisionto becarriedout fromBank offices, the capacity
assessment has recommended two field-visit supervision missions annually to cany out
post- review of procurement actions.         It is envisaged that two out o f every five
procurementswill be reviewed ex-post.

'*The  Azeri Post financial statements shown in Annex 9 are IAS based. They have been derived from the
Azeri Post financial statements developed according to national accounting rules. More detailed information
about accounting usedby Azeri Post is provided later in the text. There is an on-going reform o f national
accounting to bring it into full compliance with International Accounting Standards and International
Financial Reporting Standards. The new Accounting Law was passed by Parliament in April 2004 and i s
expected to be enactedby end - June 2004. Further information on accounting reform is available inAnnex
8.

l9 Duringthe first quarter of 2004, distributions totaling USD1.2 million were made to MOT, representing
the net income eamed for 2003, thereby reducing the capitalization o f Azeri Postby an equivalent amount.
                                                     75

Ofthe total assets o fUSD10.8 million, property andequipment amount to USD6.9 million,
or 64 percent oftotal assets. Property and equipment are comprised primarily o fbuildings,
automobiles, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures, and are recorded at original
cost net o f depreciation. Buildings depreciate at the rate o f 7 percent o f carrying value
annually. Computers and automobiles depreciate over 4 years and furniture depreciates
over 5 years using the straight-line method. Depreciation expenses increased by 29 percent
because o fnewly- constructed buildings brought into service in2003.

Collections payable on the balance sheet are comprised primarily o f pension funds
received from the state on December 31,2003 awaiting payment to beneficiaries in early
January 2004. This balance also includes collections on telephone and utility bills and
pending remittance to beneficiary institutions. These liabilities are reflected in the cash
balance o f USD3,002,000 as o f December 31, 2003. Miscellaneous assets inthe balance
sheet are comprised primarily o f prepayments for inventory o f state lottery tickets and
prepaidtaxes.

Note on Accounting Records. Azeri Post uses the accrual basis of accounting and most
short-term and longer-term obligations and receivables are reflected in their accounting
records. Azeri Post does not accrue for utilities and rent, but the potential adjustments to
reflect these in the financial statements were determined to be minor.         Property and
equipment on the balance sheet are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Azeri
Post owns a relatively small number o f its 1,167 offices nationwide. The buildings owned
are primarily the regional offices and some o f the newly-constructed rural post offices.
Most o f the offices are rented through annual lease agreements arranged by the Ministry o f
Economic Development (MED). Fifty percent o f the rent payments are made to the MED
and fifty percent is paid to building owners. Azeri Post does not pay rent on rural post
offices that occupy space instate-owned buildings.

Operating Revenues. In2003, there was a strong revenue growth o f 23 percent, with the
strongest growth coming from telephone services (35 percent) and money orders (33
percent) (see Income Statement inTable 19). Fees for telephone services range from 4-10
percent o f collections on intercity and overseas calls made from home telephones. Azeri
Post also splits 50-50 with MOCIT the revenues it derives from post-office-based intercity
phone calls. The fee for its pension payment services was 0.95 percent o f total payments
in2003. "Other revenue" inthe Income Statement is comprisedprimarilyofrevenues from
sale o f calling cards and general post-office merchandise such as cards, stationary, and
periodicals.

reduction o f the capital account in the balance sheet presented in Table 18; (ii)  loans to
former employees and retired staff amounting to USD381,000, which are continuing to be
reflected inthe accounting records by management and which are deemed not collectable,

Growth rates for most revenue sectors are assumed to be 10 percent per year, except for
collection fees, which are expected to stabilize at 2003 levels, and pension payment fees,
which are expected to decline dramatically due to reforms o f the PensionFundand transfer
to electronic payment instruments, with zero revenues expected from this sector in2005.

The following assumptions were used for the projections: (i) Post's annual capital
                                                                      Azeri
spending from operating cash flows i s expected to continue at the current level to refurbish
the existing post offices and network; (ii)        in addition, new capital contributions totaling
USD2.5 million will be made as part o f the new project fbnding for investments in
computer and communications technology, which will depreciate over the four-year
period, starting from the day o f installation; (iii)    additional investments will be made in
computer software, site preparation, technical assistance and training. Such investments
would not require depreciation; and (iv) the current average salary for Azeri Post's 3,800
employees i s USD850 per year. The average postman's salary i s about USDSOO per year.
With the induction o f new technology, and the expected higher value-added services that


                                                   80

Azeri Post will provide, the projections assumes an average annual increase of
approximately 23 percent for total salaries over the next five years. This includes about 30
percent annual increase for senior management and technical staff to bring salaries in line
with salary structure o f an institution providing financial services and about 10 percent
annual increase in salaries for staff who would continue to provide traditional Azeri Post
services.

Revenues for utility bill collection fees and for `other' non-standard revenues are expected
to increase substantially. This would be the result o f new investments in computer and
communications technology, which will dramatically increase the capacity o f regional and
rural post offices to provide payment and other types o f financial services to clients. For
example, Azeri Post started to experiment with utility bill collection services on a small
number o f locations in larger urban areas but, with its current technology, has not been
able to extend the services in the whole territory. This will change with the new
organization and technology. Also, Azeri Post will be able to provide a host o f other
services to the Government and other clients (e.g,, banks) in the whole territory o f
Azerbaijan.

The project is expected to result in a substantially better earning capacity for Azeri Post
and, therefore, in better financial circumstances.                                 The projections assume a fairly fast
growth in revenues. However, the increase i s potentially so large, that even a slower
growth is tolerable. The solution would be to carefully select the locations for the three
phases o f postal network extensiodcoverage, starting from the locations where revenue
growth is expected to be faster and thus allowing for cross-subsidization, and a slower
increase inrevenues and services inmore remote rural locations.

Broad Band VSAT Network Capacity Estimates (Space Segment)

The interconnectivity will be deployed over three phases, which will include 200, 500 and
 500 remote terminals, respectively. The VSAT system capacity is estimated by separately
 calculatingvoice requirements (Table 23) and data requirements (Table 24).

Note: 2/3 coding rate is assumed

Based on the results o f data and voice information capacity calculations, Table 25 is used
to generate overall VSAT satellite bandwidth requirements. It is estimated that a four
Aloha request for in-routes will be needed for system operation. Also, all calculations are
done for Intelsat IS-904 (60 degrees, East) satellite, spot 1. For this transponder a
conversion o f Mbps to Mhz i s calculated using a 1.4 conversion factor. It i s also assumed


                                                                     82

that OQPSK modulation i s used with ?4turbo coding for in-routes and 2/3 coding for out-
routes.

As shown in Table 25, total required satellite bandwidth for filly operational VSAT
network with 1200 operational terminals would be 12Mhz. However, for each phase o f
implementation, 2Mhz, 7Mhz and 12 Mhz would be required respectively. Although the
list price for Mhz/month over Intelsat's Ku-Bandtransponders is around USD3,800, it is
realistic to expect to obtain (through competitive procurement) a price o f around
USD3,OOO. Based on this assumption, monthly costs for satellite bandwidth required to
operate this network would be around USD36,OOO.

Bandwidth calculations assume that all 1,200 postal offices will be interconnected via
satellite.  This will be adjusted during implementation, as some o f the offices may be
interconnectedvia fiber-optic channels. The decision on the type o f interconnectivity to be
used will be made on the least-cost, adequate-functionality basis for each postal office
location. For locations where optical fiber connectivity is available and less costly to use,
this solution will bepreferred.

CommunicationsEquipmentCost Estimates

Equipment in local post offices will include: (i)     interconnectivity-related communication
equipment; (ii)   at least one high-capacity PC-based computer remote-access terminals that
would interconnect with the central application systems and allow data updates in real
time. The PC will be equipped with standard office productivity enhancement tools; (iii)
two telephones, one for staff and one for third party services; (iv) one fax machine with
full interconnectivity; and (v) a scanner andprinter. Ifneeded, more active offices could
increase their requirements.

Local post office communications equipment costs are summarized inTable 26. As shown
inthe table, beside VSAT equipment, offices would be equipped with a telephone and a
facsimile set. Please note that each office will also be equipped with PC. However, costs
for data equipment are shown under the IT component o f the same project. As shown in
Table 26, combined communications costs for remote post office would be around
USD2,500.

A s shown in the table above, it is estimated that monthly operational costs2' per remote
post office in phase one will be USD85, in phase two USD49 and inphase three USD41.
This difference i s mostly determined by fixed operational costs, which are not dependant
on the number of operational VSAT terminals. These services are related to the central hub
operational services and remote terminals sparing and maintenance. It is obvious that the
economy of scale factor indicates that the highest efficiency would be achieved if the
V S A T network were deployed ina short time-frame.




2oEstimated costs do not include licensing fees for the network operation. From the information obtained,
these costs are around USD8per monthper remote terminal.
