F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the Project are to facilitate the implementation of the country?s Poverty
Reduction Strategy and economic reform programs related to regional development and


                                                 ii
development of the non-oil sector through improvements of the access of the rural
population to financial services and improvements in the financial architecture.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO approved by the Board in December 2009 was to increase efficient
access to financial services in targeted cities, rayon centers and rural areas and support
adoption of a strategic framework for an efficient payment system infrastructure.

  Note 1: The original macro-level PDO and indicators are not taken into account in the
project evaluation because they are too high-level to be used for evaluating a 5-year
project, as causality cannot be established.

  The original and revised access to finance objective is basically the same. The result
framework provides data only on the revised indicators. They measure broadly the same
activities as the original indicators, but are more specific and have targets. The comment
section refers to the related original indicators.

  The original objective related to the payment system was based on a broader scope of
project activities than the revised objective. Data on the original indicators is provided in
Annex 15. Data on the revised indicators is provided in the below result framework.
Some original results are also demonstrated through the revised indicators related to the
access to finance objective.

  Note 2: Since the project was restructured in December 2009, the result framework
provides data on the outcomes as of December 2009 and at the closing of the project
(June 30, 2010) or based on the latest available information if more progress was shown
after the closing date.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background. Starting from 2000, Azerbaijan registered a strong, broad-based
economic growth across all sectors. Yet the country was one of the seven lowest income
countries within Europe and Central Asia Region. While its future was considered to hold
tremendous promise because of oil and gas resources, which it was developing,
diversified development of the non-oil sector was regarded as key for generating jobs and
equity beyond the end of the oil boom, in particular in rural and underdeveloped regions.
In order to take advantage of such opportunities, enhancing access to finance, especially
by SMEs in the non- oil sector, was deemed a priority.

Access to financial services, in particular in rural areas. In 2004, small urban areas
and rural areas were not adequately served by the banking and non banking sectors, and
lacked adequate payment and broader financial services1. The banks did not see a
profitable business case in extending such services outside Baku (as such, they had 199
branches in Baku and only 155 in regions), and operations of microfinance institutions
were also limited (25 institutions)2. The banking sector ­ 44 banks, of which one large
public bank largely dominated the sector ­ was deemed not effective in supporting the
non oil sector. Banking system assets accounted for 28% of GDP in 2004 with 67% held
by the largest bank whose business was focused on the oil-sector and large state-owned
enterprises. Access to payment and financial services outside of Baku was very low,
inconvenient and costly. The economy was largely cash-based, as shown by significantly
low volumes and value of transactions processed through both the Azerbaijan Interbank
Payment System (AZIPS) and the Bulk Clearing Settlement System (BCSS)3. These
conditions were not conducive to non-oil sector growth, nor to financial inclusion.

AzerPost. AzerPost4 had a network of 1,200 post offices in 2004 covering the entire
territory of the country, including 1,021 in rural areas and 270 in Baku, cities and rayon
centers. AzerPost was the only institution providing payment and financial services in

  The number of branches per 1,000 square kilometers was 3.90, the number of branches per 100,000
people was 4.11 (source: World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3754, October 2005). The Financial
Sector Assessment Program of the World Bank identified the lack of access to financial services in rural
areas as one of the key problems. The 2002 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS) had showed quite a significant improvement of the business environment, but this progress was
considered not more than a promising platform for continuing efforts to improve the governance, anti-
corruption and business environment nexus. The 2005 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey (BEEPS) identified access to finance as the 3rd most severe problem in doing business in 2005.
Only 25% of the firms considered it not a problem.

  Volume of payments: 370,000 new Azerbaijani manat, AZN, through AZIPS and AZN 538,000 through
BCSS; value of payments: AZN 10,164 million through AZIPS and AZN 679,000 through BCCS (Annex
10).

  AzerPost was a state-owned enterprise established in 1999 under the MoCIT. AzerPost was designated to
be the national postal services provider according to the Postal Law from June 2004 and Order #122 of the
Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT) from October 2004.

smaller urban centers and rural areas. However it could, if equipped, provide only three
types of cash-based financial services: postal money orders, pensions and social security
payments. Efficiency was low because, as AzerPost utilized the available old
connectivity system of the Ministry of Communication an Information Technology
(MoCIT), its speed was slow, only 220 post offices were connected to it (of which 120 in
Baku and 100 in regions) and transactions were done via paper. Without the connection,
transactions were delivered by mail or by a postman5.

Payment system infrastructure. For more than a decade the Central Bank of Azerbaijan
Republic (CBA6) had played a very active role in the launching of more efficient
interbank payment systems, expanding access to banking services and increasing
transparency within the banking system in Azerbaijan. The CBA's payment system
infrastructure included the key elements for electronic processing of interbank payments7,
but it did not yet effectively integrate all the payments clearing and settlement systems (in
particular, there was a lack of integration of the BCSS with the large sources of small
value payments, i.e., utilities) neither covered the entire territory of the country nor
included effective risk management in payment systems. Collection of utility bills and
execution of government payments was ineffective, costly and slow, contributing to the
poor financial condition and service quality of utilities. Cash was the predominant form
of payments in Azerbaijan and the payment card base was low (Annex 10).

Towards modern electronic payment services. The State Program for the Development
of the National Payment System that was approved by the President in 2004 for the
period 2005-2007 aimed to: (a) extend the access to payment and financial services by
the underserved rural population in Azerbaijan; and (b) promote availability and the use
of electronic payment options for bill payments for citizens and businesses throughout
Azerbaijan. It envisioned using a modernized AzerPost as an instrument for increasing
access to financial services in the underserved areas by integrating it with the payment
system.

World Bank assistance. The Financial Services Development Project supported two
strategic goals in the fiscal year (FY) 2003-2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that
were designed to support the 2004 State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic
Development. The strategic goals included: (a) generating jobs and non-oil sector growth

  Postal money orders were transferred electronically in 15 minutes if a post office was connected to the
MoCIT's old system or by mail, in 1-2 days in the absence of connection to this system. Payment of
pensions and social benefits was paper and cash-based or delivered by mail. Utility payments were made
directly to the utility companies everywhere in the country.
6
  According to the Referendum Act of Azerbaijan Republic dated March 18, 2009, "the National Bank of
Azerbaijan Republic" was renamed as "the Central Bank of Azerbaijan Republic". The ICR refers to CBA.
7
  The payment systems of the CBA included the AZIPS since 2001 (Azerbaijan Interbank Payment System)
for large and high priority payments and the BCSS since 2002 (Bulk Clearing Settlement System) for low
value payments. Each payment system participant was obliged to have an account at the CBA. There was
one card processing center, AzeriCard LLC (1997) that accounted for most transactions. The World Bank
Second Institution Building Technical Assistance Project (Credit No. 3663-AZ) and Financial Sector
Technical Assistance Project (Credit No. 3518-AZ) financed the establishment of these systems (except for
AzeriCard LLC).

by improving the business infrastructure and access to financial services and building
support infrastructure for small and medium-sized enterprises; and (b), in the long term,
managing oil boom growth by facilitating non-oil growth, employment and pro-poor
expenditures. The rationale for the World Bank assistance was based on its involvement
in development of the national payment system infrastructure under the previous World
Bank projects and lack of other donor financing available at that time to support
AzerPost. In line with the Government's strategies, AzerPost was chosen as the target for
the strategy of broadening financial services to underserved areas (instead of banks)
because of: (a) its much larger network and existing office infrastructure; (b) its ability to
offer a much wider range of services than banks (e-government); (c) the importance of
creating competition to the dominant bank (as per the PAD).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators8

The original PDO of the Project aimed to facilitate the implementation of the country's
Poverty Reduction Strategy and economic reform programs related to regional
development and development of the non-oil sector through improvements of the access
of the rural population to financial services and improvements in the financial
architecture9.

The original macro-level key indicators were:

         Faster non-oil growth in smaller urban and rural areas (due to better access to
         financial and business services); increased number of private enterprises in
         smaller urban and rural areas and increased employment (due to better access to
         finance and market related services); increased share of the non-oil private sector
         in the economy (due to better access to financial and business services in smaller
         urban and rural areas); reduced financial transaction costs (due to the use of
         electronic payment instruments and integration of rural areas into the national
         payment system); and reduction of the share of cash-based transactions in the
         economy.

The original project-level key indicators for the AzerPost Component and CBA
Payment System Infrastructure Component, respectively, were:

         Larger number of AzerPost's automated service functions allowing for
         deployment to regional and local post offices; more types of financial and
         business services available in regional offices, larger service volumes; larger

  The original key indicators related to macro-level impact were included in the legal agreement and were
in line with the performance indicators of the FY2003-2005 CAS for the objective of generating jobs and
non-oil growth. They are listed here, but they are not taken into account in the project evaluation neither the
macro-level PDO. They are too high-level to be used for evaluating a 5-year project, as causality cannot be
established. The "Project Implementation Performance Indicators", as such or as revised, are taken into
account in the evaluation (Section 1.3).

  The PDO in Annex 3 of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD): "support economic growth and job
creation for the non-oil sector in smaller urban and rural areas and facilitate financial markets development."

       number of regional offices with comprehensive services available; more types of
       financial and other services available in local post offices, larger service volumes;
       and larger number of locations in rural areas with financial services available.

       Number of components of the national payment system that are fully functional
       (completed according to the national payment systems strategy schedule); larger
       number of payment transactions registered in the bulk payment system; lower
       number of failures to complete payment transactions, as indicators of the effective
       management of payment system risks; larger number of cards issued (higher
       percentage of transactions where electronic payment instruments were used).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The revised PDO were to increase efficient access to financial services in targeted cities,
rayon centers and rural areas, and support adoption of a strategic framework for an
efficient payment system infrastructure. The World Bank Board approved the revision to
the PDO in December 2009 to more closely measure the outcomes of the original and
restructured project. The result framework was revised by dropping some indicators and
refining others, as explained below. In addition, the Bank team, AzerPost and the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) further clarified some revised indicators in the aide-memoire
dated from May 2010 (these revisions are shown below in italics).

The revised project-level key indicators were the following:

       Percentage of targeted post offices in: (a) cities; (b) rayon centers (small urban
       areas); and (c) rural areas (villages) that have access to newly automated financial
       services provided by AzerPost; volume of automated financial services provided
       by AzerPost (provided on the basis of the old and/or newly automated systems);
       number of automated financial services transactions provided by AzerPost
       (provided on the basis of the old and/or newly automated systems); cost efficiency
       demonstrated by the reduction in the fee charged by an agent bank to AzerPost for
       (a) ATM and over-the-counter withdrawals and (b) domestic money transfer;
       productivity of AzerPost measured as revenues/number of staff; status of the
       strategic framework for reducing the share of cash-based payment transactions in
       the economy.

The original macro-level key indicators were dropped because they did not measure
results achievable from project investments during the project life. The PAD did not
include targets for these indicators.

With regards to the original project-level key indicators for the AzerPost Component,
some were moved to the PDO level and refined to more accurately measure the project
results. The beneficiaries remained the same (Section 1.4). The PAD did not include
targets for these indicators except for the number of AzerPost offices to be connected
(1,200). This target was adjusted to reflect the phased implementation of the
interconnectivity of AzerPost offices by the MoCIT. Namely, at appraisal, the project
planned to connect the 1,200 post offices within the AzerPost network, including 213


                                             4
post offices in cities, 107 post offices in rayon centers and 880 post offices in rural areas.
At the time of the project restructuring in 2009, 1,029 out of the 1,200 offices were
expected to be connected to the AzerPost's new system by the closing date of the project.
The remaining 171 (1,200-1,029) post offices in remote areas were to be connected via
satellite by the MoCIT after connecting the other post offices. The achievement of the
target is calculated based on 1,029 post offices.

With regards to the original project-level key indicators for the National Payment
System Infrastructure Component, they were dropped due to changes in this component
(Sections 1.6 and 1.7). A new indicator (status of the strategic framework for reducing
the share of cash-based payment transactions in the economy) was added to measure
what the project financed (excluding the outcomes financed by the CBA from its own
resources). One AzerPost Component indicator ­ cost efficiency demonstrated by the
reduction in the fee charged by an agent bank to AzerPost for ­ also measured the results
from connecting AzerPost to the payment system.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Financially underserved populations were the key primary target group, especially in
small urban and rural areas. Additionally, small businesses that did not have adequate
access to payments and financial services were also expected to benefit from more
convenient, efficient, affordable and safer access to a wide range of automated postal and
financial services in Azerbaijan. The services included provision of both existing services
and new ones, such as payments of salaries, issuance of debit and credit cards,
international remittances, e-government and e-commerce (Annex 11). During the project
restructuring, e-government and e-commerce services were dropped (Section 1.7).

The direct project beneficiaries included AzerPost, the CBA and participants in the
national payment system ­ other non-financial service providers, such as utility
companies. The institutional and service capacity of the AzerPost network would be
greatly improved and its product offerings extended. The AzerPost office would be
interconnected and integrated, just as do commercial banks, through direct access to a
centralized system managed by CBA for bill payments and collections. The national
payment system architecture would serve the entire country through the connectivity
between the AzerPost platform with the BCSS and AZIPS. This would result in providing
a safe and efficient payment and settlement platform for commercial banks, leading to
growth in financial services, as well as more effective payment risk management system.

1.5 Original Components

The project included two main components, one to the benefit of AzerPost aimed at
building its capacity, focusing on providing access to financial services throughout the
regions of Azerbaijan, and one aimed at building the country's payment infrastructure.

Component 1 (goods, consultant services, training): the AzerPost Platform Component
aimed at improving AzerPost's institutional and service capacity, focusing on its capacity
to provide access to financial services. Specifically, it aimed at improving capacity for:


                                              5
(i) providing access to automated and partially new financial services, including
electronic payments (pensions, social security, remittances) and collections (utility
payments, taxes), money transfers, deposits, selling of savings accounts, issuance of debit
cards; (ii) delivering electronic-based government; and (iii) delivering electronic-based
business services. The institution building program was to improve its operational,
management, accounting, financial and risk management, operational functions, as well
as marketing and product and services infrastructure and information technology
capacity. The targeted 1,200 AzerPost post offices would be connected by implementing
a satellite-based information and communication technology (ICT) platform supported by
the project (unless a more cost effective solution, such as fiber optic cables, became
available during the course of project implementation).

Component 2 (goods, consultant services, training): the National Payment System
Architecture Component aimed at developing the national payment system architecture
within CBA10 by: (i) providing risk management system software to improve the safety
and security of retail payments in Azerbaijan; (ii) creating an interface between the BCSS
and utility companies, i.e. transmission of payments information to utility companies (and
taxes, custom payments, social security, pensions) on payments processed through the
BCSS; and (iii) creating an interface for the AzerPost platform to link with the BCSS to
provide payment services in rural areas with the national payment system architecture. In
addition, TA to design and implement the new payment system modules and necessary
training was to be provided to the CBA and to other participants in this component.

Component 3 (consultant services, training, incremental operating costs): the Project
Management Component aimed at building the technical skills necessary for managing
project implementation of the PCU in the CBA and in the Technical Implementation Unit
(TIU) of the MoCIT. It was also to finance project audits.

1.6 Revised Components

In December 2009, the Board approved revisions to the project components (as part of a
project "corrective" restructuring), including in particular the elimination from
Component 1 of the provision by AzerPost of e-government and e-business services, with
the intention to focus on the main project objective, i.e. the provision of financial services.
In addition, the payment system component was reduced in scope to recognize that a
large share of planned investments had been implemented by the government directly
without project funds11.


10
   Component 2 description in the legal agreement: "improvement of institutional and technical capacity to
implement a strategy on the national payment system acceptable to the Association, through provision of
goods, consultants' services and training."
11
   The CBA had expanded Component 2 (ii) to include the creation of an interface between the BCSS and
utility companies (Annex 2). A feasibility study from early 2006 financed under the Financial Sector
Technical Assistance Credit (Credit No. 3518-AZ) showed that mere transmission of information was not
satisfactory to these companies and that a new system with broader functional capacity should be
established. The CBA launched procurement of the system to operate a centralized information system for
mass payments (CISMP) to be financed partially under the project financing and mostly from CBA's own

 1.7 Other significant changes

 Implementation approach and component costs: In order to maximize effectiveness, a
 new implementation approach was taken in 2007 which changed the distribution of
 project costs within Component 1 (Annexes 1, 2 and 3). First, the TA was consolidated
 under one main consultant contract in early 2007 ("the integrated TA") to improve the
 efficiency of TA delivery and absorption. Second, based on findings of a diagnostic made



 resources. As the bid price of the winning bid for the Credit-financed portion exceeded the available
 funding under the Credit and there was pressure to implement the system quickly, the CBA decided in the
 end of 2006 to finance the system from its own resources. Thus, this activity was removed from the project.




                                                              7
under this consolidated contract, the proThanject partners decided in 2007 that both
postal and financial service businesses of AzerPost needed to be fundamentally and
equally restructured in order to achieve the project objectives on a sustainable basis12.
Third, based on the same diagnostic and the stakeholders' strategic decision, it was
deemed necessary to procure a large automated corporate management information
system - as opposed to a small productivity enhancing software, as planned during
appraisal - to support the new structure, the two business lines and the new functionalities.
Fourth, the project partners agreed in 2007 that the targeted 1,200 offices will be
connected mainly using landline and wireless connections instead of satellite connections,
as envisioned in the appraisal document. These changes were recorded in the December
2009 restructuring approved by the Board.

Implementation schedule. In February 2009, World Bank management approved
extension of the closing date from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010. The extension was
justified by the lack of qualified staff at AzerPost to initially engage with the consultants
hired under the FSDP and procurement delays caused by slow processing of some key IT
procurement packages and subsequent implementation delays in the AzerPost component
(Section 2.2).

Cofinancing: In March 2008, World Bank management approved a Borrower-executed
grant funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) in the amount
of US$ 612,500 (TF091639) and effective May 27, 2008 (Annexes 1 and 2). The grant
was aimed at further helping improve access to financial services in rural areas by
financing TA for: (a) reorganizing and developing the institutional capacity and internal
procedures of AzerPost and supporting adoption of the new corporate information
system; and (b) preparing and disseminating financial consumer protection diagnostic
analysis for bank and non-bank consumer protection in Azerbaijan. The latter activity
was aimed at helping develop a consumer protection regime in Azerbaijan since
consumer participation in financial markets had increased as had the number of consumer
complaints about financial services providers. The activity was considered important in
terms of further increasing consumers' confidence in financial sector during the financial
crisis, as well as supporting the project in increasing improved access to financial
services (Section 2.2). The closing date of the grant was extended by nine months to
December 31, 2009 because of procurement and implementation delays of project
activities13.

Reallocation: As part of the December 2009 project restructuring, the Board approved a
reallocation of a total of SDR 271,807.97 from Consultants Services and Training
Categories to Goods Category within the AzerPost Component (Annex 1). These savings
had arisen from consolidating a number of individual consultant assignments under one

modernizing business functions and systems and interconnecting the branch network, focusing more on its
capacity to provide access to financial services.

   Procurement delays were related to contracting a training institution in 2009. Implementation delays
were related to complex implementation of the consumer protection activities.

main integrated TA contract. The savings were used for financing the improved
functional capacity and interconnectivity of the AzerPost network to provide automated
postal-financial services.

Cancellation: As part of the December 2009 project restructuring, the Board likewise
approved cancellation of SDR 713,140.07 of the Credit amount (Annex 1). This included:
(a) cancellation of SDR 613,140.07 intended for Goods, Consultants Services and
Training under Component 2 because Sub-components (i) and (ii) were implemented
outside the project from CBA's own resources and Sub-component (iii) was financed
under the AzerPost Component (as part of implementing the automated corporate
information system); and (b) cancellation of SDR 100,000 intended for Consultants
Services under Component 3 due to the savings achieved. After the closure of the project,
SDR 443,220.42 was cancelled.

Financing plan. The Borrower counterpart funding, as reflected in the project financial
management reports, was $0.4 million compared to $5.5 million, as estimated at
appraisal (Annex 1). The original amount of $5.5 million included the estimated cost of
$4.1 million for refurbishing and building AzerPost's branches and local offices and
some minor training and goods investments that the Borrower was going to finance. They
were excluded from the project financial management reporting since they were
implemented according to the counterparts' own procedures. Counterpart funding greatly
exceeded the estimates as, according to the MoCIT, MoCIT spent more than AZN 25
million ($31 million) for construction and modernization of AzerPost offices, building
treasury boxes and establishing interconnectivity. In addition, CBA established the
CISMP from its own resources. However, the project actual counterpart funding was
only of $0.4 million, including only the MoCIT's/AzerPost's and CBA's local
counterpart funding connected with the IDA financing.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis: The project benefited from sound background
analysis, which influenced its implementation and outcomes positively14, especially with
regards to analyzing and incorporating lessons learned about: (a) using postal systems as
an instrument for providing access to financial services in underserved areas; and (b)
using the existing PCU for project management and fiduciary work. With the sole
network of outlets covering all cities and villages in Azerbaijan, the post office proved
indeed to be an ideal choice to anchor an expansion of financial services throughout the
country.

However, there were some shortcomings in the analysis that affected the project, but
were partially mitigated by active project management and flexibility in project design
(Section 2.2). First, a deeper initial institutional assessment of AzerPost's human and


14
     The Financial Sector Assessment Program, BEEPS, the previous World Bank projects.


                                                    9
financial resources would have helped design a more intensive TA program to reduce the
initial project management and implementation delays (Section 2.2). Second, on one hand,
the ICT costs for AzerPost were overestimated because they were benchmarked against
available technological options at the time of the design of the project. On the other hand,
they were underestimated because the scope of the required system software and
automation was underestimated (Section 1.7).

Assessment of the project design. The project-level objectives were clear, important and
responsive to the development priorities of the Borrower's and the CAS, and the related
project-level indicators were mostly appropriate for the objectives15. The relevance of the
objective contributed positively to the project implementation and outcomes. The
implementation delays with the AzerPost Component, however, showed that the
objectives were complex and ambitious to be implemented in 5 years due to their scope
and AzerPost's and key stakeholders' implementation capacity. In addition, the
component objective and design ­ the extent of planned TA, functional improvements
and ICT support to improve the institutional and service capacity of AzerPost ­
underestimated what proved to be required to achieve the objectives on a sustainable
basis.

Adequacy of Government commitment. The project benefited from adequate
Government's commitment and support. This affected the implementation and outcomes
positively. The commitment was demonstrated in: (a) the State Program for Development
of the National Payment System in Azerbaijan for 2005-2007 approved by the President
in December 2004 which enlisted the full backing of the Government for the next phase
of national payment system reforms in moving towards cashless economy and which saw
the modernized AzerPost as a key instrument in facilitating non-cash operations and
increasing access to financial services in rural areas; (b) the MoCIT's commitment to
finance the site preparation of AzerPost's offices in the amount of $4.1 million, as
estimated at appraisal (Section 2.2); and (c) successful implementation of the national
payment reforms under the previous World Bank-financed projects.

Assessment of risks. The risks, mitigations measures and ratings were correctly
identified with a few exceptions. The strategic programs and involvement of Government
structures adequately mitigated the key high-level risks to the objectives. The fact that
there was no new legal framework for AzerPost providing financial services in 2004 and
that the project was launched based on the Government's commitment did not affect the
project implementation significantly due to project implementation delays (Section 2.2)16.
Shortcomings included inadequate mitigation of risks related to AzerPost's constrained


15
   The ICR does not take the macro-level indicators into account since they were CAS level objectives and
outside the reach of the project during the project life. They reflected the national importance of the project.
16
   The risk assessment section in the PAD mentioned that a new Law on Postal Operations was issued; that
AzerPost's governance arrangements were improved; and that improved autonomy and accountability will
be ensured in the on-lending legal framework. These improvements materialized later, but this delay did
not significantly affect the project outcomes due to delays in making project investments (i.e., the 2008
Amendment to the Postal Law, the new Articles of Incorporation for AzerPost from 2009 and the 2010
CBA license).


                                                      10
human and financial resources. These risks materialized and proved to be high instead of
substantial/modest. This had a negative impact on implementation until early 2008 and
delayed achievement of the outcomes (Section 2.2).

2.2 Implementation

(a) Factors outside the control of the government or implementing agencies

Some factors outside the control of the Borrower affected the project implementation and
outcomes. ICT technology developed at a fast pace and prices in the markets decreased
greatly between 2004 and 2007 when the project implementation picked up. The project
took benefit of these changes that led to cost savings, and implemented a more
fundamental change in the entire AzerPost (Section 1.7). Absence of World Bank
IT/procurement staff in Baku and slow processing of the first key IT packages
(automated corporate information system, automation of regional branches and post
offices) contributed to implementation delays17. The financial crisis showed in many
countries that inadequate regulation and supervision of consumer protection issues caused
instability in the financial system. As a consequence, Azerbaijan - like Governments in
many countries - decided to strengthen consumer protection and financial literacy
activities. The 2008 inclusion of this activity into the project based on the SECO Grant
put into motion activities that strengthened the outcomes of the project (Section 1.7).

(b) Factors generally subject to government control

The government commitment to the project objectives contributed positively to project
implementation and outcomes. The emphasis on the legal framework reform to underpin
the work and ensure its sustainability, as well as the financial support had an important
positive impact. The commitment was demonstrated in: (a) the Actions for the
implementation of the State Program on the Development of Communications and
Information Technologies in the Azerbaijan Republic for 2005-2008 approved by the
Government in 2005 to improve postal services by introducing new services (particularly
postal-financial and IT services) and improving performance and quality of the postal
network; (b) establishment of a high-level Project Steering Committee in May 2007,
including MoCIT, CBA and AzerPost management together with the World Bank, SECO
and AzerPost's long-term advisor, to resolve key issues, ranging from the legal
framework and strategic options to monitoring implementation of the integrated TA and
the SECO Grant18; (c) the search for cheaper financing solutions especially for the
technical solutions and systemic determination by the MoCIT in 2007 of the optimal,
cost-effective technological solution needed to link each targeted rural office to the
AzerPost network; (d) the Amendment of the 2004 Postal Law dated October 2008,


17
    The World Bank had available two IT procurement experts for the entire Europe and Central Asia
Region during the project implementation. There was no procurement expert in Baku until towards the end
of the project.
18
   Initially, MoCIT and PMU established a high-level project management team, including MoCIT, CBA
and AzerPost, to regularly coordinate and resolve implementation issues, but it was replaced by the
Steering Committee in early 2007.


                                                  11
defining for the legal and regulatory framework for AzerPost providing financial
services19; (e) new Articles of Incorporation for AzerPost dated August 15, 2009,
changing its legal status from a state enterprise to a limited liability company, and
establishment of the Board of Directors and three independent committees20; (f) the
limited banking license granted by the CBA to AzerPost in April 201021; and (g)
provision of AZN 25 million (over $31 million) by the MoCIT (according to the MoCIT)
during the project implementation for construction and modernization of post offices,
building treasury boxes for regional branches and interconnectivity.

The project was positively affected by the sectoral policy decisions to change the scope
of both components with the assistance of the one main TA contract (Sections 1.6 and
1.7). The emphasis on the corporate reform of AzerPost, including its corporate
governance and management information system, strengthened the sustainability of the
outcomes. Lessons from similar efforts around the world, including in Brazil, Morocco,
and various European countries, were incorporated in the revised component design,
including the needs to corporatize the post office, separate its postal and financial
businesses, install a solid management information system and build its staff's capacity to
provide financial services. Nevertheless, the outcomes of the AzerPost came with a delay
as more time was required to design and implement the wider activities and the new
technological solutions for providing the landline connectivity for the AzerPost by
MoCIT (Section 3.2). Further, the original project was positively affected by the
strategic vision of the CBA to create a CISMP that promoted a greater system-wide
efficiency of the payment infrastructure.

There were implementation capacity constraints at AzeriPost, both at technical and
managerial level due to financial constraints and initially insufficient TA support22.
These constraints were addressed by taking the following actions: (a) provision of
English language and banking training for AzerPost staff in 2006; (b) appointment of a
technically competent Deputy Director for AzerPost by MoCIT in April 2006 (although



19
   Post accounts, money transfers, correspondent accounts, post savings, issuance of payment
facilities/debit cards/credit cards/post checks, foreign exchange services, transportation of cash.
20
   As required in the State Program on Improving State Property (June 6, 2007).
21
   All financial services listed in Footnote 19 except for post savings, credit cards/post checks. The MOF
and CBA discussed quite some time the acceptable scope of financial services for AzerPost. The
discussions of the CBA license started upon the amendment of the Law in 2008. These delays did not affect
the implementation or outcomes negatively to a significant extent because AzerPost network was not ready
technically ready to start launching newly automated financial services until in early-2010. In addition to
technical readiness, completion of the restructuring was a requirement for granting the license.
22
   AzerPost's financial condition worsened because: (a) tariffs for postal services remained at the level
approved before the project was launched; (b) AzerPost lost revenues from making pension and social
security payments as a result of introduction of plastic cards during 2005-2007 to make these payments,
outside AzerPost (as anticipated in the PAD); and (c) AzerPost was required by the MoCIT to establish 200
new offices in 2007. The lack of financial resources affected AzerPost's ability to attract and retain skilled
staff at competitive salaries. The Borrower requested an amendment to the Credit Agreement in November
2006, allowing for financing of incremental salaries and bonuses. The World Bank did not agree to this, as
featured in a supervision mission letter from the World Bank management to the Borrower dated May 7,
2007.


                                                     12
this was done with some delay, it proved to be a turning point in beginning to tackle the
project management and implementation delays); (c) revamping of TA into one package
with broader scope and longer duration; and (d) the MoCIT's authorization and budget
allocation for salary increases to AzerPost staff involved in project implementation in
early 200823.

The existing government administrative processes delayed the signing and effectiveness
by 7 months compared to appraisal estimates, including a 2-month extension of the
effectiveness deadline24.

(c) Factors generally subject to implementing agency control25

The new AzerPost Deputy Director responsible for the project played an instrumental
role in improving the effective management of the implementation. This reduced the
need for a separate, effective TIU in the MoCIT26. For example, under his direction,
AzerPost established a standing procurement committee in early 2006, including officials
from the MoCIT and CBA, which was critical in helping to improve implementation
efficiency and pace. AzerPost was also instrumental in re-initiating evaluation of the
most cost-efficient interconnectivity method. The CBA participated in the AzerPost
Component at the Deputy Director level, and a technical counterpart from CBA was
assigned for each AzerPost manager responsible for the project. With regards to the CBA
Component, the CBA management effectively implemented the CISMP from its own
resources.

A delay in selecting contractor for a data cabling of regional offices ­ a key IT package
­ due to the need to rebid led to delays in the implementation of the subsequent
automation and interconnectivity of post offices throughout the country.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The project appraisal document contained a number of outcome (macro)
and component (project) level indicators. The indicators appropriately reflected the
expected results at these levels. However, the macro level objectives reflected the
national importance given to this project, but they were too high-level to be used for
evaluating a 5-year project, as causality could not be established. Information on the
baseline and targets was missing. Some indicators were not measurable (Annex 15).

M&E implementation. The supervision reports discussed the indicators after the
December 2009 restructuring when the result framework was revised to more closely


23
   The MoCIT authorized a 200% salary increase for all HQ staff in March 2008. All regional staff's
salaries were raised 25% in November 2008 and 10% in September 2010.
24
   Effectiveness conditions included the signing on-lending agreements between the Ministry of Finance
(MOF), MoCIT and CBA and establishment of a TIU.
25
   AzerPost and CBA.
26
   It was agreed in 2007 between the MoCIT, CBA and AzerPost that AzerPost will manage the component
as independently as possible and MoCIT will have only a controlling role (the TIU had one staff member).


                                                  13
measure the outcomes of the project. The stakeholders focus was on regular updating of
the procurement plan and, since 2009, on the interconnectivity plan and status of CBA
permissions for each post office (these constituted the conditions for post offices having
full access to providing newly automated financial services).

M&E utilization. The result framework data that became available after the restructuring
was used to inform of progress and, in case of the AzerPost Component, to highlight the
urgency of investing all stakeholders' resources to expedite the procurement of last IT
packages and expand the landline connectivity for most of the targeted post offices from
MoCIT's resources. This information did not affect resource allocation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial management. The Borrower maintained a satisfactory27 financial management
system and provided timely and reliable information required for managing and
monitoring the project implementation. It respected the relevant World Bank financial
covenants by submitting to the Bank quarterly financial monitoring reports and annual
audit reports in a timely manner and in a format and content acceptable to the Bank.
Audit opinions were all unqualified, and no internal control issues were mentioned. In the
World Bank internal reports, counterpart funding was rated between moderately
unsatisfactory and moderately satisfactory until 2008 because AzerPost's financial
constraints affected project implementation negatively until they were addressed by
MoCIT in early 2008. There were no issues with provision of counterpart funding
connected with the IDA funding

Procurement. The procurement complied with the World Bank policy and procedural
requirement because all procurement was submitted for the prior review of the World
Bank due to the complexity of activities and Borrower's preference. One bid related to
data-cabling of regional branches was re-bid because of an unjustified local support of
the winning bidder. An audit contract was re-bid because the winning bidder did not
disclose all the required information in the bidding document about their proposal and
proposed contract conditions were not in compliance with the World Bank's standard
form of contract. There were no substantiated complaints. The procurement process on
the Borrower's side contributed to slow processes at times (i.e., delays in procuring the
external auditor and cancellation of procurement of additional armored cars, see Annex
2).

With regards to the SECO Grant, the World Bank report on internal control over
financial reporting of trust fund activities confirmed that the conditions of the grant
agreement had been followed.




27
  There was an error in the ISR recording of financial management ratings. They should have been
satisfactory in 2008-2009.


                                                  14
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

At project-end, Azeripost enjoys a substantial amount of its network interconnected and
expects to interconnect all the targeted 1,079 post offices through the entire territory of
Azerbaijan by the end of the first quarter of 2011 (Section 3.2). Coupled with its new
license, this is enabling it to expand provision of previously provided financial services
(i.e., utility payments and money transfers) and start providing a number of new financial
services (post accounts, correspondent accounts, issuance of debit cards, foreign
exchange services, transportation of cash; Annex 11). Below is an outline of the
transition arrangements for the next phase of operations.

The 2008 Amendment to the Postal Law provides an appropriate legal framework for
AzerPost's operations. Currently, the CBA has appropriately excluded deposit
mobilization and credit cards from the scope of the license. In order to gain full benefit of
the project investments and maximize revenues, it is important to widen the provision of
financial services based on the current license (i.e., pensions, social security payments,
salaries), develop professionally marketing strategies for different postal and financial
services and innovate new products for different customer groups, including corporations
and small and medium-sized enterprises. Once AzerPost has further improved internal
control and audit capacity, and fully addressed issues that were raised in the external
audit management letters, getting a license for the remaining authorized financial services
may be appropriate.

AzerPost's new legal status as a limited liability company and governance structure
since 2009 provide improved conditions for operating in accordance with the new
commercial, client-oriented objectives. On the other hand, managers at various levels are
likely to need training in order to effectively carry out their new roles in managing the
new organization.

AzerPost's human resources will be an important success factor in the next phase of
operations. Substantial staff development, especially in the sales outlets (i.e., post offices
and regional branches), is important to improve the quality level of existing operations
and introduce new and automated services. Competitive salaries (including bonuses for
"sales staff"), a modern compensation system and social package in the entire
organization will strengthen AzerPost's ability to retain and recruit skilled staff.

AzerPost's financial condition has improved markedly, and this trend is expected to
continue based on the project investments (Annex 3). AzerPost's financial condition will
be positively influenced if the MoCIT increases tariffs for postal service to better reflect
the costs ­ this is under discussion. Meanwhile, the state has been providing
compensation to AzerPost for providing these services at tariffs approved in before the
project was approved.

With regards to the next phase of the consumer protection and financial literacy
activities financed under the SECO Grant and the CBA Component, the arrangements
are in place. The consumer protection and financial literacy activities continue, and a
number of arrangements exist to sustain the reforms and institutional capacity (Annex 2).


                                              15
The CBA is also continuing the next phase in supporting increased use of electronic
payment instruments (Annex 2).

In addition to the above arrangements in place, a major accomplishment is securing a
new grant from the SECO to provide about $2 million to build on the results of the
project to: (a) improve access to financial services in rural areas through AzerPost; and
(b) implement a comprehensive consumer protection regime across the financial sector
and in the medium term develop a financial literacy program. With regards to (a), the
grant would be for: (i) implementing an extensive train-the-trainers program for
AzerPost's post office staff in rural areas to effectively deliver financial and postal
services and offering a separate management training regime for AzerPost management
staff and supervisory board members; (ii) designing a comprehensive campaign to re-
position (or re-brand) AzerPost as a reliable, nationwide provider of financial services;
and (iii) supporting key institutional reforms through funding half of the cost of the end-
2010 and 2011 external audits and all the cost of the corrective action plans developed in
response to the auditors' annual management letters which accompany their audit. The
grant implementation is expected to start in early 2011. With regards to the second
objective, the grant would help implement measures included in the Action Plan for
Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy elaborated in 2009. The former Project
Steering Committee will be reconstituted with the same membership roster (CBA,
MoCIT, AzerPost, SECO and World Bank) for the grant once approved. These activities
will provide a good start for ensuring sustainability of the outcomes.

It is recommended that an impact evaluation would be carried out in a couple of years'
time to evaluate the outcomes of the project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project objectives and design have remained highly relevant for Azerbaijan's current
financial sector development priorities, including broader reform of the payment systems
to promote safety and efficiency in payments and of wider access to financial services
among the underserved areas28. The objectives and design are also highly relevant for the
World Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY11-14. Over time, they are
contributing to strengthening the non-oil economy (business environment and regional



28
  The number of bank branches and sections was 752 in May 2010, including 330 bank branches and 49
bank sections in Baku and 305 bank branches and 68 bank sections in regions. AzerPost had 1,493 offices,
including 213 in Baku, 107 in regions and 1,173 in rural areas in May 2010. The number of commercial
bank branches per 1,000 adults was 9.57, the number of specialized state financial institutions was 0.18,
and the number of microfinance institution branches was 0.83, respectively (source: Financial Access 2010,
the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor/The World Bank). The 2008 Business Environment and
Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) identified access to finance as the 4th most severe problem in
doing business in 2008, with 30% of the firms considering it not a problem.



                                                   16
programs) and are consistent with the CPS outcomes about improving financial access for
underserved populations. The project is also well aligned with the CPS's goal to focus on
projects that clearly support the Government's reform agenda and capacity building.

The World Bank's implementation assistance responded to changing needs of the
stakeholders for increasing AzerPost's capacity for providing financial services to better
sustain the outcomes (Section 1.7). It also addressed the need for improving postal
services in line with the development priorities of the Borrower. The latter was an
implicit or de facto objective, although it was not explicitly mentioned in the 2009 project
restructuring. These changes were recorded in the Bank management's letters.

The World Bank implementation assistance responded likewise initially to the CBA's
strategic vision for payment systems reform to promote greater system-wide efficiency
by initiating the procurement of the CISMP. It is noted that this change (and the fact that
the CISMP was financed eventually by the CBA) was not reflected in the component
design until in the December 2009 restructuring approved by the World Bank Board.

The 2008 addition of the consumer protection and financial literacy activities in the
project strengthened the relevance of the project's main objective since, in the long term,
increase of financial literacy and better protection of consumer rights is expected to
facilitate demand for broader and deeper use of financial services by the population,
especially in rural areas.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project achieved its objectives to a substantial extent based on the following ratings
and justifications by each PDO:

PDO (a) Access to financial services

Summary. The project provided safe, efficient and affordable access for AzerPost's
targeted post offices to newly automated postal and financial services to a substantial
extent, as demonstrated below. AzerPost increased the number of available services,
volume of business and productivity. It reduced operational losses and expects to
complete 2010 with the first profits since 2005. AzerPost was provided with the capacity


29
   The rating is substantial (not high) due to the delay in achieving the interconnectivity of AzerPost's
targeted offices. The target is expected to be achieved by the end of the first quarter 2011.


                                                          17
for substantially expanding the scope of financial services and, thus, business volume and
profitability. In parallel, the project contributed to establishing a satisfactory legal and
governance framework for AzerPost's operations on commercial basis. Finally, under the
SECO Grant financing, the project gained results that go beyond an analysis of the
consumer protection and financial literacy issues in Azerbaijan (the objective of the
grant). These results will support the access to finance objectives in the medium term.

The achievement of access to finance objectives is demonstrated by the following data 30
(see also the result framework in the Data Sheet).

     79% (168) of the targeted 213 post offices in cities, 85% (91) of the targeted 107 post
     offices in rayon centers and 44% (312) of the targeted 709 post offices in rural areas
     have full access31 to the newly automated postal and financial services as of
     December 6, 2010. This is compared to a zero baseline and the targets of 100%,
     100% and 80, respectively. A total of 166 license applications are pending approval
     by the CBA that is expected by around year-end. The remaining 292 post offices are
     expected to have full access by the end of the first quarter of 2011. Due to
     implementation delays and granting of the license in April 2010, no post office had
     full access by end-2009 (Annexes 2 and 3).
     The volume of automated financial services transactions substantively met the target,
     increasing from AZN 35.7 million as of mid-2006 to AZN 248.1 million as of mid-
     2010 against the targeted AZN 248.8 million. Total annual volume increased from
     AZN 72 million in 2005 to AZN 386 million in 2009 and AZN 306 million by end-
     September 2010 (Annex 12).
     The number of automated financial service transactions exceeded the targets,
     increasing from 7.4 million as of mid-2006 to 27.7 million as of mid-2010 against the
     targeted AZN 23.5 million. Total annual number increased from 14 million in 2005 to
     48.4 million in 2009 and 52.2 million by November 30, 2010 (Annex 12).
     The number of newly automated financial services exceeded the targets as six of them
     became available to connected post offices by end-2010 (money orders, utility
     payments, transfer accounts and foreign exchange, debit cards and cash transportation
     services). The first two were available at the end of 2009, two more became available
     mid-2010, as targeted, and the last two became available at the end of 2010.
     Productivity measured as revenues (AZN) / number of staff increased from 927 as of
     mid-2005 to 1,933 as of mid-2010, to 3,470 as of end-2009 and to 3,339 as of end-
     November 2010 - above the target of 2,176.



30
   As required by the ICR guidelines, the ICR compares results at the time of the project restructuring
(12/2009) and at the time of the project closing (or thereafter if more progress was shown).
31
   Full access means that: (a) the computers have been installed in the offices and MoCIT has established
the landline/wireless connectivity (physical connectivity); (b) that, after that, all the modules of the
automated corporate information system have been made operational and training has been provided to post
office staff by AzerPost (operational connectivity); and (c) that, after that, the CBA has granted a post-
office based license/permission. The total number of de facto targeted offices is 1,029 post offices (of the
originally targeted 1,200 post offices, 171 will be connected via satellite by the MoCIT on its own funds,
after connecting the other post offices).


                                                    18
     AzerPost decreased its losses from early 2010 and is expected to make the first profits
     since 2005 (Annexes 3 and 16).

The direct project outcomes resulted from full organizational restructuring of the entire
AzerPost organization, strategic capacity building and automating all operations by
October 2009, as well as computerizing and substantially interconnecting the targeted
offices (Annex 2).

Under the SECO grant, the project helped prepare an Action Plan for Consumer
Protection and Financial Literacy that the CBA is using as the main input for a national
strategy expected to be submitted for Government approval in early 2011. As a result, the
CBA established a consumer protection unit; the Government is expected to officially
institute the high-level steering committee for financial consumer protection around year
end (2010); and the key stakeholders have started to work on measures to improve
consumer protection and financial literacy in line with the Action Plan (Annex 2).

PDO (b) Improvements in the National Payment System Infrastructure (the original
project-level objective) and Adoption of a Strategic Framework for an Efficient
Payment System Infrastructure (the revised objective)

Summary. The national payment system infrastructure and strategic framework
improved to a high extent (resulting to a great extent from CBA's activities financed
eventually outside the project). Specifically, it allowed for a more effective and efficient
integration of the retail payments infrastructure within Azerbaijan through effective risk
management practices for retail payments, integration of various financial and non-
financial (e.g. utility companies) systems for bill payments, and integration of BCSS and
AzerPost platforms for provision of financial services in financially underserved rural
and small urban areas.

The improved performance of the payment system is demonstrated by the following
original and revised indicators (Annexes 10 and 15)32:

     Efficiency improved and transaction costs reduced, as demonstrated by the increased
     use of electronic payment instruments within Azerbaijan, establishment of a
     centralized information system for mass payments (CISMP) and AzerPost's
     integration with the payment system. For example, transaction costs for merchants for
     cashless Point-of-Sale payments have gone down from1.5-3% in 2004 to 0.25-2% as
     of end-2009. There is no specific data on reduced transaction costs as such (one of the
     original indicators).


32
  The original objective related to the payment system was based on a broader scope of project activities
than the revised objective. Data on the original indicators is provided in Annex 15. The original indicators
measure performance that goes beyond to what project financed. Nevertheless, it is provided here to show
the growth of the payment system. Data on the revised indicators is provided in the result framework in the
Data Sheet of the ICR. Some original results are also demonstrated through the revised indicators related to
the access to finance objective.


                                                    19
       Share of cash-based transactions has decreased, as demonstrated by increased card
       transactions. Total number of cards issued has increased from 0.8 million in 2004 to
       3.9 million as of end-2009 and 4.1 million as of October 2010 (Annex 10).
       The volume and number of payment transactions channeled through the payment
       system has considerably increased. The number of transactions processed through the
       CISMP increased from 172,000 in 2008 to over 1.1 million in October 2010. The
       value of payments increased from AZN 2.5 million to AZN 143 million in the same
       period. AzerPost accounts for 90% of the number and value of transactions. As all
       utility companies, Azerpost and 74% of banks are connected to the CISMP,
       Azerbaijan truly has a very efficient and centralized mechanism for bill collections,
       bill payments and other financial services.
       The connectivity of AzerPost with both BCSS and AZIPS provided under the project
       is allowing for more efficiency within the national payments system as AzerPost can
       fully participate in the provision of large number of payment services, including a
       potential delivery mechanism for pensions and payroll in future. Whereas the
       connectivity is very recent and the transaction volumes started from a low basis, the
       integration with the respective interbank payment systems has reduced the transaction
       processing time and costs for the Azerpost. Thus, AzerPost met the targeted cost
       efficiencies as: (a) the fee for ATM and over-the-counter withdrawals was reduced
       from 0.4% to 0 and (b) the fee for domestic money transfer went from 0.1% to
       0.005% for BCSS transfers and from 0.1% to 0.043% for AZIPS transfers.
       The connectivity with the MilliKart LLC processing center was also achieved in July
       201033 which enables AzerPost clients to use any ATM and Point-of-Sale terminals
       within Azerbaijan and abroad. This aspect has significantly contributed to one of the
       primary objectives of the project ­ improving access to financial services through
       provision of electronic payments to underserved populations.
       While there is no specific indicator on number of failed transactions that is monitored
       by CBA, the significant growth in both the value and volume of transactions
       processed through the BCSS is a sufficient and satisfactory indication that the retail
       payment sector is more efficiently functioning and banks have more confidence in the
       use of clearing and settlement system owned and operated by CBA.
       Based on the work financed by the project, the CBA finalized an internal strategic
       plan on payment system reforms for 2009-2010 that was approved by the Central
       Bank in December 2008. Currently, the CBA is preparing a new strategic plan for
       2011-2013 based on the consultant's recommendations.

3.3 Efficiency

The project benefits were reasonable compared to the value of project investments in
capacity and infrastructure improvements. More benefits are expected in the future when
AzerPost will fully materialize the potential provided by the project investments. This is
supported by efficiencies gained during implementation, including: (a) consolidation of
numerous TA packages under one major integrated TA contract; (b) strategic decisions to

     AzerPost is planning to set up its own card processing center.


                                                       20
restructure the entire AzerPost organization and procure an automated corporate
information system with the capacity for providing all the originally projected financial
services, business and e-government services, and to apply the more widely available,
more inexpensive interconnectivity methods to interconnect the AzerPost network - all
created greater potential for increasing AzerPost's business and strengthened the
sustainability of the outcomes; and (c) the CBA's strategic decision to promote greater
system-wide efficiency and overall improvements in the payment system and to create a
central utility payment system that allows for a proper mechanism to closely integrate
various financial and non-financial systems, including AzerPost, for an effective
centralized system for bill payments throughout Azerbaijan.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: satisfactory

The objectives were achieved to a satisfactory extent based on a weighted average of the
moderately satisfactory rating at the time of the 2009 project restructuring and highly
satisfactory rating by now, as shown below:
     Table 3: Weighted Rating of Original and Revised Objectives

  Overall rating                                                -                -            S
*HS=Highly Satisfactory=6; S=Satisfactory=5, MS=Moderately Satisfactory =4.
**Disbursements as of end-2009: SDR 5.306; end-2009 to current: SDR 1.937, total SDR 7.244.

The rating is based on: (a) high consistency of the objectives with the Borrower's
development priorities in the financial sector and World Bank's country partnership
strategies before and after the restructuring and responsive changes to increase efficiency
and sustainability; (b) on the average, substantial extent of providing safe, efficient and
affordable access for AzerPost's targeted post offices to newly automated postal and
financial services, high extent of meeting the objective of the SECO Grant related to the
consumer protection and financial literacy issues in Azerbaijan, and high extent of
improving the national payment system infrastructure and strategic framework; and (c)
substantial extent of achieving actual and potential benefits at reasonable costs.




34
  It should be noted that post offices' full access to providing newly automated financial services,
including computerization/connectivity, operationalization of the automated corporate information system
and receipt of the license/permission, was the ultimate project target. This was substantially achieved in
2010. Although less was disbursed to achieve it in 2010 (see Table 3), the achievements in 2010 are not
less important than the intermediary results achieved before 2010 (i.e., automated corporate information
system, costing about $6 million) because they represented the "last mile" in providing full access.


                                                    21
With regards to (b), the achievement of objectives is rated as moderately and highly
satisfactory at the time of the 2009 project restructuring and after it for the following
reasons. By the time of the restructuring, the payment system related objectives and most
component results were achieved to a high extent (restructured AzerPost, installed the
automated corporate information system in the headquarters, achieved operational
connectivity of 8 branches, made available two newly automated financial services,
considerably increased AzerPost's business since 200535, established the CISMP and
introduced an updated strategic framework for increasing electronic payments). However,
post offices' full access to newly automated financial services was not reachable by end-
2009 due to the pending connectivity of offices provided by the MoCIT and lack of a
CBA license. The highly satisfactory rating for 2010 is supported in that: (a) most of the
PDO targets have been exceeded or substantially met, including post offices' full access
to newly automated financial services to a substantial extent (given a zero baseline); and
(b) the remaining targets are expected to be fully met by the end of the first quarter of
2011.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

See other sections.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

AzerPost restructured the entire organization and carried out significant changes in
human resources based on project investments as well as cooperation with a local
banking training institute since 2006 (Table 4). AzerPost completed the restructuring in
the headquarters in 2007, in regional branches in 2008, and in post offices in 2009. As
part of this process, AzerPost re-selected staff based on an evaluation and testing by the
banking training institute. As a result, 1,243 persons were laid off in 2007-2009,
including 263 persons in the headquarters and branches in 2007-2008 and 980 in post
offices in 2009. On the other hand, AzerPost put a great effort to recruiting and training
young educated staff for new functions since 2007 since its salary levels were not
competitive to attract experienced staff. A total of 249 persons were recruited for
financial services of which 61% for headquarters in 2007-2010, as well as 29% for
regional branches and 10% in post offices in 2009-2010. A total of 848-858 staff
members from headquarter and regional branches were trained mainly in new functions
in 2006 and 2009 (Annex 2). As of now, Azerpost has 116 persons in the headquarters,
including 48 in the financial services business unit, 36 in the postal services business unit,
and 32 in the service unit.




35
     There were no targets for end-2009.

In addition, based on cooperation with the local training institute, AzerPost introduced a
new grading and salary system in order to retain and attract skilled staff. It was
implemented for the headquarter staff in March 2010, and it is expected to be introduced
in the entire organization by 2012. In this system, staff's salary levels are determined
according to a number of criteria, including responsibilities and risks of the work,
education, experience, etc.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project provided a best practice example about increasing access to finance using a
postal organization based on a multi-pillar approach that included: (a) establishing a new
legal and governance framework for the new AzerPost; (b) completing in parallel a
fundamental, holistic change in AzerPost to better sustain the outcomes by restructuring
the entire organization and separating postal and financial services into different business
units, establishing strategic and business planning and implementing a fully automated
corporate information system; and (c) establishing a highest level steering committee,
including MoCIT, CBA, AzerPost, SECO, the long-term advisor and the World Bank -
fully dedicated to jointly resolve strategic issues that concerned all parties.




36
     AzerPost staff increased in 2007 considerably due to opening of about 200 new offices.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The rating is based on the moderate likelihood of certain risk materializing although their
impact is high if they materialize. The risks include: (a) delays in completing the
interconnectivity of the remaining targeted offices by the end of the first quarter of 2011
­ this is mitigated by the high-level commitment of the MoCIT to complete this; (b)
insufficient high-level focus on long and medium-term strategic planning and commercial
development of AzerPost ­ this is mitigated by the political support in making AzerPost a
success (i.e., by using it as an instrument for access to financial services, social and
regional projects); (c) cessation of the high-level Steering Committee after the closure of
the project ­ this is mitigated by the fact that, once the SECO grant is launched, the
Steering Committee will be re-instituted; and (d) difficulties for AzerPost to attract and
retain qualified staff in sales outlets at competitive salaries ­ this is mitigated by the
improving financial condition of AzerPost, but can be constrained by how quickly
AzerPost management can implement the new AzerPost mentality in the entire
organization and introduce modern compensation systems throughout the organization.
There are no risks related to the payment system outcomes.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating reflects: (a) high relevance of the objective and design for the Borrower and
World Bank based on adequate and sound background analysis and lessons learned about
the objective; and (b) efficient PCU arrangements. It also reflects some moderate
shortcomings. First, the project design did not initially provide a sufficient solution to
address the lack of required capacity in AzerPost for implementing such a complex
project. Second, the project underestimated what proved to be required to achieve the
access to finance objectives on a sustainable basis. At the same time, the shortcomings
are mitigated because: (a) AzerPost's financial condition changed after appraisal37 ; and
(b) usually deeper analysis of TA needs is done with project funds, as happened in the
project. Thirdly, the project documents did not provide targets for monitoring and



37
  After 2005, several factors resulting AzerPost becoming a loss-making entity (it lost the business of
pension payments, tariffs for postal services were lower than costs, and AzerPost's costs increased as it was
required to establish 200 new post offices). It is true this was anticipated at appraisal.



                                                     24
evaluating the project (except for the targeted 1,200 AzerPost offices) and used macro-
level objectives and indicators in the project documents some of which could not be
measured.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The satisfactory rating reflects: (a) frequent supervision and intense efforts of the
supervision teams to find solution for the lack of capacity in AzerPost; (b) strategic and
proactive supervision efforts since 2007 to expedite the delayed project implementation
and to better ensure the sustainability of project objectives, as well as critical input to the
work of the Steering Committee (this included raising strategic issues, such as continued
relevance of using AzerPost as the model for improving access to finance, use of more
up-to-date technological solutions for interconnectivity, the need for payment of state
subsidies, as required by the law, to AzerPost, and introducing a plan for monitoring key
project activities); (c) candid reporting and project performance ratings in the World
Bank's internal systems after 2007; and (d) ability to secure the SECO financing for
project activities and for continued TA to strengthen and build on the outcomes.

The shortcomings in supervision are related to: (a) absence of IT procurement resources
in the country office and slow procurement review in case of key IT packages; (b)
inflexibility of the World Bank management in accepting the Borrower's request for
financing incremental salaries of AzerPost's technical staff from the Credit; (c) lack of
focus on the monitoring and evaluation framework until 2009 when it was improved and
targets were established; and (d) lack of supervision of the CBA component from 2007
until 2009 when it was dropped from the project. Of these, (a) and initially (b) affected
the project negatively to a significant extent, but the otherwise very satisfactory
supervision efforts outweigh these shortcomings. At the same time, presence of a locally
based financial sector specialist could have strengthened supervision between missions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall moderately satisfactory rating is based mainly on: (a) correct assessment of
the development objective and instruments to achieve it and intensive and proactive
supervision focused on development impact and leadership in resolving strategic issues in
a complex project; and (b) initial shortcomings in the design based on incomplete
information, as well as insufficient IT procurement resources and inflexibility in
financing incremental salaries from the Credit.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The rating is supported by: (a) the MOCIT's and CBA's high-level commitment to the
objectives and design, as demonstrated by approval of the various strategies and legal and


                                              25
governance framework and close involvement with AzerPost's activities; (b) high-level
involvement in the Steering Committee; (c) investment of AZN 25 million in the project
implementation by MoCIT; and (d) establishment of the central utility payment system
by the CBA from its own resources. The minor shortcomings that affected the project
implementation negatively included some delay in appointing the Deputy Director in
AzerPost responsible for project implementation in 2006 and delays in providing a
budget allocation for financing higher salaries for AzerPost's staff involved with project
implementation until early 2008.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The performance of the implementing agencies ­ PCU and AzerPost ­ was highly
satisfactory. The PCU coordinated and administered project implementation efficiently
and timely and with dedication throughout the implementation period and complied with
the fiduciary requirements. The financial management supervision missions confirmed
existence of satisfactory financial management arrangements. The PCU performance was
particularly good considering the complexity of the design and procurement packages.

Performance of AzerPost ­ as the de facto implementing agency and a beneficiary ­ was
highly satisfactory. The unit represented at Azerpost was technically sound, responsive
and utmostly dedicated, remaining as such throughout the whole life of the project.
AzerPost, through its Deputy Director, played a crucial role in expediting the
implementation since 2006 and raising strategic and implementation issues to higher
levels, establishing a standing procurement committee to help improve efficiency of
procurement process and pushing for the processing of new legal framework in the
Government.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome is satisfactory based on Government's satisfactory performance and
the implementing agencies' highly satisfactory performance.

6. Lessons Learned

Deeper institutional analysis helps design TA right. The project underestimated the
TA needs in AzerPost and did not initially suggest an efficient solution in the project
design (i.e., it proposed hiring of numerous individual consultants). Together with
changed circumstances, this affected implementation negatively until early 2008 and
delayed achievement of outcomes. Therefore, complex TA projects should assess the
capacity and operating framework of the beneficiary institution beyond the standard
depth and design the project assistance accordingly in order to achieve the objectives
efficiently and successfully.

Holistic, multi-pillar approach is bound to reap more sustainable results. During the
implementation, the project developed a holistic, multi-pillar approach to improve access


                                            26
to finance and payment services. It established a legal and governance framework for
AzerPost to increase access to finance. In parallel, it implemented a fundamental change
in the entire organization and its operations: restructuring of both postal and financial
services business, full automation of the network and launching of strategic and business
planning based on commercial principles with training aligned accordingly. Finally, these
efforts were coordinated and resolved at the highest level in a steering committee,
consisting of the key stakeholders ­ MoCIT, CBA, AzerPost, SECO, the long term
advisor and the World Bank. These factors together with the consistency and dedication
of the teams on both sides were crucial to the success of this complex project. Therefore,
it is important to design project implementation approach that deeply tackles the
development issue at all levels with all the parties that have an issue at stake.

High-level project stakeholder steering committees, operating outside the
bureaucratic procedures, are a key to success in complex projects. The above high-
level steering committee operated outside the regular governmental procedures, based on
more flexible and simple principles. This helped coordinate and resolve issues efficiently,
and it was important given the complexity of the project. Therefore, complex projects
should be coordinated at the highest level between the key stakeholders during and after
the project based on flexible principles.

A champion with appropriate skills in the beneficiary organization is instrumental
for success. Until early 2006, AzerPost lacked a dedicated director responsible for the
project implementation, contributing to slow project launch. Due to his background, the
new Deputy Director responsible for the project played a key role in advancing project
implementation, raising and getting issues resolved with the key stakeholders throughout
the project life. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the beneficiary organization has a
champion with appropriate skills and background dedicated to the project.

The World Bank resources also need to be balanced against the complexity of the
project. The World Bank lacked sufficient IT procurement resources in the country
office (there were two IT procurement experts for the entire Europe and Central Asia
Region). This increased overall supervision costs and slowed down procurement process
for key IT procurement packages significantly, respectively. Presence of a locally-based
financial sector specialist could have also strengthened supervision of implementation on
a more frequent basis. Therefore, it is important to provide the staff and financial
resources according to the complexity of the projects so that the lack thereof would not
cause delays.

Use of existing, full-time PCUs facilitates implementation. The existing, full-time
PCU in the CBA coordinated successfully project activities between CBA, MoCIT,
AzerPost and the World Bank. Its availability, capacity, commitment and direct access to
the CBA management and AzerPost management helped expedite the implementation
that otherwise suffered from many delays and lack of capacity. Therefore, it is important
to use PCUs that operate at the appropriate level and ensure that they have the authority
to carry out their role effectively.

*The actual project costs are less than the original project costs because the actual costs include only the
counterpart funding connected with the IDA financing. However, according to the MoCIT, MoCIT spent
more than AZN 25 million for construction and modernization of post offices, building treasury boxes and
interconnectivity. These were not reflected in the project financial management reports.

                       business
2009   Audit           Two external audits of AzerPost in accordance with according to the
                       National Accounting Standards and the International Financial
                       Reporting Standards

The project financed consultancy services from September 2005 to May 2006 to establish
the TIU (within the MoCIT that was initially responsible for implementation of the Azeri
Post Component), staff the TIU and then assist the TIU staff and the Azeri Post in
launching and implementing the AzerPost component. The consultant contributed to a
number of activities financed by the FSDP in 2006 under Sub-Component A and B,
including launching small scale training in English and financial-banking services for
AzerPost staff and strengthening IT of AzerPost (HQ server rooms and automation) (see
below). The consultant also contributed to establishing new IT and business planning
departments, organizing their offices, selecting staff, raising the need to increase these
staff salaries, commenting on a draft business plan prepared by AzerPost, training
AzerPost staff in preparing a business plan and identifying training needs.

The project financed a number of trainings in 2006 and 2009 , including: (a) 1 to 4-day
trainings of 135 AzerPost's technical and managerial staff in branch management,
customer services, international accounting standards and budget forecasting in mid-
2006; (b) English language training for 17 of AzerPost managerial and technical staff in
the headquarters and some Baku branches in the end of 2006; (c) procurement training
abroad for some individual AzerPost staff in 2006; and (d) 508 hours of training for 676
of Azer Post's HQ and regional staff during the second half of 2009, including 46
training events in 39 topics, including new functions for postal and financial services
business (related to accounting, internal audit, customer relations and financial services,
but also in risk management, human resources planning, hiring and career development, IT,
strategic management, physical and information security, as well as marketing and
development of new products to improve their readiness to provide financial services,
gain practical skills in working with international accounting standards and use the
automated corporate information system). The training activity (d) was financed by the
SECO Grant (Sub-component G).


                                            33
In addition, the project financed the audit of AzerPost's financial statements for the years
2008 and 2009 according to the National Accounting Standards and the International
Financial Reporting Standards. The two audits provided the first external assessment of
accuracy of the financial reports, audit recommendations and Action Plan by the
Supervisory Board to explain the actions. These were the first audits of AzerPost's
financial statements (there were no available financial statements in 2007). The auditors
provided qualified opinions on the 2009 financial statements because: (a) they could not
substantiate the movements in fixed assets and could not determine the recovery value of
the fixed assets (a problem of internal control procedures); and (b) the cash in transit
could not be audited.

Between 2006 -2009, the project financed the establishment of two new servers,
automation of the headquarters and, most importantly, an automated corporate
information system (the Postal Financial Services System and Postal Counter Automation
System), as well as the required safety measures for hardware and software.

The new automated corporate information system with all modules mentioned above
became operational in October 2009 and, with that, automated all services and operations
of AzerPost, including both postal and financial services, for the headquarters and
interconnected offices in small urban and rural areas. It improved the processing time for
mail and packages, operations of post offices and new postal financial services. It made
possible increased, faster, more convenient and safer access to postal and financial
services, including new ones, through regional and rural post offices connected to the
headquarter system throughout the country, improved efficiency of operations, as well as
accuracy and availability of reporting.

As of June 30, 2010, four newly automated financial services (money orders, utility
payments, account openings and exchange) were available to the post offices that were
connected to the headquarters and the remaining two became available by year-end (debit
cards, transportation of cash). The automated corporate information system facilitated the
interface to the CISMP in July 2008, BCSS in May 2010 and AZIPS in September 2010).
The system also facilitated the connectivity with the MilliKart LLC processing center in
July 201038 which enables AzerPost clients to use any ATM and Point-of-Sale terminals
within Azerbaijan and abroad. This aspect has significantly contributed to one of the
primary objectives of the project ­ improving access to financial services through
provision of electronic payments to underserved populations.

    c. Strengthening of Core Functions
The project strengthened the core functions or postal business based on implementing the
Postal Financial Services System and a Postal Counter Automation System and the
integrated TA contract (see Sub-components B and D). In the area of postal services, the
project implemented track-and-trace system and established two new departments (postal
marketing department and postal analysis department for costing services and analyzing
trends in postal field).

         SECO)             execute the new functions, processes and services and to introduce new business
                           functions and products, as well as prepare the bid documents (with AzerPost) for
                           the the automated corporate information system.
 2010    Goods             Procured 3 armoured cars for Baku, Sumgait and Absheron post branches for the
                           effective management of cash means and liquidity.

The project financed the work of a consulting firm ("the integrated TA contract") from
2007 to early 2009 to restructure AzerPost and help automate the operations (Section 2.2).
Based on the recommendations under the TA and with its help, AzerPost underwent a full
organizational restructuring; adapted a strategic business planning process with the first
business strategy approved in 2008; and implemented an automated corporate
information system (see Sub-component B). As part of the original design, the TA
helped operationalize departments responsible for the new functions and trained staff.
These activities led to implementing a client-oriented organization with the capacity for
account-based provision of financial services.

The consultants' outputs and advice led to the following key outputs:

Strategy, business planning and organization (new compared to appraisal):
 Strategy, business planning: The first Business Plan/Strategy Document and a
    business planning process for 2009-2011 approved by MoCIT in November 2008,
    defining two main directions for development of AzerPost: (i|) strengthening the
    existing operations; and (ii) expanding the business. A revised version was approved
    by the MoCIT for 2010-2012 for the next 3 years in March 2010.
 Organization: Suggested re-evaluation of the initial extent of institutional change in
    AzerPost and proposed a high level organisation structure, including the structure of
    the headquarters, branches and post offices, as well as corporate and functional
    descriptions for headquarters and branches and post office operational manual,
    description of key commerical products and their pricing strategies, and detailed
    description of business process. As a result, restructured the entire AzerPost:
    headquarters by August 2007, 70 regional offices by January 1, 2009 and 1,508 post
    offices by November 1, 2009 based on the consultant's work (Annexes 13 and 14).
    Trained 20-30 technical staff in the 9 new functions in 2008-2009.
 Operations and IT: Prepared technical specifications and bidding documents for the
    automated corporate information system, monitored and coordinated its installation in
    2008 until early 2009, and assessed training needs. The installation of the system was
    completed in October 2009. Advised on implementing an IT security infrastructure.
 Accounting: Implemented an IAS/IFRS-based new integrated chart of accounts;
    assisted in migration of general ledger accounts to new chart of accounts; updated an

     IAS/IFRS-based accounting policies and procedures manual; new chart of accounts
     based financial statements in the system and reorganized the accounting department.
     This was achieved during the project and after.
     Organized and implemented the following new functions so that AzerPost had
     functional and fully operational units in place in these areas: internal audit and
     control (description of internal controls and audit function in Azerpost, its
     organization and processes; internal control policies and instruction manuals related
     to internal controls/audits), liquidity management (organization of liquidity risk
     management function; description of liquidity management procedures and procedure
     manual; liquidity management reports; training plan), risk management (not
     implemented yet as a separete function, but provided description of risks and risk
     profile; organization chart for the risk management function; description of risk
     management procedures and operational manual; risk management reports; training
     plan); budgeting and performance measurement (a detailed budgeting manual,
     organizaton chart and functional descriptions, training; presentation of proposed
     performance measurement and incentives system, implementation plan, training plan
     and incentives and performance evaluation material), marketing and business
     planning (a report on product descriptions and pricing strategies).

* At appraisal, the project expected that satellite connectivity equipment will account for major share of the
costs. At project-end, the project actually invested the largest share in the automated corporate information
system. The savings incurred from technological development, lower prices and use of more advanced ICT
for interconnectivity (landline and wireless connection). Table 9 shows the use of different connectivity
methods by regions, the source of financing and costs.

Table 7 shows % of the targeted post offices with full access to the automated systems. A
total of 79% of post offices in cities, 85% of post offices in rayon centers and 44% of
post offices in rural areas have full access to providing automated financial services. 166
license applications are pending, and overall the remaining are expected to gain full
access by the end of the 1st quarter of 2011.

  At appraisal, the project planned to connect the 1,200 existing post offices within the AzerPost network,
including 213 post offices in cities, 107 post offices in rayon centers (small urban areas) and 880 post
offices in rural areas. At the time of the project restructuring in 2009, 1,029 out of 1,200 were expected to
be connected to the AzerPost by the closing date of the project under the project financing. The remaining
171 (1,200-1,029) post offices in remote areas were to be connected after the closing date via satellite by
the MoCIT on its own funds, starting from the closing date of the project. Thus, 1,029 is used as the target.

             Action Plan            Developed an action plan on legal and regulatory issues for improving
             (December 2009)        consumer protection
                                    Developed an action plan on financial education for protecting financial
                                    services consumers and increasing basic financial literacy
                                    Assisted international consultants in developing an action plan on
                                    financial services consumer protection
                                    Adopted an existing financial literacy baseline survey to respond to the
                                    needs in Azerbaijan, carried out the survey, created a single database and
                                    prepared a report reflecting outcomes of the survey


The project financed a number of consultancies that, based on consultation with the
stakeholders, helped develop detailed, time-bound and costed Action Plan for Consumer
Protection and Financial Literacy in line with the international best practice, outlining
responsibilities for actions by stakeholders41 and monitoring and evaluation indicators.
Based on the TA, the Action Plan for Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy was
accepted, finalized and disseminated in a workshop with the stakeholders in December
2009 and published online in May 2010.

  The Central Bank, the State Committee for Securities (SCS), the MOF (State Insurance Supervision
Department, SISS), the Ministry of Economic Development, AzerPost, the MoCIT, the Ministry of
Education, the professional associations for the financial sector, major consumer advocacy organizations
and members of the legal and financial community of Azerbaijan.


                                                       40
The project also conducted a nationwide household survey in 2009 to provide baseline
information on the level of basic financial literacy of the population, the willingness to
use financial services, and the level of distrust in financial institutions. A separate panel
was organized in October 2010 with donors and financial industry organizations to share
the results of the above survey.

Currently, in accordance with the recommendations of the TA, the CBA is taking the
Action Plan as the main input to develop a national strategy on consumer protection and
financial literacy that is expected to be submitted for Government approval by end-2010.

In addition, based on the recommendations made under the TA, the stakeholders
established a high-level institutional structure for coordinating the implementation of the
measures with the CBA in lead. The CBA took a leadership role in implementing the
Action Plan and re-established the Consumer Protection Unit, as well as later staffed the
Unit (now it has three staff) and established working groups. Based on the
recommendations of the TA, the Government of Azerbaijan requested the designation of
senior representatives to constitute a Steering Committee for Financial Consumer
Protection, which is expected to be officially instituted by end 2010. The CBA, the MOF,
the Ministry of Taxes, the Ministry of Education, the MoCIT, the Ministry of Economic
Development and the State Committee for Securities have already designated their
representatives. The CBA, as the chair of the Steering Committee, is responsible for
leading the institutional coordination efforts, and the Steering Committee will prioritize
the measures to be implemented from the Action Plan.

The key stakeholders have started to work on measures to improve consumer protection
and financial literacy in line with the Action Plan. For example: (a) the CBA has started
to work on improving disclosure consumer credit; (b) the MoF's State Insurance
Supervision Service (SISS) has also begun working in this direction by preparing
information resources for consumers to understand features of insurance products; (c) the
State Committee for Securities (SCS) has elaborated on their program in a Concept Paper,
"Public Awareness and Public Education", which includes initiatives on consumer
protection and financial literacy; and (d) the Ministry of Education has also started to
work on financial education materials for schoolchildren.

2. The National Payment System Architecture Component

A. Credit/Payment Risk Management System

The project did not finance risk management system software to improve safety and
security of retail payments (Section 1.6). Under the CBA's lead, specific guidelines for
risk management in retail payments were developed and adopted by commercial banks
under the oversight of the CBA. They proved equally, if not more, effective in meeting
the original objective because banks could choose various alternatives to develop risk
management solutions as long as these were compliant with the standards developed by
the CBA.




                                             41
B. Large User Interface to BCSS

The CBA established a Centralized Information System for Mass Payments (CISMP)
with its own resources. The CISMP had more functionality compared to the original plan
of developing a single interface of the BCSS with large sources of small value payments
(see Sections 1.6, 1.7 and 2.1). This change was based on the results of a feasibility study
from 2006. The new CISMP was installed in July 2007 and became operational in July
2008 to facilitate collection of utility payments for the participants through the banking
system with different payment instruments. This system based on Check Free's EBPP
(electronic bill presentment and payment) consolidation software solution, has been
implemented in more than 30 countries in the world and by more than 300 institutions. It
has a much larger functionality and capacity than the system originally envisioned at
appraisal, but covers the activities considered under this sub-component. All utilities
(AzerWater, AzeriQaz, BakuCityPower, AzerEnergi) are connected to the CISMP.
AzerPost was connected to the CISMP in July 2008. Social security payments and
pensions do not have a direct interface to the BCCS but are paid by commercial banks
through payment cards.

C. Azer Post Interface to BCSS and AZIPS

The interface of the Azerpost platform to the BCSS (see Section 1.6) was implemented
with the CBA's internal resources and using the standard functional capacity of
Azerpost's automated corporate management information financed by the project. After
receiving the CBA license in April 2010, AzerPost was connected to the BCSS in May
2010 and to the AZIPS in September 2010. The interface to the interbank payment
systems has reduced the transaction processing time and costs for the Azerpost.

D. TA to Integrate National Payments System Architecture

The project financed the work of a consultant to assess the national payment system and
prepare a strategic plan for the next 5 years. (2008-2013). Based on the consultant's
recommendations, the CBA prepared a draft state program, but it was postponed due to
financial crisis. However, the CBA finalized an internal strategic plan on payment system
reforms for 2009-2010 that was approved by the Central Bank in December 2008. The
2009-2010 strategy focused on: (a) further improving and broadening electronic payment
services infrastructure potential and efficient usage of these opportunities; (b) improving
the legal base; and (c) attracting the people, small and medium businesses to active usage
of electronic payment services. Currently, the CBA is preparing a new strategic plan for
2011-2013 based on the consultant's recommendations.

3. The Project Management Component

This component financed training of PCU and TIU staff, equipments for PCU, capacity
building for financial management and reporting, as well as annual project audits.




                                             42
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Annex 16 provides information on the financial condition of AzerPost. AzerPost expects
to gain first profits for the first time since 2005, after several years of loss-making
operations.

Below are some observations about development of AzerPost's financial condition.
Revenues and profits are beginning to increase, as expected, but appraisal estimates
overestimated how much and how quickly AzerPost would earn high revenues and gain
profits. Estimates also underestimated the growth of expenses, especially other expenses.

     AzerPost's revenues have grown steadily since 2005 from 8% to 30% annually. The
     growth has been driven by growth of financial services at 16-20% annually (with the
     exception of 34% in 2007). Financial services have accounted for 55-65% of the total
     revenues. Postal services revenues have increased growth towards 2009.

     AzerPost's revenues have grown less than expected because: (a) AzerPost lost the
     business of making pension payments in 2005; (b) AzerPost is facing more
     completion from banks in making payments through the CISMP as banks have joined
     it; (c) tariffs for postal services are below costs; (d) the number of private postal
     operators has increased, especially in the courier and express mail services; (e) due to
     project implementation delays, AzerPost started providing new financial services only
     in the second quarter of 2010 and thus fewer post offices provide financial services
     than expected at the moment.

     Revenues from other services (mobile phone cards, fax and copier services, selling of
     lottery, tickets) have been around 10% of total revenues.

     Operating expenses grew 42% in 2006 (200 new offices were established) and 20-
     26% during 2007-2010 due to increased cost of operations, staff increases and salary
     increases. AzerPost hired about 1,500 new staff in 2005-2007. Salaries were changed
     twice. The MoCIT authorized a 200% salary increase for all headquarter staff in
     March 2008 and on average 50-60% in 2010. All regional staff's salaries were raised
     25% in November 2008 and 10% in September 2010. Salaries have accounted for
     about 44% of total expenses during 2005-2010 compared to 66% in 200342. However,
     other expenses than salaries have driven the increase in operating expenses.




42
  The average salary changed from $55 per year in 2003 to $170 in 2010. The average postman's salary
changed from $35 in 2003 to $130 in 2010.

      Borrower's Evaluation Report on Completion of the "Financial Services
                             Development" Project
        The Project approved by the Order N 973 signed on August 25, 2005 by the
President played a special role in supporting the implementation of the "State Program on
Development of National Payment System in the Republic of Azerbaijan", first of all,
stipulates creation of conditions for development of financial services using the
existing platform of "Azerpocht LLC, provides easy access to banking and financial
services for population living in rural areas and small urban centers, and offers wide-
scale services to customers through 1500 post offices. The Project implementation
covering 5 years implementation period started on October 14 and successfully
completed on June 30, 2010.
       Significance of the Project implementation was to create a favorable business
and investment climate and to support the socio-economic development in the regions
with the view of elimination of weak access to financial services in rural areas.
        In fact, the significance of the project is in its realization not only in an
independent form, but also, in an integrated form with the range of Institutional Projects
aimed to creating output possibilities for financial services in regions by the Government
and Central Bank including projects of widening activities of non-bank credit
institutions directed to the regions and completion of the national payment architecture.
        At the same time, the representation of Azerpost in each rural level offered a
unique opportunity for implementation of the rural financial services. On the other hand,
this project was distinguished by specificity in terms of formation of a new culture and
relationships, creation of a favorable business environment and support of the socio-
economic development.
Three components of the Project were effectively carried out and targets set in the
components were substantially achieved.
Component 1. Improvement of the Azerpost LLC platform
      The purpose of this component is strengthening the Azerpost potential to provide
financial and other business services and ensuring interactions between its regional and
local branches for the purpose to improve access to payment services in the rural areas
and to broad an access to other essential financial services.
      Within this component, first of all, an international consulting company was
contracted to provide technical assistance to the process of Azerpost LLC institutional
building.
       The provision of Azerpost LLC by necessary information technology equipment
and software was a "center of gravity" of the project. As a next step, an Automated



                                           48
Corporate Information System of Azerpost with all functional capabilities and
conforming to international standards was successfully applied with a view to provide
financial services.
        At the same time, the structural changes of Azerpost LLC were carried out, the
trainings were organized using grant amount allocated by SECO for the Azerpost LLC
staff to formation their skills in the field of new banking-financial services and
increasing their professional level with the purpose of an adjustment of the "Azerpost"
LLC structure with the structures of organizations providing banking-financial services,
and application of the most advanced corporate management standards. Approximately
500 employees from the Azerpost Head Office, branches and departments participated in
the courses (46 topics) organized by Azerbaijan Bank Training Centre.
        The legal basis regulating this field has been improved, amendments were made
to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on "Postal Service" for commencing of the
provision banking-financial services by the Azerpost LLC. According to the new law
provisions, "prudential regulation rules on issuing special permission (license) to national
post service operator and its functioning for the provision financial services" were
developed by the Central Bank. According to the law provisions, the special permission
(license) was issued on April 16, 2010 to Azerpost LLC after preparation of all legal
documents and completion of organizational arrangements.
       At the same time, full integration has been provided to the local and international
payment systems being one of the main targets of Azerpost component. Thus, in July,
2008 connections to KOMIS system 43 (collection of utility payments) of the Central
Bank, in May, 2010 to SCSSP system, and in September to AZIPS system have been
provided. Connection to the SWIFT system for provision of international payments was
also provided. In addition, integration to Western Union, Coinstar and other high-speed
money transfer systems was also successfully made.
       Transition of "Azerpost" LLC financial reporting to the international
accounting standards has been provided and independent audit of annual financial
statements (2008 and 2009) was carried out.
        As a result of successful implementation, along with the traditional postal
services, the following financial services are being provided in Azerpost's broad regional
branches and departments: 1) opening and managing of the postal accounts, 2) money
transfers, 3) issuance of payments means, including debit cards, 4) foreign currency
exchange services by clients order and accounts, 5) encashment of the cash and other
values.

  KOMIS = CISPM (Centralized Information System for Mass Payments); SCSSP = BCSS (Bulk
Clearing Settlement System).



                                            49
Component 2. Completion of the architecture of the national payment system
      The main purpose of this Component was to strengthen an institutional and
technical potential for the fulfillment the strategy of the national payment system. Within
this component, the development strategy covering next 5 years period has been prepared
in close collaboration with the highly qualified European Savings Banks Group with the
object to provide technical assistance to formation of the strategic plan in the field of
payment systems.
      The activities to improve the payments systems stipulated in this component,
including establishment of centralized information systems for utility payments, interface
of large users with settlement clearing system for small payments (SCSSP) and issues
covering risk management in payment systems have already been realized in other
projects at the expense of Central Bank's own resources.
Component 3. Project management component
       The purpose of this component was provision of technical assistance, training,
audit services and goods to the Project Unit for the effective project implementation and
management.
      The activities stipulated in this component, such as coordination, reporting
procedures, management of payments and increasing operational costs within signed
contracts, have been implemented. At the same time, starting from 2006 project fiscal
year, the tender procedure for the external audit of the financial reporting by years was
arranged, the contract was signed with the selected audit company and finally audited
financial statements have been submitted to the relevant state bodies and World Bank.
Obtained macroeconomic results and opportunities
As a result of successful realization of the project, the favorable infrastructure was
established in a view of geographical expansion of the payment systems, covering the
regions, establishment of a single electronic payment space covering whole country,
increase access of economic subject and households to the banking and financial services.
On the other hand, the Project, first of all, strengthened the competitive environment in
the field of provision banking and financial services for the economic subjects and
population living in the remote rural areas where banks are not actively providing
their services (or not providing), enabled an application of innovation in the field of
banking and financial services. This in turn, will give impetus to the development of
social and financial services infrastructure in regions, improvement of living conditions,
arrangement of conditions for provision of the various electronic government and
electronic business services, and increase of investments.
