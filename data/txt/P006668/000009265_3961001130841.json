The project will also: (a) expand\n            the coverage and enhance the quality of preschool education\n            to increase primary school preparedness and reduce late\n            entry, repetition, and dropout in primary schools,\n            especially for 5-year-olds living in poverty conditions; (b)\n            strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\n            Education (MINEDUC) central, regional, and provincial\n            offices, as well as that of the education departments of the\n            municipalities to direct and manage a decentralized\n            education system, and improve the managerial skills of the\n            municipal and private-subsidized preschool and primary\n            school administrators; and (c) assess alternative\n            cost-effective approaches to meet the secondary education\n            needs of primary education graduates. The project will be\n            supported by financing the following four components: (i)\n            primary education; (ii) preschool education; (iii)\n            institutional development, and; (iv) secondary education."}, "docdt": "1991-09-11T00:00:00Z"}
