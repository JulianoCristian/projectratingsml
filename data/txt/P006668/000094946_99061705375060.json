Key lessons learned highlight the\n            project characteristics that led to a successful outcome:\n            long-term vision and permanence of objectives and teams\n            (both the technical and political participants); focus on\n            the learning process in the classroom and teacher role and\n            participation; diversity of approaches used and their\n            adaptation to the environment (context); and prioritization\n            and sequencing of education changes. Specific lessons\n            learned stress the following: the importance of constant\n            monitoring in order to adjust programs in a timely fashion,\n            and involving and training families which changed the way\n            they participated and related to their children's\n            education and to the school; the favorable effects of\n            working with an intersectoral strategy that combines health\n            and education institutions and buys services from health\n            providers; the need to coordinate among the participating\n            actors with advance planning to increase the utility of\n            teaching materials and to train teachers and supervisors in\n            their use; focusing on teachers needs and not just computer\n            technology itself; creating awareness that infrastructure\n            investment must be aimed at improving the quality of\n            education; and the importance of changing from a clinical\n            view of special education to a pedagogical one."}, "docdt": "1999-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
