INTEFNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXEZUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR THE UPPER EGYP DRAINAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of US$36
million to finance the foreign exchange cost of a drainage project (US$31.6
million) and a bilharzia control program (US$4.4 million) in Upper
Egypt. The credit would be on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Economic Performance
2.        An economic report entitled "tCurrent Economic Position and
Prospects of the Arab Republic of Egyptr (E1A-56a) dated December 30, 1972
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 23, 1973. A Country
Data Sheet is attached as Annex I to this document.
3.        With the impetus  of the First Five-Year Plan (1961-65), Egypt's
economic growth accelerated in the early 1960's to an average annual rate
of about 6 percent -- nearly reaching the amnbitios Plan target of 7 percent
and considerably faster than the pace of growth in the 1950's. However,
the increased investment rate of the early 1960's was accompanied by growing
defense expenditure which led to serious inflationary and balance of payments
pressuires by the mid-1960's.  in i966/67 the government imposed severe import
restrictions and deflationary policies resulting in negligible growth in that
financial year. The war of June 1967 compounded an already difficult situation,
and there was a substantial fall in GDP in 1967/66.
4.        In the succeeding two years the economy recovered rapidly but the
growth rate fell to 4 percent in 1970/71 and was probably about the same in
1971/72. Defense has taken a progressively greater share of Egypt's resources
(reaching 15 percent of GNP in 1970/71), largely at the expense of investment
expenditure, which has fallen to about 12 percent of GNP in recent years.
The share of private consumption in GKP has remained at about 68 percent --
implying a growth rate in per capita private consauptim of about 1-1/2
percent annually.



- 2 -
5.        The heary claims of defense have not only squeezed investment
and development resources, but have also given rise to inflationary
pressures. Although transfer receipts from Arab countries under the
Khartoum Agreement (amounting to about LE 110 million annually) have
more than offset the loss of Suez Canal revenues, a severe scarcity of
foreign exchange continues to limit both the utilization of existing
prodactive capacity and the implementation of new development programs.
Employment has groin only slowly (by about 2 percent annually in recent
years), so that unemployment and underemplcoment have increased.
Average wages have risen faster than productivity, adding cost-pash
inflationary forces to existing demand-pull forces, exacerbated by a
high-level of Central Bank deficit financing. Price controls and a
rapid rise in imports have absorbed some of the inflationary pressure.
However,a consequence of greater import growth has been a deterioration
in the balance of payments. Net foreign exchange reserves, which have
fallen steadily in recent years, fellby rouchly $200 million in 1971 and rose
by an estimated $50 million in 1972. By late 1972, short-tenm foreign
liabilities exceeded foreign assets by the equivalent of about six months
imports.
Pebt Service Burden
6.        Egypt's out standing medium and long-term external debt at the
end of December 1972 was reported at $1.2 billion disbursed, or $1.6 billion
including undisbursed credits -- equivalent to about one-fourth of GNP.
The USSR is Egypt's principal creditor, followe~d in importance by the
United States, Kuwait, Germany and Italy. IBRD debt comprised less than
one percent and IDA debt comprised about 4 percent of the total reported
debt(including undisbursed)at end 1972. The debt service ratio in 1970/71
was about 32 percent, according to balance of payments data. In recent
years declining gross capital inflows and risinag debt service payments have
resulted in net resource transfers from Egypt. The near-tenm debt-servicing
burden will remain difficul-t as 36 percent of the reported debt outstanding
at the end of 1971 was due to be amortized witlLn two years, 51 percent
within three years, and 74 percent within 5 year^s.  The implication of Egypt's
debt profile is that rising gross capital inflows or substantial reschedulings
will be needed to sustain even a zero net resource transfer, at least during
the next few years.
Development Prospects and Constraints
7.        In comparison with many less-developed countries, Egypt is relatively
favored in terms of its geographical, natural and human resources; the size
of its domestic market; the extent of existing §.lnirastuctural development;
the level of education and skill of its labor force; and its associations
with Arab nations and some developed countries. These factors suggest that



- 3 -
the long-term growth potential could be promising. On the other hand
there are a number of formidable constraints to development in the short
and medium term. The most severe are tne defense burden, the scarcity
of convertible foreign exchange (including funds not tied to new investment
projects), the debt burden (notwithstanding recent reschedalings) and
a highly centralized administration which regulates nearly all production,
distribution, employment and financial decisions, leaving little room for
the market mechanism or for incentives for individuals.
8.        Egypt has a serious demographic problem.  The population
is already one of the most densely settled in the world and is growing
rapidly. A high rate of natural increase is combined with a high rate of
intermal migration to urban areas, resulting in growing urban congestion --
especially in Cairo.  In the longer run continuing rapid population growth
heightens problems of unemployment and underemployment and causes greater
pressure on the land. A promising beginning has been made with a national
family planning program. But more needs to be done both in family planning
and in regional and urban planning.
9.        in the absence of significant new political developments in the
Middle East, Egypt's ability to effect major changes in resource allocation
is likely to remain limited. However some encouraging developments have
taken place in the economy in the last two years. These include a rapid
growth in government revenues, fuller utilization of industrial capacity,
a resurgence of tourism in 1971 and 1972, the conclusion of new trade,
aid and debt rescheduling agreements with Western countries and promising
indications for petroleum development. In an effort to attract private
western and Arab capital, an Intemationl Bank for Trade and Tevelopment
was established, a new investment code adopted and liberal tax exemptions
and incentives made available to industries establishing in "free zones".
Egypt also became a member of the International Center for the Settlement
of Investment Disputes. The government has taken steps to confer more
operational autonomy on public sector industrial enterprises, increase
wage incentives, stimulate the small private sector, and study price
reforms. Thus far, however, the net effect of these steps on the economy
has been small.
10.       In the suamer of 1972, agreement was reached between the Heads
of State of Egypt and Libya calling for the unification of the two states
by September 1973. A number of joint committees are currently studying
the problems of unification and their implications for Egypt's future
economic development.



-4 -
Development Priorities
11.       In the aftermath of the 1967 war, Egypt temporarily suspended
medium-term planning. A neiw Five-Year Plan (1973-77) currently under
disucession aims at GNP growth of about 6-1/2 percent a year and a total
investment of BE 3 billion. The highest priority is given to investment
in industry, followed by tr.ansport, communications, and agricultare.
In contrast to the investment priorities of the first Plan, which
emphasized the High Dam and other agricultural projects, the new Plan
emphasizes iron and steel production and petroleum development.
Achievement of the Plan's investment targets will require both a major
effort in domestic resource mobilization and a reallocation of resources
which will be difficult to reconcile with the priority that the governnent
accords to defense.
The Agricultural Sector
12.       Agriculture remains the most importint economic sector in terms
of its contribution to GDP (about 30 percent), its provision of employmernt
(about half) and its generation of foreign exchange earnings (about 55
percent of total exports in unprocessed form, 85 percent including processed
agricultural goods). The growth rate of value added (in real terms) in
agriculture has averaged about 3-1/2 percent annually over the past fifteen
years but slowed down after 1966/67e   The economy continues to depend very
heavily on cotton and :otton product exports (over 60 percent of total
exports) and has been helped materially by high world prices bringing
increased revenues for the same volume of cotton exports. However the
proportional significance of cotton has declined and the local textile
industry is absorbing an inc:reasing proportion of output (now about 40
percent).
13.       The announced target of the governnent is to achieve an increase
of about 40 percent in agricultural value added over the next decade, i.e.,
a continuation of the long-term trend, but a substantial increase over
the growth rate achieved in the past several years. About 20 percent of the
ten-year increase is expected to come from furtlher development of 900,000
feddans already reclaimed since the High Dam was built, and another 20
percent from land to be reclaimed in the future, including 24,000 feddans
scheduled for reclamation in the next five years and 348,000 feddans in
the period 1978/82.  Production gains from the reclaimed lands are likely
to be slow in materializing, although benefits from the already reclaimed
lands could materialize fairly soon now that mora attention is being given
to production-increasing policies.



14.       In the future, priority will be given to improved farming practices
(especially increased fertilizer use) and to further development of public
sector poultry and other livestock industries.  In the short run, balance of
payments considerations will lead to a continuation of efforts to maintain
the areas devoted to cotton and wheat, and there may also be attempts to shift
resources to vegetable and fruit production and processing, especially with
a view to developing export markets for these high-value products. However,
the scarcity of capital will remain a major constraint to undertaking these
programs; this is true also of a number of other projects which are comple-
mentary to agricultural development,including the rural electrification
program, expansion of the fertilizer, textile, and other agricultural product
processing industries, and investments in rural education, storage and market-
ing facilities.
PART II - BANK GRDhP OPERATIONS ILN EGYPT
15.       Over a period of 25 years the Bank Group has made one loan and
three credits to Egypt, totalling $112.7 million (net of cancellations).
The loan was for the Suez Canal Expansion Project in 1959 ($56.5 million).
A $26 million credit for the Nile Felta Project was approved in 1970,
one for $30 million for Egyptian Railways in early 1972 and an engineering
credit for the cotton ginning project of $0.2 million late in 1972. The
orga izatLonal and other problems that led initially to unsatisfactory
progress with the implenentation of the Delta project have been resolved
and progress has been more encouraging in recent months under new management.
Progress with the railway rehabilitation project has been satisfactory, a
number of contracts have been let and a substantial portion of the credit
has been committed. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group
financing up to April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects. There have been no IFC investments in Egypt so far and none are
presentlr under consideration.
16.       The main purpose behind the IDA lending program,which began in
1969,is to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange for high priority
projects in agriculture, industry and infrastrucutre. With limited IDA
funds available, the program is modest in relation to Egyptts size and
absorptive capacity. The Bank Groupts first projects in the industrial
sector, a proposed line of credit to the Bank of Alexandria to finance
selected public and private sector industrial projects and assistance
With gsee one of a rehabilitation program for the cotton ginning indastry
are expected to be presented to the Executive Directors in the near
future. A population project iB expected to be negotiated shortly and
be reacdy for Boardconsideration early in FY74. Two missions visited Egypt



- 6 -
in April 19 73, to help prepare a telecommunications and a urea fertilizer
project, both for possible lending in FY74. Two agricultural projects --
a soil amelioration project and a rural development project -- are under
consideration.  The second phase of the railway  rehabilitation program
is also being prepared.
PART III - IRRIGATION AND DRAINhGE RBQUIRR43t<TS
17.       Apart from a little precipitation o11 the Mediterranean coast,
virtually no rain falls in Egypt. The four percent of the total land
area that is cultivable is totally dependent on irrigation. The traditional
practice of irrigating by diverting flood wat.ers from the Nile into basins
and sowing as the waters recede has given way over the last century to
controlled irrigation by means of barrages and canals.  The last 900,000
feddans in Upper Egypt were converted from basin to perennial irrigation
daring 1960-72.
18.       Water has traditionally been free inSEgt,and farmers have
customarily anticipated water shortages by aDppying excess water to build
up moisture reserves. Since the High Dam was commissioned in 1965,
water has no longer been scarce,but the farmerst tendency to over-irrigate
persists. Poor water management and increased cropping intensity have
hastened salLnization and caused declining crop yields.   Salinity occurs
throughout the Nile valley and the situation is deteriorating because of
poor drainage. The irrigation systems built before 1960 were provided with
shallow drains,and it is taking 25-30 years for these lands to become
saline.  The lands converted since 1960 are without drains and have turned
saline rapidly. About 12,000 feddar,s in Upper Egypt originally bountiful are
now barren and, without remedial measures, th.is will increase to 22,000
feddans by 1978.
19.       It was expected that, with the commissioning of the Aswan dam and
thIe elimination of the annual floods, the level of the Nile would remain
low and stable, permitting groundwater pressure to be reduced by natural
drainage from the upper soil layers onto the water bearing stratum of
sand and gravel and thence to the river. instead the groundwater pressure
has steadily increased probably because of seepage from the canals and
percolation losses brought on by increased cropping intensity and excessive
irrigation, and significantly less pumping from tubewells.  The net result
has been a rising groundwater table, waterlogging and salinization. Tile
drainage is as effective as (and less expensive than) tubewells in alleviating
this problem and the shortage of cultivable land makes tile drainage preferable
to open drains. About 80,000 feddans out of 2-1/2 million in Upper Egypt have
been converted to tile drainage since 1960, comoared with over 500,000 feddans
converted in the Nlile delta.



- 7 -
20.       The Bank Group's first venture in the irrigation sub-sector was
the $147 million project for the Nile Delta, for which a credit of $26
million was signed in 1970. This is part of a multi-purpose program to
provide improved drainage throughout the Nile valley provided, inter
alia, for the installation of tile drainage throughout 950,000 feddans
in the Nile Delta. An account of the problems encountered with this
project is given in Annex II. Following prolonged discussions with IDA
on the steps needed to improve the implementation of the project in
February 1973, the government announced the merging of the Nile Delta
Drainage Authority and the Egyptian General Authority for Drainage Projects
into the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP). EPADP
has already begun construction of tile drainage throughout 66,000 feddans
in Upper Egypt.  The appointments of the Chairman of the new Authority and
the two Vice-Chairmen in charge of the Delta and Upper Egypt projects
respectively, were also announced in February together with those at the
Director-General level.
21.       The proposed project area for drainage extends over six governorates
along the Nile south of Cairo to Aswan.  It includes about 88,o00 farm families.
About 34 percent of the holdings are famed by the owners and 38 percent by
tenants, the balance being part-owned. The 1952 Agrarian Reform Law and
subsequent legislation has restricted land holdings and given tenants
security. The average farm size is about 3.4 feddans. The crops grown
in the project area include medium-long staple cotton, maize, sorghum, wheat,
beans, sugarcane and vegetables. The standard of fanming is generally high
and the small size of holdings means there is a heavy reliance on labor-
intensive methods. Cotton prduction is organ zed on a cooperative basis.
Seed cotton and most of the wheat crop is delivered to the government.
Sugarcane is delivered to the local sugar factory. Only a few of the major
crops are sold on a cash basis. Crop production inputs are available on
credit through village cooperatives which are funded by the Agricultural
Credit Bank.  The cooperatives finance their operations through commissions
on supplies and produce marketed. Landowners and tenants pay a land tax
calculated as one-seventh of the net return on the land, using 1956 commodity
prices.  After the new drainage has been installed, the land tax wctld be
re-assessed.
Bilharzia
22.       Bilharzia is the most prevalent, serious, ad endemic disease in Ept.. As
a cause of morbidity in tropical and sub-tropical areas, it is out-ranked
only by tuberculosis and malaria. Transaission occurs through human exoreta
coming in contact with water inhabited by the snail hosts and by human
contact with infested water. Children aged 10-15 years are particularly
vulnerable. The two types of bilharzia common in Egypt are Schistosoma
haematobium throughout the irrigated area, and S. mansoni which is largely
confined to the delta. The disease causes debilitating symptoms and can
lead to complications like cancer of the bladder and exacerbation of the
effects of, for example, malnutrition and viral hepatitis.



- 8 -
23.       As much as 65 percent of the population in Upper Egypt is affected
by bilharzia. Snail control treatments are presently concentrated in areas
with high snail populations, but surveillance does not adequately cover
the total area and local control measures achieve only limited success dlue
to rapid re-infestation. Strong German support was provided for a snail
control program in the Fayoun governorate which was linked with intensive
care for infected persons and which reduced. the overall infection levels
frcm 50 to 16 percent.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
24.       The proposed project is part of the government's 30-year
(1960-1990) program to improve drainage throughout the country's 7 million
feddans of irrigated land, 2.5 million of which are located in Upper Egypt.
A feasibility study of the proposed project was prepared by Egypt with
the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. The drainage part
of the project was appraised in February/March 1972 and the bilharzia
element about one month later. Negotiations were held in Washington
in late March 1973. The Egyptian delegation was led by Mr. Mustafa E1
Said, Chairman of EPALri.
Project Description
25.       The main purpose of the project would be to prevent further
decline in land productivity through waterlogging and salinization in an
area of 300,000 feddans in Upper Egypt which have been identified as being
in urgent need of drainage. The project would provide for the installation
of field tile drains throughout the area, the construction or improvement
of open main and branch drains and the constr.lction of pumping stations
where gravity drainage is not possible. The project would include the
reclamationof 22.,400 feddans of severely saline land.
26.       The construction of new open drains could extend the habitat for
the snail hosts of bilharzia. The project would therefore include a bilharzia
control program to cover an irrigation and drainage system extending over
900,000 feddans, with a population of 3 million, in an area where the disease
is most prevalent and where the irrigation system is suitable for effective
snail control.  The selectedi area includes about one-half of the new open
drains to be constructed under the project. The main features of the project
are summarized in Annex III and in the report ".,ppraisal of Upper Egypt
Drainage Project" (Report No. 80-UAR dated May 18, 1973), which is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors.



-9-_
Project Costs
27.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes, customs duties
and excluding interest during construction, would be $123.8 million
equivalent, with a direct foreign exchange cost of $36 million, i.e.
29 percent of total costs, which would be financed under the credit.
The proceeds of the credit would finance the foreign exchange costs of
the pumping stations and related services, equipment, vehicles, spares,
materials, chemicals for bilharzia control and consultants1 services and
overseas training. The local financing for the project would be provided
by the government through budgetary appropriations for the EPADP and the
Yinistry of Health. The government would also bear the cost of customs
duties estimated at $6.6 million. The government has agreed to make
arrangements to recover revenues from the beneficiaries of the drainage
construction sufficient to cover an amount equivalent to the maintenance
cost of field tile drainage in the project area and, over a period of
twenty years, the capital cost without interest of the investment in
field tile drainage.
Implementation
28.       EPADP will have control over all drainage projects in Egypt.  Its
responsibilities will cover investigation, planning, design, procurement,
construction, budgeting and operation of project accounts. There will be two
Vice-Chairmen, one for the Delta and one for the Upper Egypt project, each with
his own design office and with full responsibility for project planning and
execution. Each Vice-Chairman will be assisted by a deputy. Field supervision
of the proposed drainage works in Upper Egypt would be carried out by four
Director-Generals, one each for the proposed project zones. EPADP's
Mechanical Department would be responsible for supervising the installation
of pumping stations and transmission lines and for workshops, project stores
and mechanical equipment retained by the authority. Procurement would be
handled by the Achinistration and Finance Department. A committee composed
of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman concerned and the Head of the Technical
Office would evaluate bids and make recommendations for contract awards under
the project. A panel of consultants to monitor progress and undertake
project evaluation has been nominated by EPADP and includes experienced
local experts from government and the universities.
29.       The new authority will have a nucleus of professional staff from
the disbanded drainage authorities with expe:rience in the kind of activities
proposed under the project. In addition, the project would provide for
training programs for civil engineers and technicians using the facilities
of the Land Reclamation Organization of the Ministry of Agriculture. Expert
assistance would be provided by experienced Egyptian engineers, consultants
to the authority and equipment suppliers' personnel. Provision would also
be made for appropriate overseas training for about fifteen engineers and
technicians.



- 10 -
30e       The Ministry of Health (MOMI) would havre overall respbnsibility
for the bilharzia program which would be carried out by a -orogram director
and his staff, assisted by a teamt of experts. MOH would prepore an
implementation program in consultation with I)A hwithin six mer..ths of
effectiveness0  Officials from the Snail Control Department of 1iOH would
apply the molluscicides. MOH would also set up a supervisiaa and evaluation
unit to provide data for futuLre control programs. Undertakings have been
obtained from the goveneriet that the control -measures wl-hich -would be
introduced under the project daring the implemention period 1975-78 would
be pennanently maintained.
Procurement
31.       Contracts for the five pumping stations and associated equlpnment
would be awarded ona the basis of international compe-tit.ive biddingL, in accord-
ance with DA' s guidelines  Vehicles, equipment and spares and steel and Cther
materials for the drainage works would similaxl r be procured uinder internatijonal
bidding. w7ith l-ocal manufacturers being allowed a preference of 15 percent or
the actual customs duty on imported component;s, w ihichever is Lawer. Suppliers
of tile laying machines would be required to provide experienced operators
and mechanics to tr;ain Egyptian personnel. Civvil morks contracts for
drainage, land reclamation and buildings  which would not be financed under
the proposed credit would be awarded on the basis of local competitivre
bidding.  N6olluscicides and drugs for bl'harzia would be procured under
negotiated contracts with the three manufacture:;rs concermed.. Where appropriate
economies would result, procLremen-t under the p:roject would be combined with
outstanding procurement under the Nile Delta project.
Rate of Return
32.       The economic rate of return on the drainage works based oii a
useful life of 35 years, would be 20 percent.  rhe main benefit from the
project would be -th-he prevention of a further decline in farm production due
to wqterlogCing and salinization. Farm product:.on in the area is presently
valued at $o2 million. In ten years with the prcject, it would rise to
$82 million; without. it, it would fall to $45 mil'ion and continue to decline.
The net foreign exchange impact estimated otn th. basis of import substitution
(for wheat, maize and sorghum) and exports (mainiy of cotton and sugar) would
be $6 million in year 5, $25 million in year 10 and $38 million in year 35.



- 11 -
33.       While the project would not result in a substantial number of
new farm employment opportunities, the project would enable farmers to
maintain economic production. Although accurate data on personal incomes
are not available, it is estimated that in the areas to be drained, the
average tenant farmer's income would rise from $100 to $135 after ten
years, compared with a projected decline to $90 without the project.
Comparable figures for an average owner-cultivator on a larger farm with
a current income of $340, would be $410 and $230.
34.       The benefits of the bilharzia program are unquantifiable.   The
disease undennines working habits. Its eradication would bring a general
improvement in health for three million people, increasing their ability
to withstand other debilitating infections. The molluscicides do not have
any known harmful effects on crops. They are toxic to fish at the point
of application, but the fish are edible. In any event, regeneration of
fish life in the canals is rapid. Piped water, unaffected by the chemicals,
is available for drinking.  The new open drains would increase the
mosquito hazard, but the government has a malaria control program to
combat this.
35.       The project would not resalt in any major change in cropping
intensity. The projected level of use of chemicals and pesticides would
not present a pollution hazard.

1/ The Per Capita GNP estimate is at 1970 market prices, calculated by the same conversion technique as in the
1972 World Atlas. All other conversions to dollars in this table are at the average exchange rate
prevailing during the period covered.
2/ GNP and savings are defined here inclusive of net transfer receipts, most of which consist in payments
from Arab countries to compensate Egypt for the loss of Suez Canal dues.
3/ Accurate constant price growth rates are not available owing to insufficient information concerning trade
deflators. Moreover, the export growth rate for this period is biased by the drop in Suez revenues after
1966/67. Between 1967/68 - 1970/71, exports ( in current prices) rose on the average by 12.5 percent
annually, imports by 10.6 percent annually. See also the note to Table 2.2 in the Statistical Annex.

C.  PROJECTS Iii EXECUTION-
Cr no. 181          Nile Delta Drainage Project; US$26 million Credit
of April 17, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Nile Del-ta Drainage Authority (NDDA) was established in 1970
under the Ministry of irrigation for project execution.  Mary of its senior
vacancies were left unfilled.  Appointment of consultants was a condition of
credit effectiveness and protracted negotiations with the consultants se-
lected (VEIE; of Sweden) delayed this for 12 months.  Since then ineffective
management, inadequate utilization of existing equipment and an unwillingness
to use the consultants have been major problems.  .-DA expressed to the
government its disappointment u-ith this projects slow progress.  A revised
implementation program was prepared, extending the project until 1978 and,
follownig discussions in December 1972, the government agreed to take a
number of actions recommended by MA tc improve performance and provide an
effective management.  In February 1 973, NfDDA and tle t Fgrptian General Authority
for Drainage (EGAD) were merged in the Egyptian kuhlic Authority for' Drainage
'rojects (EPADP) established by Presidential Decree. A new Chairman and Vice
Chairmen for the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt drainage projects were appointed
and the staff  reorganized and strengthened b-y the apcointment of additional
qualified personnel.  A panel of experts was nominated to undertake project
evaluation and action is bei.ng taken tc replace the consultants for the Nile
Delta project whose contract expired in YMarch 1573, by new consultants who
would advise and assist the authoritv on the implementation of both the
.ile Delta and Upper Egypt projects. The new Authority is actively working
on the arrangements for the maintenance of equipment and the storage of spare
parts and has drafted the te:rms and conditions under which Droject equipment
will be transferred to local contractors for construction of drainage works
and for the manufacture of drainage tiles.
Cr NJo. 284         Egyptian Railway Project; US$30 million Credit of
February 5, 1572; Closing Date: (i) December 31, 1973
for track materials, locomotives and spare parts; and
(ii) September 30, 1976 for signalling and telecommu-
nications equipment and installation.
The project has started satisfactoriixr.  ..4Most of the procurement
contracts have been awarded.  Some complaints have been received about eva-
luation procedures.  It appears that delays hiave occurred in passing out
information to potential bidders.  IDA has d:iscussed this problem with
Egyptian Railways and steps are bej rig taken to improve procurement procedures
nnd increase the nimbe.- of staff in the procurement office.
.-These notes are desigrned. to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress oi' proJe:ts in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being en^ountered, and the action being ta.ken to remedy them.
Thev should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not nurport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

US$17 ,O000 Credit of November 17, 1972; Closing
Date: June 1b, 1973.
This Credit was approved on November 7, 1972 but has not yet been
declared effective due to delays in Egyptian legal procedures. It is
expected that it will be declared effective prior to June 18. In the
meantime consultants are carrying out detailed engineering design studies
provided for in the project.

PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS:       International competitive bidding for the pumping
stations and associated equipment and for vehicles,
equipment, spares and steel for the drainage works.
A 15 percent margin of preference or the applicable
customs duty, whichever is the lower, would be
applied in the comparison of foreign and local
bids for vehicles, equipment, spares and steel,
where the domestic value added is 20 percent or
more. The contracts would include provision
for training in the operation and maintenance
of the pumping equipment. Civil works contracts
for drainage and land reclamation would not be financed
by IDA credit and would be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding. Molluscicides and drugs
for bilharzia would be procured under negotiated
contracts with the manufacturers ccncerned.
CONSULTANTS:                     Consultants including short-term specialists would
be engaged by EPADP as and when required, in con-
sultation with and upon terns and conditions satis-
factory to IDA, to assist and advise the Authority
in the overall planning of works, land reclamation,
water management and agricultural extension prac-
tices, and the design of pumping stations. A
separate panel of Egyptian consultants and experts
has already been nominated by the government to
monitor progress and to evaluate the benefits of
both the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt projects. A
team of suitably qualified experts would be
appointed by the Ministry of Health mutually sa-
tisfactory to the Borrower and IDA for the bilharzia
control program.
