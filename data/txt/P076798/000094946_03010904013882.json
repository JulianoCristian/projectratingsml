There are four components to the\n            project. The advocacy and behavior change component will\n            assist the government to create a favorable legal and policy\n            environment that protects the rights of persons living with\n            HIV/AIDS, and maintain awareness of HIV/AIDS and prevention\n            measures. The prevention in high risk groups and general\n            population component will finance activities to identify\n            high-risk groups, in order to target them with prevention\n            and behavioral change interventions. The access to\n            treatment, care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS\n            component will support capacity and upgrading current\n            services available for providing treatment, care and\n            support. The surveillance, epidemiology and research\n            component will support a new information system, which will\n            protect the confidentiality of medical records assuring\n            patient privacy through encrypted technology, and improve\n            the quality of the information allowing for cross reference\n            analysis from multiple databases.
