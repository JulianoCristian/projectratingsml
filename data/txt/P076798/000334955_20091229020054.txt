F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project has three main objectives coherent with the country's Strategic Plan for the
National Response to HIV/AIDS (SPNR):




                                               ii
  a) scaling up prevention programs targeting high-risk groups as well as the general
population
  b) strengthening treatment, care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWA)
  c) strengthening of the institutional capacity to respond to the epidemic

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower to control the spread of HIV/AIDS
and to mitigate its impact through: (a) scaling up prevention services for high risk and
vulnerable groups and for the Borrower's general population; (b) expanding and
strengthening treatment, care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
and mitigating the impact to those infected and affected by the epidemic; and (c)
strengthening the institutional capacity of the MOH, other government agencies and civil
society organizations to ensure an effective multi-sectoral response to the epidemic

1.    Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1   Context as Appraisal

Country background. St. Kitts and Nevis is a federation of two islands with an estimated
population of 49,000 at the end of 2006. It is a middle-income country with an average life
expectancy of 72.9 years. The country's economy is based on tourism with a declining
share of agriculture. Unemployment is the lowest among OECS member countries and the
UNDP Human Development Index ranks St. Kitts and Nevis 47th among 174 countries.
Annual real GDP growth during the 1990's averaged about 4 percent, compared to a growth
rate of 6.2 percent during the 1980's. Economic growth picked up again in 2004, with a real
GDP growth rate of 6.4 percent, followed by another year of strong growth in 2005, when
real GDP grew by 4.9 percent. The affairs of both St. Kitts and Nevis are addressed by the
federal government.

Sector background. The first HIV/AIDS case was reported in 1984 and by 2008 the
country had a cumulative total of 301 cases. There were 28 deaths due to AIDS during the
period 1984-1993 and 36 deaths were reported for the period 1994-2000. At the time of
project preparation, epidemiologists considered the Caribbean (including St. Kitts and
Nevis) at risk of seeing the HIV epidemic become "generalized" by spreading from groups
at high risk through the wider population. Persons at high risk include sex workers, women
who engage in transactional sex with multiple partners, groups of people with multiple
concurrent sexual partners, and men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM accounted for
about 3% of AIDS cases in 2001, which is considered to be seriously underreported,
according to UNAIDS. Regulations enforce the criminalization of homosexual sex and sex
work, and homosexuality is heavily stigmatized. This has impeded access to health
education, prevention and HIV treatment, as well as information about behavior and health
status of persons in these groups.

The government responded to the epidemic in the mid-eighties by setting up a national
AIDS program within the Ministry of Health, which depended on external assistance. They
initiated testing, surveillance and research, protect blood supplies, and communication
interventions. A national AIDS coordination unit was set-up (with a staff of two) in the
Ministry of Health in the mid-nineties, when the AIDS situation worsened.

Country assistance strategy and rational for Bank assistance. The AIDS epidemic
claimed an estimated 36,000 lives in the Caribbean in 2004, making it the leading cause of
death among young men aged 15-44 years in the region with the second-highest HIV
prevalence second to Africa (2.3% in 2004), see Table 1. This translated to approximately
440,000 infected adults and children in 2004. There was a sense of urgency from the
international community for the Bank to respond to the epidemic and to fund AIDS projects
in the region. The OECS CAS (2001 and 2005) identified HIV/AIDS as one of its human
development priorities for Bank lending.

(*) Caribbean countries adopted from HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean Region: A Multi-Organization Review

In 2000, the St. Kitts and Nevis government adopted the 2000 Caribbean Regional Strategic
Plan of Action for HIV/AIDS, to which it contributed. It was within this framework that the
MOH, together with stakeholders in-country, developed the first national strategic plan
(2000-2005), which identified five priority intervention areas, which the World Bank
HIV/AIDS program mirrored: (i) prevention, (ii) treatment, care and support, (iii) advocacy,
(iv) surveillance, epidemiology and research, and (v) program coordination and
management.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

According to the PAD (December 2002), the project aims to support selected activities of
the St Kitts and Nevis Strategic Plan for the National Response to HIV/AIDS (SPNR) to
assist government to control the spread of HIV/AIDS through three main objectives: (a)
scaling up prevention programs targeting high-risk groups as well as the general population,
(b) strengthening treatment, care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA),
and (c) strengthening St. Kitts & Nevis multi-sectoral institutional capacity to better respond
to the epidemic. The ICR is assessing the revised PDOs as per the restructured document,
see section 1.3.

Indicators identified before and after restructuring, as stated in the PAD and the amended
loan agreement are outlined in Section 1.3.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and key
       indicators, and reasons/justification

The St. Kitts and Nevis HIV/AIDS Project was approved on December 13, 2002 and
became effective on May 29, 2003. A Mid Term Review (MTR) was conducted in March
2006, after which a decision to restructure the project was made due to slow project
implementation and a fragmented results framework; see Section 2.2 for detailed
information.

The revised PDO as outlined in the Board approved restructured and amended loan
agreement, (March 21, 2007) is as follows: (a) scaling up prevention services for high risk
and vulnerable groups and for the general population; (b) expanding and strengthening
treatment, care and support for PLWHAs and mitigating the impact to those infected and
affected by the epidemic; and (c) strengthening the institutional capacity of MOH, other
government agencies and civil society organizations to ensure an effective multi-sectoral
response to the epidemic.

The results framework for measuring achievements of the PDO were revised and aligned
with project outputs - see Table 2 and Table 3.

A year after the project was restructured, four process indicators were dropped (5, 10, 11,
14) and two outcome indicators were added (1 and 2).

1.4   Main Beneficiaries

The project aimed to target the following beneficiary groups in the design and
implementation of activities: (i) PLHIVs and their families, (ii) general community, (iii)
high risk groups (e.g. SW, MSM, pregnant women, adolescents, young adults, military
personnel, commercial drivers and tourism workers, and out of school youth), and (iv) line
ministries, private and voluntary sectors, civil society organizations and local communities.

1.5   Original Components

The project identified five priority components which are aligned with the St. Kitts and
Nevis national strategic plan, 2000-2005. They are outlined in the PAD as follows:

Component 1. Advocacy and behavior change (US$0.51 million, 11.2% of loan). This
component would assist the government to create a favorable legal and policy environment
that protects the rights of PLWHA (advocacy). It would also aim to maintain people's
awareness of HIV/AIDS and prevention measures, promote behavior changes for safe sex
practices and risk reduction, done through national and community campaigns (Information
Education and Communication - IEC).

Component 2. Prevention in high-risk groups and general population (US$1.13 million,
26.4% of loan). This component would finance activities to identify high-risk groups (SW,
MSM, uniformed personnel, migrant workers, and hotel and tourism workers) and their
informal networks, in order to target them with prevention and behavioral change
interventions. The project would support: (i) IEC and awareness campaigns, (ii)
strengthening VCT services, (iii) condom social marketing and distribution, (iv) PMTCT,
(v) prevention and STI management, and (vi) improving the management of biomedical
wastes. A strong emphasis will be laid on youths (both in and out of school).

Component 3. Improving access to treatment, care and support for PLWHA (US$1.92
million, 43.1% of loan). The project would support capacity strengthening and upgrading
current services available for providing treatment, care and support for PLWHA. This
includes: (i) management of opportunistic infections and palliative care, (ii) introducing
Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART), (iii) strengthening health facilities and
laboratory capacity including reconstruction of Pogson Health Facility / other health
facilities and provision of lab equipment and reagents, (iv) pharmacy strengthening, and (v)
home and community-based care for PLWHA.



                                               5
Component 4. Surveillance, epidemiology and research (US$0.54 million, 13% of loan).
The project would strengthen the disease surveillance system, through (i) the design and
implementation of an integrated management information system for HIV/AIDS, to improve
resource allocation and decision making and protect the confidentiality of medical records,
(ii) the implementation of a second generation surveillance system, and (iii) the provision of
training for the monitoring and evaluation of project activities and operational research.

Component 5. Sustainable management response (US$0.30 million, 3.8% of loan). The
project would support the creation and the initial operations of a "National Advisory
Council on HIV/AIDS (NCHA)", whose mandate would be to provide policy guidance to
the Prime Minister and his Cabinet, and oversee implementation and resources mobilization
for HIV/AIDS. The project would provide resources to strengthen the institutional capacity
and operations of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU).

1.6   Revised Components. The five components were consolidated into three to
      simplify project execution during the project restructuring in 2007:

Component 1. Scaling up HIV/AIDS response by civil society organizations, and line
ministries (US$0.02 million). Support from the project will scale up ongoing activities in
line with the Government's strategy of a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder response to
the epidemic: IEC/BCC; sensitization and advocacy to address stigma and discrimination;
distribution of condoms and care for PLWHA and orphans. Selected line ministries dealing
with specialized population groups such as the Ministries of Education, Youth, Social and
Community and Gender Affairs will be funded to provide services for both internal (own
staff) and external clients.

Component 2. Strengthening the health sector response to HIV/AIDS (US$3.04
million). This will support the health sector prevention and treatment services which
include: (i) voluntary counseling and testing, (ii) distribution of condoms, (iii) strengthening
of management of sexually transmitted diseases, (iv) strengthening laboratory services and
blood safety, (v) prevention of mother-to-child transmission, (vi) opportunistic infections,
and (vii) antiretroviral therapy and management of biomedical waste. Financing will cover
civil works to upgrade health clinics which are critical for expansion of the services,
training, consultant services, drugs and equipment.

Component 3. Strengthening surveillance, monitoring and evaluation and institutional
capacity for program management (US$0.77 million). This will support the newly
established NACHA; the National AIDS Secretariat (NAS) within the Ministry of Health
and the strengthening of the PCU in the Ministry of Finance, Sustainable Development,
Information and Technology responsible for procurement and financial management. The
component also supports the development of the national monitoring and evaluation
framework with harmonized national HIV/AIDS indicators; epidemiological surveillance
and development of the information platform to enhance the clinical management
information system. Project funds will cover costs of staff, consultants, furniture, computer
hardware and software. The project results framework will be separate but in line with the
national monitoring and evaluation framework.

1.7   Other Significant Changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation
      arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

Implementation arrangement and schedule. The original operations manual dated May
16, 2003 was revised in February 2007 to streamline and clarify roles and responsibilities of
implementing agencies and institutions. Procurement processes for civil works were
simplified, and procedures to provide grants to civil society organizations were documented.
Financial management was simplified and staffing of the PCU was increased to
accommodate project needs.

Extension of the Project. The project closing date was extended by one year, from June
30, 2008 to June 30, 2009 to allow activities to be completed as project implementation was
slow the first three years of the project, see section 2.2 (11.1% disbursement rate, as of May
2007).

Global Fund. St. Kitts and Nevis is part of the GFATM grant to the OECS countries,
(March 2005- February 2010) which provided funding for AIDS treatment, thus
complementing the financing of the World Bank project.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1   Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Sufficiency of background analysis. St. Kitts and Nevis HIV/AIDS Project is part of the
Bank's Multi-country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending
(MAP). A Bank study, `HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean: Issues and Options' served as the
background analysis to prepare the MAP. The MAP for Africa was the Bank's first
response to the epidemic - some of its elements were included in the St. Kitts and Nevis
project design: (i) importance of high level government commitment and national leadership
by establishing a coordinating body, i.e. NAS, (ii) building networks with NGOs and
community groups to complement the work of public agencies, (iii) focus on treatment and
care as a continuum, with advocacy and prevention, (iv) provide a focus on behavior change
of most-at-risk groups as a key element of prevention and control, and (v) adopt
implementation measures that are flexible and responsive to the epidemic as it evolves.
Even though these elements were included in the project design, lessons from the Africa
experience had not emerged then and therefore, it was difficult to determine what worked
and what did not at the time.

The background analysis did not critically examine the needs and country context of the
federal government of St. Kitts and Nevis, including an adequate assessment of: (i) human
resources and capacity (e.g. project staff, CSOs, NGOs, and line ministries) to efficiently
respond to a multi-dimensional, complex HIV/AIDS project, (ii) CSO engagement (iii)
institutional and implementation arrangements to carry out effective programming, (iv) twin
island federation setting that operate under separate administrations and budgets, (v)
absorptive capacity to spend financial resources to implement the HIV/AIDS project, and
(vi) baseline data and/or proxies (evidence) to inform programming.



                                              7
Assessment of project design. Project preparation was participatory, bringing in
perspectives of various agencies (such as USAIDS, PAHO, CAREC, etc.) working in the
sub-region and nationally. The project design addressed the main sector issues identified
and discussed in the PAD ­ strengthening the health system and its surveillance system,
epidemiological, behavioral and social risk factors for HIV/AIDS. The project design was
in line with the Three Ones principle of ensuring that there is one coordinating body.
Nevertheless, the project design was found to be overly ambitious and relatively complex
for a country with limited human resource capacity in general, limited experience working
with Bank rules and regulations, and new to the multi-sectoral response. Even though the
project was fast-tracked, systems were not in place for an effective and efficient response.
For example, civil society organizations that were in-country did not have the capacity to
prepare proposals, manage and report on sub-projects in accordance with the project
requirements. Plans to train them should have been instituted at the beginning of the
project.

Even though the project design was relevant and in line with the strategic priorities of the
country, as outlined in the NSP 2000-2005, i.e. including all five component priority areas
in the project was unrealistic given the limited labor force and capacity. The original
indicators in the PAD were too many and too complex ­ the country did not have the health
management information system infrastructure to collect data, monitor the project and
respond to these indicators. The project design did not address operationally, how the two
islands would work together given their administrative and financial set-up.

Government/stakeholder commitment. The Prime Minister of St. Kitts and Nevis is
recognized as a leader in the HIV/AIDS effort in the Eastern Caribbean. Political
commitment came from the highest level and in 2005 a multi-agency review noted that
government was spending its financial resources and that of donors on HIV/AIDS activities,
signaling that AIDS was an important priority for the country. At the same time,
government's level of commitment did not necessarily translate into political action at the
operational level. Early on in the project, implementation suffered in the absence of key
staff over an extended period of time. The first 18 months of the project experienced slow
implementation and low disbursement of project funds (6.5% of the loan was disbursed by
November 2004).

Assessment of risks. The PAD identified and rated project risks, however some issues
pertinent to the success of the project were overlooked. For example: (i) coordination of the
HIV/AIDS response within and between St. Kitts and Nevis stakeholders, between the PCU
and MOH, and the project implementers; (ii) institutional and implementation arrangements
were not examined extensively, nor was the division of labor specified; (iii) human resource
capacity to implement the project was not considered; and (iv) working within a twin island
setting was overlooked.

Project quality at entry. The project was complex and ambitious, given the capacity and
human resource constraints of the country. Guidance provided by the Bank was not always
in accordance with the country situation and the project staffs at the Ministry of Health were



                                              8
not familiar with Bank rules and regulations, which should have been addressed at project
onset. The operations manual did not adequately explain how the activities would be
implemented and the institutional framework for implementation was set-up two years after
the project became effective (in July 2005). Little attention was paid to the M&E of the
project and CSO and non-health line ministry engagement was weak. The multi-sectoral
response was new to the country, and integrating HIV/AIDS into sector plans was a
challenge.

Overall Quality at Entry. There was no Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) by the
Quality Assurance Group (QAG). This ICR rates the overall project quality and readiness
as moderately unsatisfactory.

2.2       Implementation

The loan was approved on January 22, 2003 and became effective on May 29, 2003. The
project went through a Board approved restructuring in May 2007. Project implementation
was extremely slow for the first three years of the project because: (i) institutional and
implementation arrangements in the PAD and the initial operations manual were not clear,
(ii) inadequate staffing and minimal human and institutional capacity, (iii) procurement and
financial management procedures were not well understood by the project team, (iv) some
procurement procedures did not fit into the context of a small island with limited suppliers,
(v) challenges with procurement of civil works and information technology, led to cancelled
tenders, (vi) low level of buy-in and engagement of civil society, and non-health line
ministries, (vii) minimal country expertise and experience working with high risk and
vulnerable groups, and (viii) high staff turnover within the Bank - four project managers
over a six year project, each bringing in individual management styles and supervision
teams. This high staff turnover created many implementation delays and affected the
relationship between the Bank and the project team. The project was in danger of
suspension and closure after twenty-four months of implementation.

The turning point came after the mid-term review, when the project was restructured:

      ·    PDOs remained the same, but were restated more clearly;
      ·    Project components were simplified and changed from five to three;
      ·    A simple operations manual was developed, which focused on changing institutional
           arrangements and clarified roles and responsibilities of implementing agencies ­
           allowing the simplification of grant applications from line ministries and civil
           society groups, as well as disbursements into the ministerial accounts;
      ·    Project indicators were changed to better align with project activities and country
           capacity;
      ·    Improved coordination among stakeholders and implementing agencies;
      ·    Increased staffing with hiring of a program assistant, lab technologist and task
           shifting of two existing staff to work part-time on M&E;
      ·    Joint programming and better understanding of technical issues and procedures
           resulted from the development of a stronger working relationship between the PCU
           within the Ministry of Sustainable Development and the Ministry of Health;


                                                9
   ·   Reduction in processing time of requests as a result of project staff capacity
       strengthening activities - procurement and fiduciary training on Bank rules and
       regulations, and;
   ·   Improved proposal writing and access to funds by civil society organizations and
       line ministries.

Procurement. From the project onset, procurement was difficult, frustrating and a lengthy
process for the project team who did not fully understand the project, Bank regulations and
guidelines. The first procurement plan took over a year to develop. The operational manual
did not provide guidelines on how the procurement team should work with civil society, and
a system was not in place to provide funds to civil society. The Bank's procurement
guidelines did not fit a small island scenario of procuring goods and services ­ few suppliers
were available in-country, often leading to external bidding, which was a cumbersome
process and often caused delays. A simpler model of procuring civil works was agreed by
the PCU and the Bank after the mid-term review. After project restructuring, procurement
of goods and services occurred at a faster rate, which led to the delivery of 90% of goods at
the closing of the project, with the exception of the autoclave system and the IT platform.
Biomedical waste supplies and materials and some equipment for the IT platform were
purchased during the project implementation. The refurbishment of two health facilities in
Nevis, also did not take place ­ see MTR section.

Financial Management. During the mid-term review, the mission team noted that the
project team was operating on outdated policies related to the management of special
accounts ­ it was recommended that the government negotiate an interest bearing account
with their Bank. Payment Schedule 1 was simplified as a result of the mid-term review
(increase in percentage of expenditures to be financed and elimination of disbursement
conditions). By the closing of the project, the financial management system was in place
and operating effectively, however monthly bank statements continued to be submitted late;
as did the audit.

MTR, QER, and Extension. The project restructuring included a one year project
extension. Implementation challenges were identified and solutions were proposed as stated
in Section 2.2. The project extension allowed the project to complete the majority of its
activities, totaling $3,367,114.88, or 83% of loan proceeds. Some activities were not
completed: (i) setting-up the IT platform; (ii) procuring an autoclave for medical waste
disposal; (iii) strengthening the M&E system; and (iv) refurbishing two health centers in
Nevis. Some reasons for not completing these activities, include: (i) technical advice on the
IT platform from Bank consultants was varied, inconsistent, sophisticated and expensive for
country needs and local technical capacity was lacking to determine country needs, (ii)
delays in obtaining information to tender materials and supplies for the autoclave system
resulted in government seeking alternative financing mechanisms, (iii) lack of consistency
and continuity in the provision of M&E technical assistance by the Bank, other donors and
bilateral agencies, and (iv) the cost to refurbish Nevis health facilities was significantly
higher than budgeted. The government decided not to request a second project extension.
Instead, it has indicated that it will use its own resources to finance activities not completed
under the World Bank project.

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. The indicators in the PAD were numerous (5 DO indicators, 17 intermediate
outcome indicators, and 3 process indicators) given the capacity constraints of the country.
There was a heavy reliance on data collection through KAP surveys and epidemiological
reports even though a second-generation surveillance system was not in place on the island
and the country was not equipped to conduct KAP surveys ­ overall research capacity in St.
Kitts and Nevis is limited. Baseline data was not available at the beginning of the project
and proxy data was not used, therefore target setting was a challenge. During project
restructuring, the six-country OECS Behavioral Surveillance Survey, 2005-06 and anecdotal
evidence were used as the baseline, which resulted in a revised, refined and harmonized
framework that responded to national and donor reporting requirements. The number of
indicators was reduced to 12 and aligned with internationally accepted UNAIDS UNGASS
indicators.

M&E implementation. Several consultants from various agencies (CAREC, CHRC,
PAHO, UNAIDS, World Bank) provided M&E technical support to the project at various
times during project implementation ­ an M&E system is under development. Data
collection was difficult, particularly the consolidation of data from St. Kitts and Nevis. The
project team had numerous indicators to report on, multiple partners to report to and limited
tools to gather, analyze and synthesize the data. As a result, reporting requirements were
not fulfilled. Specific measures were taken to build national M&E capacity in 2006. An
MOU was signed between MOH and CHRC to provide M&E basic training to three staff
(two from St. Kitts and one from Nevis) over a four month period (completed in 2007), who
have been identified to carry out M&E duties part-time. Most of the indicators in the
revised, harmonized results framework were process indicators; only two outcome
indicators were identified. The MOH recognizes the M&E system requires additional
strengthening and is working on making the necessary improvements.

After project restructuring, the project team prepared progress reports, which were shared
with World Bank supervision missions. Beyond reporting to the World Bank and other
donor agencies, regular, systematic reporting to cabinet does not occur. The only major
study related to HIV/AIDS that occurred in ST. KITTS AND NEVIS was the OECS BSS
survey in 2005, which was used to provide baseline for the project. The project team will be
involved in a KAPB survey in 2010 that will collect behavioral data to indicate outcomes
and possible impacts of the HIV/AIDS response, vis-à-vis, provide the data to substantiate
the success of the Bank project. Data collection, which will also inform this ICR (UNGASS
reporting) has started, and will be completed in March 2010.

M&E utilization. M&E data was not always used by decision-makers to inform policy.
Data were reported to donor agencies and shared with limited stakeholders and
implementers.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment. An environment assessment rated the project as B at time of appraisal. In
2006, a biomedical waste management system was set-up by a consultant who will return to
the island to train staff on the system. A medical waste autoclave system was recommended
for biomedical waste management, but not procured before the closing of the project. The
project was in compliance with Bank safeguard policies.

Financial Management (FM).             Overall, FM quality improved significantly during
implementation and the St. Kitts and Nevis project team complied with Bank fiduciary
requirements. At the onset, FM was weak, with technical and fiduciary teams struggling to
cope with their responsibilities. The situation changed after the mid-term review when the
government of St. Kitts and Nevis took a more active role in monitoring project activities
and hired a project accountant. A payment problem was encountered with the contractors of
the Pogson Health Facility; however, it was resolved by project closing. External audit
reports were received late each fiscal year, due to delays from the auditing firm.

Procurement. All procurement was handled by the PCU. At mid-term, an ex-post review
of procurement activities was done ­ the project team had complied with all Bank guidelines
in all cases.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The HIV/AIDS project was a catalyst for change in St. Kitts and Nevis. It legitimized AIDS
in-country, put HIV/AIDS on government's agenda and paved the way for other donors (e.g.
leveraging funds from the Global Fund through the OECS regional project) to invest in
AIDS. The country does not envision a follow-up HIV/AIDS project through the Bank;
however, government has absorbed project staff to ensure program sustainability. In
addition, government gave an indication that it would support the national HIV/AIDS
response, including free provision of ART.

The government has expressed interest in developing a health sector project focusing on
non-communicable diseases following country elections in 2010.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives, design and implementation of the project are highly relevant and consistent
with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals as expressed in the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers, CASs, and Sector Strategy Paper. It is now known that the HIV epidemics
in the Caribbean (including St. Kitts and Nevis) are complex and possibly unique, exhibiting
neither the highly concentrated pattern of most countries nor the widely generalized pattern
of Eastern and Southern Africa. This makes programming especially difficult, and puts a
premium on employing heterogeneous prevention methods, which the project did. The



                                            12
project objectives and project activities are also in line with country priorities as outlined in
the previous (2000-2005) and recently completed National Strategic Plan (2009-2013) and
the regional Caribbean HIV/AIDS response. However, more priority should have been
given to strengthening the surveillance system to develop the needed data.

3.2      Achievement of Project Development Objectives

St. Kitts and Nevis is a small island with a population of approximately 49,000 in 2006.
Provision of health services and data collection capacity is limited ­ a population-based
survey has not been carried out in St. Kitts and Nevis, nor have there been any other studies
or assessment done to indicate the success of the national HIV/AIDS response. Overall, the
major achievements of the project were (i) an IEC campaign that reached the general
population, (ii) the reconstruction of health facilities and procurement of equipment and
drugs has benefitted the entire population, and not only those living with HIV, and (iii)
Bank-funded investments in building human capacity are being used now to implement
other donor-led projects; and since the project closed, all project staff have been absorbed
into the government structure and are working within the Ministries of Health and
Sustainable Development.

Some of the project targets were achieved, but there is limited quantitative data to
substantiate whether the project has achieved its development objectives. As is typical of
HIV projects in advanced epidemics, most indicators in the results framework are
internationally recognized process indicators that do not measure DO results. The two
outcome indicators in the results framework have no baseline data, but the country will be
conducting its KAPB study in 2010 to determine changes in behavior. To assess project
achievements, the ICR team also collected as much qualitative evidence and data as possible
on physical changes before and after the Bank project.

Before project restructuring:

Before project restructuring, very few project activities were completed to meet the original
PDOs, (11.6% disbursed before project restructuring) therefore, the PDOs are rated
unsatisfactory. Under each PDO, the following achievements are noted:

      (a) Scaling up prevention programs targeting high-risk groups as well as the general
          population:
                 (i)    Eight sub-project by CSOs were undertaken
                 (ii)   VCT provided to pregnant women and their partners
                 (iii) Purchased condom vending machines

      (b) Strengthening treatment, care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS
          (PLHIV):
                 (i)    Refurbishment of three health facilities in 2005/6
                 (ii)   Purchased laboratory equipment




                                               13
    (c) Strengthening St. Kitts/Nevis multi-sectoral institutional capacity to better respond
        to the epidemic:
                (i)    Clinical Care Coordinator was hired
                (ii)   Technical assistance provided for developing a biomedical waste
                       management system
                (iii) Set-up and establish the national response under the auspices of
                       NACHA and financed chair of NACHA
                (iv)   Recruited project accountant and M&E consultant

After project restructuring:

After project restructuring, numerous activities were completed by the project team -
achievements are noted below. Note ­ PDO ratings are based on achievements per the
results framework and completion of activities related to the PDOs.

PDO 1: Scaling up prevention services for high risk and vulnerable groups and for the
general population. There is little evidence to indicate the success of the World Bank
project in scaling-up prevention services for high risk groups because stigma and other
barriers constrained the project team from doing much work that directly targeted MARPs.
The IEC/BCC campaigns conducted during the life of the project have not been evaluated
and therefore, the extent of its success is unknown. However, many of the implementers
interviewed indicated that more people and communities were aware of HIV/AIDS today
than before the project started. It is also likely that by legitimizing AIDS as a subject for
public discussion, the project helped create the space for non-governmental groups
(especially the Caribbean HIV/AIDS Alliance) to work directly with MARPs. It is
anticipated that the upcoming KAPB study (2010) will provide data on the outcomes of the
IEC/BCC campaigns. The PDO rating is based on the achievement of two process
indicators and several key activities conducted under Component 1. See Table 4 for
additional information. This PDO is rated moderately satisfactory.

                                                           small).

Key prevention activities conducted by the project team focused on targeting the general
population and included: (i) Stop the Cycle IEC/BCC campaign in the form of
advertisements, bill boards, banners, and posters were visible throughout the island. Many
other awareness campaigns were also conducted ­ see Annex 2 for a comprehensive list, (ii)
distribution of advocacy/educational materials translated into Spanish to fit the needs of
migrant populations, (iii) Fifteen awareness campaigns/projects were conducted by NGOs
and line Ministries as part of their contribution to the national HIV/AIDS response, which
totaled 1.6% of project expenditure ­ very few NGOs exist in St. Kitts and Nevis. Before
the World Bank project, none of the line ministries were involved in the response to the
HIV/AIDS epidemic and HIV/AIDS was rarely a topic of discussion. By the end of the
project, public awareness on HIV/AIDS had increased and all line ministries had
successfully identified and conducted prevention activities within their ministries. See
Annex 2 for a comprehensive listing of all outputs generated under this PDO.

PDO 2: Expanding and strengthening treatment, care and support for People Living
With HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and mitigating the impact to those infected and affected by
the epidemic. The two outcome indicators in the project did not have a baseline, making it
difficult to determine whether the targets have been reached. Three out of four process
indicator targets under Component 2 have not been reached, however other major
accomplishments are noted that substantiate the achievements of this PDO, see Table 5.
This PDO is rated moderately satisfactory.

Targets were not reached as a result of: (i) stigma forces many positive patients to seek
health care services outside the public sector ­ either from private physicians on the island,
or in neighboring countries, (ii) nutritional and social support is demand driven, however
issues of stigma and discrimination may be another reason why PLHIVs do not actively
seek support when needed, even though it is readily available. Greater emphasis should
have been made by the project team to (i) collect data from private physicians, who provide
care to the majority of HIV/AIDS patients and (ii) expand community based coverage of
PLHIVs. Stigma remains a major problem in St. Kitts and Nevis.

Significant achievements under this objective include: (i) reconstruction of Pogson Health
Facility that provides comprehensive health care services to residents of several rural
communities ­ coverage is approximately 10,000 people; (ii) procure and distribute
equipment to strengthen laboratory and pharmaceutical services, which is not solely limited
to HIV/AIDS; (iii) project funds purchased second line drugs and provided them free of
charge, while first line drugs were provided through the Global Fund grant and the Brazilian
Government, free of charge, (iv) 45 condom vending machines were installed, and (v)
significant capacity building for the provision of PMTCT and VCT services (21 sites) to
approximately 1,998 beneficiaries.

Planned activities that did not occur: (i) procurement of a medical waste autoclave system
and (ii) the refurbishment of two health facilities in Nevis, see Section 2.2-2.5 for more
information.

PDO 3: Strengthening the institutional capacity of the MOH, other government
agencies and civil society organizations to ensure an effective multi-sectoral response
to the epidemic. Significant strides were achieved in capacity building of project staff, civil
society and line ministries in areas of fiduciary management, procurement, grant preparation
and use of funds and reporting. However, two major activities were not accomplished at the
end of the project ­ setting-up and operationalizing the IT platform and M&E system.
Furthermore, HIV related activities have not been mainstreamed into work plans and
budgets. The PDO is rated moderately satisfactory.

Component 3 of the restructured document responds to this PDO, and the indicators used to
measure success are indicators 9, 11 and 13 (see Table 6 for more information). Other
outputs stated in the project document are also highlighted. Note ­ none of these indicators
had a baseline.

The MOH did not have prior experience working with CSOs and had to quickly learn how
to manage their projects. The HIV/AIDS coordinator was also the CSO/line ministry focal
point working closely with representatives from line ministries and civil society, which was
important in jump-starting the multi-sectoral response (2007), which up to this point had not
been implemented. The project funded five ministries and 18 civil society organizations to
implement HIV/AIDS activities in communities. Approximately 20 project staff benefited
from capacity building training and have been retained by the government after the closure
of the project. More resources were allocated and spent on capacity building activities,
based on the need for staffs to implement the project as outlined in the re-structured
document. The IT platform was problematic because the country did not have the capacity
to determine its needs and the Bank equally did not provide appropriate technical advice,
see section 2.2 for more information. The M&E system also had many drawbacks related to

3.3     Efficiency

As part of the horizontal APL for AIDS in the Caribbean, this project was covered by the
economic analysis conducted for the program as a whole. Accordingly, the PAD did not
include a separate economic analysis for St. Kitts and Nevis. Both the PAD and the ICR
team did not conduct a rigorous economic analysis of the project. However, other indicators
were reviewed; see Table 8 which shows interventions believed at the time to be cost-
effective.

Source: Ainsworth and Teokul, 2000

In the PAD, the first four activities in Table 8 accounted for 49% of planned project costs,
however when compared to actual expenditures, no funds were spent on these activities
according to the June 2009 financial management report. This is inconsistent with the data
provided in the results framework, which indicated that VCT targets were exceeded and
PMTCT targets fell short of being achieved by 3%.



                                                        18
Approximately 69% of project funds were spent on strengthening the health facility and
laboratory capacity, which did not include other prevention services such as condom
distribution, VCT and PMTCT, OI, ARV and biomedical waste management. The health
facilities provide comprehensive care, which serves the general population and not only
those who are HIV-positive. Only six percent of project funds were spent on prevention
services, including IEC/BCC campaigns when 50% of young women and men aged 15-24
years correctly identified ways of preventing HIV and rejected major misconceptions about
HIV transmission. The project did not work directly with MARPs, who are potential drivers
of the epidemic; however, another organization which is experienced in working with these
hard-to-reach populations exceeded project targets. The operational cost of the project was
0.8% of the loan. In the years since the project was prepared, the professional literature has
cast increasing doubt on the efficacy of some interventions and on the feasibility of
calculating the discrete benefits of many others. It now appears more likely that some of the
most important outcomes of HIV programs are the threshold effects they produce on norms
and behaviors through the cumulative impact of multiple interventions. As many of the
benefits of the project are intangible, they are impossible to quantify, however in the
interviewers conducted by the ICR team, project staff and beneficiaries indicated that the
project made a significant difference in the lives of people from St. Kitts and Nevis,
providing an environment where HIV and AIDS issues could be discussed. The ICR team
rated the efficiency of the project as moderately satisfactory.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The project objectives, design and implementation are highly relevant and consistent with
country development priorities, and Bank CAS and corporate goals. Even though
qualitative data and physical changes observed indicate that the World Bank project had
made a difference in the lives of the people of St. Kitts and Nevis and PLHIV's are better
off today than six years ago ­ the overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory
because inadequate quantitative data is available to corroborate the outcomes of the project.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)   Poverty Impact, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The ICR team did not undertake a specific assessment on gender and/or poverty impact;
however it noted that the project targeted most-at-risk populations such as MSM and SW.
The Caribbean HIV/AIDS Alliance was able to reach approximately 2,669 people from
October 2007 to September 2009, through individual health promotion programs. Through
the Bank project, food vouchers were provided to PLHIVs who needed nutritional support
to improve adherence to treatment, as well as comprehensive home based care, which
included psycho-social support. Four line ministries implemented activities that touched on:
Gender (teen mothers, low-income women, MSM, SW), Education (HIV/AIDS education
policy under review by donor agencies, peer education and female empowerment programs
all incorporate HIV/AIDS into the curriculum), Youth (youth groups use the media and



                                             19
youth parliament as a means to tell their story and advocate for change), Labor (HIV/AIDS
work place policy forthcoming with support from ILO, in-house staff training on HIV/AIDS
has taken place).

(b)   Institutional Change/Strengthening

Some institutional changes were beneficial to the project team and the society as a whole: (i)
a strong working relationship developed between two ministries - Ministry of Sustainable
Development and Ministry of Health, which led to joint programming and a better
understanding of technical issues and Bank procedures and processes; (ii) capacity of
project staff, line ministries and civil society organizations was strengthened and resulted in
leveraged financing from other agencies such as Global Fund, PANCAP, etc. The
strengthened capacity allowed for more effective program implementation; (iii)
establishment of NACHA as an advisory and approval board for HIV/AIDS projects.

(c)   Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project did not anticipate working with the private sector; however towards the end of
the project, they actively participated in the IEC/BCC campaigns.

N/A

4.        Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The government of St. Kitts and Nevis has absorbed all of the project staff after the project
closed. They will continue to manage the national HIV/AIDS response, using the skills
acquired from the project. This ensures sustainability and continuity of the program. The
government is committed to continue to provide free ART for PLHIV even after the World
Bank and Global Fund projects close in 2009 and 2010 respectively. It is not clear whether
the government will continue to provide grants to line ministries and civil society
organizations so they can continue to work with their constituents to deliver prevention
programs. Stigma against PLHIVs may continue to drive the epidemic even further
underground making it difficult to conduct effective prevention, care and treatment
programs among MARPs and other vulnerable populations. The OECS BSS reported that
only 1- 5 % of population 15-49 years St. Kitts and Nevis expressed accepting attitudes
towards people living with HIV and AIDS.

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending
      phase)

Rating: Unsatisfactory

The project was prepared in a short period of time, was in line with country assistance
strategy, national strategic plan of the country, and had commitment from the highest level
of government - the Prime Minister of St. Kitts and Nevis was a recognized leader and
advocate in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the sub-region. The project included a
component that focused on strengthening the overall health system. Consultations took
place with other donors in the sub-region during project design. The project complied with
Bank fiduciary and environmental regulations; however, several issues were not considered
at project entry: (i) country situation/context was not considered when designing the project,
i.e. level of engagement of CSOs, (ii) institutional and implementation arrangements were
not well defined in the project document and operational manual, leading to delays in
project implementation by 2.5 years, (iii) the project design was overly ambitious for the
level of human and institutional capacity available in-country, (iv) absorptive capacity to
spend the resources, especially in an environment where Bank rules and regulations were
not well understood, (v) project indicators were too many and not realistic given the country
situation, (vi) twin-island set-up and operational nuances particular to each island, (vii)
political commitment did not translate into institutional commitment in St. Kitts and Nevis.

(b)   Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The project went through four task team leaders during the project life cycle, from May
2003 through June 2009, each with its own team make-up. There was little continuity, and
the St. Kitts and Nevis team noted that each new Bank project team brought a learning curve
that led to set-backs and implementation delays. The country was limited in implementation
capacity, and the Bank could have taken an active and frequent supervisory role during the
first few years of project implementation to ensure the project had set-up systems and was
on track to achieving results (see section 2.2-2.5). It was not until mid-way through the
project that the third TTL changed the dynamics of Bank's engagement with the project
team. The Bank's project team was able to identify and resolve implementation bottle
necks, and provide consistent, frequent, hands-on technical assistance and advice as quickly
as possible, which led to the achievement of development objectives.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory


                                             21
The overall rating for the Bank performance is moderately unsatisfactory, due to the quality
at entry rating being unsatisfactory, whereas the quality of supervision was rated as
moderately satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The government's commitment to the project was very strong at the project design stage;
however, this did not translate into institutional commitment, and thus faltered during the
first two years of project implementation.           Readiness to implement the project,
implementation arrangements and capacity were relatively weak as the project was initially
coordinated by the Permanent Secretary of the two ministries respectively, until the
appointment of appropriate staff. Implementation issues were not fully resolved until the
third year of the project. Counterpart funding was provided on time by the government and
the team was in compliance with fiduciary requirements. Government also increased its
contribution to the project from $460,000 to $1.01 million to cover the increased
construction costs of Pogson Health Facility. Attempts were made to strengthen the M&E
system, however more work needs to be done in this area. Coordination and partnership
with the World Bank was initially rocky, however by the time the project was restructured, a
strong relationship had developed. The government retained its entire project staff at the
closure of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The Ministry of Health is the technical arm of the HIV/AIDS project, whereas the PCU,
Ministry of Sustainable Development was responsible for all fiduciary aspects. These teams
worked very closely together and are located in the same building, which makes it easier for
joint programming. At the onset of the project, there were internal coordination issues
which led to delays. For example, back-up arrangements were not in place when staffs were
away from the duty station, which caused delays in project implementation. After the mid-
term review and project restructuring, momentum was gained by the project team, and they
were able to implement most project activities and disburse approximately 83% of the loan
within two years. Additional staffs were brought on board to assist with project
implementation, monitoring and evaluation. At the end of the project, an M&E system is
still not in place; however three staff members attended a four-month training at CHRC in
Trinidad and Tobago.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory


                                            22
The overall rating for the Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory, due to the
government and implementing agency performances rated as moderately satisfactory.

6.       Lessons Learned

The following lessons were learnt from the project:
     ·   Project design: Project design should match the country context and the capacity
         available in-country. Using a template model that may have worked in other
         countries creates implementation delays and unrealistic expectations. This applies
         especially to commitment by all stakeholders, especially CSOs and to establishing
         the appropriate institutional framework for program implementation. The project
         design could have had more of a capacity building and systems development
         emphasis.
     ·   Project coordination: Technical and fiduciary teams struggle to cope with
         responsibilities at inception in a country that is a first time borrower and where
         collaboration between more than one ministry is key to successful implementation.
         Therefore, ensuring that the operations manual is simple to use and clearly outlines
         institutional and project team roles and responsibilities is essential to the success of
         the project.
     ·   M&E: The capacity to implement M&E must be identified and addressed at the
         design stage and a budget assigned to it. This is especially important when no
         baseline data are available and need to be collected within the first year of the
         project. If that is not possible then proxy data should be used so that performance
         and outcomes can be measured and monitored.
     ·   Partnerships: Political commitment does not necessarily translate into ownership by
         implementers and beneficiaries of services. The Bank, regional organizations
         (CHRC, UNAIDS on behalf of the UN system) and other donors (GFATM) in this
         case needed to build stronger partnerships and coordinate activities. Lack of
         coordination shows up more readily in technical assistance for M&E.
     ·   Staff retention: The ability to retain technical and fiduciary staff after project
         closure is a necessary condition to guarantee operational sustainability. In the case
         of St. Kitts and Nevis, the skills and experience of trained staff were retained by
         absorbing the staff in the Government establishment and therefore staff will be
         available to continue controlling the spread of the HIV and mitigate its impact.
     ·   Bank Staff Continuity: Four TTLs over a six year period for a first time borrower
         and a small country is bound to result in poor client relationships, inconsistent policy
         and operational advice, less than satisfactory fiduciary and safeguards management,
         and insufficient proactive engagement with public and private partner agencies.

Reconstruction and Development

The borrower contribution at the end of the project is significantly higher than what was anticipated
at project appraisal. Mid-way through the project, construction costs in the Caribbean increased
and during project restructuring, the government agreed to increase its contribution to the project
from US$ 0.46 to $2.1 million. However, the government was not able to meets its $2.1 million
counterpart contribution.



Annex 2. Outputs by Component
(Costs in US$ was provided by the PCU, as of October 30, 2009)

Component 1: Scaling up HIV/AIDS response by civil society organizations, and line
ministries (US$0.02 million)

Although the implementation of this component experienced considerable delays in the
early stages, thirty two project proposals were approved and funded by the end of the
project, ten by line ministries and nineteen by CSOs. The projects targeted a wide cross
section of the population from the young to the elderly, and persons infected and affected by
HIV/AIDS.

Through the CSO - Facilitating Access to Confidential Testing, Treatment and Support
Group (FACTTS), this project was able to support PLHIV in various ways: 15 PLHIV
received food vouchers on a monthly basis from December 2008 to June 2009. Others were
able to participate in training exercises and workshops both nationally and regionally to
enhance confidence in peer advocacy activities.




                                                 25
The project was able to sensitize the general public through activities geared towards
behavior change, and the reduction of stigma and discrimination. Some of the awareness
campaigns implemented included: Men Make a difference (2005); Women, Girls and HIV
(2006); ABCDE of HIV (2006); Know your Status Campaign (2006); Respect I...My life, My
choice, My rights (2007); Keep the Promise (Lead, Empower Deliver (2007); and Keep De
Promise (2008). Eleven and twenty-one activities were organized by line ministries and
civil society organizations respectively, as follows:

Component 2: Strengthening the health sector response to HIV/AIDS (US$3.04
million)

The MOH hosted several activities geared towards promoting advocacy and behavior
change, including the annual World AIDS Day Campaigns and VCT testing days. Forty-
five condom vending machines were procured through a MOU with OECS/PPS, drugs were
purchased and distributed free of charge to persons infected with HIV, including pregnant
women.

Three health centers and one medical facility were rehabilitated in St. Kitts ­ Cayon,
Newton, Basseterre and Pogson, respectively. The two health centers identified in Nevis
were not rehabilitated.




                                           27
The PCU was able to procure equipment under this component to strengthen health facility
capacity. These include audiovisual equipment, a DT 60 II analyzer, and other laboratory
equipment which were installed and operational. Materials and supplies were also
purchased to support the current biomedical waste management disposal system at the
general J. N. France General Hospital.

A Clinical Care Coordinator was also contracted and retained through the end of the project,
while a laboratory technologist was contracted for twenty months.

Component 3: Strengthening surveillance, monitoring and evaluation and institutional
capacity for program management (US$0.77 million)

The MOH encountered several obstacles with designing the National Health Information
System. However, the PCU was able to procure the required equipment in a timely manner.

The chair of NACHA was appointed after the establishment of the advisory committee on
July 18, 2005. The project financed the contracting of a project accountant. Three staff
members within MOH participated in a four-month monitoring and evaluation internship at
CHRC in Trinidad and Tobago. Project staff and implementers directly involved with the
project received additional training from the World Bank and other agencies. All project
staff were retained by the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis following completion of the
Project.

An assessment of the Operations, Objective, Design, Implementation and Operational
Experience

The Loan Agreement, No. 7156-SC, for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project
between the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis (GST. KITTS AND NEVIS ) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) was endorsed on February
28, 2003 and became effective on May 29, 2003. An amount of US$4,045,000.00 was
provided to finance the National response to HIV/AIDS through focusing on the following
five priority areas for intervention:

     ·   Advocacy and Behaviour Change

     ·   Prevention

     ·   Improved Access to Care for PLWA

     ·   Surveillance, Epidemiology and Research

     ·   Sustainable Management Response

The objective of the Project was to control the spread of HIV/AIDS through scaling up
prevention programs targeting high-risk groups as well as the general population,
strengthening treatment, care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) and
finally, strengthening of the multi-sectoral institutional capacity to better respond to the
epidemic. Key performance indicators were determined and included in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD).

The PAD, Loan Agreement and the Operations Manual were the documents which governed
the operations of the Project. The Project design was satisfactory however procedural
details especially regarding the approval and implementation of projects by the civil society
organizations (CSOs) and Government line ministries were ambiguous. Initially, this
resulted in a slow uptake of funds from this budget line. Further, other international donors
which financed activities as part of the national response to HIV/AIDS required that
additional performance indicators be introduced and monitored. Consequently, the Ministry
of Health was confronted with the overwhelming task of monitoring a large number of
indicators.

As a result of the abovementioned issues it was recognized and agreed by the World Bank
and the Government that the Project should be restructured. The restructuring exercise
included a revision of the Operations Manual and corresponding amendments to the Loan
Agreement. This also facilitated the harmonization of all the indicators used for all the
donor agencies involved in the HIV/AIDS interventions in the Federation and a
simplification of the project design by realigning the Project components with the Project
objectives. As a result, the Project components and priority areas were streamlined to
reflect the following:




                                             32
        ·   Scaling up HIV/AIDS Response by Civil Society Organizations and Line
            Borrower's Ministries

        ·   Strengthening the Health Sector Response to HIV/AIDS

        ·   Strengthening the Borrower's Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation and
            Institutional Capacity for Program Management

The restructuring of the Project which became effective in June 2007, proved to be
beneficial as there was an increase in the implementation and disbursement rate shortly
thereafter. Moreover, it improved the prospects for meeting the Project objectives.

An assessment of the Outcome

Scaling up HIV/AIDS Response by Civil Society Organizations and Line Borrower's
Ministries

Under this component, the Project aimed to finance subprojects undertaken by Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS, provide training and care for
PLWA. The submission of proposals for subprojects increased significantly during the
latter part of the Project. While eight (8) subproject proposals were approved and
implemented prior to the restructuring process, twenty one (21) were approved and
implemented subsequent to the date it became effective. Some of the activities undertaken
by the CSOs included:

   ·   The production of a comic book geared towards alleviating stigma and
       discrimination of PLWA. This book was distributed to children at the primary
       school level.
   ·   A Nutrition Assistance Support Program which financed food vouchers to PLWA.
   ·   Several workshops and training programs
   ·   HIV/AIDS awareness carnival troupes
   ·   Trivia games geared towards increasing HIV/AIDS awareness


Strengthening the Health Sector Response to HIV/AIDS

Intervention in this component targeted:

   ·   The reduction of stigma and discrimination against people living with AIDS
   ·   The design and implementation of information, educational, communication and
       behavioral change programs
   ·   The carrying out a national program to promote condom use and increase distribute
       of condoms
   ·   Upscaling voluntary counseling and confidential HIV/AIDS testing program through
       the initiation of public national testing days and the provision of the necessary
       laboratory equipment and reagents to provide in-country capability for HIV testing.


                                           33
   ·   The strengthening of the technical and institutional capacity of the Borrower's health
       facilities and laboratories including the rehabilitation of the Pogson Health Facility
   ·   Improving the management biomedical waste in the country

Most activities earmarked under this project were successfully implemented. The MOH
launched several awareness campaigns to reduce stigma and discrimination, to inform,
educate and communicate behavioral change messages. Recognizing the expansion of the
Spanish speaking community in St. Kitts and Nevis, a decision was made to create
awareness campaigns targeting this segment of the population through the recruitment of a
Spanish Translator. Some HIV/AIDS awareness materials created in English were
translated to Spanish. Audiovisual equipment was purchased and distributed to Health
Centres to support continuous education and VCT programs. Further the MOH
implemented several VCT campaigns, distributed both male and female condoms and have
installed several condom vending machines in specific areas in St. Kitts and Nevis.

The MOH and PCU attempted to procure electronic billboards to further strengthen and
sustain the HIV/AIDS awareness campaign. Two attempts were made at the procurement
process. No bids were submitted for the first procurement process, while one bid was
submitted by the stipulated deadline during the second attempt. Unfortunately, the financial
proposal of the bid substantially exceeded the budget and the bidding process was therefore
cancelled. Additionally, the MOH and PCU proceeded with the necessary arrangements to
recruit an IEC/BCC Specialist to work with various stakeholders in order to design and
guide implementation of a comprehensive communication strategy to support the national
HIV/AIDS Programme. Regrettably, after the evaluation process it was discovered that
there were no suitably qualified applicant who was available to undertake the assignment.
Consequently, the MOH decided to utilize its staff in the execution of the IEC/BCC
activities. Despite these two setbacks, the MOH continued awareness campaigns through
the use of promotional items, brochures, flyers and t-shirts financed by the Project.

With regards to the Health facilities, the Project financed the renovation of three (3) health
centres namely, the Cayon, Basseterre and Newtown Health Centres and the construction of
the Pogson Medical Facility. Work on two additional health centres in Nevis was not
accomplished due to the delays in completing the necessary procurement process.

In addition, several pieces of equipment were purchased for the laboratory at the Joseph N.
France General Hospital in order to increase the capacity of HIV diagnosis and
management.

A consultant was recruited to devise a system for the biomedical waste management. The
resulting proposal included the procurement of supplies, materials and a new autoclave
system. The PCU and MOH were successful in purchasing the supplies and materials
however there were difficulties encountered during the procurement of the autoclave system
which resulted in extensive delays. Towards the end of the Project, a decision was made not
to proceed since there was no longer adequate time to complete the procurement process.
The Government of St. Kitts and Nevis will seek an alternative source for financing this
very important piece of equipment.


                                             34
Strengthening the Borrower's Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation and Institutional
Capacity for Program Management

Under this component, funds were allocated for the establishment and operation of the
National Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (NACHA), strengthening of the institutional
capacity for the implementation of the national HIV/AIDS program and disease surveillance
and strengthening the PCU in fiduciary management.

The NACHA was established in June 2005 and chaired by a medical processional who is
actively involved with the issues related to HIV/AIDS in the Federation. Officers from the
PCU and the MOH benefited from training workshops financed by the World Bank on
HIV/AIDS program implementation and fiduciary matters. Officers were also given the
opportunity to attend workshops jointly funded by other donor agencies on aspects that were
HIV/AIDS related. A notable training exercise was the internship training of three officers
made possible by the Caribbean Health Research Council (CHRC). The Officers were
trained in Monitoring and Evaluation techniques and have been deployed to assist with the
monitoring of the HIV/AIDS indicators.

The procurement of IT equipment to support the development of the country's surveillance
system had proven to be a challenge primarily due to a lack of in-country expertise in this
particular area. Several attempts and consultancy resources were utilized to conceptualize
the design of this platform however this was not finalized by the end of the Project
execution period. The Department of Technology, however, was able to identify the key
pieces of equipment that would complement and form the foundation of the new system.
The MOH and PCU with the assistance of the Department of Technology were able to
procure and finance these pieces of equipment through the Project.

Evaluation of the Borrower's performance

The Government of St. Kitts and Nevis experimented with a new model for implementing a
major Project which required scarce skills and knowledge. Project coordination and
management was therefore shared between two ministries namely the Ministry of
Sustainable Development and the Ministry of Health. A Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
within the Ministry of Sustainable Development was mandated to carry out the fiduciary
management of the Project. The PCU was staffed with a Project Coordinator, Project
Accountant, Procurement Officer and Administrative Assistant. This Unit had already
acquired some experience in applying the World Bank procedures since it was intimately
involved in the implementation of previous IRBD funded Projects such as the Emergency
Recovery and Disaster Management Project and the Emergency Recovery Project.
Additional training opportunities during the implementation of the Project also assisted in
strengthening skills and updating knowledge of revised Bank procedures.

Further, the PCU fulfilled all fiduciary responsibilities as stipulated in the Loan Agreement.
A financial management system was maintained including records, accounts and financial
statements in the format acceptable to the Bank to reflect the operations, resources used and


                                             35
expenditures related to Project activities. Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) were
submitted on a quarterly basis and annual audits were conducted.

The Ministry of Health was responsible for technical matters and collaborated with the
relevant stakeholders in fulfilling the requirements of the Project. The NACHA and CSOs
also provided support to project implementation.

The PCU and the MOH met and communicated regularly to monitor Project
implementation, to resolve any issues that can create bottlenecks and also to update Project
plans.

During the early stages of the Project, the execution of activities occurred at a very slow
pace thus resulting in a low disbursement of loan funds. This was partly due to the
unfamiliarity with the Bank procedures by the technical officers at MOH, the uncertainty
regarding the responsibilities of key players and weakness in the Project design. Subsequent
to various training sessions with the MOH staff and the restructuring of the Project,
implementation and disbursement increased dramatically. The Government of St. Kitts and
Nevis further demonstrated commitment to the achievement of the Project objectives
through exceeding the financial contribution requirements under the Loan Agreement.

Overall the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis was able to accomplish the objectives of the
project. Therefore, the general performance can be considered satisfactory.

Evaluation of the Bank Performance

The Project has been through four (4) Task Teams since the inception. These many changes
were inconvenient and resulted in a weak Bank-GST. KITTS AND NEVIS coordination.
The third task team however worked with the Project for the longest tenure and made a
significant impact in terms of project implementation and management. This team
recognized the need for the restructuring of the Project and worked diligently and in close
collaboration with the MOH and PCU in the completion of this process. The PCU and
MOH therefore wish to recognize the invaluable contribution to project implementation
made by Mrs. Mary Mulusa and her team. The regular missions to the Federation and the
development of a valuable working relationship resulted in a significant improvement in
project implementation.

Easy access to Bank staff, quick responses to correspondence, advice and the availability of
Bank staff to assist during critical periods have contributed in part to the overall
accomplishment of project objectives. In general, the World Bank's performance can be
rated satisfactory.

Proposed Arrangements for Future Operation

The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project had been a very different experience
compared to previous World Bank funded projects undertaken by the Government of St.
Kitts and Nevis. In particular, the working relationships with the CSOs had proven to be


                                            36
more complex than originally anticipated. Given the rich experience provided through this
Project the PCU and MOH have identified some arrangements that can be instituted when
implementing or managing projects of a similar nature:

   ·   A new modality for engaging CSOs should be establish in order to encourage early
       buy-in the overall objective of the project, to inform CSOs of their contribution to
       the project and to strengthen the organizations' capacity to prepare, implement and
       manage projects.

   ·   Work programs should be integrated for several ministries.

   ·   The commencement of the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project provided
       leverage to attract additional resources to support the current and future work in this
       area. During the execution of the Project other opportunities to access resources
       from other donor agencies to address different aspects of the national response to
       HIV/AIDS were presented to the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis. The acquisition
       of these funds has assisted the Government to sustain its national response to
       HIV/AIDS. Therefore under future initiatives, efforts should be made to explore
       additional resources in order to promote the sustainability of the project/program.


Lessons Learnt

   1. As far as possible, flexibility must be built into the project design to facilitate
      unexpected events which can delay project implementation.

   2. Where technical deficiencies are noted in country, particularly in relation to
      bids/proposals, evaluation and development of appropriate specifications and terms
      of reference, resources should be provided from the project to recruit competent
      short-term consultants to assist where necessary.

   3. Knowledge of the procurement procedures of the World Bank should not be
      confined to the officers at the PCU but should be extended to the personnel of the
      implementing technical agency and other stakeholders. This would aid in expediting
      the implementation of the project activities.

   4. Having the same officers on the Bank and Beneficiary's team, as far as possible,
      during the tenure of the Project can assist with continuity, consistency and avoid
      delays in Project implementation. Where this is not possible, efforts should be made
      to establish formal handing over procedures to improve project specific knowledge
      within the team at any given point.

Economic and Financial Analysis

The project had a direct impact on the lives of those individuals who received support
financially in the form of food vouchers for a seven month period, and also those who
were able to receive medication free of cost. This allowed them to have more disposable
income and provided them with the means of meeting their other obligations. Further,
this allowed for continued employment and less days away from work as a result of
morbidity associated with HIV/AIDS. The food vouchers also provided revenue for the
business owners who partnered with FACTTS, thus increasing their income. The tax on
this income further creates revenue for the Government which ultimately contributes to
the GDP and the economic status of the Federation.

The Project also supported the reconstruction of the Pogson Health Facility as well as the
renovation of three (3) health centres on St. Kitts thereby enabling increased access to
medical and health care to at least 10,000 persons including vulnerable groups of the
population, namely women, children and young people who are considered the most at
risk group to HIV/AIDS. These individuals, many of whom are from lower socio-
economic environments, would not normally be in a position to pay for health care
delivered in the private sector. The project has therefore contributed positively to
ensuring that individuals remain healthy so that they may lead worthwhile and productive
lives.

These activities will be far reaching as persons are now fully aware of the epidemic and
are now more inclined to monitor their sexual behaviour and ensure that they are
protected. This will positively influence the economic stability of the country as the
number of infected persons is expected to decrease significantly in the future.
