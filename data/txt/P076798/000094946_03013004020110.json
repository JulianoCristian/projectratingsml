KITTS AND NEVIS:\n            CARIBBEAN HIV/AIDS PREVENTION CONTROL,TF026626-PHRD-DOMINICA: CARIBBEAN\n            HIV/AIDS PREVENTION CONTROL PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7156", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project will combat the incidence,\n            and impact of HIV/AIDS in St. Kitts and Nevis, and will\n            include initiatives by the public, and private sectors to\n            strengthen the institutional framework, and build capacities\n            responsive to the epidemic. It is important to note that the\n            incidence of biomedical wastes within the framework of the\n            project, poses adverse environmental impacts, due to the\n            inadequate handling of infected materials. This audit of\n            biomedical waste management practices, presents its results,\n            following an assessment based on information, and review of\n            relevant documentation. While some legislation exists, there\n            are no specific regulations at the national level on dealing\n            with biomedical wastes, thus recommendations are made on\n            various elements that could be addressed in future\n            regulations. Short-term recommendations are provided for\n            immediate implementation, as part of a transition to the\n            full implementation of best practices, and a national\n            biomedical waste management system. Containers intended for\n            infectious wastes should bear the international bio-hazard\n            symbol; the UNIVEC safety boxes should be replaced with\n            puncture-resistant sharps containers, with lids to prevent\n            spillage. Such wastes should be transported to a selected\n            central collection point; steps should be taken to phase out\n            incineration practices, though as long as these persist, the\n            area should be kept clean with appropriate chimneys\n            installed, but only infectious waste should be incinerated -\n            toxic metals, chlorine, or chlorinated plastics should NOT\n            be burned. Incineration practices should be banned in the\n            long term, replaced by new efficient treatment technologies.\n            Long term recommendations addresses future legislation, and\n            regulations on biomedical waste management, considering\n            coordination with hazardous (non-biomedical) waste\n            management laws, as well as laws dealing with health, and,\n            establish national and local authorities to enforce such\n            legislation. An institutional policy on biomedical waste\n            management should govern the administrative and\n            organizational structures of health care facilities, to be\n            extended to occupational safety and health issues, waste\n            segregation and classification practices."}, "docdt": "2002-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
