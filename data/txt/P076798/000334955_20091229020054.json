KITTS AND NEVIS:\n            CARIBBEAN HIV/AIDS PREVENTION CONTROL", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7156", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and\n            Control Project for St. Kitts and Nevis were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project design should match the country context and the\n            capacity available in-country. Using a template model that\n            may have worked in other countries creates implementation\n            delays and unrealistic expectations. This applies especially\n            to commitment by all stakeholders, especially Civil Society\n            Organization (CSOs) and to establishing the appropriate\n            institutional framework for program implementation. The\n            project design could have had more of a capacity building\n            and systems development emphasis. Technical and fiduciary\n            teams struggle to cope with responsibilities at inception in\n            a country that is a first time borrower and where\n            collaboration between more than one ministry is key to\n            successful implementation. The capacity to implement\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) must be identified and\n            addressed at the design stage and a budget assigned to it.\n            This is especially important when no baseline data are\n            available and need to be collected within the first year of\n            the project. If that is not possible then proxy data should\n            be used so that performance and outcomes can be measured and\n            monitored. The ability to retain technical and fiduciary\n            staff after project closure is a necessary condition to\n            guarantee operational sustainability. In the case of St.\n            Kitts and Nevis, the skills and experience of trained staff\n            were retained by absorbing the staff in the Government\n            establishment and therefore staff will be available to\n            continue controlling the spread of the HIV and mitigate its impact."}, "docdt": "2009-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
