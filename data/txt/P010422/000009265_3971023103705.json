The project failed to meet its objectives,\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            unlikely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was unsatisfactory. Two main lessons can be learned from\n            this project. First, more attention should be devoted to\n            assessing the real degree of interest in the project on the\n            part of the ultimate beneficiaries. Second, the correct\n            financial intermediary should be selected. The PFC (Power\n            Finance Cooperation) was not the correct intermediary for\n            this loan. A direct relationship between the Bank and GOI\n            (Government of India) and/or state governments and/or SEBs\n            (State Electricity Board) may have produced better results.\n            However, at the time that the loan was made, GOI was not\n            willing to borrow directly for technical assistance, even if\n            the states were to be the final beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "1997-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
