The project\n            will cover technical assistance activities to be essentially\n            carried out in the form of advisory services extended to\n            state electricity boards (SEBs) and other power utilities\n            planning to enter into agreements with private parties for\n            the purchase of power, the takeover of distribution\n            activities or the management of existing facilities.  They\n            will include inter alia the provision of financial, legal\n            and technical advisory services to review outstanding\n            project proposals and assist in contract negotiations, and\n            assistance to SEBs to enable them to prepare and package new\n            projects well enough for them to invite meaningful bids, and\n            help them in the bidding, evaluation, selection, and\n            negotiation process.  The latter will focus on instilling,\n            to the extent possible, some degree of competition among\n            project developers, and on assisting in the implementation\n            of other forms of private sector participation."}, "docdt": "1993-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
