INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPiENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN FOR
A SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of the Sudan for the equivalent
of $23.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Droject to expand
power generation and transmission facilities in the Sudan. The proceeds of the
credit will be on-lent to the Public Electricity and Water Corporation (PEWC)
at 8 percent for a period of 24 years, including a four-year grace period.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission from the Bank visited the Sudan in November/
December 1971 and its report entitled "The Economic Development and Prospects
of the Sudan" (Report No. AE-27, in four volumes, dated June 9, 1972) was
distributed on June 30, 1972 (R72-179). This was the first full economic
mission to the Sudan after a lapse of several years but, owing to continued
political unrest in the southern part of the country at that time, the mis-
sion's coverage was limited to Northern Sudan. In March 1972, the Government
reached an agreement (The Addis Ababa Accord) with the southern dissident
elements, as a result of which peace returned to the South and a Southern
Regional Government was established in Juba with a large measure of autonomy.
At this time, the Bank was requested to assist in the reconstruction and
development of the Southern Region, which had suffered much physical destruc-
tion during the prolonged strife. A special economic mission visited the
Region in November/December 1972, and its report on development problems and
prospects in the Region was distributed on June 25, 1973 (R73-159) (Report
No. 119a-SU dated June 1, 1973). A review of the present position of the
Sudan's economy and the prospects for the future was presented in the
President's report on the Second Education Project, dated March 25, 1975,
(Report No. P-1495a-SU) and is attached as Annex IA. Country data appear
as Annex I.
PAPT II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE SUDAN
3.        The proposed credit would be the tenth credit to the Sudan, bringing
the total commitment of IDA funds to the Sudan to $152.8 million. IFC has
made two investments in the Sudan, totaling ($2.2 million). A review of Bank
Group lending to the Sudan was presented in the President's report on the
Second Education Project, dated March 25, 1975, (Report No. P-1495a-SU) and
is attached as Annex IIA of this report. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1975,
and notes on the execution of on-going projects.

PART III. EIECTRICITY AND WATFR SUPPLY IN SUDAN
B .k£rournd
The present total installed power capacity in the Sudan is 2L0 MW.
In coprparison with other countrie; at a similar stage of development, a
relat-ively large pro-ortion of the populat on (8-9%) have access to elec-
t-icity, although per capita consumption of electricity (24 Kwh) is anlorig
the lowest recorded in the world. Many small towns remain without elec-
tricit-y and rural electrification is limited to the highly developed irrigated
areas irn the Blue Nile and Khartoum Provirnces.  In 1973 the major uses of
electricity were industrial (h3%), domestic (37%) and agricultiure (12%).
);gricu1ltural use is expanding rapidly.  The total energy consumption was
3-' Gwh in 1973.
5.        The largest power operation in the Sudan is the Blue Nile Grid,
with a total capacity of 170 M4W. It comprises a 90 MW hydroelectric
-r: lLation nn the Roseires Dam, a 15 MW hydro-station on the Sennar Dam,
-,-d a number of thermel, diesel and gas-turbine plants with a combined
capacity of 65 MW. The remairnder of the power sector (70 MW) is made up
of a enunher of isolated installations in other regions of the country too
remote tc be connected tc the Blue Nile Grid. The largest of these isolated
.c-e r.s are at Atbara, Port Sudan and Khasm el Girba. With the exception
-   r. P-solated diesel plants operated by various individual users (,wmounting
90 about 30 M4W in all) all of these installations are owned and operated by
the ?ublic Electricity and Wa-ter Corporation.
The Link between Power Generation   Irrigation and Water Sap-y1
6.        The generation of electricity in the Sudan has been initimately
linked with irrigation only since 1962 when the first hydroelectric station
:iL n e Bluc Nile system was ins'alled at the Sennar Dam, which had origiintally
been butilt in 1925 for irrigation purpo7ses only.  The Roseires Dam, constructed
a-n 1552, was designed as a dual purpose dam; the hydroelectric station was
-   1'.'Led in 1966, and the dam was designed so that its height could be raised
abuh-senuctrlt y to provide more water for both irrigation and power generation.
.oc] ~the-r two dams supply nearly half of the Sudan's power needs aind also
rox-:;de the water for the largest existing irrigation schemes in the Sudan

_rCe _  _nm and the periodic conflicts between the needs of irrigation and

The InStitutionm.i Framework
7.        The first Bank loan for electric power (No. 522-SU of 1968) was made
to the Central Electricity and Water Corporation (CEWC), the predecessor to the
presert borrower. When the CEWC was created in 1966, its powers were
vested in a Board of seven members. However, during the political chlanges
which occurred in the country in 1969, the boards of several public enter-
prises, including CEWC, were abolished and their powers taken over directly
by the Government. Between 1969 and 1974, CEWC had a difficult time with
several changes in ministerial responsibility, and the General Manager was
obliged to run the Corporation without statutory or formally delegated
authority. This difficult environment was exacerbated by excessive staff
changes and the inadequacy of the management consultants retained.   As a
result, operations of the Corporation were deficient in a number of respects,
and its commercial and financial position deteriorated.
8.        During the period of preparation of the proposed project, a variety
of necessary steps to restore the Corporation to an adequate standard of
operation have been agreed with Government and the Corporation, and some of
them have been implemented. In February 1975 legislation was passed which
restored the autonomy of the Corporation, now renamed the Public Electricity
and Water Corporation (PEWC), and provicded for inclusion on the PEWC Board
of the Director General of Irrigation and a representative of commerce and
industry to formalize the link with irrigation and to inject some commercial
and business experience.
9.        In addition to enacting the necessary legislation, the Government
and PEWC have agreed to a whole range of steps required to improve the
operational efficiency and financial position of the Corporation. As early
as January 1973, the General Mianager of the then CEWC had asked the Electricity
Council of the U. K. (ECUK) to review the Corporation's organization structure,
recommend the specific duties of each department, prepare job specifications
for senior staff, and propose a suitable training program. As a result of
this request, ECUK has prepared a comprehensive program, covering all aspects
of the Corporation's electricity operations, and offered to assist in imple--
menting it.  ECUK's institutional proposals are consistent with the restoration
of autonomy to the new Corporation under the recent Act. Organizationally
they provide for a greater degree of decentralization, improved financial
management and the creation or strengthening of weak departments such as
commercial policy, planning and staff development. The Government and PEWC
have agreed to these proposals, and PEWC has signed a technical assistance
contract with ECUK.  Under the assistance program, which will be implemented
over a period of two years, ECUK will provide about 14 manyears of technical
assistance for experts to work with PEWC and over hO manyears of overseas
training for PEWC staff.
10.       Another important reform will be the introduction of cost reflecting
tariffs for electricity. This would help to even out the peak loads, thus
minimizing the need for investment in additional thermal peaking plant, and
avoid waste during the season of abundant hydroelectricity. Peak demands



- 4 -
are currently suppressed only by administrative regulations. During
negotiations we discussed with the delegation the terms of reference of
the studies for a power market survey for the period up to 1990. It was
agreed that this study, which would be financed under the Credit, should
include a review of the scope for influencing the growth and pattern of
demand, as a long-term policy variable, by pricing policy or other means.
ECUK has agreed to assist in developing a cost reflecting tariff to be
implemented by January 1976.
11.       In addition to its functions of electricity generation and dis-
tribution, the PEWC is also responsible for urban water supplies. However,
there has been some debate over the advantages and disadvantages of PEWC's
having dual responsibility for power and urban water supply. The reasons
for this institutional arrangement are largely historical and administrative,
and since the responsibility for rural water supplies falls under another
ministry (National Resources and Rural Development), some rationalization
may be desirable. The Government and PEWC have therefore agreed to under-
take, with the assistance of ECUK, a detailed study of the advantage or
otherwise of continuing the functions of electricity and water supply
within the same entity. The WHO recently completed a sector study of
water supply and sanitation in the Sudan, which improves our knowledge
of the sector.
Sector Planning and Coordination
12.       The project will help to strengthen the planning of future power
development and will also improve coordination between competing users of
water in the Sudan. In the past, the responsibility for investigations and
development of water resources for hydroelectric power was vested in the
Ministry of Irrigation and Hydroelectric Power, which was not responsible,
however, for the generation and distribution of electric power. On the other
hand, the previous legislation governing the PEWC did not oblige the Corpora-
tion to investigate new power projects or to prepare a long-term development
plan. This legislative oversight, combined with lack of staff and several
changes in ministerial responsibility, meant that very little planning was
done. The new legislation governing PEW7C specifically assigns the Corporation
the responsibility for carrying out investigations of power projects and for
preparing development plans for the power sector. The Government has provided
assurances that by the end of 1976 PEWC will prepare an electricity plan
up to 1990, based on a market demand survey and studies of alternative
sites for hydroelectric development. With the help of ECUK, PEWC will
build up a planning unit which will then be responsible for long-term plan-
ning on a continuous basis. The terms of reference for the IDA-financed
studies will ensure that all possible alternatives are considered to minimize
the investment required and to maximize the use of the available water.
13.       The fragmented responsibility for irrigation, water supply and
electric generation has militated against the coordinated planning of the
Sudan's water resources as a whole. Since these resources are the basis
of much of her commercial agriculture as well as her only indigenous power



- 5 -
source, this lack of coordination has been a serious problem. Sever.1 steps
have now been taken to improve the planning of the use of the Nile w;ters
in both the short and long terms.   The Directorate of Irrigation wil- continue
to execute studies in the field of irrigation, including projects which have
a hydroelectric component. However, the Government has agreed that the
Committee for Coordination of the Operation of Roseires Reservoir will
now coordinate the investigation of all projects involving hydroelec,ric
generation. The General Manager of PrWC will be on this committee aitd
the Director General of Irrigation will be on the Execujtive Board of PEWC.
To supplement studies being carried out by the Directorate of Irrigation
for the heightening of Roseires Dam, the next irrigation expansion o07 the
Blule Nile and the possible multi-purpose development of the Atbara River,
the proposed IDA project will also finance studies of possible hydro-
electric sites on the Nile and the White Nile.
Demand Grcwth and the Investment Required
14.       Consumption of electricity has doubled in the years 1967/73,
during a period of slow growth in the economy. The economy has now entered a
period when an expansion of developrent expenditures seems likely.   Wahile
transportation, which is not a major consumer of electricity, will receive
a large proportion of rising development expenditures, planned expansion
in both the agricultural and industrial sectors necessitates a major increase
in electricity supplies. Electricity demand in the agricultural sector is
expected to increase nearly 300 percent in the period 1973181 (with the
Rahad project accounting for about a quarter of this expansion) and indus-
trial consumption by over 100 percent in the same period. These rates of
expansion are related to the implementation schedules cf known agricultural
and industrial projects. Irrigation pumping and agricultural processing
industries will account for about 50 percent of the expected increase *n
consumption.  The combined industrial and agricultural use is expectel to
amount to about 62 percent of electricity consumption in 1981 as oppc,3ed to
55 percent in 1973. Domestic consumption is expected to fall to 31 percent
of the total.
15.       The additional generating capacity provided for in the proposed
project will ensuae adequate capacity, with the appropriate mix of hydro
and thermal generation, until 1980.   The additional transmission facilities
are required to utilize fully the available generating capacity and to
ensure greater reliability of supply. The installations at Juba are required
to meet the needs of the regional capital of the South, which has grcwn in
size rapidly. A decision on the next major expansion of generating capacity
will be required by 1977 to provide adequate time for construction. The
long-term planning studies provided for in the project will establish the
demand after 1980 and determine the best way to respond to the rising demand,
taking into account plans for irrigation expansion. The possibility )f
influencing both the magnitude and pattern of demand through appropriLte
tariff policies will be considered.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
16.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Sudan Second Power Project"
(No. 516a-SU dated April 25, 1975), is being circulated to the Executive
Directors separately. The project was designed by PEWC1/ with assistance
from their consultants, Merz & McLellan.   The project was appraised in
January-February 1974. Three subsequent missions have followed to pursue
a variety of issues remaining unresolved after the appraisal mission.
Negotiations were held in Washington in late October 1974. The Sudanese
delegation was led by Dr. Nasreldin Mubarak, Director General of the
National Planning Commission, and included Sayed 2air Mustafa, General
Manager of PEWC.
Description and Purpose
17.       The project represents about 22 percent of the PEWC's total invest-
ment program for the six-year period to June 1979 and about 30 percent of
its investment in electricity supply in the period. The balance of the
electricity investment program consists of 17 MW of diesel units in isolated
towns, electrification of the Rahad Irrigation project and distribution
schemes in different areas. The project will ensure that the electricity
supply system can meet the demand in the major agricultural and industrial
areas up to 1980, and comprises: (a) the addition of a 42-M1W hydro unit at
Roseires hydroelectric station and of 15-1MW of diesel capacity at the Burri
station in Khartoum with complementary transmission line extensions; (b) the
addition of 5-MW diesel capacity to Juba power station, upgrading and extend-
ing the Juba distribution system; (c) long-term planning studies; and
(d) management consultancy services by the Electricity Council of the UK
(ECUK). The additions to the generating capacity and transmission network
of the Blue Nile Grid were selected as the least cost solution from four
alternatives, with a varied mix of hydroelectric, diesel and gas turbine
generation and varying requirements for additional transmission.
Cost Estimates and Financing
18.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $40.0 million,
including contingencies, which account for 19 percent of the total, and
customs duties and local taxes. The foreign exchange component is esti-
mated at $23.7 million (59 percent). The proposed credit would almost
cover the estimated foreign exchange cost, the local cost being financed
entirely from internally generated cash.
19.       Of PEWC's total investment program for 1973/74 to 1978/79, 63
percent is expected to be financed from internal cash generation, and
1/ Henceforth, the report refers only to PEWC, although it will sometimes
be clear from the context that the term refers to its predecessor, CEWC.

37 percent from loan capital. The IDA credit would represent 34 per.ent
of the new loan capital to be employed by PEWC in the period. The proceeds
of the IDA credit will be onlent by the Government to PEWC at 8 percent
interest for a period of 24 years, including a 4-year grace period. The
other sources of loan capital during the period will be the African Develop-
ment Bank ($4.6 million) and the Government of the Sudan ($40.5 million).
The Government's loan will be for the electrification of the Rahad Irriga-
tion project and for the water supply expansion program. This program gives
emphasis to improved efficiency of the water supply production and distri-
bution systems in cities currently supplied. New water works are under
construction in Khartoum and several other cities, and distribution networks
are being extended.
Construction Supervision
20.       Execution of the construction program vill take place under
PEWC's overall supervision, with the assistance of two firms of consul-
tants. One firm will provide technical services in regard to the
additional unit at Roseires, and the installation at Juba. The other firm
will assist with the transmission lines and the diesel units at Burrn.
Since there are no Sudanese contractors experienced In thte specialized
construction required for the installation at Roseires, foreign contractors
will be required for this component.
Procurement and Disbursement
21.       All goods and services costing over $20,000 will be procured
through international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Associa-
tion's guidelines. No preferences will be applied. The credit
will finance the CIF cost of the imported equipment and the entire cost
of the engineering services, including the foreign cost of construction
supervision. It is proposed that expenditures after June 1, 1974 up to
$300,000 for consulting services and the initial phases of the ECUK prog-
ram of technical assistance, be met from the credit retroactively.
Accounts and Audit
22.       PEWC's accounts are presented in accordance with public utility
practice. While the accounting system provides separate income statements
for the electricity and water operations, it does not permit compilation
of separate balance sheets and cash flows. PEWC has agreed to review its
system and prepare separate sets of accounts from FY73/74 onwards. This
will be necessary to monitor adherence to financial covenants.
23.       PEWC'a accounts are audited annually by a Sudanese firm which,
through a period of very weak financial management, has repeatedly under-
lined the shortcomings of PEWC's accounts. These accounts will cont-nue
to be independently audited.



Staff
2i.       A consequence of the lack of autonomy of the Corporation in
recent years, and of major weaknesses among the senior staff, has been a
low level of morale and motivation at all levels of PhDWC. The reorganization
of the Corporation now under way will provide the opportunity to advance
a number of well educated and able staff, using proper selection methods.
Assurances have been given to the Association that it will be consulted
prior to future appointments of General Manager, Chief Electrical
Ingineer and Chief Financial Officer. Difficulty has been experienced
in finding a suitable Chief Financial Officer. ECUK is assisting with
recruitment, and if no suitable candidate is found, ECUK will second a
senior official to PEwC for two years. In view of the vital nature of
this appointment, it is not intended to make the proposed credit
effective until the position is filled satisfactorily.
24.       The Corporation is one of the largest employers in the Sudan.
It is also overstaffed. WUile a direct reduction of staff would be
impractical, assurances have been given that no increases in its non-
technical unclassified staff will take place without prior consultation
with the Association.
Financial Position
26.       Several references have been made to the weak financial manage-
ment of PEWM. The position at the time of the appraisal was unfortunately
no better than it was when the first Bank loan was made to PEWC in 1968.
The consequences of this weak management and the steps taken and proposed to
improve the situation can be summarized as follows: First, management con-
sultants were not successful in introducing a computer in the accounts
department, which has caused large delays in billing and a consequent build
up in accounts receivable. In July 1973, the Bank sent a billing expert to
Sudan to assist, and some progress has been achieved. Further targets for
the reduction in receivables were agreed to during negotiations. Second,
while the financial return on PEWC's power operations was satisfactory until
mid-1974 (about 8 percent), PEWC's water operations have been running at a
considerable loss (a negative rate of return of about 4 percent), in breach
of a covenant under Loan No. 522-SU. The Government has agreed to introduce
a revised water tariff, the first since 1968, to provide for an increase in
revenue from the water operations. The introduction of the revised water
tariff, which will be a condition of effectiveness of this credit, will produce
a rate of return on water operations of 4 percent from 1975/76, as agreed in
section 4.03 of the Project Agreement. This is satisfactory in the circum-
stances. The new water tariff will not represent an excessive burden for the
lower income groups. Although only a 15 percent increase in the electricity
tariff level would be required to maintain the 8 percent rate of return on
electricity operations also specified in section 4.03 of the Project Agreement,
in the face of fuel price increases, PEWC has recommended a 30 percent increase.



-9-
The Government has accepted this recommendation, and intends to make the
increased tariff levels effective on July 1, 1975. Third, the losses in the
water operations, compounded by the build up of receivables, caused serious
liquidity problems. In the past, PEWC has been financed entirely through
debt, but in view of PEWC's liquidity position, the Government has now
agreed to convert its advances into equity and a loan from the Bank of Sudan
into a contribution in aid of construction. This changed position is reflected
in the balance sheet from 1974, which indicates a debt/equity ratio of 13/87
in 1973/74, and provides a sound financial basis for the new Corporation.
Fourth, PEWC's assets are understated, since the hydroelectric components
of multi-purpose schemes are not adequately represented, and a number of
undertakings taken over from the Public Works Department in 1971 are not
represented at all. PEWC has now obtained the title to assets previously
unrepresented in the balance sheet, and has undertaken to revalue all its
ass,ts by December 31, 1975.
27.       The financial forecasts for the future, which are based on
conservative estimates of sales of electricity and water and the financial
return covenants agreed under Loan No. 522-SU, indicate continued improve-
ment. They also depend on restraint in the expansion of staff in accord-
ance with the Government's and PEWC's undertakings. The ECUK program
provides for considerable assistance to PEWC in improving the standard of
accounting, budgetary control and financial managment.
Justification of the Project
28.       The principal Justification for the project lies in the major
role it will play in providing the electricity required for expansion of
Sudan's basic productive processes -- agricultural production and agri-
cultural processing, and for the development of other industries. The
return on investment on the Blue Nile Grid expansion has been estimated
to be about 21 percent, and that for the Juba expansion, about 10 percent.
These represent a minimum estimate of the economic benefits, as the
electricity revenues do not reflect the full economic benefits of the
projects, and the cost of the transmission improvements has been allocated
in its entirety to this project, although the line will then be adequate
for the output of subsequent generating sets. PEWC is one of the largest
of the Sudan's public corporations. Restoration of PEWC to a healthy
financial condition would be a major contribution towards a higher level
of public savings, which is a principal prerequisite of an improved rate
of growth in the economy as a whole.



PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
29.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Association and the
Democratic Republic of Sudan, and the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Public Electricity and Water Corporation, the recoin-
mendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text of a draft
Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Agreements conform to the
normal pattern of the Associationts agreements for public utility
projects of this kind.
30.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit and Project Agreements
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI -- RECONIMENDATION
31.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approved the proposed
Development Credit.

THE ECONOMYI/
1        The Sudan, with an area of one million square miles, is the largest
country in Africa. Although a large part of the country consists of desert or
semi-desert, the Sudan has a great untapped potential for agricultural develop-
ment. About one-third (200 million feddan3 or `7 million hectares) of the total
land area is suitable for crop or pastoral production, and only a small fraction
of this land is presently utilized. Ir addition, the White Nile and the Blue
Nile provide an abundance of water which has enabled the country to develop the
largest irrigation system in tropical Africa. The Sudan has increased its use
of the Nile water to over half of that allocated to Sudan under the Nile Waters
Agreement with Egypt, but there remains room for a considerable further expansion
in irrigation in arid areas of the country. The proximity of Sudan to markets in
the Middle East and Europe places it in an excellent position fbr agricultural
exports, and oil producing Arab countries have increasingly come to consider
Sudan as its primiary future source of agricultural products.
2.        According to the most recent estimates of population the population
of the Sudan is about 17 million people, and has been growing at a rate of
over 2.5 percent a year during the 1960s. Much of the land is unoccupied or
very sparsely populated, and in contrast to iany developing countries, there
is no population pressure on presently developed land. Indeed, in some parts
of Sudan, a shortage of labor in combination with hard soils may dictate mechan-
ized techniques of agricultural production.
In spite of the large potential for development, the Sudan is a poor
country.  GNP is estimated at US$125 per capita, and the country is included
among the UN's twenty-five Least Developed Courntries.  The economy is heavily
dependent on cotton, which is the m.ajor commodity produced on irrigated land, and
also exports gumL arabic, sesame and groundnuts.  Its considerable grazing resources
have hardly been tapped. The manufacturing sector is relatively smRll and, apart
fror. the processing of some agricultural commodities, it is limited to the produc-
tion of consumer goods and building materials.   There is some potential for mining--
chrome, iron ore, asbestos and copper. There have been some exports of chrome
ore and the feasibility of developing the other deposits is receiving attention.
The puDlic sector has long been important in the Sudanese economy. It embraces
all modern irrigation facilities, the railways and virtually all power and water
supply. After the nationalization measures of 1970/71, a significant proportion
of industry, commerce and finance was also transferred to the public sector.
Although some industrial enterprises have been returned to the private sector,
about half of the GDP is still generated within the public sector.
4.        The Sudan's economic development has been disappointirig in re ent years.
During the period 1965-72, the Sudanese economy was characterized by slw growth,
bordering on stagnation. It suffered from a declining level of investr.nt--
private and public--a marked decline in external aid, rapid monetary ex:ansion,
and inflationary price increases. This unsatisfactory performance was artly
caused by the preoccupation of the Government with acute political prol-Lems,
r_irticul arly the disturbances in the South which divided the country ax i repre-
1/  Bxtracted from Report No. P-1495a-SU dated March 25, 1975.

sented a serious crain on resources.  With this problem settled, the Government
has been able to give more attention to its economic policy, and as a lesult
greater emphasis is now given to devclopment. In seeking to re-estabL!sh the
momentum of development in the economy to utilize Sudan's unique poten';ial, the
Government is faced with two major problems. The first is to step up the volume
of investment from its recent low level, in both the public and privatP sectcrs.
The second is to overcome the major physical constraints, particularly the inade-
quacy of the transport system, whichi is presently strangling the growtl- of the
economy.
5.        While total investment in the Sudan was stationary during the period
1967-73, the current development plan provides for ani ambitious investi:ment program.
An increase of about 40% was achieved in 1973/74 and a further considerable
increase is budgetted for 1974/75. To raise the level of investment sJgnificantly
will require an improved capacity in planning and project identification.  The
Bank is executing a project financed by the UNDP to strengthen the rel.tively
coiplex central planning organization which already exists.  The Bank has also
sent a mission to review the statistical system of the Sudan and has m: S.ie recor-
mer.dations for improvements. The Government itself is now considering a reorgani-
zation of its planning system. These steps should result in improvemeits in the
planning and evaluation functions in the medium term.
6.        In planning its investment program for the longer term, the -udan faces
difficult balancing choices. It must emphasize expansion of productio: in the
modern agricultural sector with a view to expanding export  earnings0  This will
imply expansion and improvement of irrigated farning which is highly c. pital
intensi\e but high yielding, and mechanized dry-land farming which dir ctly
benefits only small numbers of people. It must also promote agricultu, e in
the poorer parts of the country, which would yield much less for export and
requinr less investment,but would benefit much larger numbers of the poorest
people and lead to a better regional balance in incomes. Another choice will
concern the extent of mechanization so as to encourage employment, in   situation
where undoubtedly a labor surplus exists. However, investment in the 1 ome areas
of itinerant labor could soon reduce labor surpluses. Other questions concern
the incentive structure in the economy on which the recent ILO mission will have
recommendations to make, the extent to which industrial expansion shoui:d be encour-
aged, and the extent to which expansion of transportation facilities i' advance
of demand is justified for reasons of cohesive development.
7.        A major challenge for the Government will be to mobilize dom-stic and
external resources to finance a higher level of development expenditur-.. At
present, public savings are not adequate to finance even half of the p ojected
level of development expenditure. The IMF has had a series of stand-b: arrange-
ments with the Sudan and in both the IMF's consultations and the Bank's discussions
with the Government, specific recommendations have been made regarding budgetary
and fiscal measures needed to improve the financial situation. The ta burden is
relatively high, and the most urgent measures are curtailment of curre t expendi-
ture and a movement towards increased financial viability of public co porations.
These measures can only be effective over time, and the level of publi sector
investment in the Sudan over the next few years will be, to a great ex ent, a
function of the inflow of external assistance.



AINEX IA
Page 3 of 5
8.        In this connection Sudan's association with the Arab oil-erqrting
nations rray well be the key. The expectation is that Sudan may be able to meet
the food import requirements of rmany of these countries. A number of them,
through the medium of the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, are
considering very large investment plans in the agricultural sector and in infra-
structure required to facilitate agricultural expansion.  In addition bilateral
lending is likely to continue fran individual Arab countries.  If this capital
inDlow develops on a substantial scale it wrill remove one of the major current
restraints on the level of investment a%nd help overcome Sudants needs for foreign
exchange until its earnings of foreign exchange from exports carn rise.  However,
a rapidly increasing inflow of external capital will require improved capability
to plan and implement projects, and the need for a continued firm hand on the
government. s finances will be even more acute if Sudan is not to be cushioned by
the capital inflow into levels of public recurrent expenditure which are not
sustainable in the longer term.
9.        The inadequacy of the transportation system is undoubtedly the rrmost
serious inpmediate bottleneck to the development of industry, mining, agricultural
processing and the economyj in general. Transport in the Sudan still depends pri-
marily upon the railways, with a total route length of about 4,750kn. The rail-
way has played a crucial role in the country's development from a subsistence economy
by carrying the country's steadily rising imports and exports. However, under
the pressure of growing traffic and inadequate utilization of the present stock
O0 locomotives and rolling stock, railway capacity is severely strained. Major
capital expenditure is under way, with IDA participation, to improve the rail-
ways' carrying capacity, and further large investment is required. There are only
300 Dr. of paved roads outside municipal limits, the remaining roads being poor
sand and gravel tracks. A considerable investment program in new roads and for
improved maintenance of existing roads has been initiated, and studies for further
roads are being undertaken. Nile River transport could play a more imaportant role
-;r zat present, as could danestic air transport on account of the large distances
-Ithin the country. Considerable investment in both modes is planned. An oil
piLel-ne from Port Sudan to Khartoum is under construction.
10.       Compared with most other countries in Africa, the Sudan as a whole is
cuite well provided with trained manpower. This is attributable in part to the
fact tha-t the educational system has evolved over a longer period. A feature of
the system is that although the number of children in elementary and secondary
schools is still small in relation to their total age group, a high proportion
progresses to universities and other institutions of higher learning; enrollment
in these institutions has increased rapidly. There has been a growing problem
in absorbing some of the output of the educational system, particularly, university
graduates with general arts degrees. In the recent past, the Government has been
prepared, as a matter of policy, to hirc all university graduates needing jobs,
but this clearly entails considerable waste. There is an urgent need to proceed
with the reorientation of the educational system to make it more responsive to the
current demands of economic development. The Government is planning an education
sector study, which will derive considerable assistance from the finds of the -0LO
Enployment mission.

11.       Given the huge requirements for public sector investment in the immediate
future, the role of the private sector in promoting growth is recognized to be
very important. Although the public sector plays a major role in the economy,
historically the attitude towards private investment has at most times been favor-
able. The decline in private activity since l965 was mainly due to the unstable
political environment and the uncertainty generated by the nationalization and
confiscationi measures of 1970 and 1971. The Government has taken steps to settle
compensation claims, has returned sowe confiscated property and has enacted legisla-
tion provriding incentives and guarantees for private enterprises, both foreign and
domestic. There are indications of an improved level of investment in the private
sector, and of interest on the part of foreign investors.
12.       Currently, Sudan faces a difficult balance of payments situation partly
as a result of a deterioration in the terms of trade. The increase in oil prices
is expected to treble the oil import bill from about U-S$22 million in 1973 to about
US$68 million in 1975.  There is very little roomt for reduction in the use of oil
products, which is already tightly constrained, but addi-tional taxes were never-
theless imposed in an attempt to contain imports. The food import bill rose by
0% from 1,72 to 1973 and, on the basis of nine months figures, a further increase
occurred in 1974. The principal cause was the increased cost of sugar and wheat.
A major expansion in domestic production of both these commodities is under way,
which will soon remove this drain on foreign exchiange.  Other imports, particularly
of capital goods, should expand in proportion to the projected increase in invest-
ment. Export prices have been good recently, but are now well below the levels
of mid-1974. In the past fiscal year (1973/74) the current account of the balance
of payments was in deficit again, partly due to large rises in prices of essential
imports, and partly due to delayed sales of some exports, mainly cotton.  The IMF
has made a compensatory financing loan of $21.6 million equivalent to assist bridge
the gap until commodity sales recover, but in view of continued difficulty in the
market for cotton, a balance of payments gap for 1974/75 also seem inevitable.
The net foreign reserves of the country have been depleted since 1968, and at
December 1973 they stood at a negative figure of US$100 million. The latest INF
standy-by covering the period up to August ]975, provides 24 million SDRs.
13.       By mid-1974, the Sudants total external debt was estimated to be US$850
million equivalent, including undisbursed commitments of about US$450 million.
The breakdown of the total debt outstanding by source shows that the Bank Group,
bilateral sources and private banks are the three principal creditors with shares
of 23, 41 and 34 percent respectively. Debt service payments on long-term amounted
in 1973 to 11 percent (IBRD/IDA 3 percent) of the value of exports of goods and
non-factor services. While the Sudan has a good record in meeting its repayment
obligations, such obligations over the next few years are likely to absorb an
increasing portion of its foreign exchange earnings. A disturbing feature of
Sudan's external debt position has been the rising proportion of medium-term debt
contracted on commercial terms.   While a rapid increase in private and public
capital inflows is essential, it is equally important that the terms of public
capital inflow should be as concessional as possible. It is also important for
Sudan to give high priority to the productive investments and export promotion
policies which will enable it to substantially expand foreign exchange earnings.
The Sudanese are aware of the need to contain debt service within the cot ;try's
capacity to meet debt obligations. The Government informed the IMF that it has



ANNEX IA
Page 5 of 5
adopted a policy of not increasing external debt of less than five years' maturity
and that longer-term debts will be limited to those that contribute to the develop-
ment of the economy and are on favorable terms. Given the current balance of
payments problem, the government may have difficulty adhering to this policy,
but in view of this policy, and the emphasis being given to the development of
Sudan's considerable productive potential, particularly in the agricultural
sector, continued support from IDA and other sources of concessionary funds is
warranted. The major infrastructure investments required for the development
of a country as large as Sudan dictate the need for a continued flow of con-
cessionary funds.

C. _PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
The Bank and IDA have so far made six loans and eight credits to
the Sudan. Disbursements are either in progress or expected to commence
for the following projects.
Credit No. 122 Education Project; US$8.5 Million Credit of June 24, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Major elements of the project are about 36 months behind schedule.
Delays have been caused by belated appointment of consultant architects,
difficulties in establishing project implementation procedures, weaknesses
in management, excessively high quotations received for construction items
necessitating re-tendering of certain project components, difficulties in
obtaining deliveries of materials, and late arrival of technical assistance
personnel. Although these problems were to a large extent beyond the control
of the Project Unit, the latter's capacity to deal with problems has improved,
and work is now proceeding satisfactorily. Disbursements have picked up and
should now go more smoothly. Slight cost overruns will be met by the Government.
Extension of the Closing Date is likely. We will continue to monitor the
project closely.
Credit No. 311 Mechanized Farming Project; US$11.25 Million Credit of
June 12, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The first mechanized farming project (Loan 556-SU) to establish
about 140 farms of 1,000 feddans each (1 feddan - 1.038 acres) was completed
in July 1971, one year ahead of schedule and with substantial savings.
Encouraged by this success, the area of the original project was extended
by 75,000 feddans and a second mechanized farming project covering a further
420,000 feddans was approved for which Credit 311-SU was signed on June 12, 1972.
Implementation is going well, after some initial delays. Land clearing and
area under production are ahed of schedule and cooperation of other agencies
involved in the project, especially agricultural research, road construction
and water supplies has greatly improved. Progress on road improvements and
construction of a training centre are still behind schedule. Feasibility
studies for further expansion of mechanized farming have started. Disbursements
are picking up and should grow quite rapidly now.
Credit No. 331 Highway Project; US$7.0 Million Credit of September 29, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project comprises assistance to the Roads and Bridges Corporation
in improving its organization, in preparing a highway betterment and maintenance
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.

not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in projecti execution.

program and purchases of related equipment, spares and materials. Also
included are feasibility studies of about 500 km. of roads followed by detailed
engineering of about 350 km. and technical assistance to the Ministry of
Transport in transport planning and training of DaR staff. The project is
progressing satisfactorily on the whole. Although the consultants reports
were delayed, they have now been presented to the Government and the Associa-
tion.  Implementation of some of the recommendations is under way and provided
the award of contracts for equipment and spare parts is not delayed, the
project should be completed on schedule. The Government has selected consultants
for the feasibility studies of about 600 kns. of roads. 350 kms. of these
roads are likely to form the basis for a second highway project in the future.
Credit No. 364 Rahad Irrigation Project; US$42 Million Credit of
March 30, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is expected to irrigate an area of about 300,000 acres
which are now sparsely populated semi-desert on the East Bank of the Rahad
River. It will use water pumped from the Blue Nile and will include the
construction of irrigation supply, distribution and drainage works, the provi-
sion of agricultural processing equipment, storage facilities, and the settle-
ment of about 14,000 tenant families (about 70,000 people) with all the
necessary infrastructure and supporting services. The Kuwait Fund and USAID
are participating in the financing of this project by providing a loan of
US$11 million each. The Credit became effective on August 29, 1973. There
has been progress in preliminary earth-moving, design work and procurement
of equipment. Problems have been encountered in management of the project, and
there has been a poor response to invitations to bid for construction work
and supply of equipment. Significant cost overruns, stemming from various
causes, appear certain. IDA recently participated in discussions with the
Government, its consultants and the Kuwait tind and reached agreement on an
approach to the various project problems and to the financing of the expected
cost overruns. The project problems included difficult procurement issues,
the schedule for the introduction of improved irrigation and agricultural
techniques and project management. The Board will be informed in more detail
about the progress of the project when proposals for financing of modifications
to the project and of the cost overruns are made. Negotiations with the
Government of Sudan for an increase in the credit for this project are
cutrrently tmider way.
Credit No. 447 Industrial Bank of Sudan (IBS) Project; US$4 Million Credit
of December 14, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project will help the Industrial Bank of Sudan, which is an
existing development finance company, to function more effectively in
financing industrial development in the private and public sectors in the
Sudan. The Credit became effective on March 15, 1974. The Credit was expected
to meet IBS' requirements of foreign exchange for the two-year period through
1975, but business has expanded rapidly and the Association has already
approved sub-projects exceeding US$3.5 million. A possible second credit
for IBS is being negotiated.

Credit No. 457 Third Railways Project; US$24 Million Credit of January 31, 1974-
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is intended to help improve the R-iilways' operational
standards and provide the capacity needed to meet expanding demand on the trunk
routes. It also recognizes the need to develop complementary transport modes
by including components to assist river transport, port development and civil
aviation. The Credit became effective on July 29, 1974. Contracts for supply
of much of the equipment under the credit have been awarded. We are concerned
at the lack of urgency shown in the efforts to improve operational efficiency,
the major objective of the project and crucial for the country's development
program in general, and have raised this matter with the Government at the
highest level. We are also concerned at the possible impact on the project of
the decision to accelerate the dieselization of the locomotive fleet. Sudan
Railways and their consultants are working on the training and maintenance
implications of this decision.
Credit No. 476 Southern Region Agricultural Rehabilitation Project; US$10.7
Million Credit of June 5, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The Project, which forms part of a larger rehabilitation program,
aims at intensifying food production by (i) providing improved seed to
farmers, (ii) expanding extension services (iii) establishing a center for
nutrition research, and (iv) improving animal health and livestock production
through a program of vaccination, marketing and research. The project also
aims at rehabilitating the cotton and coffee growing industry, and establishing
the nucleus of a small-farmer dairy industry. Research, credit and technical
assistance, including staff for a Project Development Unit in the Ministry of
Agriculture to implement the project, are also included. The project became
effective on September 9, 1974. Some key staff members have been appointed
and work is in hand on recruiting further staff and providing housing for them.
Seed trials and seed multiplication are under way. The associated cattle
vaccination campaign, financed largely by Germany, is under way. A slow start
to this project was expected, but a supervision mission currently in the field
is reviewing the progress of the project, and will discuss with the Government
requirements for its more rapid implementation.

BANK GROUP LENDING TO THE SUDAN!'/
1.        Since the Sudan's Independence in 1956, the Bank Group has helped to
finance various development projects with commitments totalling $249.5 million
and has been the country's single largest source of foreign aid. A major
portion of our past lending was to help finance irrigation and railway projects;
in addition we also helped with one power project and an education project,
a highways project, and three agriculture projects. The Bank/IDA share of
debt service is 22 percent (1973). Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1975 and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
2.        Progress on Bank Group operations in the Sudan varies.  Difficulties
in obtaining materials, high bids which often require re-tendering and weak-
nesses in management continue to slow down implementation. Three projects in
particular have encountered problems in implementation-the First Education
Project, which was very slow in starting off, but is now proceeding satisfac-
torily; the Third Railways Project, where progress towards improved operational
efficiency is very slow; and the Rahad Irrigation, which has faced management
problems and serious cost overruns. Recent discussions with the Government and
cofinanciers, following a major supervision mission, has resulted in an agreed
approach to the various problems, including the financing of the increased
cost of the project.  (See Annex II).   The placing of supervision responsibility
in our Regional Mission in Eastern Africa for some projects is helping to
provide effective and timely technical assistance at critical stages of project
implementation.
3.        No loans or credits were made to the Sudan between September 1968 and
June 1972, largely because of the Government's failure to take measures necessary
to overcome its economic difficulties.  However, over the past three years the
situation has improved. The Government has resolved the conflict in the South
and an expansion in the level of expenditure on development projects is under
way, benefitting the whole country, including the backward Southern Region.
The financial measures taken under the continuing stand-by arrangements with
the IMF are further evidence of the Government's search for solutions to the
Sudan's pressing economic problems. While overall performance is still weak,
these steps provide justification for more active Bank Group assistance to the
Sudan.
4.        As the Sudan has considerable agricultural potential waiting to be
tapped, the Bank Group will continue to emphasize assistance to the agricultural
sector. Within agriculture, we have recently made a credit for a major irriga-
tion project and for an Agricultural Rehabilitation Project in the So th.
In addition, we are assisting the Government in preparing projects in livestock
and mechanized farming and other fields of agriculture. A second edu(ation
project, emphasizing training in the rural areas was recently approve-.

It will help to give a more vocational content to education curricula.
Lack of transport facilities continue to hamper movement of goods withir the
country and to the outside world.   Tbe Third Railway Project is intended to
improve rail transport and to help design further necessary improvements in
related transport faci1ities, In addition, a Second Highway Project is under
preparation, and included in the agricultural rehabilitation program is about
350 miles of agricultural feeder roads in the Southern Region. With the first
credit to the Industrial Bank of Sudan (IBS), the Bank Group is helping to
expand private investment in the growing industrial sector.   A second credit
to IBS is currently being negotiated. The first power project, which developed
some of the hydro-electric potential of the Roseires Dam was completed in
1972. The proposed project would develop these resources further, and assist
expansion of the electricity system in several ways.
5.        The Bank Group is actively seeking cooperation from bilateral sources
to supplement scarce IDA resources, for example in the financing of the Rahad
Irrigation project. In 1973 the Consultative Group for Sudan, which had last
met in 1964, was reconvened. Most of the original member countries as well as
some new countries participated in this meeting and expressed interest in
helping the Sudan. This seems likely to lead to increased external assistance.
At an appropriate time a further meeting of the Consultative Group will be held.
