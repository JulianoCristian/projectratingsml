1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       At the time of project appraisal, Tajikistan was one of the most fragile and poorest of
the CIS countries. The country was emerging from a five year civil war that ended in 1997, and
much of the infrastructure in the agriculture sector was dilapidated. By 2000, economic growth
was just beginning to recover, but the country still faced great hurdles to development, and the
great majority of its population continued to live in rural areas and rely on farming for survival.
The agriculture sector was (and still is) of vital importance to the economy of Tajikistan,
accounting for about 30 percent of GDP and 50 percent of employment. From the end of the
1990s, Tajikistan started the gradual privatization of former state farms in order to transform the
agricultural sector into a competitive market oriented system. This transition towards private
farms was supported by the Bank in 8 districts, through the Farm Privatization Support Project
(FPSP) which supported newly privatized farms on 18,000 ha. The FPSP started in 1999 and
closed in 2006.

2.       In Tajikistan, eighty percent of the cultivated lands are irrigated, but in 2000 most of
the principal irrigation and drainage (I&D) infrastructure (pumping stations, delivery pipes,
diversion structures, main canals, etc.) were in danger of collapse, after nearly 30 years of
neglect. This was becoming a major risk for the production capacity of the agricultural sector
and in particular for the viability of newly privatized farms supported under the FPSP, who
relied heavily on reliable irrigation services. It was expected that in case of no rehabilitation of
I&D infrastructure there would be a reduction in irrigable lands resulting in a sharp reduction in
rural incomes and in migration of the rural poor to urban centers or abroad. Therefore, the
Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (RIRP) emerged in response to a Letter of
Development Policy from the Government of Tajikistan that highlighted the need for: (i)
intervention in the rehabilitation of rural infrastructure; and (ii) introducing institutional reform
to water management. Institutional reform was essential, since in the aftermath of the civil war
and macro-economic instability, the organizations involved in water resources management
(including the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources - MIWR), oblast level organizations
(OMOs--Obijineniya        Machinogo      Orosheniya),      inter-raion    organizations    such    as
Meshraivodkhoz, and raion-level water management organizations (Raivodkhoz - RVK) had
shrunk dramatically because of severe budget constraints and had neither the staffing nor the
capacity to operate, maintain or let alone rehabilitate the I&D systems.

3.       The project was designed to complement the FPSP by focusing on the same
geographical regions of Yavan, Matcho, Zafarabad, Kolkhozabad, Sharinav, Rudaki (Leninski),
Khuroson (Ghozimolik) and Gissor raions, to support newly privatized farmers with improved
delivery of irrigation services and potable water. Furthermore, the project was designed to
contribute to the Government strategy, as expressed in the Letter of Development Policy, to
introduce institutional reform in the irrigation sector by decentralizing planning, administration
and management of primary and secondary irrigation and drainage canals, as well as to provide
a basis to transfer the operation and maintenance (O&M) of tertiary irrigation and drainage
canals to Water Users Associations (WUAs) and increase cost recovery of O&M.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.        The Project Development Objectives were: (i) to increase water supply and efficiency
in the main and secondary irrigation canals supplying the farms being privatized under the Farm
Privatization Support Project and adjoining farms; (ii) to develop institutional capability in land
and water resources management; and (iii) to improve the quality of drinking water in selected
villages. The Key Indicators (KI) were: (i) Improved average water conveyance in main canals;
(ii) Area well served with timely irrigation water in adequate quantities; (iii) Number of people
served by improved irrigation; and (iv) Increased water use efficiency and reduced water use
with more crop variety.


1.3 Revised PDO

5.        There were no changes made to the PDO or to the key indicators during project
implementation.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.        The project intended to benefit roughly 400,000 people who depend on irrigated
agriculture in the project areas through improvements in water infrastructure that aimed to
increase reliability of water delivery and timely water availability during critical periods of crop
growth. Of the 400,000 beneficiaries, 60,000 inhabitants in 23 villages were to benefit from
improved drinking water supply. Secondary beneficiaries of the project included organizations
involved in the management of water in the irrigation sector. These included organizations at
the raion and oblast levels, as well as the Tajikistan University of Agricultural Sciences (TUAS)
and the Tajikistan Land and Water Resources Management Institute (TLWRMI).


1.5 Original Components

7.        The RIRP was originally intended to be implemented over a period of five years and
included the following four components:

Component One: Rehabilitation of main irrigation and drainage works (US$ 16.2 million):
Under this component, the following works were planned: (i) Repair of head-works and
downstream protection works addressing main water supply to the project areas, upgrade of
emergency escape structures; (ii) Desilting of canals (about 1 million CM of earth works),
structural repairs and replacement of damaged canal linings wherever necessary; (iii)
Replacement of cross regulator gates (140) and selective rehabilitation of siphons, aqueduct
structures and outlets to the on-farm canals, including repairs to gates and surrounding
structures and installation of new gates and turnout boxes; (iv) Rehabilitation of drainage works,
involving desilting, improvement and reformation of the main and collector drains and cross
sections, cleaning and repair of vertical drains and replacement or installation of new equipment,
and repairs to out-falls; (v) Rehabilitation of pump stations supplying the main irrigation
systems (in about 30 locations); repair of electro-mechanical equipment; provision of essential
spare parts for the pumps, motors and transformers; repair of pump station forebays and
delivery bays; and replacement of delivery pipes where necessary; (vi) Repair of electric motors
and submersible pumps for tube wells; (vii) Re-establishment of water measurement devices (at
about 99 points) on the main canals and at the off-take points to each of the former state and




                                                  2

collective farms; and (viii) Selective improvement of access roads (101 km) to the main and
secondary irrigation canals and pump stations, including gravel surfacing.

Component Two: Provision of community-based village water supply in selected villages
(US$ 1.3 million): The project was designed to support the following activities:(i) Construction
of tube wells with submersible pumps in the village of Ak-Kurgan (Rudaki raion) and water
supply for nine hamlets in Matcho raion and all seven villages in Zafarabad raion; and (ii)
Rehabilitation of the pump unit in the water supply pump station of Firdausi Farm and
construction of a new pump station at Ittifok Farm, as well as laying of the main water delivery
pipelines in Kulabad village of Yavan raion and in three villages (Rokhi-Lenin, Suyunabad,
Yangiabad) of Kolkhozabad raion.

Component Three: Institutional capacity building for improved land and water resources
management (US$ 2.7 million): The project was designed to support institutional capacity
building to improve land and water resources management. This included several activities.
First, this component aimed to improve the management and operations of main water supply
organizations. Water supply organizations were located in each project raion (the RVKs) and in
the oblasts. This component was designed to improve their record keeping and monitoring,
analysis of water supply and demand, needs-based budget estimation, administration, setting
and collection of irrigation service fees, O&M rules, regulations and procedures; and
communication systems. Support for rehabilitation of offices was to be provided, as well as
office equipment, office supplies, training and technical assistance.

Second, the project sought to establish a transparent system of irrigation system fees (ISFs)
between farmers and RVKs, with progressive increases in order to arrive at full cost recovery
for O&M for the delivery of water from source to farmers within 10 years. Therefore this
component supported the establishment of WUAs of farmers at the field systems level. The
main functions of these WUAs would be to operate and manage field level irrigation and
drainage systems, collect water charges from beneficiaries, and pay for the irrigation services
provided by the RVKs. The project was to assist in the formulation of a Water Code that
would, among others, provide a legal basis for: (i) the establishment and functioning of
independent and self financing Water Users' Associations in the project areas; and (ii)
decentralization of water management responsibilities from RVKs to WUAs, downstream from
the intakes to areas under management by WUAs. The project would provide support for the
initial establishment of these organizations, like office equipment, vehicles, training, technical
assistance and operating costs.

Third, the component aimed to finance the strengthening of the Tajikistan University of
Agricultural Sciences.    The TUAS would receive support to provide new courses at the
undergraduate and graduate levels in water management, economics, finance, recent advances
in I&D technology, legislation, WUAs, and the like. The project would rehabilitate facilities,
upgrade the laboratories of the hydro-melioration department, provide support to the library,
training equipment and materials, and support faculty exchange programs, twinning
arrangements with foreign universities and study tours.

Fourth, this component aimed to establish the TLWRMI. This institute was to be established as
a center of excellence for applied research, training and demonstration of the efficient use of
land and water resources in the country. It would build upon the unused facilities of the Hissar
Polygon (demonstration farm), where such research was carried out in the past. Emphasis would
be placed on undertaking an applied research program to determine key parameters for


                                                 3

improved irrigation management in Tajikistan (crop coefficients, soil infiltration and run-off
characteristics, salinity tolerances, etc), and providing the institute with the necessary research
equipment to implement this program.          This institute eventually would provide practical
training for farmers and students in a variety of land and water resources management
technologies and practices suitable for private farming. The project would rehabilitate the
training facilities, upgrade the laboratories, provide essential equipment including office
equipment, and finance operating costs, training and technical assistance.

Finally, this component was to support a study of irrigation institutional restructuring,
specifically of the MIWR, to evaluate various institutional options and recommend suitable
mechanisms for the sustainable development of land and water resources in Tajikistan. The
study would encompass a detailed review and assessment of existing organizations,
organizational and management systems, policies for land and water resources development, the
legal framework, and lessons learnt from the experience from the implementation of the FPSP
and the RIRP and activities being undertaken in these projects, and an evaluation of a variety of
organizational structures from around the world. Stakeholder workshops would be held with all
the relevant agencies, institutions and beneficiaries, and a suitable plan for the restructuring of
irrigation institutions would be recommended. The project would also finance technical
assistance and study tours.

Component Four: Strengthening of Project Management and Implementation Unit (US$
3.0 million): For the management and implementation of the RIRP, the Project Management
Unit (PMU) established for the implementation of the FPSP would be strengthened with
additional technical, financial, accounting and procurement staff. A Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) would be established under the PMU in Dushanbe for day-to-day management of the
project and supervision of on-site construction and quality control. The project would finance
rehabilitation of the offices, equipment, training, technical assistance and operating costs.


1.6 Revised Components

8.        The components were not formally revised.


1.7 Other significant changes

9.        While the project was not formally revised, it was extended by six months to close in
December 2007 to take advantage of some savings in the project disbursement. These savings
came about because of a favorable exchange rate with the dollar that led to about US$ 0.79
million in additional funding at the project closing. The project was extended so that the PMU
could procure steel sheets that could then be made into large-diameter pipes for water delivery.

10.       Component 2 was originally conceptualized as investments mainly in civil works, to
construct and rehabilitate much-needed water supply infrastructure to about 60,000 people in 23
villages. Village Water Organizations (VWOs) would be established for these villages. The
VWOs would not own the potable water infrastructure, but be responsible for the O&M after
hand-over of the system after completion. In the first year of project implementation, it was
deemed more sustainable to use a more comprehensive Community-Driven Development




                                                  4

(CDD) approach1, where the VWO as a representative of the community would contribute 20%
towards the cost of civil works in cash or in kind, receive the project funds, manage all aspects
of subproject implementation, and afterwards would be the owner to the infrastructure. After
system hand-over, the VWOs were to assume full responsibility for the O&M of the potable
water supply schemes supported under the project.

11.         Under Component 3, the number of WUAs to be supported under the project was
gradually increased during project implementation from 16 to 41 in total under RIRP, in
addition to 9 WUAs established under FPSP. This expansion beyond the original target was
based on an interim evaluation at MTR in 2004, which at that time indicated that the WUA
model established under FPSP was successful and suitable for replication.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

12.         The main feature of project preparation was that RIRP was designed to complement
the FPSP, so in districts where private farming and provision of long term land lease rights were
already taking place. RIRP would complement the FPSP investments with investments in
improved irrigation and potable water infrastructure and increased institutional capacity. RIRP
was implemented by the same PMU, and as the FPSP also provided support to WUAs, RIRP
WUAs were established according to the model developed under the FPSP and partially
supported with trainings and technical assistance provided under the FPSP. Preparation of the
RIRP was financed under a Japanese PHRD grant.

13.         Secondly, the project was conceptualized under difficult conditions. The country had
recently emerged from civil war, institutional capacity was underdeveloped and the needs for
rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure were immense and outstripping the investment capacity of
both the Government and the IDA portfolio. Therefore, the choice was made at design to focus
project investments on preventing the imminent collapse of irrigation and drainage
infrastructure, in order to prevent shrinkage in irrigated area and associated loss of rural
livelihoods, and with a rather low investment of around 100 US$ per hectare, instead of aiming
for a more comprehensive rehabilitation that would required higher per hectare investment costs.
Furthermore, as there was hardly any private sector in Tajikistan to provide quality services in
design, engineering, construction, and construction supervision, rehabilitation was to be done
according to the available Soviet-era designs and technical specifications.

14.         A third key feature was that the project aimed to leverage the investments in irrigation
and drainage infrastructure with investments in institutional capacity building, establishing
WUAs, introducing progressive cost recovery of O&M and conducting a comprehensive study
on irrigation and water sector reform, in order to ensure the sustainability of project investments
in infrastructure rehabilitation. Based on the discussions with Government and the Letter of
Development Policy, the World Bank team expected that this would be realistic and feasible,
since Government had expressed its commitment to a gradual reform of the irrigation sector and



1According to the World Bank definitio, CDD is an approach to development that supports participatory decision making, local
capacity building, and community control of resources. The key pillars of this approach are community empowerment, local
government empowerment, accountability and transparency, and learning by doing. Under the CDD approach the project
channels funds directly to communities and the community manages all aspects of subproject implementation.

the agriculture sector. At negotiations, a number of concrete agreements were reached with
Government to support this reform. Among others it was agreed in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) that the project would carry out a restructuring study of the MIWR and that
Government would: (i) maintain the necessary policies and procedures to monitor the
achievement of the PDO according to the outcome indicators; (ii) maintain arrangements for the
maintenance by WUAs of operational and financial records and submit a status report on the
collection rate of the ISF; and (iii) review and adjust annually the ISF, based on a system of
progressive cost recovery of O&M, satisfactory to IDA. Based on these agreements, the PDO
was not just to maintain the current level of water supply, but to actually increase water supply
and efficiencies in main and secondary canals as a result of the complementary investments in
infrastructure and increased institutional capacity resulting in improved cost recovery of O&M
of the I&D systems.

15.       Fourth, an important design consideration was that Government was not willing to
allocate substantial budget for institutional capacity building and technical assistance for
Component 1, 2 and 3 and did not consider this essential for successful achievement of the
PDOs, in spite of its commitment to increasing capability in land and water resource
management. Budget for technical assistance was limited and mainly allocated to strengthen
the capacity of the PMU in procurement and financial management.


Component One: Rehabilitation of main I&D works

16.       The main objective of this component was to increase water supply and efficiency in
the main and secondary structures supplying the farms being privatized under the FPSP and to
prevent further deterioration of I&D infrastructure in the project area. At the time of project
appraisal as well as at project closing, the rural population of Tajikistan relied heavily on
irrigated crops, but the irrigation system was deteriorating rapidly, leading to a decline in
irrigation services and the failure of key structures, including headworks. A possible outcome
of this could have been a rapid decline in irrigated area and rural incomes, resulting in migration
of the rural poor in search of alternative employment. Given this scenario, the objective of the
component was clear and important, and furthered the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Tajikistan. It responded adequately to the development priorities of the Government
and as a result the component benefited from a strong Government commitment. The project
allocated sufficient resources for maintaining the existing level of water conveyance, but
depended on Government commitment to a reform of the irrigation sector and gradual increase
in funds available for O&M to achieve the PDO of an actual increase in water conveyance and
ensure sustainability of project investments. This was not realistic as Government commitment
to reform was not substantiated with adequate budget allocations for qualified technical
assistance that would have provided outside expertise in the field of O&M cost recovery and
sector reform, and during project implementation Government commitment reduced even
further.

17.       A joint IDA and Government assessment during the identification and preparation
phases of the project concluded that the highest priority was to reverse the rapid deterioration of
irrigation infrastructure and to maintain water supply through the swift rehabilitation of vital
irrigation infrastructure. Therefore, the specific scope of works for subprojects was proposed
by the Government and adopted by the RIRP during preparation. Rehabilitation was based on
existing Soviet-era designs with a straightforward scope of activities, which was considered
appropriate given that this was the first sizable attempt in Tajikistan to rehabilitate basic


                                                 6

irrigation infrastructure and given the limited experience of the PMU in implementation of
infrastructure projects.

18.        In the eight project raions, only about 48,000 ha or 38% of the total project area was
equipped with gravity fed systems, and 62% with pumped systems. Since most of the pumping
stations were in a very poor condition, it was estimated at preparation that these pumping
stations were likely to stop functioning within the next 3-5 years, leading to further declines in
the irrigation service area and in agricultural production. Therefore, around US$ 10.2 million
(around 67%) out of the US$ 15.3 million total funds allocated under Component 1 were
designated for the rehabilitation of pumping stations with the main intention to render them
operational for the next 8-10 years.

19.        Project design envisaged the support of an international technical team to review
designs and design cost-effectiveness, and assist with the adherence to appropriate technical and
quality standards. Budget allocated to design and construction supervision was around 2.2% of
the rehabilitation works, which was low compared to similar engineering projects, which
allocate around 8% to 12% of the costs of rehabilitation to implementation planning, design and
construction supervisions. As a result, the RIRP used the standard designs from the Soviet-era
(of which cost-effectiveness is not a key design parameter), and supervision of the
implementation of works was done by the oblast and raion water authorities, with support of
one international quality control irrigation engineer (IQCIE).

20.        The main risks for Component 1 were adequately assessed at project design, including
a substantial risk resulting from an unstable political environment, a substantial risk for the
timely implementation of acceptable quality of project works, and a moderate risk resulting
from the lack of availability of skilled specialists. In the risk framework, the continuation of the
Government reform program was identified as a mitigation measure to avoid the risk that
farmers incomes would not rise as rapidly as envisaged, whereas it would have been more
realistic to identify a decrease in the commitment from Government to the reform of the sector
as a substantial risk for the achievement of the PDOs.


Component Two: Provision of community-based village water supply in selected villages

21.        The main objective of this component was to improve the quality of drinking water in
selected villages, through the construction and rehabilitation of community-based potable water
supply systems serving 60,000 people in 23 villages2. Since 80% of rural areas in Tajikistan at
the time of project appraisal and of project closing does not have a reliable water supply from
clean water sources, and people mainly draw water from irrigation and drainage canals, the
objective was important and responsive to the development priorities in the project districts.
However, the component was marred by a number of significant shortcomings both in the
design of the CDD approach as well as in the technical designs, which eventually contributed to
a unsatisfactory outcome of this component. Most importantly, the CDD approach whereby the
project channels funds directly to communities and the community manages all aspects of
subproject implementation, was relatively new in Tajikistan, and was a significant deviation of
the top-down project management that was common practice. The PMU had no expertise or
experience with this approach, and no alternative implementation partners with experience in



2The number of 23 villages was reported through project supervision, but in the BCR 30 villages are reported. The
7 additional villages are in fact a number of neighborhoods (mahalas) part of the 23 villages originally targeted.


                                                         7

CDD were identified, nor where funds allocated to provide adequate technical assistance to the
PMU to build this capacity and have an appropriate staffing level to manage this component.
Second, at project appraisal, it had been noted that based on lessons-learned from the EU
TACIS program, villagers were too poor to make advance cash payments to the contractor for
construction of the works.       In spite of this, the project design included a community
contribution of 20% in order to enhance the perception of the community ownership over the
system. This 20% was to be provided both in cash (2% or more at the start of implementation)
and in kind (18% or less in labor and materials).       The rationale for setting the level of 20%
community contribution was not based on an affordability and willingness-to-pay analysis, and
given the poverty of the project areas, the assumption that communities would be able to
contribute significantly towards the civil works reduced the likelihood of the component
meeting its objective.

22.       The PMU reported that technical designs were finalized by relatively inexperienced
design engineers. Beneficiaries and system operators reported that technical designs included
pump capacities that were too low for the required head (elevation) and did not specify the
appropriate electrical devices to control power supply to potable water pump stations. As a
result, the World Bank evaluation team observed that a number of pumps were not functioning
because the electrical switchboard or the pump motors had burned. Little funds were allocated
to staffing for the supervision of civil works, and it was reported, and confirmed by
observations from the evaluation team, that construction of civil works was of poor quality and
included equipment that was not according to specifications and hence not adequate to meet the
design objectives. During project implementation some trust funds became available for a
short-term CDD consultant to build capacity in the PMU and the VWOs, but eventually the lack
of management capacity at the PMU in combination with the lack of construction supervision
resulted in very poor contract implementation, low capacity of the VWOs and unsatisfactory
achievement of this component.

23.       No specific risks were identified for Component 2 in the risk table. General risks rated
as substantial were the lack of a supportive environment for independent functioning of water
organizations resulting from resistance to change from raion administrators and the timely
implementation of acceptable quality of project works. This was correctly identified, as the
strict control of raion authorities over the activities of the rural population, proved not to be
conducive to the implementation of CDD approach and the establishment of independent and
autonomous VWOs. Risks not adequately mitigated included the substantial risk of the low
financial capacity of the communities to contribute to the project costs and the limited capacity
of the PMU to implement the CDD approach.


Component Three: Institutional capacity building for improved land and water resources
management

24.       The main objective of this component was to develop institutional capacity in land and
water resources management, through support to oblast and raion water management
organizations, establishing WUAs responsible for O&M, providing support to the TUAS,
establishing the TLWRMI and supporting a study on the restructuring of the irrigation sector.
This component was designed to address the poor state of water infrastructure management in
Tajikistan and facilitate the gradual increase of ISFs to meet real O&M costs over a period of 10
years. At project design, the actual budget for O&M of irrigation infrastructure was one-eighth
of the budget allocated during the Soviet times. Therefore, this component was highly relevant,


                                                  8

given the role of region and district water management organizations in the implementation of
Component 1, and the role of WUAs in improving the efficiency and sustainability of the
project infrastructure investments, through improving on-farm water management and
generating fees for increased O&M. Continued dialogue between Government and IDA during
preparation and implementation were adequate to ensure that at negotiation agreements were
reached on ISF record keeping and procedures for the gradual increase of ISFs under review of
IDA. However, at the level of the district authorities, it was noted that there was insufficient
commitment to especially the creation of WUAs, as it was not perceived in the interest of the
authorities to transfer ownership and management of on-farm irrigation structures to
independent farmer-based groups.        At appraisal it had been envisaged that Government
commitment to a gradual reform of the irrigation sector and continued dialogue with district
authorities would eventually ensure and increase in their commitment.

25.      The component was complex and relatively new to Tajikistan, but the component
design had some significant shortcomings. Most importantly, as under component 2, there were
insufficient budget allocations to technical assistance for this complicated component, and no
dedicated staff within the PMU to coordinate and be accountable for the component outputs and
outcomes.    Secondly, oblast and raion water management agencies were supported with
equipments and with a limited amount of training (9 in total) conducted by local institutes, with
limited input from external consultants with relevant expertise in water sector reform. The
project would have benefited from a more long-term and hands-on involvement of qualified
technical assistance and follow-up by the RIRP to provide backstopping in the implementation
of training skills and to ascertain that training skills would materialize in improved record
keeping, improved water management, gradual increase in ISFs and improved institutional
arrangements. Thirdly, support to the TUAS and the TLWRMI consisted of the provision of
equipments, facility rehabilitation and short-term training input provided by international
consultants.  A longer-term arrangement, allowing for a more continuous involvement of
experienced consultants could have contributed to proper training, hand-over and use of the
equipments in applied research, eventually did not materialize.

26.      With respect to the WUA subcomponent, project design deviated from best-practice
examples of projects with a WUA component from the World Bank and other agencies. This
resulted in a number of critical shortcomings that contributed eventually to the unsuccessful
functioning of these organizations:

   · Due to its complexity, support to WUAs under World Bank projects in general had a
       dedicated component with a significant amount of technical assistance. Under the RIRP
       support to the establishment of WUAs was a subcomponent.

   · WUAs were supported partially with equipment, training and management costs
       (payment of salaries through a declining contribution of 100% in the first year to 25% in
       the third year), but the project design did not dedicate adequate technical assistance and
       responsible staff within the PMU to coordinate the component, provide hands-on
       assistance and guidance to the WUAs, monitor their functioning and implement
       mitigation measures identified in the risk matrix.

   · Lessons-learned from other projects with a WUA component show that payments of
       WUA salaries by projects instills the perception among farmers and water authorities
       that WUAs are created as part of the project, and not with the objective to become the
       main organization responsible for water management in WUA areas. Therefore this



                                                9

        practice was known among World Bank sector specialist to be detrimental to the
        sustainability of WUAs, and in the RIRP it contributed to the unsuccessful outcome of
        this subcomponent, as many WUAs stopped functioning shortly after the project ceased
        to contribute to salary costs. Even as the financial situation of farmers was dire, mainly
        as a result of increasing debts to cotton investors and low financial returns at the farm
        household level, payments of WUA salaries was not essential for establishing successful
        WUAs, as some WUAs established independently or by other projects3 are functioning
        relatively well without external salary contributions.

    · The project established WUAs on administrative boundaries, along the boundaries of the
        kolkhoz brigades. Lessons-learnt from similar projects, show that WUAs preferably are
        established on the basis of hydraulic boundaries. WUAs established on hydraulic
        boundaries provide irrigation water to their members from water intakes under the
        operational control of the WUA, and as such O&M is less complex and the potential for
        water conflicts is reduced.

    · A key element at design was for Government, through the PMU, to ensure that accurate
        records would be kept and collected from WUAs regarding their operations and
        financial conditions. This commitment was also included in the DCA and indicators
        were established. However, the staffing level at the PMU and procedures included at
        design to gather data were inadequate to collect and maintain these records.

27.       Regarding the WUAs the component appropriately identified the need for a suitable
and comprehensible legal framework and set of procedures for the creation and operation of
WUAs to ensure the orderly transfer of the O&M of I&D infrastructure from state control to the
water users. The project emphasized the need for an appropriate legislative framework to be
passed by the Government, and on intensive training and provision of technical assistance for
the creation and functioning of WUAs.

28.       The main risks were identified at project design in the risk matrix, including the
substantial risk of the lack of a supportive and facilitating environment for independent
functioning of water supply and delivery organizations resulting from resistance to change from
local administrators. Proposed mitigating measures were generally adequate and included
continued dialogue with national and district authorities, demonstration of the benefits of
decentralization, wide information dissemination and consensus building, and encouraging
participatory approaches.

29.       The second risk rated substantial was the setting of adequate levels of irrigation
service fees by WUAs, and the ability and willingness of farmers to pay to cover O&M costs.
Proposed mitigation measures were generally adequate and included a gradual increase of price
of water and energy prices for agricultural purposes, provision of intensive training to WUAs,
strengthened record keeping, financial and management information systems, internal audit
from the outset; and information dissemination of collection rates, use of funds. However,
project design did not envisage sufficient financial and human resources to proper implement
these risk mitigation measures.

Component Four: Project Management

30.       Component 4 was not designed adequately. Sufficient budget was allocated to provide
technical assistance to the procurement and financial capacity within the PMU, but the staffing
plan only provided for 1 irrigation engineer in charge of implementation of Component 1, with
support by the IQCIE, and no staff dedicated to Component 2 and 3 of the project.


2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 Factors that have affected general implementation progress:

31.       The main factors affecting project implementation progress were: (i) decreasing
commitment from Government to a gradual reform of the agricultural sector and the irrigation
sector; (ii) an environment in the agricultural sector which became increasingly restrictive for
farmers to obtain sufficient income from agriculture and for independent community-led
organizations like WUAs or VWOs to function effectively; (iii) the lack of accurate and reliable
information from the M&E system regarding the outcome of project implementation; (iv) poor
capacity of contractors; (v) insufficient technical assistance to the PMU and organizations
established by the RIRP; and (vi) inadequate staffing levels and capacity at the PMU. Most
notably, and discussed in more detail in Section 2.3, as a result of the significant short-comings
in the M&E system, a number of implementation issues were not identified during
implementation. Based on the M&E reports, implementation progress and achievement of
project outcomes were reported satisfactory throughout the duration of the project, while in the
meantime a gradual decline in the achievement of project outcomes occurred.

32.       A core underlying element during implementation was and still is the agricultural
policy in Tajikistan, most notably in the cotton sector. The 2007 World Bank strategy for
agriculture sector development in Tajikistan4 noted that: (i) the impact of agricultural reforms
from the end of 90s onwards are limited, markets for commodities and farm inputs are weak,
and there is a flawed agricultural policy inhibiting rural poverty reduction; (ii) Government
control of cotton production and marketing is based on production targets and is combined with
local Government coercion of farmers to achieve these targets and to work with specific cotton
gins and investors; and (iii) by charging above market prices for on-farm inputs and paying
below market prices for cotton fiber, local governments collude with investors who squeeze
profits and oblige farmers to rely on them for inputs and seasonal finance, pushing farmers into
increasing debts. The 2007 Bank strategy drew on the findings of the 2004 Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis5 which already had identified that local authorities had incentives to collude
with rent-seeking stakeholders (i.e. cotton investors) in the cotton sector. As a result of this
environment, returns for farmers from cotton cultivation were decreasing during the lifetime of
the project, debts were increasing, and farmers were increasingly not able to determine the
agricultural production and management at their farms.

33.       The agricultural policy was also reflected in a reduced Government commitment to a
gradual reform of the irrigation sector. The power imbalance between rural communities and

district authorities inhibited the decentralization of water management and the effective
functioning of WUAs, as RVKs were instrumental in exercising local Government control over
the WUAs and enforcing water allocation schedules to meet cotton production targets. As
farmers' margins decreased, fewer funds became available to gradually increase ISFs to meet
O&M costs, and hence adequate funding to ensure the sustainability of investments was
jeopardized. This reduced commitment from Government was demonstrated by the lack of
reporting on the progress in ISF collection and cost recovery from the MTR in 2004 onwards,
and eventually also the study on restructuring of the MIWR was not carried out under the RIRP.

34.      For the three project components, specific factors affected implementation progress
and project achievements and are discussed in Section 2.2. A number of more general factors
listed below affected implementation of the RIRP, most notably in hindering implementation
timelines, but by project closing, these general factors did not significantly effect the
achievement of the PDOs:

         Procurement: Several factors contributed to a weak procurement process. First, the
         staff within the PMU had limited knowledge of procurement rules, leading to delays
         and confusion over procurement procedures.           This was coupled with an overall
         country environment where procurement of private company goods and services did
         not exist, the lack of private companies (and related lack of knowledge to prepare
         bidding documents), as well as a weak banking sector, lack of security instruments
         (such as letters of credit) and poor knowledge of public procurement processes all
         contributed to delayed procurement and disbursement of funds.

         Delayed counterpart financing: Significant delays within the Government to release
         counterpart financing caused additional delays in project expenditures, as well as led
         to the Bank to postponing reimbursement of counterpart financing pending compliance
         with procedures and a temporary downgrading of implementation performance to
         unsatisfactory. Much of this delay was caused by staff turnover that made training
         programs and knowledge retention difficult, and also led to increased staff trainings.

         External environment: In 2000, a major drought was followed by an influx of
         emergency drought relief funds. Many of the staff working on the RIRP were engaged
         in the distribution of these emergency funds, and the implementation activities of
         RIRP were delayed for several months. At the close of the disbursement of these funds,
         project staff returned to their responsibilities, and implementation of project activities
         resumed.

35.      These general factors were identified by regular supervision on the part of the Bank
team and the resulting delay was made up in 2004 under an accelerated implementation
schedule that, combined with supervision, led to the timely closing of the project. Other aspects
of supervision were judged less satisfactory by a quality supervision assessment (QSA)
conducted in 2006, which rated the supervision as moderately satisfactory. The QSA identified
that supervision was mainly conducted within multitask missions, which contributed to a diluted
focus on core implementation issues. Boundaries between RIRP and the FPSP were blurred and
hence the QSA identified the main challenge to be the measurement of attributable outcomes.
The QSA identified the Bank team's failure to update KIs as a major contributing factor to this
problem, but rated supervision moderately satisfactory based on the assumption that the project
would achieved the PDOs. In response to the QSA findings the supervision team from the end




                                               12

of 2006 onwards tried to update the KIs, but a lack of data and data accuracy provided by the
PMU restricted an adequate KI assessment.


2.2.2 Specific factors that affected implementation progress by component:

Component One: Rehabilitation of main I&D works

36.       The main factor that affected the timely implementation of this component was the
difficulty in obtaining appropriate and reasonable bids from nascent private companies in the
country both for design as well as for the implementation of civil works, and the lack of
adequate technical assistance for design and construction supervision. Because of the civil war,
Tajikistan remained behind other FSU countries in the development of a private sector that
could actively compete through a bidding procedure for works contracts. In addition to this,
weak capacity of the PMU regarding procurement and high staff turnover delayed
implementation of this component in the first years of the project. In general, the construction
works were undertaken under difficult conditions, as harsh weather conditions and the
obligation to ensure continuous water supply during the irrigation season limited construction to
relatively short time periods.      In addition, most of the local contractors lacked previous
experience with work planning and this type of extensive rehabilitation; and were not aware of
international standards and how to prepare bidding documents. Finally, original estimates for
I&D works turned out to be more expensive than anticipated, due, in large part, to an increase
of the prices of goods (pump equipments) imported from Russia. Especially in the first years of
the project, up till 2003, this negatively affected quality of works and construction progress.

37.       In the absence of a team of supervising engineers, considerable efforts both by the
PMU and IDA supervision teams were made during project implementation to improve quality
of both design and civil works under this component. A main contributing factor was the
recruitment of the IQCIE to assist the PMU from 2002 to 2005, who provided a series of
trainings to staff and contractors to explain the contracting and contract implementation
mechanisms and who was instrumental in improving compliance of civil works contract
implementation with quality standards.           Eventually this positively affected the project
implementation schedule and the quality of the works implemented from 2004 onwards, as
observed by the evaluation team. The rehabilitation restored water conveyance to previous
levels, but as reform of the water sector did not materialize, and O&M allocations remained
stable, an actual increase in water conveyance as targeted in the PDOs, was not achieved. This
was not adequately noted by World Bank supervision, and hence no additional measures to
either increase water conveyance or to modify the PDOs were proposed during implementation.


Component Two: Provision of community-based village water supply in selected villages

38.       Design of this component did not provide a strong basis for successful achievement of
the component's objective, and also during implementation several factors contributed to the
unsuccessful outcome of this component, both at the institutional and project management level
as well as at the technical level:

39.       The component was supported with a trust fund for a CDD specialist, who provided
training to the PMU and the VWOs. No other technical assistance was provided. During
implementation of the component, it was reported by the CDD specialist to the World Bank
supervision team that the PMU was not the most appropriate organization to build capacity at



                                                  13

the community level, since their main expertise was project administration. Also, it was noted
that the communities were committed to the approach, but that in the absence of a structured
approach to VWO capacity building, project activities continued to be implemented in a top-
down manner, much according to the Soviet legacy of project administration and
implementation, and not according to the principles of the CDD approach. Project funds were
not made available to the VWOs, and in practice implementation of the potable water
subprojects was done by the PIU, as they supervised the works, managed the contracts, and
disbursed funds to the contractors. From the start of the project, implementation was affected
by the low amount of cash community contributions and reportedly in Macho part of the system
was not constructed as a result of this. It was reported by beneficiaries to the evaluation team
that the level of community contribution was not adequately discussed with the beneficiaries
and had not been agreed upon with the community in general meetings. The community
contribution in cash and in kind was not adequately recorded in the certified Bill of Quantities
and as a result there was little clarity how much each of the communities contributed to the
implemented works. Poor capacity and ownership by the VWOs of the systems after hand-over
resulted in low collection rates from communities, improper O&M and a rapid deterioration of
the parts of the system that were functioning after hand-over. Support of the raion authorities
proved to be key for the functioning of the VWO and the quality of the implemented works. In
case of Zafarabad, the VWO has been merged into the jamaot and has full support from the
authorities. In other areas the VWOs have less support and in the case of Yavan local
authorities removed equipments on the balance sheet of the VWO to sites under the control of
the raion authorities.

40.       Civil works contracts in practice were managed by the PIU, who also made payments
to the contractors, with limited input from the VWO. This procedure did not contribute to
transparent implementation and empowerment of the VWO.              Contract management and
supervision of the construction of civil works was inadequate and, in combination with the poor
quality of designs, resulted in the installation of equipment that was not according to
specifications, delays in construction progress, and eventually in non-functioning systems in
Yavan and Kolkhozabad districts, and partially functioning systems in Matcho and Rudaki
districts. Poor contract implementation at times had negative externalities, as in the case of
Matcho, where back pressure on the spring during excavation caused the spring discharge to
decrease significantly, in the case of Yavan where pressure in the potable water network
existing prior to the project was reduced, and in the case of Kolkhozabad where construction
debris had not been removed by the contractor. Contract management documentation was not
according to engineering standards, as for several contracts changes were made without
amendments to the contract or variation orders and as-built drawings and O&M manuals were
not available.

41.       The PMU did not address these issues adequately during implementation, and also did
not provide correct information to the World Bank supervision team on the lack of
achievements of the component. For example, it was not noted by the supervision team that
project funds were not disbursed to the VWOs and that effectively project implementation was
done by the PMU and not according to the principles of the CDD approach. Beneficiaries in
Yavan stated to the evaluation team that during field visits the World Bank supervision team
was not provided with full and accurate information, in spite of the fact that VWO reportedly
highlighted implementation problems with the PMU. General problems of poor VWO capacity
and low community contributions were noted by the World Bank supervision team in summer
2005, and from that time onwards the team consistently urged the PMU to address this issue and


                                               14

further the capacity building of the VWOs through the recruitment of an international training
specialist. However, the supervision team did not note the extent of the problems with this
component, and continued to rate the outcome satisfactory, even when only a minority part of
the target population had been provided with water.


Component Three: Institutional capacity building for improved land and water resources
management

42.       The support to oblast and raion water management organizations did not face
significant implementation problems in the achievement of its' main outputs, training and the
provision of equipment.       However, the project did not provide continuing support to
operationalizing the acquired training skills and equipments in the daily activities of these
organizations, and as a result M&E and record keeping of water management, ISF collection
and O&M cost-recovery in the districts remained weak. The implementation of support to the
TUAS and the TLWRMI were hampered by similar difficulties: trainings on equipment were
limited, and reportedly O&M manuals were poorly translated and not understood by staff
trained in the use of the equipments. It appears that this went unnoticed both by the PMU and
the supervision missions, as no issues were reported with the outcomes of this subcomponent.

43.       This component also aimed to establish local level WUAs to take over the O&M of
secondary and tertiary canal structures. At the project's inception, it was understood that this
task would be monumental, given the lack of (i) private ownership of land holdings; (ii) support
from raion authorities to the emergence of independent farmers organizations; and (iii) political
will to pass a legal framework that would adequately equip these organizations with the ability
to collect fees. However, the lack of adequate technical assistance and staffing within the PMU
did not contribute to the effective implementation of this monumental task. In the first years of
the project, WUA salaries were paid by the project and WUAs received training under the
technical assistance component of the FPSP. Through the FPSP PIU field office, the PMU was
able to provide some backstopping to WUAs, and had a continuous dialogue with RVKs,
centered around the rehabilitation of works, but also to ensure RVK support to WUAs. At this
time, WUAs were relatively effective and farmers were satisfied with their performance. As the
project reduced the salary levels, from 2005 onwards, most of the WUAs started to lay-off staff
because of insufficient resources, and at the same time were not able to increase their revenue
through collecting ISFs, since: (i) the RVKs would interfere when WUAs would manage the
water supply not according to the priorities of the district authorities, which were set to meet the
cotton production targets; and (ii) farmers were indebted to cotton investors. A training
program provided by RIRP in 2006, by local trainers mostly in the training center in Dushanbe,
was providing extra skills to WUA staff, but was not able to reverse the negative trend.
Eventually, by the end of 2007, most WUAs stopped functioning altogether, and the ISFs were
paid mainly by investors directly to the RVKs.

44.       After 9 revisions of the original draft were reviewed by the Cabinet, the Law on
WUAs was eventually passed in November 2006, close to the project's closing date. It granted
WUAs the right to establish themselves as independent organizations registered with the
Ministry of Justice, to collect fees from WUA members and enter into contract with RVKs.
However, there is no supporting legislation within the Water Code to ensure that RVKs would
have to cooperate with WUAs, and as a result many RVKs had the legal mandate to by-pass
WUAs in critical water allocation decisions. Eventually, it was reported that in general the
RVKs considered the WUAs an unnecessary nuisance to meeting the objectives of the district


                                                15

authorities, namely to allocate irrigation water to farmers growing cotton. For example, in three
out of the eight project districts (Khuroson, Matcho, Yavan), the RVKS effectively did not
agree to the WUAs collecting ISFs from farmers and fees were paid directly to the RVKs by the
investor companies to whom the farmers are indebted, or by the farmers. In two districts
(Matcho and Rudaki), WUAs reported that in the early days of WUA establishment, WUAs
were not allowed by raion authorities to halt water delivery to farmers who did not pay ISFs,
whereas in Rudaki raion WUAs were instructed by the RVK to only admit farmers with more
than 5 ha under cotton cultivation as members to the organization.

45.       Similar to the performance under Component 3, the PMU did not address these issues
adequately during implementation, and also did not provide correct information to the World
Bank supervision team on the lack of achievements of the component, in spite of repeated
requests from the World Bank for an inventory of the status of the WUAs. Beneficiaries
reported to the evaluation team that the PMU was aware of the serious capacity and
implementation issues regarding the establishment of WUAs. The PMU provided an update
report in the draft BCR at project closing, but when the evaluation team found that these data
were partially incorrect, a more accurate report was submitted by the PMU only in the final
BCR, 4 months after project closing.

46.       During implementation, and in spite of repeated request from the World Bank
supervision team, the PMU did not provide the Bank team with an inventory of the status of the
WUAs, nor did the PMU contract with an international WUA training specialist. These
requests from the Bank were made after the supervision team noted from 2005 onwards that the
capacity of WUAs should be strengthened. Given the extent of the poor performance of WUAs,
the Bank's recommendation for the provision of additional training would have been
insufficient to reverse the declining trend in the achievement of the component outcomes.
Because of the poor progress reporting by the PMU, the supervision team did not identify the
gradual decline in performance indicators and the extent of the threats posed to the WUAs and
continued to rate the establishment of WUAs satisfactory based on performance indicators that
were not updated. Mitigation measures identified in the risk matrix to minimize the risk to
WUA functioning, like a continued dialogue with oblast and raion level water organizations,
and demonstrating the benefits of decentralization, were eventually not implemented.


Component Four: Strengthening of Project Management and Implementation Unit

47.       The greatest challenge to this component was the adoption and implementation of
appropriate procurement procedures. Reliance on foreign technical assistance for capacity
building led to higher costs within this component than originally anticipated, but was essential
for building up the procurement capacity within the PMU, as major procurement issues were
not identified during project implementation. Project management costs also ended up higher
than originally estimated because of a six month extension, additional consultancies required to
address issues of weak procurement capacity and staff turnover, and increases in unit costs. The
second factor that affected implementation was the absence of a functioning M&E system to
inform the World Bank supervision team of not only the project outputs but also of the project
outcomes.




                                                16

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design

48.       At the project's inception, a series of indicators were identified to measure the
progress made in achieving these objectives. Intermediate outcome indicators were designed
for all 3 project components, but were not reflected adequately in the outcome indicators, since
these indicators focused mainly on the results obtained through Component 1. The indicators
under this monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework included:

(i)   Infrastructure indicators: These included an increase in: (a) water conveyance efficiency
      in the main and field canals, (b) energy efficiency of the pumping stations selected for
      rehabilitation,( c) area serviced with timely delivery of water in optimal quantities for
      crops; and (d) number and types of farm groups being serviced by the improved I&D
      infrastructure.

      Key indicator used was the improved average water conveyance in main canals. Taking
      into account the water measurement and accountability practice in the main conveyance
      systems in Tajikistan and the lack of capacity of local staff at the time of project
      development, as well as the objective of the component, more relevant indicators in the
      result framework could have been identified. Due to the lack of a proper M&E database
      and system, and given the lack of adequate funds for system O&M (especially pumping
      stations) a more proper indicator would have been an increase in the functional lifetime of
      infrastructure supported by the project.

(ii)  Water Users' Associations and irrigation cost recovery indicators: These included: (a)
      formulation and adoption of a Water Code providing a suitable legal basis for the
      establishment and functioning of independent organizations providing water supply,
      delivery, and O&M; (b) increase in number of Water Users' Associations (WUAs)
      responsible for O&M of water delivery systems from the hydro-post to the individual
      farmers' fields; and (c) establishment of a transparent system of irrigation service fees,
      with progressive increases in level and improvement in collection rates in each of the
      project schemes.

(iii) Drinking water indicators: These included: (a) improvement in quality of drinking water;
      (b) increase in the number of independent, community-based VWOs with responsibility
      for O&M of the drinking water supply facilities in their villages; (c) increased level of
      community contributions of labor, local materials or funds for village drinking water
      supply facilities; and (d) increase in number of families receiving safe drinking water.

(iv) Capacity indicators: These included: (a) increase in number of persons trained in water
      resources management; (b) adoption of improved agriculture and irrigation practices; (c)
      increased level of practical applicability of the new subjects and training courses being
      introduced; (d) increase in the number of multi-disciplinary land and water resource
      management programs; and (e) increase in other forms of collaboration of water resources
      management faculty with specialists outside their departments and disciplines.


2.3.2 M&E Implementation

49.       Implementation of M&E was adequate in the first years of project implementation, but
inadequate in the last 3 years. A baseline study was prepared in 2001 for both the FPSP and the


                                                17

RIRP, since the two projects were designed to be complementary and had the same target areas
and beneficiaries.      The weakness of the survey was that FPSP was already under
implementation whereas RIRP was beginning implementation. An update to the survey was
prepared at MTR in 2004, for both projects simultaneously. Semi-annual progress reports were
produced in a timely fashion and of good quality regarding the outputs of the project, but with
inaccurate data on the achievement of outcomes. The PMU also prepared a mid-term evaluation
report including quantification of the indicators established under the results framework.
However, since MTR, few updates were provided, and towards the completion of the project,
the PMU did not report accurately on the outcomes achieved under the project. Most notably,
after 2005 the Government did not meet the reporting requirements regarding the condition of
the WUAs and the progress in ISF collection and cost-recovery as agreed during negotiations.
The Bank response to this omission could have been more adequate, as no explicit reference is
made in the project supervision documents to the reporting required under the DCA. Eventually,
M&E activities were limited to monitoring physical outputs and financial monitoring.
Indicators to evaluate the impact of component interventions were not followed systematically
and managed in a database, and as a result most of the data available at project evaluation were
mainly based on estimations of PMU staff and an extensive evaluation by the evaluation team
through field visits and review of data from the RVKs.

50.       The outcome indicators for Component 1 proved to be practically difficult to measure
because of the existing and persisting O&M practices at the water organizations, in spite of their
increased skills resulting from the training provided under RIRP. Also, neither the PAD nor the
Project Implementation Plan (PIP) identified any systematic data collection mechanisms, and
relevant baseline data were available for only a few of the subprojects. Furthermore, during
implementation of the project, discrepancies emerged between the indicators used in the PAD
and the indicators used at the MTR. For example, at the MTR an unrealistic increase of overall
efficiency of the main conveyance system from 65% to 80% objective was targeted, whereas in
the results framework a more realistic target of improved average water conveyance in main
canals was set.     Therefore, PMU progress reports and Bank supervision reports did not
adequately describe the achievements obtained for this indicator.

51.       While the outcome indicators for Component 2 were measurable, the draft and final
Borrower Completion Report (BCR) did not contain adequate and accurate information on the
final outcome of these indicators. For example, in the draft BCR it was reported that 100% of
the target number of 60,000 beneficiaries were being supplied with potable water, whereas the
evaluation team observed that in fact only around 17,000 people were being supplied. In the
final BCR, the coverage area remained overstated, and reductions in gastrointestinal diseases
are attributed to the project in a district (Yavan) that eventually was not provided with improved
water supply by the project.

52.       The outcome indicators for Component 3 were measurable, and at MTR basic data
were available. However, since MTR the data on WUA were not regularly monitored or
updated, although they were reported as satisfactory in the results framework included in the
supervision reports. As a result, at project completion, no accurate data were available on the
status of the WUAs, and rapid data collection was necessary after project closing to update the
data on the WUAs' performance.




                                                 18

2.3.3 M&E Utilization

53.       During project implementation, the key indicators as reported by the supervision team
progressed in a satisfactory manner, but the World Bank supervision team did not ascertain
whether the quantifiable indicators reported during implementation accurately captured the
achievements of improvements made. This is especially true for indicators that measured
improvements in institutional capacity, since many of the key output and impact indicators in
the results framework used quantifiable units and could have been verified by the World Bank
during supervision. As the reported data were inaccurate and at times incorrect, they were not
adequate in informing the supervision team of the appropriate course of action. This situation
was not rectified by the PMU and hence the full picture of the achievement of project outcomes,
especially regarding Component 2 and 3, emerged not during supervision but after project
closing.   During field visits, the evaluation team noted that the PMU did not provide
representative information to the World Bank: project beneficiaries (farmers, WUAs and
VWOs) that were introduced by the PMU to the evaluation team stated that the project had a
positive and sustainable outcome. Project beneficiaries that were visited on request of the
evaluation team stated that the project did not have a positive or sustainable outcome.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards

54.       The RIRP was classified as category B. The project triggered safeguards OP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment) and OP 4.09 (Pest Management). Compliance with all safeguards
triggered was not rated for most of the duration of the project. During the first years of
operations, there were ample problems with implementation of the environmental management
plan (EMP) and the environmental conditions in the implementation of civil works, but at MTR
it was reported that most parts of the EMP had been implemented satisfactorily. As the EMPs
provide the required guidance for compliance with the environmental safeguards, the
supervision team did not further report on environmental issues in Aide Memoires (AMs) since
the MTR in May 2004.

55.       Under Component 1, each design report of a subproject included an environmental
impact assessment. No significant negative environmental impact was observed at evaluation,
since the implemented works were rehabilitative in nature and were carried out on the existing
canal systems without any disruption to arable land. Overall the environmental impact of the
component activities could be classified as positive, since rehabilitated main systems allow for
more efficient conveyance and use of water as well as improved opportunity to control the
groundwater table and drainage water. Some negative impact was observed under Component
2, as the evaluation team observed that construction debris had not been cleared from the site in
Kolkhozabad after the contractor considered the contract closed, and it was reported that in
Matcho during project implementation one spring was damaged due to backpressure during
excavation. These issues went unnoted during project implementation and no remedial action
was taken during the lifetime of the project.




                                                19

2.4.2 Fiduciary

56.       Financial management under the project was reportedly weak in the first years of
project implementation but increasingly considered satisfactory, as it was done according to
Bank guidelines and the DCA. Although overall satisfactory, some errors occurred; on two
occasions the PMU reported the contract for potable water supply in Kolkhozabad completed,
although it was observed and verified in the field that this was not the case.

57.       Procurement capacity within the PMU reportedly remained weak throughout project
implementation. As a result of the use of international procurement specialists, works, services
and goods procurement typically complied with Bank procedures and guidelines and PIU staff
was trained in the use of standard Bank documents. Post-reviews were carried out by IDA staff
and major issues were not identified.

58.       Documentation for civil works contract management was inadequate and not
according to common engineering practice and SNiP standards. This hampered the ability of
the evaluation team to assess whether civil works that had been paid by project funds had
actually been built according to specifications and handed-over to the designated beneficiaries
in satisfactory condition. The international technical assistance could have been more effective
in assisting the PMU with establishing an effective system for contract amendments and other
documentation, and with adequate procedures for filing and maintenance of contract and
procurement records.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

59.       It was recognized at appraisal that institutional reform would be necessary to sustain
O&M of infrastructure investments established under the RIRP and arrangements were agreed
with Government during negotiations to increase O&M cost recovery. However, under the
RIRP there was no formal attempt of restructuring of the Ministry of Water Resources and
Irrigation, since this was considered premature for a first operation and in the political and
economical climate in Tajikistan after the civil war. At project closing, funds for O&M were
insufficient, and it is estimated that at the current level of maintenance, rehabilitated pumping
stations will gradually fall out of order again within 2 to 3 years. Funds for operation are also
increasingly limited, as more than 60 percent of the irrigation water in the project areas is
pumped up from the source to the field, with lifts sometimes exceeding 100 m. As the
electricity that powers these pumps is priced well below the full economic cost, this represents a
substantial subsidy to agriculture. A 2003 World Bank6 study calculated that if electricity (as
well as every other aspect of production) were priced at world market prices, the cotton
cultivation of between half and two thirds of irrigated land in eight representative districts in
Tajikistan would not be economically viable.

60.       Few arrangements are in place to ensure sustainable operation of the VWOs
established under Component 2. VWOs are still functioning in two districts (Matcho and
Zafarabad) and partially functioning in Ak-Kurgan. The VWOs in Yavan and Kolkhozabad are
not operating sustainably as of project completion. With all VWOs, collection of fees are not

                                                      20

recovering the cost, leaving most of the VWO staff without salary and often the VWOs are
unable to repair broken equipments or to operate water disinfection systems.

61.       Since the staff of the TUAS and the TLWRMI was not properly trained under
Component 3 to use the research equipment provided by the project and incorporate it in their
on-going research and operations, it is not likely that the required capacity for sustaining project
outcomes is in place. Regarding the WUAs, the evaluation team noted adequate support from
raion authorities in 1 out of 7 project districts (Zafarabad), whereas in other districts the
institutional environment in the agriculture sector is not conducive to maintaining the WUAs as
an independent organization responsible for O&M of the on-farm systems. As a result, a
significant number of WUAs ceased to operate once salaries were not paid anymore by the
project. A positive contributing factor that could potentially reverse the downward trend in
WUA performance is the establishment in 2007 of a WUA unit within the MWRI, mainly as a
result of the policy dialogue with a USAID funded WUA program. This unit is gradually
gaining momentum within the MIWR and might be able in the future to incorporate the lessons
learnt under RIRP and other projects and incorporate them in future WUA development
programs.

62.       No viable M&E system is in place to monitor project outcomes after project closing,
and RVKs do not collect adequate data on the operation of the I&D systems. Performance
indicators suitable for continued monitoring by Government are similar to the indicators
adopted at project appraisal.

63.       In the current environment within the agricultural sector, the Bank cannot contribute
significantly to sustaining the benefits achieved under the project in the water sector. Since
O&M of the I&D system depends strongly on the current financial arrangements between
Government, cotton investors and farmers, World Bank projects and analytical work on the
I&D sector should be conducted within a framework of reform of the cotton sector. Whereas
the problems in the agricultural water sector are enormous and of serious detriment to the rural
economy, this sector should remain a focal point for the World Bank, but any engagement
should be built on solid analytical work identifying the main constraints to the water sector and
possible solutions for a restructuring of water management institutions and finances.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

64.       Considering the continued contribution of agriculture to the country's economy, to
employment (70% of project area population), and to reduction in rural poverty the project
development objectives were and still are highly relevant, and are in line with the priorities of
the Tajikistan 2006-2009 Country Partnership Strategy to improve business opportunities in the
agriculture sector and income opportunities for farmers.         The agro-climatic conditions in
Tajikistan and in the project area in particular mean that growth in agricultural output depends,
to a large extent, on ensuring a guaranteed irrigation water supply, and therefore focusing on
irrigation rehabilitation proved to be relevant.

65.       As for Component 2, according to the MIWR, 80% of the rural areas in Tajikistan
remains not connected to a reliable water source and draws on water mainly from irrigation
ditches, which is similar to the situation at the start of the project. Therefore, in the few
localities where project supported infrastructure was functioning, beneficiaries highly



                                                21

appreciated the project. In localities where the project was not successful, intended project
beneficiaries drink unsafe canal water, or spend significant time and effort hauling water from
reliable water points. Targeted beneficiaries in Kolkhozabad, which eventually at project
closing had not received any potable water from the project, reported to the evaluation team
paying TJS 55 per 3 CM of potable water, delivered by water truck, which is equivalent to TJS
17 (US$ 5) per CM of potable water. This is very high given the low household incomes, and
almost twice as much as what Washington DC residents pay for their water.

66.       Due to the lack of funds for O&M and the dire state of on-farm irrigation systems,
project support to WUAs was and is still highly relevant. Since RVKs do not have the budget
or the staff capacity to do the O&M of on-farm I&D systems, the creation of farmer-based
WUAs is the most viable alternative, and has shown to be a successful alternative in other
countries. In addition, as more and more independent farms with small areas are created, O&M
will become more complex, and will increasingly render the RVKs and the old water brigades
ineffective for the on-farm water management. Therefore, there is an important role to play for
WUAs, provided they are enabled to function effectively.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Component 1: Rehabilitation of main I&D works
Satisfactory

67.       The project development objective for this component to increase water supply was
not achieved, since the limited data available show that irrigation water supply remained stable
or even decreased. However, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which the activities
of the component were implemented, the component managed to rehabilitate essential I&D
infrastructure, and as a result maintained the level of water supply in project districts. Given the
design of the project, the poor state of I&D infrastructure, the continuing lack of resources for
O&M as a result of the absence of a significant water sector reform in Tajikistan, this is
probably the most that could have been accomplished by the project.                  Therefore the
achievement of this component is rated satisfactory.

68.       Although not systematically documented by the M&E system, observations by the
evaluation team showed that most of the rehabilitated systems, with some exceptions, were
functioning and in reasonable technical condition (see Annex 2 for more details).               The
component achieved most of the contract targets, and as a result of 36 subprojects executed
under the project with moderate to satisfactory quality compared to similar works in Tajikistan,
about 127,500 ha (compared to 140,000 ha targeted) currently have a more reliable irrigation
water supply. The difference between the target area and the achieved area is mainly related to
the rising costs of goods (mainly pump equipment) during the implementation of the project.
However, the most important achievement is that the most critical and defunct sections of
irrigation systems were rehabilitated and replaced and it is expected by oblast and raion water
organizations that the project investments will keep the systems operational for at least the next
8 to 10 years provided there is adequate funding for O&M. At the current level of O&M
funding however, it is expected that systems operation and irrigation water conveyance will
decrease within 2-3 years, from 2010-2012 onwards, as pumping stations are deteriorating and
funds for O&M will remain insufficient.

69.       In the absence of a functioning system for water measurements in canals, in spite of
hydroposts rehabilitated under the project, it is not possible to obtain reliable and realistic data


                                                 22

for gravity schemes on increased canal water conveyance (i.e. the yearly volume of water
conveyed through the canal system). The PMU reported an increase in efficiency of main
conveyance systems from 0.5 to 11.5 % and an increase of conveyance (total flow) from 65% to
83%, but these estimates are not substantiated with reliable data. More reliable data are
available from pumping stations rehabilitated under the project, serving around 64% of the
project area. Based on these data, provided by the PMU, overall water conveyance did not
increase in these areas, but actually decreased with 1% and 16% in 2005 and 2006 respectively7.
For the rehabilitated pumps, the average energy consumption per million CM of pumped water
reduced from 266 kWh/MCM to 261 kWh/MCM, a decrease of 2%. This is most likely mainly
due to the replacement under the RIRP of old pumps and electric motors. For 9 out of 21
pumps supported with relatively small investments, energy consumption per MCM increased,
indicating that minor rehabilitation works were only partially successful in reversing the decline
in the functioning of the pumping stations. Pumped water conveyance per hectare decreased by
7% on average, mainly as a result of decrease in Zafarabad (17%) and Macho (12%). In
Kolkhozabad it decreased by 1%, in Yavan by 2% and in Sharinav it increased by 40%.
Reductions in water delivery per hectare could be related to (i) lower crop water demand due to
higher rainfall and lower evapotranspiration; (ii) decrease in electricity supply and hence pump
operating hours; and (iii) in case of Zafarabad more efficient on-farm system water management
by WUAs and increased field application efficiencies.

7Water conveyance is partially a function also of irrigation water demand, which is related to rainfall. No
correlation between rainfall and water conveyance could be observed, as from 2001 to 2005 water conveyance
decreased and rainfall increased, but from 2005 to 2006 both water conveyance and rainfall decreased. One would
expect that water conveyance would decrease if rainfall increases.


                                                                     23

Fluctuations in these areas result mainly from pumps falling into disrepair or being relocated
from one raion to different raion. Overall level of investments per hectare was low compared to
similar projects in other World Bank regions but more or less equal to the level of investments
made under similar projects in the region, like the Rural Enterprise Support Project in
neighboring Uzbekistan. This project, with similar per hectare investments was able to bring
about a significant increase in yield levels of cotton and wheat.

71.       Under RIRP, investments were most significant in Yavan, Kolkhozabad, Zafarabad
and Matcho, where the project investments covered 80% or more of the total district irrigated
areas. The incremental impact of these investments on total cultivated areas and cropping areas
is analyzed by comparing these 4 main project districts with adjacent non-project districts with
similar agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Crop areas for the different districts,
based on data from the State Statistical Agency (SSA) are indicated in the figures below.

72.       It should be noted that crop areas are determined by a multitude of factors, of which
irrigation water availability is an important factor, and that there is likely to be a time gap
between increased irrigation water availability and changes in the cropping pattern. Therefore,
no strong conclusions should be based on these data. From Figure 1 and Figure 2 figures it is
observed that from 2000 ­ 2003, crop area (106,600 ha) is higher than the area with adequate
water supply ( 41,800 ha). In 2004, 2005 and 2006, when the area with improved irrigation
service reliability was increasing by 11%, 18% and 88% respectively, total cropping area
actually decreased from 108,151 ha in 2003, to 108,103 ha in 2004 to 107,635 ha in 2005 to
99,447 ha in 2006. Cotton area decreased slightly in project districts from 53,302 ha in 2003 to
51,399 ha in 2006, as did the area under wheat and other crops. In non-project areas, also a
slight decrease in crop area is noted from 88,294 ha in 2003 to 83,959 ha in 2006, but less
pronounced as in project districts and mainly as a result of a reduction in the area under cotton.
From these data it appears that: (i) a stark reduction in irrigated area as anticipated as the
without-project scenario at project design did not occur; and (ii) the increase in the area with
adequate water supply is not reflected in an increase in the cultivated area or in crop
diversification. It was reported by farmers to the evaluation team that the dominant factor in
determining crop areas are the strict production targets set by the district authorities and the low



                                                    24

margins for farmers on cotton. Farmers reported that many of them plan their area under cotton
cultivation to closely match the production targets of the district authorities and their own
household demand for fuel wood for the winter, and do not expand the crop areas beyond this,
as it is not profitable.

Component 2: Provision of community-based village water supply in selected villages
Unsatisfactory

73.       The project was not successful in meeting the development objective to improve the
quality of drinking water to 60,000 people in 23 villages.     In total, it is estimated that only
17,237 (28%) out of 60,000 targeted beneficiaries benefited from the project, as a result of
major shortcomings described in more detail in Annex 2. First of all, the disinfection facilities
that guarantee a water quality according to standards are not functioning in all five schemes
supported under the project. Secondly, in three out of the five schemes (Yavan, Kolkhozabad
and Matcho) deficiencies in design but mainly in contract implementation resulted in either no
provision of potable water (Yavan and Kolkhozabad districts) or in a very limited coverage of
the population (Matcho). As a result, in Yavan raion, zero out of the targeted 28,000 people, in
Kolkhozabad also zero out of a targeted 4,564 people, and in Matcho an estimated 2,737 out of
6,158 people targeted, received potable water through RIRP supported infrastructure.

74.       In Yavan raion, pump engines and pipe sections provided by the RIRP to the VWO
were reportedly removed by raion authorities for use in a potable water or irrigation scheme at a
different location.     In Matcho, the low coverage was partially a result of poor contract
management and partially a result of low community contributions. In Rudaki raion, the picture
is less clear, but as a result of mainly design problems and missing submersible pumps, it is
estimated that around 6,500 people of a targeted 13,000 people actually receive water as a result
of the RIRP. Finally, at the time of project completion, VWOs were not functioning in Yavan
and Kolkhozabad, functioning in part of the coverage area in Matcho, although indebted to the
contractor, and partially in Rudaki raion. Only in Zafarabad raion the project was implemented
satisfactory and the functions of the VWO were taken up adequately by staff from the village
authorities. The main problem of the system in Zafarabad is the absence of a water tower, since
water is supplied only part of the year in summer, when electricity is available, and for a limited
number of hours during the winter months, if electricity is available. In Zafarabad, the VWO
has an average collection rate of 51%, with higher collection percentages in neighborhoods
were 15% of revenues are provided to the collector as a salary.

Component Three: Institutional capacity building for improved land and water resources
management
Moderately Unsatisfactory

75.       The outcome of the project support to the capacity of TUAS and the TLWRMI was
moderately satisfactory.    The main output of the project was achieved satisfactory, since
facilities were rehabilitated and laboratory equipments and computers were provided and
installed. The outcome is less satisfactory: at the TLWRMI, the equipments have not yet been
put to use, and have not been incorporated in the research facilities and in applied research,
mainly as a result of inadequate training and poor understanding among staff of the equipments
and their potential use; at the TUAS, reportedly two new research streams were established in
the field of management of I&D systems and in the field of WUA operations. As with the
TLWRMI, integration of new methods in the on-going research and curriculum activities



                                               25

appears absent, as research and teaching staff trained under RIRP and interviewed by the
evaluation team did not have the skills to provide a demonstration of the increased capacity or
training skills resulting from the project. The project eventually did not conduct the study on
irrigation restructuring, but it was noted by the evaluation team from discussions with the
TLWRMI and the MIWR that there was an increased awareness among management of the
need for gradual irrigation sector reform and institutional restructuring.

76.       Although not concretely covered by outcome indicators in the result framework, the
outcome of the project support to oblast and raion water organizations is moderately satisfactory.
Outputs were achieved satisfactory, but the evaluation team noted that the trainings provided
under the project for increased institutional capability did not result in improved record keeping
of water conveyance, ISFs and cost-recovery of O&M which could substantiate the project
outcomes and could demonstrate any improvements in water management.

77.       The objective to increase the capacity of WUAs to take responsibility for O&M was
not met and the outcome was unsatisfactory. The majority of WUAs (26 out of 41) under RIRP
and 1 out of 9 WUAs established under FPSP had stopped functioning or were foreseeing
ceasing activities in 2008. Only 8 out of 41 RIRP WUAs and 4 out of 9 FPSP WUAs were
functioning moderately satisfactory or better, as they were able to do some planning of O&M,
and conduct minor O&M works. The main reason for the low performance of WUAs is the
lack of support from raion authorities, low income levels of farmers, lack of a substantial
discussion between the PMU and the raion authorities, insufficient guidance and follow-up from
the PMU and the absence of adequate technical assistance. One significant outcome is the
passing of the Law on Water Users Associations, although after many revisions. However, a
law legalizing the relation between RVKs and WUAs and specifying the responsibilities of
RVKs towards WUAs, is absent, thus allowing RVKs to by-pass WUAs in the planning and
operations of on-farm irrigation water supply. Only after project completion did the PMU
collect data on the status and functioning of the WUAs, a far step from the regular reporting on
WUA functioning as agreed in the Development Grant Agreement.

78.       It should be noted that whereas 33 out 41 WUAs were not functioning satisfactory, the
majority of the 8 satisfactory functioning WUAs were in Zafarabad, where the RVK was
supporting the farmers to establish WUAs, and the WUA model reportedly has been replicated
within the district. In Zafarabad raion, farmers who were members of functioning WUAs
mentioned that management by WUAs allowed more land to be irrigated at the tail-end of
systems and facilitated more transparent billing of water. One WUA established under RIRP in
Zafarabad was functioning highly satisfactory compared to most WUAs established under the
RIRP, as they were able to do some O&M works, had some maintenance equipment and
adequate number of staff on their balance sheet and were not indebted to the RVK or investors.
In most of the other districts, farmers identified lack of support from the RVK and lack of
corrective action by the PMU as the main reason for poor performance of the WUA. Farmers
indicated that they saw the clear need and benefit of WUAs, but as one farmer reported, "the
project was like a house without a foundation", as district authorities had the mandate to enforce
their water management planning on farmers, thus bypassing the WUAs. Throughout all the
raions visited, both farmers and WUAs appreciated the training provided under the project.


3.3 Efficiency

79.       At project appraisal it was envisaged that as a result of the timely and optimal delivery
of water there would be a measurable increase in overall crop production in the project area and


                                                26

a measurable increase in income levels of farm households benefiting from the project. The
economic analysis at appraisal estimated an economic rate of return of 34 % over a 15 year
period, as it was assumed that as a result of relieving crop moisture stress, wheat and cotton
yields would increase by 2010 from 1.5 tons/ha to 1.8 tons/ha and from 1.8 tons/ha to 2.3
tons/ha respectively. Crop areas for wheat and cotton were projected to increase by 2010 from
35,941 ha to 45,175 ha and from 54,094 ha to 57,730 ha respectively. For the without project
scenario the economic analysis assumed that the conveyance capacity of the system would
decrease, resulting in a decline in crop areas for wheat and cotton by 2010 from 35,941 ha to
13,143 ha and from 54,094 ha to 18,158 ha respectively. Yields for cotton and wheat were
project to decrease by 2010 from 1.5 tons/ha to 1.1 tons/ha and from 2.1 tons/ha to 1.2 tons/ha
respectively.

80.       Irrigation rehabilitation investments were mostly completed between 2003 and 2005
and data on yields and cropping area are available until 2006 only. Yet, assumptions at appraisal
were based on projections for 2010. Hence, it is not possible to evaluate the assumptions made
at appraisal. Available data for 1 ­ 3 years can only provide an indication of the trend of the
project impact. As Figure 1 and Figure 2 indicate crop areas did not drop to the extent projected
at appraisal under the without-project scenario and in general did not yet change significantly in
2005 and 2006. Increases in cropping area (as projected in the with-project scenario) are
however not expected to occur as a result of improvements in irrigation infrastructure because
of two reasons: (i) most of the infrastructure was rehabilitated by 2006 and its operation is
limited by the lack of funds and electricity; and (ii) as reported in paragraph 72 it appears that
other factors like the cotton production targets, are more dominant in determining crop areas.

81.       As yields are depending on many factors, the impact of the project on crop yields is
estimated by comparing yield data for the 4 main project districts with yield data for the
adjacent project districts, thus minimizing the impact of different agro-climatic conditions on
yield differences. The yearly weighted averages of cotton and wheat yields, for the 4 main
project districts and adjacent non-project districts (SSA data) are shown in the figures below:


                      Cotton yields (ton/ha)                                             Wheat yields (ton/ha)

82.       As a result of the project, there was an increase in the area with reliable water supply
of 11%, 18% and 88% in 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. From Figure 3 and Figure 4 it is
observed that cotton yields in the same period were 2%, 7% and 22% higher in 2004, 2005 and
2006 respectively, which cannot necessarily be attributed to the irrigation investments made

under the project, as it is noted that in 2002, when project investments had not yet had an effect,
the cotton yield was 23% higher in the project districts. Wheat yields are slightly higher in
project districts by 1%, 11% and 5% in from 2004 to 2006. Also here the slightly higher yields
in project districts cannot yet be attributed to the project investments, as the yields of 2004-2006
followed a yield increase in project districts from 2001 to 2004 which is steeper than the yield
increase in non-project districts, and actually dropped in the years 2005 and 2006, when the area
with reliable water supply increased.

83.       It is difficult to discern the impact of the RIRP project on the yields independently
from that of the FPSP which provided support to 18,000 ha of privatized farm land, or 42% of
the incremental area receiving improved water management. A 2007 farm survey conducted as
part of an independent research , elicited yield data for 2006 from two types of farms which
                                    8

benefited from the RIRP: (a) those that were also "pilot farms" under the FPSP and as such
received a one-time grant towards inputs acquisition as well as training in farm management
and (b) "non-pilot farms" which only benefited from irrigation rehabilitation under RIRP and no
FPSP support. The data indicate that yields in FPSP pilot farms were higher than yields in non-
pilot farms, respectively 8%, 6% and 11% for cotton, wheat and vegetables. However, in the
absence of baseline data, it is not possible to discern the magnitude of improvements, if any, or
to isolate the impact of irrigation rehabilitation.

84.       Details of the ex-post economic analysis which focused mainly on irrigation
rehabilitation are provided in Annex 3. Data constraints limited the quantitative aspects of the
analysis significantly. Most notably, as the impact of the project on agricultural production
could not be distinguished on the basis of the available data, no reliable projections for future
project benefits could be made, and hence the economic rate of return could not be estimated.
The key findings are the following:

    · While energy use indicators improved at about 60% of the pumping stations
        rehabilitated by the project, and in 2% on average, and while water consumption per
        hectare of land decreased at 70% of the stations, the rates of decrease are highly
        variable. Furthermore, water consumption decreased by 7% on average but increased
        between 55-80% in some areas and absolute levels remain extremely high in some areas.

    · No obvious improvement in cropping intensity and yields or shift to higher value crops
        in response to improved availability of irrigation water could be discerned in the four
        raions analyzed (Yavan, Matcho, Zafarabad and Kolkhozabad). This may be explained
        by a number of factors including farmers abandonment of allocated lands in reaction to
        the Government policy that 70% of land be allocated to cotton (the financial margins of
        which are dismal), labor shortage as a result of out-migration of young men to Russia,
        and the falling into disrepair of pumping stations that are not covered by the project.
        Exceptions are some increase in area allocated to vegetables and potatoes in Yavan, to
        cotton in Kolkhozabad, and an increasing trend in cotton yields in Matcho. As expected,
        average yields in farms that received support under the Farm Privatization Support
        Project were for the most part higher than average yields in farms that only benefited
        only from RIRP.

    · A total of 620 ha of land that was previously not cultivated was brought under
       cultivation following the completion of irrigation rehabilitation works in Yavan (200ha)
       and in Gissar (420 ha). In both raions, the additional lands are cultivated with
       vegetables. The net incremental economic value generated to the Tajik economy is
       estimated at US$ 257/ha in Yavan and US$ 667/ha in Gissar. Given the per hectare
       investment cost of US$ 241 in Yavan and US$1,142 in Gissar, and assuming that: (i) the
       rehabilitated infrastructure will be operated and maintained properly; and (ii) the per
       hectare returns remain on average at the above estimated levels, the net present values of
       vegetable production on these additional lands are estimated at US$ 1,082 per hectare in
       Yavan and US$ 2,348 per hectare in Gissar.
    · The averted cost associated with morbidity and mortality from diarrhea in rural areas
       where potable water investments were carried out was estimated at nearly US$20,000
       annually. The efficiency of the entire subcomponent of US$ 1.3 million could not be
       calculated however, due to lack of averted cost estimations for other water-borne
       diseases.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.       Although rated satisfactory throughout the duration of the project, the evaluation team,
based on data that became available after project closing, rated the overall outcome of the
project as moderately unsatisfactory. The project fully disbursed the allocated funds, and the
main result of this is that the working life of critical irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
mainly pumping stations, is prolonged and that the I&D systems maintain the capacity to
provide the same amount irrigation water as before the project started.                 However, this
achievement falls short of the original project development objective to increase irrigation water
supply and efficiency. Within the context of Tajikistan and the resources allocated under the
project, this is considered a satisfactory achievement for this Component 1, but, the
unsatisfactory outcome of Component 2 and the moderately unsatisfactory rating of Component
3 resulted in the project being rated moderately unsatisfactory overall.                An additional
consideration for this rating is that the efficiency of the I&D investments seems limited: (i) a
stark reduction in irrigated areas, as projected under the without-project scenario, did not occur
both in project as well as in non-project districts; but (ii) it is not clear to what extent changes in
yields and crop areas in project districts can be attributed to the RIRP. In addition, the
efficiency of the investments in I&D rehabilitation is constrained by the poor performance of
WUAs, since their performance is critical for an improved on-farm water management and an
increase of cost-recovery of O&M to sustain the investments made under the project.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

86.       Tajikistan remains the poorest country in ECA, with 57% of the total population and
64% of the rural population living below the poverty line of $2.15/day. This is especially true
in the rural areas of Sugd oblast (Matcho and Zafarabad districts) and Khatlon oblast




                                                 29

(Kolkhozabad raion), where rural poverty remains persistent at 68% and 78% respectively9.
The project contributed to not further increasing poverty in these districts, since yield levels in
the districts stabilized compared to neighboring districts. However, the benefits from the I&D
rehabilitation for increased farm incomes can not materialize to the fullest since farmers are not
able to increase their profit margins in the production of cotton, due to the current policies and
arrangements in the cotton sector. Therefore, the poverty impacts of the project seem limited.
The poverty impact of the rural potable water supply component is very limited due to the low
coverage, and in three locations reportedly negative; (i) in Yavan and Kolkhozabad, the
community contributed to the system, but no functioning potable water supply system was
handed-over to the VWO; (ii) in Matcho, an existing spring was demolished because of poor
design and contract implementation. Overall, the benefits of this component are poor, and in
the majority of the targeted project villages, women and children continue to haul water from
distant and often polluted water points.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

87.         Capacity building of institutions was one of the supporting components of RIRP.
Since WUAs and VWOs were largely unsuccessful and unsustainable, beneficiaries reported a
decreased trust from farmers and villagers in the functioning and independence of these
organizations. Project support to oblast and raion water organizations did not significantly alter
current operational practices, and did not reduce institutional impediments to decentralization of
water management. However, as a result of RIRP and efforts from USAID, there are signs of
increasing awareness within the national government of the need for a gradual transition
towards institutional restructuring and integrated water resources management, which
eventually could create an institutional environment that is more supportive for the functioning
of WUAs as an autonomous organization.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

88.         Before the RIRP started, few contractors were capable of undertaking bidding and
contract implementation according to improved procurement procedures and quality of works.
With several large civil works contracts implemented, experience among contractors has
increased, thus facilitating the implementation of similar projects10.


3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Surveys

89.         The beneficiary survey at MTR, based on results from the 2003 cropping season,
states that the irrigation component in FPSP and RIRP has, to a large extent, met the water
needs of farmers and that the performance of WUAs, measured in terms of irrigation water
distribution efficiency and the ISF recovery rate (at close to 100%), was good. Furthermore the
survey reported: (i) considerable crop diversification from cotton to other crops due to timely
water supply leading to higher cash incomes; (ii) higher cropping intensities; and (iii) increased
productivity levels by 25 to 40%. According to SSA data, increased productivity levels were
indeed observed in 2003-2004, both in project and non-project districts, but higher cropping

intensities and crop diversification were not observed. Regarding potable water supply, the
2004 survey (conducted before the drinking water schemes were constructed) reported
considerable awareness and enthusiasm for the upcoming establishment of VWOs.

90.       No end-of-project survey was conducted, but interviews of the evaluation team with
beneficiaries indicated that significant changes occurred since 2004. Farmers in 7 out 8 districts
are not content with the functioning of the WUAs, and largely ceased to pay ISFs via or to the
WUAs. Beneficiaries in 3 out 5 target areas are not aware of the existence of a functioning
VWO. Evaluation of yield figures, cropping intensity, and crop areas at project closing,
indicated that positive results reported at MTR where not sustained towards the completion of
the project.

91.       Regarding Component 1, oblast and raion water organizations spoke highly of the civil
works conducted under the project, as it rehabilitated critical infrastructure on their balance
sheet.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Substantial

92.       The risk to the development outcome of the project is rated substantial.             For
Component 1, the technical risk associated with poor construction mainly in the first years of
the project and a number of partially rehabilitated structures with declining performance, is
moderate. Substantial risk based on financial and economic considerations is associated with
the lack of O&M of rehabilitated systems, in particular the pumping stations. In light of a crisis
in the energy sector and insufficient O&M resources both from government and from farmers
indebted to cotton investors, the evaluation team observed structures that were already
deteriorating and would likely be in need of further rehabilitation within the next 2-3 years. The
capacity of raion water authorities to deliver irrigation water greatly depends on the expected
working life and O&M of outdated equipment that is increasingly beyond repair. Therefore, this
risk impacts the reliability of irrigation water supply and is compounded by a moderate risk of
Government relocating pumps procured under RIRP to different irrigation systems and
therefore not contributing to achievement of the project objectives in the target districts.

93.       For Component 2, achievement of the development outcome was unsatisfactory, and
therefore the risk to even further deterioration of the systems and the functioning of VWOs is
low. The current level of low achievement is likely to be sustained after project closure, but
with continuous lack of funds for O&M of the existing and functioning systems, there is a
substantial risk of further deterioration of parts of the rehabilitated system that remain
functional.

94.       For Component 3, achievement of the development outcome was moderately
unsatisfactory. Mainly as result of the persistent policies in the cotton sector and the lack of
reform of the irrigation sector, the functioning of RIRP WUAs is likely to deteriorate further in
the absence of the payment of irrigation fees and the lack of institutional support from the raion
authorities.   In the future this trend could be reversed, provided a law regulating RVK
cooperation with WUAs is passed by the Cabinet, and the WUA unit at the MIWR becomes
effective in reforming relations between RVKs and WUAs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Moderately Unsatisfactory

95.       No Quality Review was conducted at entry, as this was not mandatory at that time.
Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry for Component 1 was moderately satisfactory to
moderately unsatisfactory.      A positive factor was that the team chose a straightforward
approach for the selection and design of the rehabilitation works, in light of the dire state of the
irrigation system, the lessons learned from other projects and the low capacity of the national
design agencies and contractors. However, a moderate shortcoming was the absence of a
thorough review of the effectiveness of investments in the rehabilitation of irrigation systems
that were mainly pumped and had high O&M costs, compared with gravity schemes with lower
O&M costs and potentially higher rate of return.           Significant shortcomings included (i)
inadequate causal link between outputs and outcomes, as outcomes were not achieved in spite
of completion of outputs; (ii) the selection of structures for partial (and therefore less effective)
rehabilitation; and (iii) the absence of budget for adequate design and construction supervision
by an engineering consultancy firm.

96.       For Component 2, the Bank's performance was moderately unsatisfactory because of
significant shortcomings. Project design was inadequate in: (i) the technical designs of the
systems, which were mostly too complex and expensive; (ii) the lack of budget for adequate
technical assistance for the implementation of the CDD approach and the supervision of the
civil works; and (iii) poor design of the CDD approach, not taking into account best practice
examples from other regions and lessons-learned from similar projects in Tajikistan. Most
notably, the attempt to include a community contribution of 20% ignored the poverty in the
country and was not based on a comprehensive analysis of willingness and capacity to pay.

97.       The Bank's performance for the design of Component 3 was moderately
unsatisfactory. Risks were identified satisfactorily, but significant shortcomings included the
lack of incorporation of best-practice examples for water sector reform and WUA establishment,
which indicated that (i) commitment to sector reform from Government should be reflected in
the allocation of adequate resources to technical assistance for sector reform and a clear
implementation plan; (ii) an adequate level of technical assistance is required to advise WUAs
and Government during implementation and for follow-up after the trainings with both WUAs
and raion water authorities to advance sustainable WUA operation; (iii) WUA staff salaries
should be not paid by a project; and (iv) sufficient dedicated project WUA support staff should
be responsible for component implementation. Moderate shortcomings vis-à-vis the design of
project support to the TUAS, the TLWRMI and the oblast and raion water authorities included a
lack of well-defined mechanisms for incorporation of training skills in the day-to-day
operations and activities of these organizations.

98.       At project design it was envisaged that structural changes to the institutional
arrangements in the water management sector would generate alternative resources for water
management through an increase in irrigation service fees. However, as a result of the design
shortcomings, the PDOs were overly ambitious and realistically could not have been achieved
given the limited timeframe of the project, and the resources allocated both by the World Bank
and the Government.



                                                32

(b) Quality of Supervision
Moderately Unsatisfactory

99.       Since the team was not effective in proactively identifying threats to the achievement
of the development objectives, and did not specify adequate resolutions, the quality of
supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory. This is in line with the QSA which rated the
quality of supervision moderately satisfactory based on the assumption that PDOs were being
achieved. The supervision task was constrained by a lack of accurate information, but as the
team was aware off of the sensitivity of the project outcomes to achievements under the WUA
component and the implementation of the CDD approach, it should have followed up more
vigorously on the achievements of the project. Supervision inputs in terms of staff weeks were
adequate, but reportedly as a result of limited supervision budgets, the supervision teams had to
be engaged in multiple tasks, including the supervision of the FPSP and the preparation and
supervision of the Community Agricultural Water Management Project. Candor and quality of
AMs was adequate although repetitive at first, until the MTR in 2004. From end 2004 to end
2007 reporting was inadequate, with insufficient new information on the outcome of the project,
demonstrating that the supervision team did not have adequate information to assess the status
of the project. Information was presented mainly in the results framework, which was not
regularly updated based on verified information. Throughout the project, little information was
available regarding the institutional capacity building component, the progress on ISF and
O&M cost-recovery and the study on irrigation sector restructuring proposed at design, even
though specific reporting requirements on these aspects were included in the DCA. Supervision
of safeguards and fiduciary aspects was satisfactory, although more thorough supervision of
civil works contract management procedures and documentation could have contributed to more
adequate implementation of civil works contracts.

100.      With respect to Component 1, considerable efforts by the IDA supervision teams were
made during project implementation to ensure acceptable quality of both design and civil works
implemented. This positively affected the project implementation schedule and the quality of
the works implemented from 2004 onwards. The supervision team performed less well with
respect to the monitoring of achievement of Component 1 outcomes, as throughout the
reporting, different indicators from the original indicators were used, and estimates provided by
the PMU were not validated by the team.

101.      Bank supervision was moderately unsatisfactory with respect to Component 2. After
the MTR in 2004, insufficient field visits were conducted to monitor and validate the progress
reported incorrectly by the PMU and to proactively assess the risk to achievement of
development outcomes. The component was rated satisfactory throughout the project, while the
extent of problems with the potable water schemes went unnoticed by the supervision team, in
spite of timely reports from the international CDD consultant that the component was at risk.
The supervision team did note that the capacity of VWOs was low, and from 2005 onwards, the
supervision team requested the borrower to avail additional resources to train VWOs. However,
given the poor implementation of civil works, the provision of training would not have been
adequate to ensure that this component would have achieved its objective.

102.      Bank supervision was moderately satisfactory for Component 3.                 Moderate
shortcomings including a lack of reporting on progress and achievement of outcomes for the
project support to oblast and raion water authorities, the TUAS and the TLWRMI and therefore
the lack of integration of training in organizational practices went unnoted. Reporting on the
support to WUAs was more consistent and informative, but not based on information verified


                                                33

through field visits. As a result, the supervision team reported that the WUAs were established
and functioning satisfactory throughout the project. From 2004 onwards, monitoring indicators
were not adequately updated nor verified in spite of regular requests to the PMU by the
supervision team. From 2005 onwards, the supervision team requested the borrower to avail
additional resources to capacity building of WUAs, but when this did not materialize the project
and implementation performance ratings were not modified accordingly. The supervision team
did not ensure that mitigation measures identified in the risk framework were implemented, and
as a result no constructive dialogue with raion organizations was conducted once they became
an impediment to proper functioning of WUAs in most of the districts.

103.       Most notably, the supervision team did not indicate to Government that the
achievement of PDOs was at risk. Adequate steps should have included vigorous verification of
outcomes in the field, downgrading of the project and the formulation of a clear plan to either
restructure the project or to improve implementation in order to achieve the PDOs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Moderately Unsatisfactory

104.       Overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Moderately Unsatisfactory

105.       Government performance was moderately unsatisfactory, as there were significant
shortcomings. Most notably, Government did not fulfill key agreements reached during project
negotiations. Government performance was not adequate in: (i) maintaining the necessary
policies and procedures to monitor the achievement of the PDO according to the outcome
indicators; (ii) maintain arrangements for the maintenance by WUAs of operational and
financial records and submit a status report on the collection rate of the ISF, and (iii) review and
adjust annually the ISF, based on a system of progressive cost recovery of O&M, satisfactory to
IDA. The failure to meet these agreements, highlights that Government did not follow up on
the intentions specified in the Letter of Development Policy to: (i) reform the irrigation sector to
increase water use efficiency, by setting increased water usage fees and by establishing
institutional mechanisms for transfer of responsibility for O&M to water users and WUAs; and
(ii) develop a competitive market oriented agricultural sector.

106.       Because of the shortcomings in Government performance, the project did not
successfully achieve key outcomes and intermediate outcomes. Average water conveyance was
not increased, most likely as a result of poor O&M and lack of funds for O&M, and water use
efficiency and crop diversification outcomes were not realized most likely because of: (i) the
lack of reform in the water sector; and (ii) strong Government control of the agricultural sector
and the continuing practice to coerce farmers to meet cotton production targets, thus
establishing unfavorable conditions to an increase in the income level of the rural population.
Government control over the cotton sector also contributed significantly to the unsatisfactory
outcome of the WUA subcomponent, as district authorities by-passed the WUAs in 7 out of 8
districts in order to allocate water according to the cotton production targets. This eventually
resulted in a limited flow of funds from water users to WUAs and water operators to effectively
operate and maintain the I&D systems. There are no adequate arrangements by Government for


                                                 34

regular operation of the project supported infrastructure, and as a result some rehabilitated
pumping stations are likely to cease functioning within 2 to 3 years.          Other significant
shortcomings included a lack of oversight of Government on the performance of the PMU and
the proper functioning of the M&E system, and lack of oversight on the adequacy of the
consultations with beneficiaries and other project stakeholders, especially in case of the village
drinking water component and the WUA subcomponent.

107.     Satisfactory performance included Government commitment to implementing the
project outputs under Component 1, the readiness for implementation and acceptable fiduciary
management including regular audits over the life of the project. Under Component 1, issues
pertaining to slow implementation of works were resolved eventually, including a delay in
counterpart funding in 2003 which temporarily affected the rating of project implementation
performance. One moderate success achieved was the passing of the Law on WUAs in the
Cabinet.

108.     As the supervision team did not inform the Government and the PMU consistently that
achievement of the PDOs was at risk, they were not aware that urgent action was required to
either restructure the project or to revise project implementation, and remained under the
impression that the project was progressing satisfactory. However, as it is the responsibility of
the Borrower to ensure that the supervision team has access to accurate information,
Government is partially responsible for this shortcoming

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Moderately Unsatisfactory

109.     The performance of the PMU had significant to major shortcomings. Most notably,
project management was unsatisfactory. Fiduciary management and procurement was weak,
but the key ingredient for satisfactory project management, namely a functioning M&E and
reporting system to provide correct and representative data, was absent.         During project
implementation the PMU provided the World Bank supervision team with inaccurate and at
times incorrect information regarding the achievement of project outputs and outcomes, and
hence restricted the team in their possibility to identify threats to the achievement of the
development outcome. As this was the main contributing factor to downgrading the project
after project closing from a satisfactory to a moderately unsatisfactory rating, the overall
implementing agency performance was moderately unsatisfactory.

110.     The implementing agency performed unsatisfactory in the implementation of
Component 2. Major shortcomings included: (i) a lower commitment to the achieving results
under this component was noted, resulting possibly from a lack of accountability of the PIU to
community-based organizations; (ii) incomplete delivery of project outputs, like partial
construction of village water schemes; (iii) poor implementation of the CDD approach; (iv)
unsuccessful resolution of implementation issues; (v) over-stating the achievements of this
component; and (vi) the absence of transition arrangements for sustainable O&M. These
shortcomings contributed significantly to the unsatisfactory outcome of this component.

111.     The    implementing     agencies    performed    moderately   unsatisfactory    in    the
implementation of Component 3.       Outputs were delivered, as the oblast and raion water
organizations, the TUAS and the TLWRMI were supported with equipment and training and
WUAs were established and trained according to the project implementation plan, but the target
outcomes were not achieved, partially due to inadequate follow-up by the PMU. Significant



                                               35

shortcomings included: (i) the absence of a constructive dialogue with RVKs to facilitate a
more enabling environment for WUAs to operate; (ii) lack of follow-up assistance to WUAs
after the trainings; and (iii) lack of follow-up with the TUAS and the TLWRMI to facilitate that
new skills and new equipments were used in education and research.

112.       The PMU and the PIU performed satisfactory in the management of component 1, as
they were committed to realizing the component outputs, rehabilitation of I&D works, and
eventually adequately resolved implementation issues under this component. Poor design and
sub-standard quality of works characterized the project in the first years, but mainly as a result
of contracting the IQCIE, a more diligent design and supervision of works resulted in increased
quality of construction works. More effort should have been allocated to: (i) monitoring and
realizing the outcomes of component 1; and (ii) maintaining accurate contract files and
engineering documentation, as many standard engineering documents are unaccounted for.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Moderately unsatisfactory

113.       There were significant to major shortcomings in both the performance of the
Government as well as the implementing agency.             Since these shortcomings resulted in
downgrading of the project outcome from satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory after project
closing, overall borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

114.       The implementation of the RIRP M&E system provided incorrect data. As a result of
verification of these data after project closing, the project was downgraded from satisfactory to
moderately unsatisfactory. Inadequate M&E critically affects the ability of the World Bank to
identify threats to project outcomes and propose adequate corrective action, and hence M&E
results should be verified and properly documented through prompt supervision follow-up.

115.       Given the persisting arrangements in the cotton sector in Tajikistan, where cotton
investors with the compliance of Government increasingly indebt farmers in order to meet
cotton production targets, World Bank support to community organizations in cotton areas, like
WUAs, should be based on assurances by Government that these community organizations will
not be coerced to operate according to targets and procedures set by district governments and
which are designed to meet cotton production targets. Project design should include clear
measures and procedures to avoid this from happening within World Bank-funded projects in
Tajikistan.

116.       The project development objective was to increase irrigation water supply, whereas
the project design was mainly geared towards maintaining water supply and preventing further
deterioration of the irrigation and drainage system. As a result, the targeted outcome was not
realistic given the outputs of the project. For project outcomes to be achieved satisfactory,
project design should clearly link project outputs to project outcomes. If during supervision it is
evident that PDOs will not be achieved, the supervision team should inform the Borrower and
take joint action for corrective measures through either restructuring of the project or through a
revised project implementation plan.

117.       Achievement of the project development objective hinged on a gradual increase in
cost-recovery of O&M, through a decentralization of water management to Water Users
Associations. Experience from other projects shows that this is a complicated process requiring


                                                 36

adequate technical assistance. Resources for technical assistance were inadequate, contributing
to unsatisfactory achievement of project outcomes. Future projects on establishment of WUAs
in Tajikistan should therefore allocated sufficient resources for technical assistance to
Government in order to be successful.

118.      Project investments in pumped irrigation schemes did not increase overall water
supply, mainly because of a lack of funds for O&M. Poor O&M has a critical impact on project
outcomes, and any future investments for irrigation and drainage rehabilitation projects in
Tajikistan should be based on an analysis of the economic and financial viability of
rehabilitated schemes and the resources available for O&M.

119.      Financial resources for O&M of I&D systems are inadequate, mainly as a result of
insufficient Government budget allocated to water authorities and low margins by farmers on
cotton, resulting in a low capacity to pay for irrigation service fees. The low margins of farmers
are a result of flawed agricultural policies in the cotton sector. Therefore, to improve the
sustainability of investments in the water sector by means of adequate O&M, future projects
should: (i) aim to increase the financial capacity of farmers to contribute to the O&M of on-
farm systems, mainly through the adjustment of the current agricultural policies which result in
low returns for farmers on cotton cultivation; and (ii) during project appraisal and negotiations,
reach agreement that should there be a shortfall in collection of irrigation service fees due to
Government agricultural policies, the Government through increased budget allocations will
cover the shortfall in available funds for O&M of the system

120.      Primarily because of non-cooperation by district authorities and decreasing
Government commitment to the success of the WUA subcomponent, WUAs were not able to
function effectively. This risk and corresponding mitigation measures were identified at project
appraisal. Because the mitigation measures were not implemented according to project design,
the negative impact of district authorities on the functioning of WUAs went unnoted by Bank
supervision.   In addition to close supervision, diligent implementation of risk mitigation
measures, including the continued monitoring of the progress of sector reform and allocating
adequate resources for awareness building, training, policy dialogue and consultations with the
district authorities, should be done during project implementation, especially in a high-risk
environment like Tajikistan.

121.      Mainly because management style and the capacity and the commitment of the PMU
were inadequate, the community-driven development approach for the village water supply
component was implemented unsatisfactory and most water supply schemes did not reach their
objective. Accordingly it is important that future investments in Tajikistan in CDD project
components are implemented through capable and committed project partners with adequate
understanding of the CDD approach.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

122.      A draft ICR was submitted for comments to the Government on June 25, 2008. This
draft ICR of the RIRP proposed to downgrade the performance rating of project outcomes from
satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory, to rate Borrower performance unsatisfactory and to
rate Bank performance moderately satisfactory. Government communicated to the Bank on
July 25, 2008 (see Annex 5) that they did not agree with the proposed ICR findings and
methodology, and they requested a further review of the ICR. On October 14, 2008, a meeting


                                                 37

was held between the World Bank and representatives of the Government to discuss the
comments from Government on the draft ICR and to clarify the ICR process, methodology and
results. At this meeting, representatives of the Government and the World Bank came to a
mutual understanding that: (i) the World Bank team would revise the proposed ratings for Bank
performance from moderately satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory and for Government
performance from unsatisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory; (ii) the PMU would provide
further comments of a factual nature to the draft ICR; and (iii) the draft ICR would will be
modified to incorporate the proposed ratings and to address applicable Government comments
in a draft final ICR, to be sent to Government for a final review.

123.      No further comments of a factual nature where received by the World Bank and the
final draft ICR was submitted to Government for comments on December 1, 2008. Government
communicated to the Bank on December 12, 2008 (see Annex 5) their strong disagreement with
the proposed ratings and requested the World Bank to revise the ICR to reflect the comments
from Government of July 2008. The final draft ICR was not significantly revised.

(b) Cofinanciers

124.      There were no cofinanciers for RIRP, but the project had some benefit from
simultaneous activities funded by USAID. For example, policy discussions under the USAID
Central Asia Water Management Program leveraged the ratification by the Cabinet of the Law
on WUAs, and one WUA in Yavan district was provided with further capacity building support
under the same program.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

125.      The evaluation team discussed the RIRP outcomes on the establishment of WUAs
during a meeting held with Winrock, an US NGO with extensive experience in similar
programs in Tajikistan. This meeting highlighted mutual agreement regarding the constraints to
WUA development in Tajikistan noted in Sections 2.1. and 2.2, the critical importance of the
WUA project design considerations, including the importance of providing sufficient technical
assistance to WUAs under the project, the detrimental impact of the project salary contributions
to the sustainability of WUAs, and the shortcomings in the implementation and promulgation of
the Law on WUAs.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.        This annex contains more details on the evaluation of the three components to support
Section 3.2, Achievement of Project Development Objectives. For the evaluation, the team: (i)
reviewed the project infrastructure on-site; (ii) through review of engineering and financial
documents, including design and completion documentation, verified project inputs and outputs
for each site; (iii) reviewed data on irrigation water management from RVKs and the PMU; (iv)
observed the operational status of project infrastructure; (v) conducted site interviews with
WUAs, VWOs, TUAS, TLWRMI and project beneficiaries; (vi) reviewed data provided by the
PMU and discussed evaluation findings with the PMU and PIU; and (vii) repeatedly invited the
PMU to provide clarification on findings and analysis presented by the evaluation team.

Component One: Rehabilitation of Main I&D Works

2.        In total, 36 contracts in 7 districts were implemented, of which 25 were reviewed in
detail by the project evaluation team. The contract status is shown in Table 2.

* Contracts not reviewed by evaluation team. Data obtained from the Borrowers Completion Report


3.          All the works under the 36 contracts were completed and contractors paid. Total cost
of the original civil works and supply and installation of equipment contracts is US$ 15.99
million. The total cost of actual completion of these contracts is US$ 15.78 million. Total
savings is US$ 201,506.00 or 1.3% of the original total cost of contracts. For the 25 contracts
reviewed in detail, cost of the original contracts is US$ 12.40 million compared to total cost of
actual completion of works which is US$ 12.43 million. Thus, the total cost overrun is
US$ 31,494.00 or 0.25% of the original total cost of 25 contracts. The maximum increase of the
original contract cost was 14.68 %, and the maximum saving is 1.87 %.

4.          Out of the 25 contracts visited works implemented under six of them were delayed.
Relevant variation orders were available only for three out of these six contracts. The total
command area of all contracts is about 127,095 ha as per the engineering design reports,
compared with 137,747 ha as reported in the Borrowers Completion Report, including 128,069
ha in the project districts area). The average investment cost was US$ 124 per ha, ranging from
US$ 17.85 per ha in Rudaki raion to US$ 1141.92 per ha in Gissor raion.

5.          Despite the rehabilitative and relatively simple nature of the works, review of Detailed
Engineering Designs implemented in the initial stage of project implementation revealed an
overall poor quality with respect to the book of drawings and to the annexes. As most design
capacity is with government institutes and hence could not be procured under World Bank
guidelines, the PMU faced serious difficulties in finding suitable design companies at the start
of project implementation. Eventually, three relatively inexperienced companies were selected.
With the support of the International Quality Control Irrigation Engineer (IQCIE), design works
were improved and became adequate for the purpose of rehabilitation. A notable exception is
the design of the BGK headworks, which did not include innovative design features that could
have contributed to the sustainable rehabilitation of the works. For all the designs, engineering
design firms had not been contracted.

6.          The civil works contract documentation made available by the PMU to the evaluation
team did not allow for a comprehensive review and analysis of the quality of supervision of
civil works. In particular, essential documents required under the SNiP were not available in
most of the contract files, including daily activity reports of site supervisors approved by PMU
Engineers, monthly bills of completed quantities and bills of cumulative quantities, certificates
of used materials and equipments, certificates of invisible works, certificates of welding tests,
tests of concrete and soil compaction works, and "as-built" drawings. Available certificates of
invisible works are general and do not specify the sections or dimensions of the works. The

7.        The IQCIE spent considerable time during his assignment supervising implementation
of works.     The participation of representatives of raion water authorities and institutions
responsible for pumping stations O&M was highly encouraged. This was evidenced by the high
awareness of representatives of raion institutions about the works implemented, contractors,
supervisors, PMU engineers and the activities of the IQCIE. The IQCIE was not delegated by
the PMU to sign completed Bill of Quantities, whereas this could have provided an opportunity
and incentives for the PMU maintain a better quality of subprojects contract and engineering
documentation files. Poor quality of concrete works, road profiling and equipment mounting
has been observed by the evaluation team under some of the contracts.

8.        Major works implemented under the component included: canal cleaning (54.08 km),
canal concrete lining (8.43 km), cleaning of collectors (72.25 km), profiling of maintenance
road ( 82.64 km), rehabilitation of 28 pumping stations, rehabilitation of 57 boreholes and 299
other structures. The PMU data for the type and total amount of works implemented under the
component are summarized in Table 3. A significant portion of available funds, about
US$ 12.04 out of US$ 16 million was allocated to investments in civil works and supply and
installation of equipment for rehabilitation of pumping stations. The overall quality of works
implemented at the sites visited appears satisfactory compared to the quality of similar works in
Tajikistan, though in some cases poor quality of canal concrete lining and poor equipment
installation, especially the mounting of electric cables, were observed. Some of the works
implemented are in poor condition, particularly:

    · In the "New Karatag" pumping station in Sharinav raion (command area 750 ha) all the
        equipment installed under the project have been moved to other districts and the
        pumping station (including the pump house) is currently in a very poor state;
    · Pumping station No. 4 (Guliston cascade) in Kolkhozabad raion (command area 840 ha)
        is flooded while all the equipment has been installed;
    · Due to the poor quality of downstream apron works in the BGK headwork concrete
        works have been washed away for the most part and need diligent re-design and
        rehabilitation
    · In all the schemes visited by the evaluation team most of the water measurement devices
        (hydro-posts) had been destroyed.

Rating of outputs

9.      The rating of works implemented in each contract site visited by the evaluation
team was done based on two criteria: (i) design solutions and quality of works
implemented based on observations and review of available technical documentations
(CI-Contract Implementation); and (ii) current operational status of rehabilitated schemes
(OE-Outcome Effectiveness). Ratings vary from moderately unsatisfactory to highly
satisfactory.     The only contract which was rated as moderately unsatisfactory is
ICB.CW­2 (BGK headworks) both in terms of implementation and current stage. This is
the result of significant shortcomings in the design solutions and poor quality of works
implemented. Currently the rehabilitated aprons are washed out (almost completely) and
require significant re-investment.

10.     The majority of works implemented under the other contracts are rated as
satisfactory as compared to similar works in Tajikistan, as only minor shortcomings have
been observed, mainly because of the lack of experience in PMU staff at early stage of
project implementation.          Works under 5 contracts have been rated as moderately
satisfactory as obvious shortcomings in the quality of works such as poor quality of
concrete works, electric mounting, metal works and the like, have been observed.
However, good standard of works and adequate current operational condition have been
observed by the evaluation team in Yavan raion (PVMK canal and PVMK Tunnel Outlet).
Consequently the works implemented under these two contracts are rated as highly
satisfactory. Summary ratings of the works are presented in Table 4.

Component Two: Provision of Community-Based Village Water Supply in Selected
Villages

11.      The potable water component was supported by an international consultant on
three short-term assignments for a total of two months who provided an implementation
manual for the CDD approach and training to PMU staff and VWOs.                            The last
assignment was in May 2003, two years before completion of most of the potable water
supply subprojects. Main recommendations from the consultant to the Bank supervision
team included:

    · As important as knowing, understanding, and working with VWOs is, equally
       important is knowing, understanding, and pushing RIRP/PMU to implement a
       CDD approach in RIRP. The greatest challenge in implementing CDD in RIRP is
       not with the villagers and the VWOs. The greatest challenge is to work with
       RIRP/PMU and get them to accept, understand, and fully implement a CDD
       approach in the project's drinking water supply component.
    · It may be wise to seek other, outside sources to implement capacity-building of
       VWOs, rather than to rely exclusively on RIRP/PMU staff.
    · RIRP/PMU needs to commit the resources required to implement a CDD
       approach in RIRP, whether they come from PMU or elsewhere. At an absolute
       minimum, there should be at least one PMU staff person who knows, understands,
       accepts, and is willing to implement the CDD approach in RIRP. There should be
       one person in one office with full responsibility and authority for implementing
       the CDD program in RIRP/PMU.
    · RIRP/PMU should place much more emphasis on the long term financial, O&M,
       and management implications of rehabilitation designs. RIRP/PMU engineers
       need to consciously ask themselves whether local villagers are technically,
       financially, and organizationally capable of long-term management of the design.
    · In the bidding documents supplied to potential contractors, there should be clear
       information regarding the 20 percent contribution from the villagers, to avoid any
       future misunderstanding during rehabilitation.
    · Though there will be considerable sums of money deposited into VWO bank
       accounts during rehabilitation, it may not be necessary for the VWO to employ a




                                                  46

         full-time accountant during this time.                 A part-time, professionally trained
         accountant may be sufficient.
    · If the VWO cannot afford to hire a Quality Control Engineer during rehabilitation
         (and it is likely they cannot), RIRP/PMU should consider allowing the VWO to
         hire the engineer, but a large proportion of the engineer's salary could be
         transferred from RIRP/PMU to the VWO, and then the VWO could pay the
         engineer's salary.
    · A more concentrated, systematic effort is needed to include women in VWO
         decision-making.

12.         The PMU recruited one engineer to coordinate this component, but other
recommendations were not implemented. Most notably, the PMU continued to be the
main implementer of the CDD component, to the extent that funds were not transferred to
the VWO accounts but paid directly by the PMU to contractors, the quality control
engineer was not paid by the VWO but by the PMU, and eventually no effective effort
was undertaken to establish sustainable VWOs.

13.         The infrastructure output of component 2 consisted of civil works contracts.
The output of civil works as reported by the PMU are listed in the Table 5 and Table 6:

14.          Incorrect information was provided by the PMU regarding the outcome of each
of village drinking water schemes, overstating the number of beneficiaries.               The
evaluation team visited each of the potable water supply schemes and found the
following:

        Matcho. For five out of 9 villages targeted under RIRP, the system had not been
        functioning because of a number of the following reasons (as reported by
        representatives of the VWO and inhabitants and observed by the evaluation team).
        In one village, during rehabilitation of the spring, backpressure during mechanical
        excavation practically halted the flow of the spring, rendering it not suitable as a
        source for the village. In a second village, the pressure provided by the pump was
        too low to reach the village, which is located at a slightly higher elevation. In a
        third village, the polyethylene (PE) pipe was reportedly of inferior quality and
        leaked, and resulting low pressure was insufficient to supply the village with water.
        In the fourth and fifth village, the community's contribution was not sufficient,
        leaving the system only partially completed. The VWO had been left with a debt to
        the contractor of TJS 30,000 (approximately US$ 8,000), and is trying to repay this.
        However, because of this debt the Defect Liability Period had been waived.

        Zafarabad. The system is operating properly and was operating properly at
        contract completion. The project constructed infrastructure was in good condition
        and well maintained. Members of the VWO reported that the VWO has been
        incorporated into the village (jamoat) administration, and employs 14 staff members,
        including the head of jamaot, with a fee collection rate around 55% (TJS 18,160
        collected in 2007 out of TJS 32,600 planned). There is limited electricity supply
        from October to April, so there is no reliable potable water supply during these
        months.       During this period the village inhabitants use the old water system,
        consisting of one existing tap stand supplied by the spring.




                                                 48

Kolkhozabad. According to the progress reports of the PMU, the contract had been
completed and handed-over, but the system was not functioning at project closing.
The evaluation team observed after project closing that works were not completed.
Specifically, the electric hoist mounted inside the pumping station, the connection
to the main supply of electricity, the connection to the chlorination system and one
pump were missing at the water intake station. Also, the team observed that quality
of works was not according to contract specifications. In particular, concrete blocks
for manholes were used instead of reinforced concrete, a secondhand transformer
was installed, the installed pumps of 7.5 kW were not according to contract
specifications of 10 kW, and PE to steel pipe connections were done by heating PE
and dressing it over steel. Quantities of works were not according to the Bill of
Quantities in the contract. Specifically, the number of buildings, the number of
electricity poles and the connection of the toilet blocks to a sewerage or septic
system were lower than the quantities specified in the contract. The contractor
informed the evaluation team that he had handed over the project, but he was not
able to provide information as to why the project had not been completed. No
contract documentation was made available by the PMU to the evaluation team to
clarify the observed differences.

Statements by the VWO and the villagers indicated that the VWO had little
participation from the communities targeted under the project. Five out of six
village households interviewed by the evaluation team reported they were not aware
of the existence of a VWO, and six out six households interviewed had not been
asked for a contribution, both in cash or in kind. All households stated they would
be willing to contribute to an improved water supply. One interviewed female
household member who was interviewed stated to the evaluation team that they do
not feed their children or send them to school, in order to save money to buy water,
since the price per CM of tankered water is roughly TJS 17 (approximately US$ 5).
One villager informed the evaluation team that the chairman of the VWO is a
supplier of construction materials to the project, whereas the former chairman of the
VWO was a contractor on the project. The current VWO chairman confirmed he
had worked for the contractor before becoming the head of the VWO. He did not
provide information to the evaluation team to explain why the contractor had
handed over the system while it was not completed.

Rudaki. The system is providing only an estimated 50% of the design target area,
with pumps mostly not provided by the RIRP, since only one of out four pumps
provided by RIRP was available on-site when the evaluation team visited:
  ·     At the Ak-Kurgan site there is a defunct borehole with no submersible pump,
        a transformer station and pump house that is not connected to the
        transformer station, all constructed under RIRP. The VWO informed the
        evaluation team that the pump was in the pump house and that it was
        working. Neighborhood residents informed the team that: (i) there is severe
        water shortage due to a lack of pressure in the pipeline; (ii) shortly after
        construction of the pump house the pump worked and the water supply
        improved, but the transformer burned.; (iii) people from the community



                                       49

       collected money twice to repair the transformer, with no success; (iii) they
       do not know the VWO; (iv) water is provided by the Dushanbe water
       company; and (v) the pump station was build on land that was privately
       owned, without the consent of the owner.
  ·    At the Komunism site, the transformer station was likely over 5 years old,
       not connected to the pump house and with the actual transformer missing,
       the chlorination system was not installed and the borehole with a
       submersible pump was, as reported by the operator, in existence before the
       onset of the project.
  ·    At the Chemtepa site the borehole constructed by the project (as reported by
       the PMU), had no pump, the chlorination system was not installed and the
       transformer at site was missing.
  ·    At the Galezor site the project tubewell is working when there is no limit on
       energy supply (from May to September) but provides 9 out of 67 households
       only due to low capacity of the pump. The NGOs CARE and CESVI
       rehabilitated existing springs in the village from 2005-2007 and connected
       the school and the health clinic to the potable water supply. The VWO is
       not known by beneficiaries.
  ·    The VWO appeared to have little understanding of the system: (i) the VWO
       representative stated that chlorination of the water was done directly in the
       borehole (effectively chlorinating the aquifer); (ii) there were significant
       gaps between the rates and income from fee collection quoted by the
       accountant and the rates and income mentioned in the financial files; and
       (iii) the financial statement showed a significant yearly deficit, of which the
       VWO accountant was not aware.

Yavan. The potable water system constructed by the project to serve 28,000 people
in the village of Kulobod and downstream villages, was not functioning at project
closing. The evaluation team observed that the village of Kulobod does not receive
water from the pumping station and pipeline rehabilitated by the project, and only a
small part of the village receives water from a connection to the industrial water
supply of a chemical factory which was constructed before the RIRP. The chief
engineer of the pumping station (who reported not being involved in the project),
and the villagers stated that this was the situation at project completion. The pump
motors were missing, as were a section of the pipeline connecting the pump station
to the village. The PMU and the head of the VWO reported that representatives of
the district authority (hukumat) in Yavan district removed the section of the
pipeline shortly after completion of the project in June 2005 for use, according to
the PMU, in a different water supply system.

The chief engineer reported that the pump motors installed under the RIRP were
faulty and not functioning properly, and as a result were not able to power the
pumps providing water to the villages targeted under the project. According to the
PMU and to the construction progress reports of the IQCIE old pumps and motors
were indeed installed in August 2004 and not replaced with new ones until the
beginning of June 2005. The PMU reported to the evaluation team that new pumps



                                       50

       had been installed just before handing over of the project. These pumps were not
       observed at the site by the evaluation team.

       The evaluation team interviewed approximately 15 households in the village of
       Kulobod and the head of the VWO from a village 25 km from Kulobod. None of
       the households provided positive feedback on the project.                Seven project
       beneficiaries in Kulobod stated to the evaluation team that the people working on
       the project deceived the World Bank supervision team by manipulating the
       operation of the potable water scheme existing from before the project and
       presenting this as results achieved because of the RIRP. .Beneficiaries stated that
       they contributed money and labor to the project. The VWO stated that the financial
       contributions were used for staff salaries. Some eight villagers stated that the water
       supply of the village, existing before project onset, had deteriorated because of
       leakages in the project pipelines that were attached to the existing village network.
       Beneficiaries reported that at the start of the project, the project representatives had
       disconnected existing connections to the water supply of the chemical factory and
       informed the villagers that households which cultivated cotton would receive a new
       connection to the new potable water supply scheme.

15.         From the achievement of the outcomes, it is clear that there were major
shortcomings in the area of contract management of the potable water works; however,
these shortcomings cannot be identified properly as there is limited documentation
regarding the contract management process. The list of documents made available to the
evaluation team is listed below:

18.       The procurement of equipment was supported with technical assistance by an
international irrigation researcher from Colorado State University.       This researcher
recommended establishing some new courses within the current curriculum of the TUAS
and provided a detailed description of the course content. Furthermore, he provided
training in the use of the equipment. At the TUAS, it was reported to the evaluation team
that all research equipments were used in new research and training curricula. This
report, however, is doubtful as research equipment appeared brand-new and not used, and
staff reportedly trained under the project and teaching students on the use of the
equipment were not able to operate the equipment when requested by the team. At the
TLWMRI, the director acknowledged that the research equipment was not being used, as
a result of limited training and the fact that the equipment manuals had not been properly
translated.

21.        Under the RIRP and the FPSP, 50 WUAs were established, 41 under RIRP and
9 under FPSP, and received training and equipment. The evaluation team obtained
information on 22 out of 50 WUAs through field visits and site interviews and was
provided by the PMU with information on all 50 WUAs established under RIRP and
FPSP, as reported by the WUAs to the PMU. WUAs were ranked according to the
criteria listed in Table 12, where satisfactory performance corresponds with the target
level for WUA functioning described in the monitoring indicators. All WUAs that
reported they were able to do some O&M works were ranked moderately satisfactory or
higher.

6 Highly satisfactory         Not in increasing debt, paying salaries and doing O&M


22.         Overall, results were unsatisfactory, based on findings by the evaluation team
and information provided by the PMU, as shown in the table below. Most of the WUAs
had ceased functioning and WUAs established under RIRP were on average
unsatisfactory, whereas WUA established under FPSP were on average moderately
unsatisfactory. WUAs established under FPSP received a more sustained and rigorous
training program than those established under the RIRP.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

23.          The cost benefit analysis focuses mainly on irrigation and rehabilitation
activities of the project because rehabilitation works accompanied by institutional
strengthening activities cost the largest share of project expenditures (approximately
90%).       Specifically, the following phenomena which are typically associated with
investments in irrigation are explored: (i) increases in crop yields due to more reliable
provision of irrigation water; (ii) shift in the cropping pattern to higher value crops that
cannot be grown profitably under rain-fed conditions; (iii) higher cropping intensity and
cultivation of previously uncultivated land; and (iv) savings in water and energy due to
reduced losses and higher efficiency in operations. All these phenomena are associated
with higher incremental economic benefits to the farmers and/or the society as a whole.
The objective of the cost benefit analysis is to measure the efficiency with which these
benefits are achieved by comparing them with project costs.

24.          Unavailability of key data and the questionable nature of data that were
available severely limited the analysis of project benefits. Most notably, as the impact of
the project on agricultural production could not be distinguished on the basis of the
available data, no reliable projections for future project benefits could be made, and
hence the economic rate of return could not be estimated. The key sets of missing data
are annual crop budgets, including yields and market prices for outputs, total area
irrigated and cultivated, and cropping patterns in the command area of rehabilitated
irrigation infrastructure before and after effectives of these investments. In the absence of
such data, the analysis used raion-wide data collected by the State Statistical Agency.
Unfortunately these data sets are characterized by a number of deficiencies, including
significant inconsistencies (such as huge fluctuations in area data for perennial crops
from one year to the next) and missing data points. Experts consulted also indicated that
over-reporting of production figures by 20 to 30% is not uncommon. The analysis was
mindful of these deficiencies in reaching conclusions using these data.

Cost and Timing of I&D Rehabilitation Investments

25.      The total cost of I&D rehabilitation investments was US$ 15.8 million, affecting
some 127,000 ha of arable land. Per hectare investment ranged from a high of US$ 1,142
in Gissar to US$ 17.9 in Rudaki, with an average US$ 124 across the project area.

26.      As indicated in Table 16, in Yavan and Sharinav, rehabilitation works were
completed in 2004, making reliable water supply available on 750 ha and 6,100 ha,
respectively. However, in Sharinav the area serviced was reduced in 2007 because the
new equipment was moved to another raion by Government decision. In Matcho,
investments were completed gradually increasing the serviced area from 10,515 ha in
2002 to 23,564 ha in 2007. In Kolkhozabad, as of 2005, 3,270ha more were serviced;
there was nevertheless a decline in 2008 due to some pumps going out of operation. In
Zafarabad, reliably irrigated land from 15,000ha in 2005 to 36,250ha in 2006, while in
Gissar, 400 ha could be irrigated in the 2008 cropping season due to the project. In
Rudaki, limited project investments did not aim at increasing serviced area, but at
maintaining the structural soundness of the BGK headworks and one conveyance canal.

Project Impact on Energy and Water Use Efficiency


27.       Three efficiency indicators are discussed in this section: (i) pump efficiency
(power consumed per cubic meter of irrigation water supplied, measured in kWh/million
CM); (ii) power consumed per hectare irrigated (in kWh/ha); and (iii) water supplied per
hectare of land irrigated (in CM/ha). Pumping station level data are provided for 2001
(pre-project), 2005 and 2006 in Table 17. Analysis of these data leads to the following
conclusions:

        (i)     Pump efficiency in terms of energy consumed per cubic meter of water
                increased in 12 out of 23 pumping stations between 2001 and 2005/2006.
                Improvements are particularly noticeable in 2006. However, the analysis
                considered averages of the final two years in order to take into account
                possible special conditions in 2006, except in the case of Zafarabad where
                rehabilitated pumping stations became effective only in 2006. Power
                consumed per hectare of land decreased in 13 out of 23 pumping stations.
                It is not possible to compare the pump efficiencies to similar pumping
                schemes in different countries, as the analysis could not draw on data on
                the pumping elevation.

        (ii)    Per hectare water consumption decreased in the command areas of 16 out
                of the 23 rehabilitated pumping stations. However, the overall average
                decrease of 7% is low. Furthermore, there is significant variation in the
                rate of decrease at the level of pumping station which ranged from 1% to
                58%.     It is also noteworthy that at three pumping stations water
                consumption increased by 54-78%.

        (iii)   At nearly 15,000 CM/ha on average, water consumption remains very high.
                Raion averages range from about 12,000m3/ha in Zafarabad in 2006 to
                nearly 24,000 CM/ha in Kolkhozabad in the same year. In some areas,
                water consumption levels reach nearly 38,000 CM/ha which compares
                highly unfavorably with technically feasible levels of 7,000 CM/ha
                achieved in the US, Australia and Israel.


Project Impact on Crop Yields, Cropping Patterns and Cropping Intensity


28.       This section examines the impact of irrigation rehabilitation investments on key
crop yields (cotton, grains, and vegetables), total land under cultivation and relative
allocations of land to different crops. Total cropping area may have increased both due to
the beginning of cultivation of previously uncropped area and increased cropping
intensity whereby farmers are able to harvest crops more times during the year than
without improved irrigation water supply. The analysis focuses on four raions, namely
Yavan, Kolkhozabad, Matcho and Zafarabad, where project investments per ha were
sizeable and/or completed before 2006 so data were available for analysis.

29.       The economic analysis at appraisal predicted that in the without-project scenario
pumping stations would cease functioning within five years, leading to a gradual decline
in cultivated area and yields. In the with-project scenario, it was assumed that yields
would improve from their 1999 levels and a significant diversification in crops would
occur along with significant increases in area planted to grains and cotton.

30.       This analysis faces three important difficulties, all related to data availability:
Firstly, data on area cropped and cropping patterns in the project area are not available,
hence the statistics from 1999 and assumptions made for the with- and without-project
scenarios may not be compared with actual data. Secondly, the period during which
infrastructure rehabilitated under RIRP was functional and provided irrigation to an
increased area of land and for which data area available is limited to 1-3 years. This is a
very short period given the large number of other factors that can affect area and
cropping mix decisions, and yields. Thirdly, the available data on baseline are limited to
one year, thus not allowing the analyst to take into account fluctuations that may occur
due to a variety of reasons.

31.       As a general comment on yields, 2005 should be noted as a year with unusually
unfavorable weather conditions which led to a significant drop in output levels almost
across the country and crops.


32.       In the absence of data specific to the command areas of the irrigation
infrastructure, raion-wide data were reviewed and compared with those of with adjacent
non-project comparator raions with similar geographical and climatic conditions, thus
minimizing the impact of different agro-climatic conditions on yield differences. No
significant irrigation rehabilitation investments were carried out in these adjacent districts,
whether funded by the World Bank or any other donor. The pairings are as in Table 18:

33.       From Figure 3 and Figure 4 it is observed that in 2005 and 2006 average yield
trends in project districts remain stable, whereas in non-project districts yields declined.
In 2006, cotton and wheat yields were approximately 18% to 5% higher in project
districts compared to non-project districts. The stable yields in project districts are more
likely a result of more reliable water availability than in the neighboring districts.
Therefore, the main achievement of this component were its prolonging the working life
of critical infrastructure (mainly pumping stations), its halting the decline in the provision
of irrigation water and its prevention of a decline in the total crop area.

34.       One of the difficulties in the analysis was to discern the impact of the RIRP on
the above variables independently from that of the FPSP. This was partially achieved


                                               62

through the analysis of data collected in a 2007 farm survey. The survey elicited yield
data for 2006 from two types of farms which benefited from the RIRP: (a) those that were
also "pilot farms" under the FPSP and as such received a one-time grant towards inputs
acquisition as well as training in farm management and (b) "non-pilot farms" which only
benefited from irrigation rehabilitation and no FPSP support. The data indicate that, as
expected, average yields in pilot farms were higher than average yields in non-pilot farms.
However, in the absence of baseline data, it is not possible to discern the magnitude of
improvements, if any, or to isolate the impact of irrigation rehabilitation.

35.       Raion-wide statistics indicate that overall cropping area decreased in 2005 and
2006 despite an increase as of 2004 of area with reliable irrigation of more than 6,000 ha
(Table 20). Rather, the decreasing trend in overall cropping area from 2004 is similar to
that observed in the adjacent Abdurahman Jomi (Hojamaston) raion which was not
included in the RIRP (or the FPSP) (Table 21). The seeming lack of impact of project
investments in Yavan may be explained by the deterioration of other irrigation
infrastructure. In Yavan irrigation is mainly based on pumping and the project's
intervention was limited to partial rehabilitation of five deteriorated pumping stations out
of a total of 12 stations in the conveyance system. Based on observations of the O&M
performance in project areas, it is likely that some of the remaining stations seized
functioning properly while others were being rehabilitated. Conversations with farmers in
Yavan also point to farmers abandoning land allocated to them in reaction to the
Government policy that 70% of all land in cotton areas be cultivated to cotton despite
extremely low financial returns on cotton. Anecdotes conveyed to the ICR team suggest
that for some farmers belonging to dekhkan farms work only for the sticks of cotton
which serves as fuel for heating; hence such farmers cultivate only as much of their
allocated land as will cover their needs for heating materials for the following winter.
Finally, labor shortage brought about by migration of young men to Russia for work may
be another factor explaining the decline in the cropped area.

36.       With regards to cropping patterns, the area under cotton increased slightly in
2004 but then decreased again in 2006. The area under grains decreased also, and by
almost half in 2006.         The factors listed above may at least partially explain these


                                                        63

decreases. Vegetable cultivation increased slightly during the period 2004-2006, the
percentage of land under vegetables also increased a little, which could be an indication
that farmers retained land for high value crops as irrigation became more reliable. The
increase in area allocated to potatoes is also of note.

37.       As shown in Figure 5 cotton yields in Yavan spiked in 2002 but then steadily
decreased until 2005 despite the rehabilitated irrigation pumps coming on line in 2004.
On the other hand, grain yields display a steady increase through 2006. Vegetable yields
spiked in 2004 suggesting initial positive impact of irrigation rehabilitation.

38.       The increase in area with reliable water supply did not have a significant impact
on the area cultivated. In fact the changes in total cropping area closely mirror those in
the comparator Jilikul raion in 2005 and 2006 (Table 22 and Table 23). However
improved irrigation may have led to the increases observed in area devoted to cotton in
2005 and 2006 since in the same years Jilikul experienced declining area devoted to
cotton production. This may have occurred at the expense of grains, since area allocated
to grains, including corn, decreased in 2005 and 2006, while in Jilikul the reverse was
observed. No clear impact on other crops can be discerned due to data limitations.

39.       As shown in Figure 6 grain, cotton and vegetable yields behaved similarly in
Kolkhozabad and Jilikul for the most part, suggesting that increased reliability of
irrigation did not lead to large yield improvements.

Zafarabad

40.       Available data on total cropping area in Zafarabad indicate that it remained
below the total irrigated area and that it actually declined in 2006. A similar decline was
observed in the adjacent comparator Nau raion where irrigation rehabilitation did not take
place. Here the area devoted to cotton decreased significantly, while there was a slight
increase in area allocated to vegetables. This phenomenon is observed in Nau too.
Nevertheless, it would be misleading to conclude that the project did not have any
impact-based data pertaining to a single year.

41.       As shown in Figure 7, in 2006, the cotton yields continued the positive trend
seen in Zafarabad while the negative trend in grain yields continued. The fact that in Nau
the cotton yield fell sharply in 2006 while in Zafarabad it increased slightly may be
attributed to better irrigation availability in the latter, although caution is called for as the
positive trend existed already. Similarly, the fact that the falling trend in vegetable yields
was halted in 2006 in Zafarabad cannot necessarily be explained by irrigation
rehabilitation since a similar phenomenon albeit at a lesser scale was observed in Nau.

42.        A slight decrease in the total area cropped is observed in the one year for which
data area available.         This contrasts with the significant increase in the adjacent
comparator, Bobojon Gafurov raion. There appears to be a shift from cotton and grains to
fodder crops and to a lesser extent to melons in that one year. A similar decrease in cotton
area and increase in melon area are observed in Bobojon Gafurov in 2005.

43.        As shown in Figure 8 yield data indicate that the increasing trend in the cotton
yields continued in 2006. This contrasts favorably with the decreasing trend in Bobojon
Gafurov. On the other hand, like in Bobojon Gafurav the grain yield continued to decline,
albeit at a slower rate. Vegetable yields rebounded from the drastic fall in the previous
year, but this is likely more due to limitation of cultivation to favorable areas (area
cultivated to vegetables) decreased.

New Land Brought under Cultivation


44.          A total of 620 ha of land that was previously not cultivated was brought under
cultivation following the completion of irrigation rehabilitation works in Yavan (200 ha)
and in Gissar (420 ha). In both raions, the additional lands are cultivated with vegetables.
The per-hectare financial gross margins in Yavan and Gissar are estimated at US$275
and US$ 667, respectively.                  The corresponding economic values are US$ 257 and
US$ 667 (see below for assumptions). These values are considered incremental benefits
due to the project since no returns were reportedly obtained from this land prior to the
rehabilitation works. Hence, the total annual values generated to the economy are
roughly US$ 56,564 and US$ 266,985 respectively.

*Half of annual average per ha water consumption in Yavan and Sharinav in 2005 as reported by the PMU. Two vegetable crops per
year are assumed.


45.          Given the per hectare investment cost of US$ 241 in Yavan and US$1,142 in
Gissar, and assuming that (i) the rehabilitated infrastructure will be operated and
maintained properly, and (ii) the per hectare returns remain on average at the above
estimated levels, the net present values of vegetable production on these additional lands
are estimated at US$ 1,082 per hectare in Yavan and US$ 2,348 per hectare in Gissar (10
year period, r=.12.). These correspond to high internal rates of return.

46.          The crop budgets used in this estimation were obtained in a field survey of
farms in 2006.1 Since the survey area did not include Gissar, the crop budget observed in
the adjacent Sharinav raion was used in this analysis. Financial input prices were adjusted
as follows: VAT of 15% was deducted from the prices paid by farmers for fuel, seeds and
fertilizers. A pension fund tax of 25% and a social fund transfer of 1% were deducted
from salaries paid to hired labor. Additionally it was assumed that the shadow price of

labor is 50% given the high rate of unemployment in rural areas of Tajikistan. Market
price data, obtained from the State Statistical Committee, were not further adjusted
because no taxes are levied on crops sold by farmers on the market place or to
intermediaries. Per hectare water consumption had not been included in the crop budget
established in the 2007 survey. Considering that these areas benefit from pump irrigation
and assuming double cropping, the evaluation team inserted half the average annual per
hectare water use levels. The economic cost of water provision is estimated at US¢ 2.9
per hectare (9.4 Dirham/ha). At 10 times the rate charged to farms for irrigation water
supply in Yavan, Sharinav, Gissar, Kolkhozabad and Rudaki, the analysis assumes this
amount reflects the true coss of water delivery to the field. The exchange rate for mid-
2006 was taken as TJS 3.2 per US$.


Impact of Drinking Water Supply Investments


47.       The key benefit of improved potable water supply are: (i) reduced incidence of
water-borne diseases; (ii) reduced expenditures households incur to avert such diseases;
and (iii) reduced cost, in terms of time and effort, to collect drinking water from distant
locations. The recently completed Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) for Tajikistan
(World Bank, 2008) estimated the annual cost to the economy of poor water supply,
sanitation and hygiene to equal 1.4% of Tajikistan's GDP ­ in particular, diarrheal
illnesses in rural areas at TJS 72 million and Hepatitis A and Typhoid/Paratyphoid across
the country at TJS 4.2 million.       The annual household averting expenditures were
estimated between TJS 3 million and TJS 7 million.             These costs rank third in
significance among all environmental hazards in Tajikistan.

48.       This section evaluates the benefits of RIRP's small potable water supply
component by building on the above-referenced study. The estimated number of rural
residents in Rudaki, Matcho and Zafarabad who as a result of the project now have
improved potable water supply is estimated at 17,000 (Table 29).

49.       Based on this number the averted loss in disability adjusted life years (DALY)
terms and monetary terms was calculated to be 45 and US$20,000 per year respectively
(Table 29). The key assumption was that improved drinking water supply would reduce

and incidence of diarrhea is the same among project beneficiaries as in the overall rural
population.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and Government comments on ICR

Summary of BCR:

The Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project aimed to (i) increase the total efficiency of
water use in main and field canals; (ii) reduces expenses of pumping irrigation and
increase the efficiency of rehabilitated pumping stations and other infrastructure; (iii)
establish Water User Associations and introduce measures to sustain project investments;
(iv) to improve drinking water quality involving communities; and (v) to strengthen
institutional capacity for the development of land management and water resources. To
do this, the project was comprised of four components. Each of these components are
listed below with an assessment of their outcomes:

Component 1: Rehabilitation of main irrigation net and drainage collectors:

This component was designed to rehabilitate critical irrigation infrastructure for more
reliable and efficient water delivery. At the closing of the project, all the works under
this component were completed. As a result of the rehabilitation of infrastructure,
efficiency gains were noted in the main canals from between 0.5% and 11.4%, due,
primarily to a reduction in leakage from the canals (68.3 million cu annually) and a total
land water supply in the project areas of 56,900 ha. In addition, 3,530 ha of land was
improved, and 620 ha of land that was previously unusable because of water shortages
and high water tables, was introduced into agricultural rotation.            This resulted in
employment for 1,100 farmers, most of whom are located in the relatively impoverished
RRS. Table 31 shows a breakdown of the areas where water supply was improved as a
result of investments in rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure.

Investments under this component also replaced pumps that served to reduce the power
expenses for water supply by 5%, and increased water supply to 81,760 ha of land. The
total area that benefited from improved water supply was 137,747 ha.

Assessment of achievement: Overall the objectives of this Component were achieved.
Rehabilitation works have been completed in all five districts, although the scope of
rehabilitated works was modified slightly in two districts (Zafarabad and Matcho)
because of increased equipment costs. The quality of the work is rated as satisfactory,
although the continued O&M of the infrastructure remains questionable. Secondary
impacts of the investments included increased capacity to execute Bank projects, and in
procurement procedures for local firms.

Lessons Learned: While the investments in rehabilitating infrastructure was considered
crucial at project design, more training and capacity building is needed to ensure the
sustainability of investments.



Component 2: Rehabilitation of drinking water supply system in rural areas:

Investments made under this component were designed to rehabilitate drinking water
supply systems in rural areas. At the project's closing, five water supply systems were
rehabilitated. These included:

In addition, existing water supply systems were rehabilitated to improve the quality of
drinking water, in line with requirements of the law GOST 2874-82 "Drinking Water".
This resulted in improvements to water supply systems affecting an additional 52,500
inhabitants. This served to reduce the disease level by 25 to 50%. Table 32 shows the
reductions in diseases as a result of improved drinking water.

Assessment of achievement: The rehabilitation of works to the drinking water supply
system was fully implemented as designed, and the quality of the works is rated
satisfactory. However, in light of the extreme poverty of the targeted populations, the
participation of local communities remains low, at only ten percent. The lack of
participation is expected to negatively impact the sustainable O&M of these systems.

Lessons Learned: Given the crucial link between community participation and the
sustainability in investments, the local context for participatory action is important to
understand. The participatory process must account for the ability and willingness to pay
on the part of villagers, and necessitates intensive training and capacity building exercises
to introduce the approach. Capacity building and training programs for local staff is also
key to understanding the process.


Component 3: Increase of institutional capacity of organizations and department of
Republic of Tajikistan

This component aimed to complement investments in the rehabilitation of infrastructure
by supporting institutional capacity building in relevant organizations and departments.
This was done mostly by providing trainings and improving facilities at the Tajik
Agrarian University, as well as by providing training programs, assisting in WUA
establishment, and preparation of technical specifications for works to be completed
under the project.

By November 2006, legislation on WUAs was accepted by Parliament and signed by the
President, and revisions to the Water Code of the Republic of Tajiksitan were revised to
be line with provisions for user groups at the local level.



                                              79

A number of WUAs were established under the project and were provided with trainings
and mobilization campaigns. These WUAs are organized with a manager, a water
management engineer, an accountant and field agents (mirobs) to cover 450-500 ha or
irrigated land per worker.

Assessment of achievement: The Water User Associations (WUAs) established under
this component failed to achieve sustainable O&M of canal systems. The main reasons
for this are: (i) poverty rates and farmer indebtedness to futures companies; (ii) lack of
micro- or bank-credit schemes to farmers; (iii) limited support from the local authorities;
(iv) poor knowledge of legal rights amongst farmers; (v) lack of machinery that could be
rented to implement works; and (vi) the absence of specialists that could provide
operational support to on-farm irrigation systems.

Lessons Learned: Water User Associations established for irrigation purposes should
take into account the patterns of crop production in the area. In this project, much of the
achievement of WUAs was undermined by the focus on cotton production and related
indebtedness to futures companies that provide key inputs.         In addition, sustained
capacity building exercises are needed to ensure the mobilization of members and the
training of WUA staff.


Comments on the Bank's performance:

Overall, the borrower rates the performance of the Bank as satisfactory, given the close
supervision and institutional support provided. The Bank was responsive to challenges
that emerged during implementation and assisted the PMU in overcoming them. The
close supervision of the Bank's team ensured that initial problems, such as developing
terms of reference, procurement and contracting, was dealt with in a timely manner and
improved over the course of the project.


Comments on the PMU performance:

The PMU's performance is rated satisfactory. This rating is based on the responsiveness
of the PMU to the Bank's requirements and suggestions during supervisions, which
improved the final achievement of the project.
