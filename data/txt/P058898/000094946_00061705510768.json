supply in selected villages will support construction of\n            tube wells with submersible pumps, and rehabilitation and\n            construction of pump unit in selective water supply pump\n            stations. 3) Institutional capacity building for improved\n            land and water resources management will support improvement\n            of management and operations of main water supply\n            organizations, establishment of water users'\n            associations at the field systems level, strengthening of\n            the Tajikistan University of Agricultural Sciences,
