environmental impact due to\n            construction works is expected to be small, the\n            infrastructure rehabilitation works to increase water\n            efficiency in the main, and field canals on demonstration\n            farms, does not include investments in dams, nor\n            construction of new canals, to allow increased water\n            abstraction from main sources. Neither does it include\n            resettlement plans. Hence, several environmental issues have\n            been identified in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP),\n            namely, ineffective water resources management, and,\n            increasing areas affected by water-logging and soil\n            salination, due to inefficient irrigation water management,\n            and improper use of drainage systems. Furthermore, soil\n            erosion, and town waste water discharges into major rivers,\n            will increase water pollution. This EMP discusses measures\n            to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment, recommending\n            during construction, a) the dampening of surfaces to avoid\n            dust pollution, b) that works be adjusted to daytime\n            schedules to ease noise disturbances, and, c) that solid\n            wastes be disposed of in accordance with environmental\n            regulations. Vegetation degradation should be replaced\n            and/or replanted. Sludge drainage will be seasonally\n            controlled, according to operation and maintenance\n            practices, while affected crop lands will undergo periodic\n            water, and soil testing, by regional laboratories. An\n            awareness campaign is recommended."}, "docdt": "2000-03-31T10:49:02Z"}
