RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)
1.    Background :
Tajikistan is a mountainous, landlocked country of 143 thousand square with a
population of about 6.2 million and is one of the poorest areas in Central Asia. Presently, it is
estimated that 85 percent of the population, cannot meet their basic needs for food, health and
educational services. Agricultural sector dominate the economy contributing to about 30% of the
NMP and 50 percent of the employment and about 70 percent of the population live in rural areas.
The vast majority of the poor - about five million -owe their circumstances to the collapsed
economy and post-civic conflict situation in the country and would, if employment opportunities
are made available through growth, be able to improve their living standards. Within the sector,
crop production accounts for approximately two thirds of the gross value of the output in constant
terms of which half is cotton although bread is the staple food of Tajikistan. Major constraints to
speedy recovery of agricultural sector, beside the private land ownership, is the poor state of
Irrigation infrastructure. The agricultural sector in Tajikistan is almost fully dependent on
irrigation - about 700 thousand hectares of the total annual cropped area of 812 thousand hectares
is irrigated.  Due to severe budget constraints and lack of maintenance over the past several
years, much of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure is deteriorating and in need of urgent
rehabilitation unless these infrastructures are rehabilitated speedily the agriculture would come to
a grinding halt. Therefore the Government of Tajikistan (GOT) is giving high priority to urgent
rehabilitation of these vital irrigation and drainage infrastructure in order to reduce the risk of
losing considerable national assets and productive capacity. IDA has been requested to assist
GOT in this and is ready to assist government with the financing of the proposed Rural
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (RIRP).
II.   Project Objectives:
2.    The project's main objectives are: (i) to increase the overall water use efficiency in the
main and field canals servicing the ten demonstration farms being supported under the Farm
Privatization Support Project and all the adjoining farms; (ii) to reduce the costs of lift irrigation
and improve operating efficiency through the rehabilitation of selected pumping stations; and
other critical irrigation infrastructure; (iii) to establish water user associations in the project areas
and introduce progressive cost recovery measures; (iv) to improve the quality of drinking water in
a few selected villages in the project area; and (v) to promote decentralization of the Ministry of
Irrigation and Water Resources.
III.  Scope of the project:
3.    The Government of Tajikistan is a signatory to the international treaty for sharing of river
waters, and is keen to adhere to the agreed limits. Because this abstraction limitation to water
from the rivers it has to improve its available water use efficiency to enhance the agriculture
prodcution. Unlike other Central Asian countries, Tajikistan has developed a unique irrigation
system of combination of gravity and pumping. The proposed Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Project (RIRP) would rehabilitate existing physical infrastructure for irrigation and drinking
water for timely water delivery in each of the eight raions in the three Oblasts of RRS, (Leninsky,
Hissar and Shahrinau raions); Khatlon (Yavan, Gosimalinski, and Kolkhozabad raions), and
2


﻿Leninabad (Matcha and Zafarabad raions). All main canals and most of the secondary canals in
the project command area are lined. Majority of the tertiary canals are pre-cast reinforced
concrete, or have cast in-situ concrete lining. However, unlined open earth canals exist in more
.       than 40 percent of the tertiary canal systems. Off-farm irrigation water conveyance efficiency is
low (less than 50 percent) as the system has deteriorated from lack of maintenance in the past
several years. The main canals could benefit from better sediment removal and repairs or
replacement of turnout gates to feed the tertiary channels. A large proportion of turnout gates are
either very badly damaged or have no gates at all. Under RIRP, a significant proportion of the
gates will be rehabilitated or replaced and all canal linings will be repaired and joints replaced
and drainage system flushed, cleaned and repaired. Improvements to these systems will thus
improve the availability of water to farms without higher abstraction from source reduce losses
and incidences of water logging.
4. Availability of good quality drinking water is a matter of vital importance for rural
population in the project area. To ensure reliable supply of quality drinking water the project
would help, on a pilot scale, the present inefficient government managed drinking water service
transformed into an operationally independent community managed system. Village water supply
pilot activity would be undertaken with the active involvement of the beneficiaries, a social
scientist and an environmentalist besides the team of engineers from the Rural Water Department,
to ensure community participation and to protect from any environmental negative impact, in the
design, construction and in transferring Operation and Maintenance responsibility to the village
community. The following activities would be supported by the project under the village
drinking services component: (i) construction of tube-wells with submersible pumps in the
villages of Akkurgan, Leninsky ralon; all the nine villages in Matcha raion; and in all the seven
villages in Zafarabad raion; and (ii) rehabilitation of the pump unit in the existing water supply
pump station (Firdausi farm) and construction of a new pump station (Ittifok farm) as well as
laying the main water delivery pipelines inKulabad village of Yavan raion; and in three villages
i.e. Rokhi-Lenin, Suyunabad, Yangiabad, of Kolkhozabad raion.
IV. Potential Proposed Project Impact on the Environment:
5.   The environmental impact of the proposed project is expected to be small, but positive.
The proposed works does not include any investment in dams or resettlement nor construction of
new canals or head works that would allow increased water abstraction from main sources. It is
however classified as category "B" for the purpose of OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment so as
to provide for monitoring the project during and after implementation. The project will address
relevant aspects of the environmental problems the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resource
Management (ME& NRM), Republic of Tajikistan, has identified for the irrigation sub-sector as
a whole. ME&NRM has identified the following environmental issues that relate to the irrigation
sub-sector in general: (i) ineffective water resources management; (ii) increasing areas affected
by water-logging and soil salinization, caused by inefficient irrigation water management and
improper working of drainage systems; (iii) soil erosion due to poorly managed farm
management systems and (iv) discharge of town waste waters into major rivers polluting the
water. As per the recently passed Law of Tajikistan on Environmental Protection and Law on
Ecological Expertise, all civil works including the rehabilitation, would have to be assessed on
the ecological impact and mitigation and have to be reviewed and monitored by the ME& NRM.
6.   The proposed project activities would finance repair and rehabilitation of parts of irrigation
infrastructure for improving water use efficiency, check the process of salinization, water logging
and arrest the process of land degradation and provide in few selected villages drinking water
supply system. All these works will be of minor nature. It is expected to foster more prudent use
3


﻿of irrigation water through priw 'tized farms. Community involvement in the operation and
maintenance (O&M) of the village drinking water facilities and formation of Water Users
Associations proposed to be formed, as a bottom - up institution of the irrigators for the cost
recovery and O&M is expected to instill a greater sense of individual and community
responsibility, perhaps sufficient to collectively take measures to protect the environment. The
rehabilitation of the main and subsidiary inter farm irrigation and drainage canals will enhance
the ability to enhance field level water use and conveyance efficiency with possible beneficial
applications for monitoring and control of the environment.
7.   The reduction in losses and improved irrigation distribution will, besides the equity
amongst farmers, reduce seepage losses from main canal and over-supply of irrigation, with a
beneficial effect for the area: a lower water table, a lower risk of salinity, and less stagnant water
pools in the village causing health problems. Provision of clean potable water in the problem
villages would reduce waterborne disease incidences and improve villagers health. However,
since potential negative impact of the project would be (i) increased agrochemical pollution, and
surface water contamination, resulting from the possible increased use of pesticides and
fertilizers, along with improved availability of irrigation water; (ii) soil erosion associated with
the maintenance of existing practices of agricultural production; (iii) improper and indiscriminate
use of on-farm irrigation water such as resorting to flood irrigation by the farm owners, choice of
modem water conservation techniques and methods; (iv) dumping of excavated sediments and
other materials from irrigation and drainage canals, structures;(v) environmental damage possibly
caused by contractors during construction activities; and (vi) and Nurek Dam stability issues.
Further, as the entire upper watershed for the entire Aral Sea basin, there is a need to guard
against any possible ecosystem and hydrological system issues including the international water
ways issues.
8.   As the project is classified as Environmental Category "B", the environmental was done in
the form of management plan only ( OP 4.01 - Annex C para. 1) . The management plan deal with
issues related to construction and operations, and has identified any negative impacts that may
arise, in addition to describing effective mitigating measures to reduce potentially adverse
environmental impacts. The Summary EMP is enclosed herewith and will be attached to the
PAD. A summarized EMP in the form of tabulated description of environmental impacts and the
proposed measures is attached.

A refresher course for the Regional Department of Environment and Natural Resource Management
Chemical Laboratory and the Regional Water and soil Chemical Laboratories staff for three days will also be
organized every year during the project period in quality control methods to upgrade their levels for
improving the quality of analysis and reporting on the irrigation, drainage and drinking water samples. A
feed back on their performance and comparisons of their results with standard lab in Dushsanbe will be
provided during the training.
Trainings Programs and Seminars for Project Field Staff and Water Users:
The project will organize periodically training programs and workshops to develop and expand professional
14


﻿skills and capacity of the staff involved in project implementation. Trainees would be specialists of the head-
quarters and field offices of the MOI&WR, MOA, members of Water User's Associations (WUAs), farmers.

﻿E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Institutional arrangements for implementing the Monitoring and Mitigation Plans both for Irrigation and
Drainage Component, and as well as the Village Drinking Services component are presented in the chart E. I
and E.2 attached to this report the flow of information regarding Monitoring and Mitigation Plans activities
and mitigating measures, are as follows:
The raion level trained staff of Raivodkhoz will periodically, before the crop planting season and after crop
harvest (every April and September ), collect soil samples from statistically selected and designated command
area farms, and drainage water samples from the selected points by the ME & NRM and send to the Regional
Water and Soil chemical analysis laboratory of their respective jurisdiction i.e., Dushanbe, Kurgantubpe and
Khujand for analysis.
The division for environmental analysis and management within the Ministry of Irrigation which is responsible
for environmental aspects of the irrigation projects.  This unit will coordinate with ME&NRM  for
implementation of the project Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP)as per the procedures and guidelines. The
ME&NRM issues directives, the applicability and validity of these environmental mitigation plans (EMPs).
The ME&NRM has regional offices and Laboratories at Kurgantubpe, Khojand and Dushanbe for conducting
the analysis and support for monitor environmental standards and provide recommendations on environmental
parameters for mitigation of negative impacts.
The division for environmental analysis and management within the Ministry of Irrigation which is responsible

ME&NRM issues directives, the applicability and validity of these environmental mitigation plans (EMPs).
The ME&NRM has regional offices and Laboratories at Kurgantubpe, Khojand and Dushanbe for conducting
the analysis and support for monitor environmental standards and provide recommendations on environmental
parameters for mitigation of negative impacts. ME&NRM Engineers supervise and conduct specialized
inspections to monitor for protection of water, land, air, fauna and flora, fish, use of industrial waste/recycling;
units for analytical control, and report to oblast, municipal, raion environmental committees. ME&NRM
Engineers supervise the construction works, and control the environment on project/construction site.
However, the existing situation is not satisfactory for the implementation of the EMP, at the ground level as
well as institutional and laboratory capacity is presently weak and limited due decline in overall
macroeconomic conditions and budgetary constraints.
The project therefore provides for the laboratory equipment and operational expenses for the duration of the
project. Details of the institutional arrangement for the collection of periodic water samples and feedback
mechanisms are illustrated in the chart I of this EMP. The Environmental Advisor in the PMU would be
responsible for introducing the environmental protection clauses in the contract Bid Documents so that all the
works executed under the project conforms to the environmental regulations. The Environmental Advisor in
the PMU and the ME& NRM would review the periodic reports of the Raion level Raivodkhoz engineers and
the NGOs, news media reports during the construction MIWR on the Environmental reports with regard to
above Noise, Dust, improper disposal of solid wastes and loss of vegetation and would recommend appropriate
mitigation measures to restore the environmental conditions and in the event of the severe damages issue
direction of change of construction regime and/or stop the work by issue of notice to the contractor.

﻿V.    Mitigation Measures during Construction:
9.    The key mitigating measures against the potential negative impact that is being envisaged
under the project Environment Mitigation Plan (EMP) with regard to each of the items are as
follows:
Environmental damage possibly caused by contractors during construction activities: Such
as i) Noise; ii) Dust; iii) Solid wastes dumping of excavated sediments and other materials
from irrigation and drainage canals, structures; and iv) damage to natiral vegetation etc.,:
necessary mitigating measures would constitute integral part of the design and
implementation including the contracts binding the contractors to carry out the
environmental obligations during construction of the sub-project.  Standard bidding
documents would have the following environmental precautionary clauses:
"The natural landscape should be preserved to the extent possible by conducting
operations in a manners that will prevent unnecessary destruction or scarring of
natural surroundings. Except where required for permanent works, quarries, borrow
pits, staging and processing areas, dumps, and camps, all trees, saplings, and
shrubbery should be protected from unnecessary damage by project related activities.
After unavoidable damage and to restore quasi-original conditions were appropriate;
Contractor's operations should be so performed as to prevent accidental spillage of
contaminants, debris, or other pollutants, especially into streams or underground
water resources. Such pollutants include untreated sewage and sanitary waste,
tailings, petroleum products, chemical, biocides, mineral salts, and thermal pollution.
Wastewater, including those from aggregate processing and concrete batching, must
not enter streams without settling ponds, grave I filters, or other process, so as not to
impair water quality or harm aquatic life;
The contractor should ensure proper disposal of waste materials and rubbish. If
disposal by burial or fire, it should not cause negative impact to either the air, soil nor
ground water supplies;
The contractor should minimize air and water pollution emissons. Dust from the
handling or transporting of aggregates, cement, etc., should be minimized by
sprinkling or other methods. Materials, brush or trees should only be burned when
the owners permits, under favorable weather conditions;
The contractor's facilities, such as warehouse, labor camps, and storage areas, should
be planned in advance to decide what the area will look like upon completion of
construction. These facilities should be located so as to preserve the natural
environment (such as trees and other vegetation) to the maximum extent possible.
After project construction, camps and building should either serve as permanent
residences and form future communities, if such use can be fore seen and approved,
or be tom down and the area restore to its quasi-original condition in order to avoid
deterioration into shanty towns.
Borrow pits should be landscaped and planted accordingly to an ecological design to
provide some substitute area for lost natural landscapes and habitats."

﻿Mitigation Measures during Operation :
a) Quality of the drinking water: The water will be regularly analyzed for all the standard
parameters ( attachment 1) in the regional ME& NRM laboratories and reports submitted to
ME&NRM regularly.
b) .  With regard to Soil and drainage water qualities: The samples will be analized in
the regional Soil and water chemical laboratories of MIWR by the Raivodkhoz staff. This
is proposed to be implemented in coordination and synchronization with the on going
program Farm Privatization Support Project (FPSP), in the same project area by the same
Project Management Unit (PMU) on three elements i.e. training, demonstration and
information services. These activities are totally integrated with the RIRP where training
will be provided to the farming community of the project area sensitizing them on all the
environmental issues;
c).   on soil erosion associated with the maintenance of existing practices of agricultural
production and improper and indiscriminate use of on-farm irrigation water such as
resorting to flood irrigation by the farm owners, choice of modern water conservation
techniques and methods,: the MOA supported by the training and demonstration program
under the FPSP would be providing improved soil and land management practices to the
farming community to prevent any soil erosion associated with the maintenance of existing
practices of agricultural production; and demonstrations under the FPSP will provide advise
and training to the farmers not only to farming community in the project area but also to the
entire farming community in the raions upstream of the irrigation scheme. It is however
noted that most of the erosion occurs in the upper catchment which this project will not be
addressing but will be taken up as a part of National Resource Management Program study;
The Issue of Nurek Dam Safety :
The proposed project does not directly affests with the investment .now being proposed for
rehabilitation. The status of this Dam has been investigated by the World Bank under. Aral Sea
Basin Program, has carried out an asssessment of the safety requirements of Nurek dam, and
detailed recommendations are being taken into account in the protection of Nurek dam for its
effective performance. Final detailed estimates are still under study. This was discussed with the
ME& NRM, MIWR and the Deputy Prime Minister, cabinet ofMinisters during appraisal.
Acceptance and acting on the recommendations for the mitigation measures of the Nurek Dam
safety will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed RIR.
The Issue of Notification requirement under OP 7.50:
All the proposed rehabilitation works on the RIRP are part of an existing scheme and would
involve rehabilitation only, which would not exceed the original scheme, alter or expand the
volume of water abstraction limits as a signatory to the internationally agreed water share of
October 7, 1967, which is currently valid. The proposed project shall not change the existing
nature of the water abstraction, or alter its scope and extent as to make it a new or different
scheme. The quantity of the water share would be limited by the head works design capacity that
was originally conceived and constructed and would not be altered. The works would not
adversely impact in any way water use or water quality in the riparian countries. It would also
not be adversely affected by other riparian possible future water use, as improvement to the water
management and drainage system will only improve the environmental conditions. Most of the
drainage water from the project area hitherto were being discharged with much more pollutants
and agrochemical into the Aral sea basin. After the completion of the RIRP works, the drainage
21


﻿water would still be discharged into the systems, but with lesser quantities of pollutants and
would be regulated and monitored. In view of the foregoing facts and in line with paragraph 7 (a)
of OP 7.50, it is strongly felt that this project does not constitute a case for the notification
requirement . The Development Credit Agreement would include a covenant calling for the
implemertation of this Environmental Management Plan.
Management Responsibility:
The environmental management responsibility will be shared by three agencies:
i.) The Executing Agency; (ii) Supervising Agency; and (iii) Monitoring Agency.
i.) The Executing Agency will assume the responsibility for: (a) the design and assessment of the
physical work options in accordance to the Tajik environmental norms, regulations and
requirement; and (b) the physical implementation of the activities under the project. Ministry of
Irrigation and Water Resources (MIWR), Consulting design engineers of the Design Institute and
externally engaged consulting engineers will assume the primary responsibility for providing
alternative designs and for preparation of the bidding documents with specifications taking into
account environmental protection requirements.  Contractors will be responsible for the
implementation of the rehabilitation works in accordance with environmental requirement
specified in the bidding documents.
(ii) Supervising Agency: Project Management Unit ( PMU) will be the Supervising Agency and
will be responsible for the timely and sound execution of works and activities in sequence under
the project. It has to obtain the clearances from the ME& NRM for each of the individual sub-
project before placing it before the Project Coordination Committee for approval.
(iii) Monitoring Agency: The ME& NRM will be the primary monitoring agency for the RIRP
activities. A full time environmental Advisor will be appointed for the RIRP for the Monitoring
purposes and She/he shall submit her/his quarterly monitoring reports to the Director PDU who
will submit to Sate level Pror nt Coordination Committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister at
the Cabinet of Ministers level. n addition the Bank environmental specialist will monitor during
supervision missions adherence to the EMP by various agencies.
During the operations the Raivodkhoz engineers and field staff of ME& NRM would
collect the soil and water samples and arrange to get them analyzed in the respective regional
laboratories and depending upon the result provide appropriate mitigation measures to the
Farmers and community (see Chart 2) . The State level Project Coordination Committee headed
by the Deputy Prime Minister would review the project implementation quarterly reports
including the environmental iss1es submitted by the Director, PMU periodically at least thrice an
year during the project implem ntation period.

﻿F. CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL NGOs AND PROJECT-AFFECTED GROUPS
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of Mr. T Ostanaev, director of the ProJect
Management Unit, on 29 February, 2000, at the seminar hall of the Ministry of Agriculture, at 44.
Rudaki Street, Dushanbe, preceded by the public invitation. (See the document at Attachment -
F-1). The following included the agenda of the meeting:
* Environmental Aspects of the Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project;
*  Formation of the Water User's Association for Operation and Maintenance of the
Irrigation and drainage works and cost recovery;
*  Formation of community organization for the Operation and maintenance of the Village
Drinking Water Facilities to be rehabilitated/Developed.
The project authorities presented the project and the issues with regard to the above points
Following is the brief summery of the participant's views with regard to the project.
*  The participants unanimously concluded that the outputs of the proposed project
components would strengthen sustainable development of the National agriculture, involving
technologies, policies and actions directed at the integration of socioeconomic principles
related to the environmental protection. This, without doubt, would promote development
and increase the agricultural production and would economically help the farms (farmers),
prevent the risk of the decreased productivity of irrigated land, protect natural "assets", and
prevent the degradation of soil fertility and water quality.
*  It is expected that the project would promote sustainable and effective use of irrigated land
and water, introduction of environmentally sustainable management practices, increased
responsibilities for the environment. Rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation and
drainage systems would help to improve the efficient water use, to reduce soil salinity and
erosion and water pollution caused by soil degradation.
*  The drinking water program would mitigate the problem of drinking water availability in the
project villages and the proposed project approach would improve the sanitary and health and
living conditions of these villagers as the protected water supply would reduce the incidences
of water related diseases.
*  Based on the above the meeting    considered the project to be technically feasible,
environmentally sound, socially acceptable and they would provide full cooperation for its
successful implementation.
*  The meeting also expressed that it was quite educative to organize such meetings. These
types of Public Consultation were not organized under former Soviet Union. People in
general are not aware of the environmental assessment needs and the rights and
responsibilities of the people and their role in the project realization. and it was therefore
emphasized that more attention is required to be paid to educate the citizens to (i) sensitize
the people about the environmental impacts and their duties and responsibilities (ii) to review
the general and technical principles of environmental procedures and the role of government
and private agencies; and (iii) to educate the people about the existing legislation, norms and
procedures of the Republic of Tajikistan and to suggest any modifications for improvements.
