Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation Project (RIRP) for Tajikistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the implementation of the RIRP Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) system provided incorrect data. As a result of\n            verification of these data after project closing, the\n            project was downgraded from satisfactory to moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Inadequate M&E critically affects the\n            ability of the World Bank to identify threats to project\n            outcomes and propose adequate corrective action, and hence\n            M&E results should be verified and properly documented\n            through prompt supervision follow-up. Project investments in\n            pumped irrigation schemes did not increase overall water\n            supply, mainly because of a lack of funds for Operation and\n            Maintenance (O&M). Poor O&M has a critical impact on\n            project outcomes, and any future investments for irrigation\n            and drainage rehabilitation projects in Tajikistan should be\n            based on an analysis of the economic and financial viability\n            of rehabilitated schemes and the resources available for\n            O&M. Mainly because management style and the capacity\n            and the commitment of the Project Management Unit (PMU) were\n            inadequate, the community-driven development approach for\n            the village water supply component was implemented\n            unsatisfactory and most water supply schemes did not reach\n            their objective. Accordingly it is important that future\n            investments in Tajikistan in Community Driven Development\n            (CDD) Project components are implemented through capable and\n            committed project partners with adequate understanding of\n            the CDD approach."}, "docdt": "2008-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
