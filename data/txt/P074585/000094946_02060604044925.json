{"cdata!": "The Ethiopia Structural Adjustment\n            Credit Project (ESAC) focuses on economy-wide reforms aimed\n            at improving the investment climate for the private sector,\n            in support of the Government's pro-poor growth\n            strategy; deepening civil service reforms and strengthening\n            public expenditure management to improve the quality of\n            public services delivery. Within a context of peace and\n            macroeconomic stability, the Credit will help to sustain the\n            recovery of investment and growth and reduce poverty. The\n            reforms supported by the Credit wil lower transaction costs\n            for private investors and exporters, and improve the overall\n            business environment. Public sector management and\n            expenditure will increase public accountability and the\n            effectiveness with which essential services are delivered.\n            Future operations will emphasize the deepening of these\n            reforms, in the areas of further private sector growth,\n            decentralization and empowerment, capacity building, and\n            infrastructure and human development. The ESAC is a one\n            tranche, transition operation. It is expected to be followed\n            by Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) in later years\n            to accompany the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (PRSP) which is under preparation."}, "docdt": "2002-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
