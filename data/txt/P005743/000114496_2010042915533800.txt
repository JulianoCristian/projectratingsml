Re:
Loan No. 3786-TUN
(Secondary Education Support Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement      
Your Excellency:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Secondary Education Support Project) dated 
September 21, 1994, between the Republic of Tunisia (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), as amended.  We also 
refer to the request to the Bank contained in the letter on your behalf from Mr. 
Hamouda Hamdi dated October 6, 1998 to implement the measures required to reallocate 
the proceeds of the Loan so as to allow the financing of local costs incurred in 
connection with training received overseas.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank, after due consideration to your 
request, has agreed to the above.  Accordingly, Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds 
of the Loan) to the Loan Agreement is hereby amended to read as set forth in the 
Attachment hereto.  Since an important number of expenditures to be financed under the 
amended Category (3) had already been incurred, the newly defined disbursement 
percentage for such Category will be retroactively applied from November 3, 1997.
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
the confirmation on the enclosed copy of this Amendment Letter and returning it to us.
Sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR  
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
