MEMORANDUM AND RECOMIMATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRI TO TE EXECtUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A SECONDARY EDUCATION SUPPORT PROJECT
1. I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reconunendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Tunisia for the equi ,alent of US$98.3 million to help finance a project for a
Secondary Education Support Project The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 17 years, includir, 5 year. of grace.
2. Sector Development and Issues. Tunisia has made significant progress towards a market-
oriented economy by placing consistent emphasis on both human resources development and prudent
macro- economic policies. Over the 1986-93 period, the Government addressed economic
inefficiency by restraining demand, devaluing the dinar and correcting macroeconomic imbalances.
These reforms have improved the socio-economic environment and reduced the constraints on private
initiatives.
3. At the same time, the Government has maintained support for its major social objectives. Poverty
reduction, social development, family planning programs and education reform have received
continuous funding. Since 1965 there have been major improvements in infant mortality and life
expectancy, while population growth rates have declined significantly. The net school enrollment
ratio among 6-14 year olds rose from 60% in 1976 to 90% in 1992. Primary school retention rates
have substantially improved from 33% in the early 80s to 85% in 1993-94. Today, almost all 6-year
olds enroll in school.
4. In 1993/94, about 1.5 million children were enrolled in public lower-basic education, about
383,000 in public upper-basic and 293,000 in public secondary general education. Public higher
education registered 96,000 students in 1993/94. The vocational training system (pre-employmnent
training) included 42,000 students in 1992/93, of which more than 40% were in private institutions.
Tunisia allocates 6.3% of GDP to its education sector, which is considerably higher than countries
with comparable per capita GDP. The share of education in the national budget reached 22.1 % in
1993, reflecting the priority given to this sector.
5. The Government initiated a national education reform in 1989. Under this reform restructuring
of primary and lower secondary into a 9-year basic education cycle will be completed in 1997/98.
The single national examination at the end of grade 6 will be replaced by school-based exams and
regional assessment in 1994/95. A national exam will be introduced at the end of grade 9 to
determine tr%knsition from basic to secondary education (grades 10-13).
6. During the 8th and 9th (1993-2002) National Plans, lower-basic enrollments are expected to
stabilize while upper-basic and secondary enrollments will increase from 40% to over 60% of the
relevant age group. Increased demand for upper-basic and secondary school enrollments (projected
annual growth rate is on average 6% over 1993-2002) will require the creation of about 180,000 new
pupil-places from 1995 to 2001. The human and financial resource needs to meet these quantitative
and qualitative challenges will remain considerable over the next decade, if Tunisia is to provide the
increasingly skilled and educated labor force needed for an expanding economy. Budgetary
constraints over the coming years will require more emphasis on efficiency and quality as well as
greater private sector involvement.
7. Faced with these challenges, the Government's education reform objectives are to insure
alignment between educational and community values and to increase and broaden young people's
human capital to enable their full participation in Tunisia's economic development. To that end, the



2
reform program includes measures to: (i) reduce repetition and increase retention rates; (ii) improve
transition rates between levels without lowering standards of educational quality and regulate pupil
flows in line with affordability and sustainability; (iii) restructure curricula at all levels and improve
teacher training and pupil orientation and selection procedures; (iv) formulate new attainment targets
and develop national assessment instument; and (v) encourage the development of private education
within a regulatory famework. The Law on education reform adopted in 1991 and its
implementation decrees elaborate these measures.
B. Tunisia is favorably placed to continue this ambitious reform program, since population growth
has slowed down and the country's economic prospects look bright. A recently completed Bank-
financed sector study on post-basic education and training endorsed the Government's overall
strategy. The study concluded that it was budgetarily possible to significantly reduce grade 1-6
dropout rates nd increase grade 6 to 7 transition rates to about 70% by 2000. Ibe study
recommended that secondary general education expansion should go hand-in-hand with improved
efficiencv at that level and with promotion of private basic and secondary education; and that
coordination between secondary and higher education and vocational training should be improved.
9.  Project OhieeLv . This project (total cost US$184.3 million equivalent) would continue to
assist the Government in (i) implementing its basic and secondary education reform program aimed at
improved quality and efficiency; and (ii) increasing access to accommodate the projected increase in
upper-basic and secondary school enrollments. The project would be executed over five years by the
Ministry of Education and Sciences (MES).
10. nrpJect Racdp&id. The first component (total base cost US$7.3 million equivalent) would
improve the quality and efficiency of educational delivery mechanisms by:
(1A) strengthening the education performance evaluation and assessment capacity of the central and
provincial MES evaluation services and of the National Institute of Education Sciences (INSE)
in charge of pedagogic research and technical advice through the provision of local and
overseas training and equipment;
(1B) promoting more effective teaching and training practices for about 26,000 teachers, pedagogic
and orientation counsellors and inspectors at school, provincial and central levels through the
provision of local and overseas training and technical assistance; and
(1C) strengthening the central and provincial MES administrative and planning services to improve
the information and feedback mechanisms between decision-making levels through the provision
of technical assistance and MIS equipment.
11. 'Me second component (total base cost US$151.9 million equivalent) would improve access by
financing:
(2A) the construction of about 30 upper-basic and 44 secondary schools in under-served areas;
(2B) the rehabilitation of upper-basic and secondary schools in areas where these are mostly needed
and the establishment of a preventive school maintenance system; and
(2C) instructional equipment and related training and technical assistance for about 380 upper-basic
and secondary schools, and institutional support to the National Institute for Office and
Computer Sciences (INBMI) and the National School Equipment Mantance Center (CNM).

12. Smma_ry of Project Cots. Totil project costs are estimated at US$184.3 million equivalent
including contingencies amounting to US$25.0 million or 16% of total base costs (US$159.3 million
at May 1994 prices). About US$98.3 million equivalent is in foreign exchange (53% of total project
costs). Project financing would consist of a Government contribution of US$86.0 mi1lion equivalent
for local cost and a Bank Loan of about US$98.3 million equivalent. Taxes have been estimated at
about US$2.6 million equivalent. Project costs and the financing plan are shown in schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Tunisia are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
13. Project Manafement and Implemntmation. The Project would be implemented by
existing line institutions of the MES. A Project Management Unit (PMU) would be established in
MES' Building and Equipment Department, which would be responsible for the management and
coordination of all project activities. A Management Committr,. will be created in the PMU which
will include representatives from every executing agency and -.. nie staff whose number,
qualification and experience will be satisfactory tr 'he Bank.
14. Impac Indicators. To permit the monitoring and evaluation of project activities, the
Government has developed a list of impact indicators, in coordination with the Bank, and will
provide the baseline and target values necessary for their monitoring.
15. Project Sustainbilitv. The annual incremental expenditures of the project will amount to
less than 1 % of MES recurrent budget for 1992-93, which is expected to remain at its current level
over the 8th and 9th Plans. The strengthening of the CNM will help sustain project investments.
The reinforcement of monitoring and evaluation practices at central and Governorate levels will also
contribute to a more flexible and effective system.
16. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. The Education and Training
Sector Project (ETSP; Ln. 3054-TUN) supports the reform of lower basic education and also
strengthens public vocational training. The Employment and Training Fund Project (Ln. 3255-TUN),
under the Ministry of Vocational Training and Employment, promotes labor mobility by developing
regional intermediation mechanisms for employment and skills training. The latter project has had
difficulties with timeliness of audits which are currendy being resolved. The Higher Education
Restructuring Project (Ln. 3456-TUN) assists the Government in making the system more responsive
to the country's needs and more cost-effective through creating Higher Instiutes of Technology
distinct from universities; providing incentives to universities to enhance quality and increase intemal
efficiency; and strengthening higher education managerial and planning capacities. Tese projects are
generally well implemented and are expected to achieve their objectives. Lessons learned are that
successful implementation depends on adequate provision of staff and recurrent budgets for project-
supported institutions and the PMU. In addition, all project implementation entities should have clear
responsibilities and accountability and an adequate capacity for monitoring and evaluation. These
issues have been addressed in the design of the Secondary Education Support Project.
17. Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's human resource sector lending strategy
in Tunisia, as indicated in the Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. P-6006-TUN of April 16,
1993), supports the Government education reform program. The proposed project would implement
policy recommendations resulting from ongoing pedagogic research and technical assistance under the
ETSP and the Bank's sector study. Although many other donors are providing assistance for
vocational training and higher education, no other external agency is supporting systemic change in
basic and general secondary education in Tunisia. Delaying investment in secondary education would



4
only result in higher medium-term costs of vocational education and adult retraining. The proposed
project has strong support among education decision-makers and is an ingral part of the
Government's sector development plans.
18. Azed Actions. The following was agreed: (i) In order to assure a timely start-up of
projeet implementation activities, the Government will submit to the Bank for its review and approval:
(A) not later than June 30, 1995: (a) the proposal evaluations and evaluation reports for the
consultants' services required to carry out subcomponents IA and 1C of the project; and (b) proposed
awards for 2 bids for the supply of instructional materials required under subcomponent 2C of the
project; and (B) not later than September 30, 1995, the report on the evaluation an4 comparison of
bids for proposed awards for 3 bids for construction of civil works required for the schools under
subcomponent 2A of the project; (ii) the Government shall take all necessay measures to ensure the
provision, beginning with the FY95 budget and for each following FY budget until project
completion: (A) to the MES, of the necessary budgetary resources required to maintain an adequate
level of the MES's annual recurrent and investment budget for basic education; and (B) to th- CNM,
the INBMI, the INSE and the PMU, of the fnds necessary to allow them to suitably meet each of
their recurrent and investment budget costs for the project; (iii) the PMU shall be maintained
throughout the period of project implementation under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and
provided v ith staff, financial and physical resources adequate to carry out its responsibilities; (iv) the
Government shall define to the satisfaction of the Bank: (A) not later than December 31, 1994, the
Baseline Values necessary for the application of five (5) of the Impact Indicators; (B) not later than
December 31, 1995, the Baseline Values necessary for the application of four (4) additional Impact
Indicators; (C) the Baseline Values necessary for the application of eight (8) further Impact Indicators
upon the completion of the studies necessary therefor; and (D) not later than December 31, 1996, the
Target Values necessary for the application of nineteen (19) of the Impact Indicators; (v) the
Government will select sites for the constuction of schools under the subcomponent 2A, and basic
education schools and secondary education schools to be rehabilitated under subcomponent 2B, so as
to locate and rehabilitate schools where: (a) the projected need of additional pupil-places is the
highest; and/or (b) the overall and female enrollment rates are the lowest. Furthermore, the
Government will take all measures necessary to ensure that the basic education schools and secondary
education s&ebols located in these areas are provided with adequate boarding facilities. The following
would be a condition of Loan Effectiveness: the PMU will have been established and operational
with management structure, staffing, objectives and responsibilities as agreed during negotiations.
19. Ennironmmetal Consiations. This is a category C project. School design and construction
will provide adequate water supply, sanitary facilities and waste collection; disposal of construction
waste; and safety standards. Environmental topics would be included in the curricula, guidelines for
teachers and instructors on how to include environmental topics in their teaching would be developed
and enviromnentally safe equipment purchased.
20. Project Obiective Cat"tozies. The project will have a significant impact on poverty
alleviation through quality improvements, reduction of inequities in the delivery of educational
services, and improved access to secondary education. This project would improve school completion
rates, access, and academic performance of poor children. School sites for construction would be
selected according to indicators of national and regional educational needs, taking into account
available gender and poverty assessment data. Regional education management would also be made
more aware of gender and poverty considerations through training and technical assistance.

21. ftPjeet BeI!. The project would assist the Government in maintaining the momentum of
the ongoing education reform. 48,000 new pupil places in upper-basic and secondary education
would be created over the project life. New pedagogic inputs (in line with the revised cutrricula),
improved management at central, regional and school levels, and in-service training for about 26,000
teachers and staff would benefit more than 700,000 school children. Higher retention and transition
rates would improve the system's overall efficiency, and produce more graduates with better general
cognitive skills adapted to the needs of the economy. The Govemment would be able to establish
clear benchmarks for educational performance and output through improved evaluation and assessment
capacity of the MES and INSE, which would lead to more efficient resource utilization and better
planning. Finally, the project would result In lower adult illiteracy and reduce the need to develop
costly vocational training capacity for school dropouts.
22. Prolect Risks. The main risk lies in the traditional reluctance of parents, teachers and staff to
change their perception, working habits and skills. This risk has been minimized by extensive
information and feedback to and from various national organizations (unions, employer federations,
parents and teachers associations), that has resulted in broad ownership and a national consensus on
education policy. Secondly, investments will only have their desired effects if the system is
structured to implement the reform's objectives broadly and deeply. New training practices,
allocation of additional budgetary resources, continuous consultation of all stake-holders, and
incentives for teachers and inspectors to acquire and use new practices, are measures the Government
has taken to rally all parts of the system around the reform goals. Thirdly, secondary and higher
education expansion should not divert the Government's attention from the lower levels. A
continuous effort is required to improve basic education school retention rates. To help mitigate these
risks, agreement was reached on education policy targets and sector performance (impact) indicators.
23. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Pink and recommend that the Execudve Directors approve it.
