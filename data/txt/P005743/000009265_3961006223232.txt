REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
SECONDARY EDUCATION SUPPORT PROTECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:   Republic of Tunisia
Beneficiary: The Ministry of Education and Sciences (MES)
Amount:    US$98.3 million equivalent
Terms:       Seventeen Years, including a five-year grace period, at the IBRD standard variable
interest rate.
Project Objectives.
This project would continue to assist the Government in (i) implementing its basic and
secondary education reform program aimed at achieving improved quality and efficiency; and (ii)
improving access to accommodate the projected increase in upper-basic and secondary school
enrollments. The project would be executed over 5 years by the Ministry of Education and
Sciences (MES). The Secondary Education Support Project (total cost US$184.3 million
equivalent) will finance technical assistance, training, equipment, construction and rehabilitation.
Proiect Description.
The first component (total base cost US$7.3 million equivalent) would help the MES to
improve educational delivery mechanisms by financing the implementation of the following quality-
and efficiency-related measures:
(1A)   strengthening the education performance evaluation and assessment system by
financing institutional support for central and provincial MES evaluation services and
for the National Institute of Education Sciences' (INSE) (US$1.6 million);
(iB)   promoting more effective teaching and training practices for about 26,000 teachers,
pedagogic and orientation counsellors and inspectors at school, provincial and central
levels (US$4.5 million);
(1C)   strengthening the central and provincial MES administration and planning services to
improve the existing information and feedback mechanisms between the different
decision-making levels (US$1.2 million).
The second component (total base cost US$151.9 million equivalent) would provide support
for improved access by financing:
(2A)   the construction of about 30 upper-basic and 44 secondary schools (of which 6 with
boarding facilities) in under-served areas (US$102 million);
I/  The INSE is responsible for providing technical guidance and services to the MES management and decision makers. It is a public
institution under responsibility of the MES. Its tasks include (i) executing pedagogic research and specific studies at the request of
MES; and (ii) development of tools to promote assessment and evaluation of educational performance.



v
(2B)   rehabilitation of upper-basic and secondary schools in provinces and areas where these
are mostly needed and the establishment of a preventive school maintenance system
(US$12 million);
(2C)   provision of instructional equipment for about 380 upper-basic and secondary schools,
training and technical assistance for its proper use, and institutional support for the
National School Equipment Maintenance Center2 (CNM) (US$37.9 million).
Project Benefits.
The project's major benefit would be to assist the Government maintaining the momentum of
the ongoing education reform. Project-financed school construction would create 48,000 new pupil
places in upper-basic and secondary education over the project life (out of the total of 180,000
needed). New pedagogic inputs (in line with the revised curricula), support for improved
management at central, regional and school levels and inservice training for about 26,000 teachers
and staff would benefit more than 700,000 grade 7-13 school children. Higher retention and
transition rates would improve the system's overall efficiency. The Government would be able to
establish clear benchmarks for educational performance and output through improved evaluative
and assessment capacity of the MES and INSE, which would lead to more efficient resource
utilization and better planning. Finally, it will also result in lower adult illiteracy and avoid the
need to develop more costly VT capacity for school dropouts. Continued growth of private
education at secondary and higher education levels would further help to achieve sustainable
fimancial sector development.
Project Risks.
The project's main risk lies in the traditional reluctance of teachers and staff to change their
working habits and skills. Teacher, parents and education managers alike have attitudes formed by
the present system, which emphasizes success through strict selection. This risk has been
minimized by the use of extensive and effective information feedback including various national
organizations (unions, employer federations, parent and teacher associations), that has resulted in a
national consensus about education policy. Secondly, Tunisian and Bank investments will only
have their desired effects if the system is structured to implement the reform's objectives broadly
and deeply. Broad ownership increases the chances of success. New training practices, allocation
of additional budgetary resources, continuous consultation of all stake holders, incentives for
teachers and inspectors to acquire and use new practices and knowledge are measures the
Government has taken to align all parts of the education system around the reform goals. Thirdly,
secondary and higher education expansion should not divert the Government's attention from the
problems at lower levels. This includes a continuous effort to improve basic education school
retention rates, based on the results of studies financed under this project. To help mitigate these
risks, agreement was reached on education policy targets and sector performance (impact)
indicators and their baselines. Moreover, this project follows a sector loan dedicated to basic
education.
2/  The 'Centre National de Maintenance' is reaponsible for distribution and maintenance of pedagogic equipment. It also trains
technicians and laboratory assitants for econdary schools. The CNM has 6 regional 'antennas' distributed over the country.

resources development and prudent macro economic policies. Over the 1986-93 period the
Government confronted the issue of economic inefficiency by a policy of restraining demand,
devaluation of the dinar and other improvements in macroeconomic imbalances. The reforms have
improved the socio-economic environment dismantled numerous constraints on private initiatives.
The Government's ongoing social reform program includes a deep and broad education reform,
which the Bank has been supporting under the July 1991 Education reform Law.
2. At the same time, the Government has maintained support to its major social objectives.
Poverty reduction, social development, family planning programs and education reform have
received continuous funding. Between 1965-90, infant mortality decreased from 160 to 52 per
thousand, life expectancy at birth rose from 48 to 67 years (for female), The population grew from
5.6 million in 1975 to over 8 million in 1992, while population growth declined from 2.5% in
1985 to 2.0% in 1993. The Government's active family planning policy, supported by the Bank,
contributed to a decline in total fertility from an average of 7 to 3.5 children per woman over the
1960-89 period. Today, almost all 6 year old enrol in school. The net school enrolment ratio
among 6-14 year olds rose from 60% in 1976 to 90% and adult literacy rates increased from 15%
to 62 %.
3. The Government's human and financial resource needs to sustain these social reform efforts
will remain considerable over the next decade, if Tunisia is to meet the challenge of a rapidly
changing economy which will need a highly skilled and well educated labor force. Expected
budgetary constraints over the coming years will require more emphasis on efficiency and quality
through reallocation of available resources. At the same time, continued growing demand for
education and training (in part as the result of more efficient pupil flows and the introduction of 9
years of basic education' currently being implemented), combined with an acute shortage of
physical capacity in post-basic education and training facilities, will pressure the Government to
allocate additional resources to the sector and to use available resources more efficiently.
Education and Training Sector Presentation and Lssues
4. Enrollment. Tunisia has achieved a level of school enrollment that compares favorably with
similar countries. Universal primary school enrollment is close to being achieved (net enrollment
ratio is 90%). In 1993/94, about 1.5 million children were enrolled in public lower-basic
education (grades 1-6), about 383,000 in public upper-basic and 293,000 in public secondary
general education. While education remains mainly public (99% of primary education pupils, and
82 % of secondary pupils), private education for boththe basic and secondary education is growing
and already enrols 80,000 pupils (70,000 in grades 7-13 representing 12% of total enrollments at
I/    In Tunisia, basic education is divided into a lower basic education cycle of 6 years (which replacea the traditional prinary education
cycle), followed by an upper basic education cycle of 9 years (which replaces the 3 years of lower secondary education). The
introduction of 9 years of basic education started in 1989/90 and will be completed in 1997/98.

secondary level) and average private education growth rates (9 % over 1987-93) have outstripped
those of public education and are expected to grow even faster in the 1990s. The private sector is
also present in pre-schools where 45 % of funding is ensured by municipalities and other private
sources. Public higher education had registered 96,000 students in 1993/94. The vocational
training system (pre-employment training) included 42,000 students in 1992/93, of which almost
18,000 students in private institutions.
5. During the 8th (1993-97) and 9th (1998-2002) National Plans lower-basic enrollments are
expected to stabilize while upper-basic and secondary enrollments would increase from 40% of the
relevant age group (1992/93) to over 60% of the relevant age group in 2001/2002. Although, the
net enrollment rate among 6-14 year olds has increased from 76% in 1984 to 88% in 1990,
significant differences remain between rural and urban areas (80% and 95% respectively) and
between boys and girls (92 % and 82 % respectively). School retention rates for the 6-13 year age
group have drastically improved (from 33% in the early 80s to 85% in 1993-94). The
Government is committed to improve the school retention rates further under the National
Solidarity Program, notably among children in gouvernorats and regions which are lagging behind.
However, maintaining and improving school attendance among the most marginalized groups of
children in underprivileged and dispersed rural and peri-urban communities is becoming
increasingly difficult and costly for the Government. The 1992 exam pass rate2 from grade 6 to 7
was around 58% (compared to 32% in 1986), and baccalaureate pass rate at the end of grade 13
was 41 %. Completion rates still need to be improved, notably in basic education (around 37% of
grade 1 entrants did not stay in school until the end of grade 6 in 1992/93) and a significant
number of these children risk a relapse into illiteracy.
6. Education Reform. Restructuring of primary and lower secondary into 9-year basic
education cycle has been underway since 1989 and will be completed in 1997/98. The single
national examination at the end of grade 6 will be replaced by school-based exams under
gouvemorat control and regional assessment in 1994/95. Pupil transition rates from grade 6 to
grade 7 are allowed to increase from 45 % (in 1986) to 65 % in 1995 and 70% by the year 2000
(reached 58% in 1993/94). A national exam will be introduced at the end of grade 9 to determine
transition from basic to secondary school. Secondary education is being redefined as grades 10-13.
The 4-year secondary curricula structure introduced in 1991/92 is being simplified with
specialization occurring only in grades 12 and 13 and specializations reduced to 5 new curricula
options3 more in line with modern economic trends. Textbooks and teacher guides for basic and
secondary education levels are adapted to the new curricula as they are being introduced. Pupil
textbook coverage is adequate and regularly evaluated by the Ministry of Education and Sciences
(MES). Pre-and inservice teacher training for basic and secondary education are being improved
(quality and practical content) and adapted to the new reformed system with more emphasis on
practical teaching experience. Finally, under the reform, secondary technical and vocational
education (grades 7-12) have been phased out in 1991/92 and more pupils are channelled to remain
in upper-basic and secondary general education. The vocationalised secondary technical schools
have been integrated into the vocational training network or transformed into general secondary schools.
2/  In 1994/95, the national exam at the end of grade 6 will be replaced by regional testing to regulate entry into grade 7. A new
national basic education completion exam will be introduced in 1997/98 at the end of grade 9.
3/  These five options are: humanities, economics and management, mathematics, experimental sciences, and technical sciences. The
implementation decree 92-1182 of the 1991 Law defines the percentage of slots open in each stream in order to diversify the
country's human capital base and to channel students' into more economically marketable fields. The decree also redefines the
weighta for each subject in the examinations.

7. Financinig Efriciency and Sustainability. Strict regulation of student numbers and control of
costs assures Tunisia a relatively balanced sector development. Tunisia allocates 6.3% of GDP to
its education sector, which is considerably higher than that of countries with comparable per capita
GDP. The share of education in the national budget reached 22.1 % in 1993, reflecting the
priority given to this sector. The Ministry of Education and Sciences (MES) spends more than
45% of its budget on basic (grade 1-9) and about 25% on general secondary education (grade 10-
13). During the 1980/90 period, the largest share of public recurrent expenditure went to the
education and training sector, accounting for 27% of total government recurrent budget. Although
parents do not pay tuition fees, they make a significant contribution in the form of school books
and materials, uniforms, transportation and after-school remedial instruction. While the number of
grade 1-6 pupils grew by almost 25 % over the period 1982-1992, the recurrent primary education
budget increased by only 4% (in real terms). Given the budget constraints and the growing
demand for education at upper-basic (grades 7-9) and secondary (grades 10-13) levels, the
government will be hard pressed to (i) improve efficiency of resource utilization in the public
system; (ii) promote private education development; and (iii) consider the introduction of cost-
recovery mechanisms at the higher end of the education and training pyramid. The ongoing
reform is focusing on measures regarding the first two issues. The introduction of cost-recovery
measures at higher education levels, however, may prove more difficult given the political and
social situation in the Maghreb.
8.  Secondary Education4. As mentioned above, public investment in basic education,
population growth, and improved retention rates due to better quality and efficiency in the lower
levels of the education pyramid and the commitment of the Government to develop its human
resources have resulted in a high demand for upper-basic and secondary education. The increased
demand for upper-basic and secondary school enrollments (projected annual growth rate is on
average 6% over 1993-2002) will require the creation of about 180,000 new pupil-places from
1995 to 2001 and will put pressure on both the recurrent and investment education budgets. At the
same time, the secondary education system will incorporate the new orientations set out by the
Education Law of July 1991.
9. Curricula and Pre- and In-Service Teacher Training. National teachers' unions,
parents' associations and teachers and inspectors at all grade levels and in all subjects have
participated in the drafting of the applications of the 1991 education reform Law and have received
drafts of revised curricula for comment. This process (i) ensured a broad ownership and
acceptance of the reform law and new curricula among education community members, and (ii)
gave teachers and inspectors initial familiarity with all aspects of the reform. Although
quantitative teacher supply capacity in basic and secondary education is adequate (except for french
language and history teachers, where shortages are expected during the 9th Plan period), teachers'
instruction methods and quality still need to be improved. Pre-service teacher training programs
are being revised to reflect the new curriculum requirements and make preservice training more
practical, geared to classroom realities and providing opportunities to apply knowledge newly
acquired. Practicing teachers and inspectors are receiving inservice training in implementation of
the new curricula. There also is feedback on the effectiveness of the retraining through the
inspectors' evaluations of teachers' practices, analyses of inspectors' annual reports by the MES's
Department of Inspection, and through evaluations by the National Institute of Education Sciences
(INSE).

analysis of underlying strengths and problems in the Tunisian secondary education and training system.

10.  Assessment and Manaeement. The feedback and evaluation mechanisms need to be better
developed to monitor the reform's outcomes. As retention and transition rates increase, the system
will move from a selective to a mass system. To make this shift without sacrificing standards of
educational quality is a challenge confronted by many countries. Systematic diagnostic testing and
alternative teaching strategies to act on the results of assessment are critical for maintaining quality
and are now lacking. Management is highly centralized, school headmasters and regional
education directors have little decision-making power. The results are a ministry of education
overburdened with management detail, when it should be freer to focus on guiding and adapting
the system. Curricula reform (especially the new specialized options in grades 12 and 13) requires
different laboratory equipment and pedagogic materials, not just in schools, but also for the teacher
training centers.
11.  Selection and Certification. The low baccalaureate exam pass rate (40% over the last five
years), which is used to limit growth in higher education produces an increasing number of failed
students without a secondary diploma. Entrants into the various university disciplines and
establishments are oriented on the basis of the baccalaureat exam. This inefficient and costly link
between student certification and selection in higher education, which is typical for all Maghreb
countries with education models similar to the traditional French system, is driven by the need to
maintain academic standards for university entry, and is source of wasted human and financial
public capital.
12.  Secondary OutDut. The number of secondary school graduates (about 23,000 in 1993)
has been increasing at an average of 8% p.a. over the last four years and will reach 40,000 by the
year 2000 compared to an estimated annual recurrent budget growth of only 4% between 1980-90
growth of enrollment in higher education and pressure on public resources which make
improvements in resource management, allocation of additional resources and introduction of cost-
recovery measures unavoidable.
13.  Hither Education. Technical and managerial skills are key inputs for the development
of new productive activities, particularly in the private sector. Higher education should also
become a powerful instrument for promoting regional integration through common research and
training programs and increased mobility of highly qualified workers. Consequently, the
Government is in the process of (i) restructuring higher education; (ii) reforming programs to
increase internal efficiency and occupational relevance; and (iii) increasing the share of higher
education enrollment in the 20-24 year old group from the current 8.5% to 14% by the year 2000
(an average anticipated annual enrollment growth rate of 7.8%). The Government expects that this
will promote social mobility and women participation. During the 1990s, the government will need
to address the following issues in higher education: (i) how to become more cost-effective and
create adequate facilities for a growing number of university students with limited public
resources; (ii) how to reduce the imbalance between higher education output and labor market
needs; and (iii) how to improve the overcentralized management in higher education. The
introduction of cost-recovery measures in public universities and promotion of private higher
education should become one of the government's priorities for the next decade.



5
Emplovment and Labor Market
14. A major concern to the Government is the continuing high level of unemployment (around
overall 14% for men and 22% for women; and 29% among youth in the 18-24 age group) despite
significant decreases in the price of labor. Even though labor force growth is slowing down (from
3.1 % over 1975-84 to 2.6% annually over 1985-91), it still outstrips the population growth. This
leads to a growing unemployment problem. Most longer term unemployed have a relatively low
level of education (over 60% have less than 9 years of education; and the 1989 overall illiteracy
rate was estimated at 37% -- 48 % among women and 26% among men). Over the next ten years
special attention should be paid to providing more efficient pre-employment training and to
facilitating youth labor market insertion in particular women (with increasing private sector
participation). In addition both the capacity and the quality of on-the-job training networks need to
be improved.
15.  The public sector accounts for only 20% of annual job creation and this share is decreasing.
Only 1.8% of total number of jobs created in 1989 were in agriculture; while 37% were in private
industry; and 41 % in the private services sector. This indicates that the public post-basic education
and training sector, which continues to train students for civil services positions, will need to
undergo major changes before the year 2000. Removing the rigidity of the labor regulatory system
and promoting labor mobility should also be one of the Government's priorities. The Tunisian
industry and services sectors have a relatively low percentage of qualified professionals in middle
and higher management levels (5.6% against an average of about 15% in industrialized countries).
As a result there are severe shortages of middle and higher level technical and management
specialists. Improved upper-basic and secondary general education is only a first step in the right
direction.
Strategy for Sector Investment
16. Government Strategy. Tunisia is favorably placed to continue its ambitious reform;
population growth has slowed down and the country's economic prospects look bright. The
education reform's broad objectives are to (i) insure alignment between educational and community
values; and (ii) increase and broaden young people's human capital, supporting both Tunisia's
continued economic development and young people's ability to participate in that development. To
achieve these objectives, the reform, (which the Bank supports), includes measures to: (i) reduce
repetition and increase retention rates within levels; (ii) improve transition rates between levels
without lowering standards of educational quality and regulate and control pupil flows in line with
affordability and sustainable economic development, (iii) restructure curricula at all levels, improve
teacher training and pupil orientation and selection procedures, (iv) formulate new attainment
targets and develop national assessment instruments, and (v) improve vocational training
efficiency. The Law on education reform (adopted on July 29, 1991) and its implementation
decrees elaborate these measures. The Bank's sector study shows that it is budgetarily possible to
significantly reduce grade 1-6 dropout rates and increase grade 6 to 7 transition rates (to about
70% instead of 65% by 2000). This requires increased capacity at upper-basic and secondary
levels.

17.  Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's human resource sector lending strategy
in Tunisia5 supports the Government's reform program. The Education and Training Sector
Project (ETSP; Ln. 3054-TUN) supports reform of lower basic education. ETSP also includes a
US$15 million component for the training sector, aiming to reinforce the network of sectoral
training centers by adapting existing secondary technical schools. In addition, the project finances
training and technical assistance to strengthen the institutional management capacity in public
vocational training. The ETSP will end in 1995 while reforms in upper-basic and secondary
education are still being implemented. Implementation of the sector project has been very
successful and achieved most of its objectives. The Employment and Training Fund Project (Ln.
3255-TUN) assists the Government in improving labor mobility by developing regional-based
intermediation mechanisms for employment and skills training through (i) facilitating job placement
for the unemployed and improving productivity at the workplace by providing systematic in-
company training; and (ii) strengthening key services to enterprises. The Higher Education
Restructuring Project (Ln. 3456-TUN) aims to assist the Government in making the higher
education system more responsive to the country's needs and become more cost effective through:
(a) creating Higher Institutes of Technology distinct from universities, geared toward labor market
needs; (b) providing incentives to Universities to revise curricula to enhance the quality of teaching
and learning and increase the relevance of teacher training programs and increase internal
efficiency; and (c) strengthening managerial and planning capacities. A recently completed Bank-
financed sector study on post-basic education and training strategy concluded that: (1) the
Government should continue to give adequate priority to improved internal efficiency (better
completion rates) in basic education; (2) secondary general education expansion should go hand-in-
hand with improved efficiency at that level and promotion of private basic and secondary
education; and (3) there should be improved coordination between secondary and higher education
and vocational training policies.
18. The proposed project builds on this and will implement policy recommendations resulting
from ongoing pedagogic research and technical assistance under ETSP and the Bank's sector study.
This project would result in better retention and completion at the upper-basic and secondary levels
and produce more graduates with better general cognitive skills adapted to fields needed in an
increasingly competitive economy. Although many other donors are providing substantial ad hoc
assistance for vocational training and higher education, no other external agency is supporting
systemic change in basic and general secondary education in Tunisia. Delaying investment in the
secondary education reform will tend to produce higher medium-term costs of vocational education
and adult retraining. Over the coming years the Bank's strategy also needs to assist the
Government in (i) promoting cost-sharing arrangements with and participation of local industries in
vocational training, both for pre-employment and on-the-job training; (ii) supporting expansion of
the private post-secondary vocational training capacity (specific job training courses of max. 2 or 3
years duration), thus providing alternative incentives for academic university education; and (iii)
improving the Government's programs for job creation and labor market insertion.
19.  Lessons Learned. The MES has been fully involved in project preparations and has
demonstrated serious commitment and ownership. As a result, the proposed project has strong
support among education decision makers and fits well into the Government's sector development
plans. Lessons learned indicate that successful implementation depends on adequate provision of
staff (in terms of skills, work experience and availability) and recurrent budgets for project-

supported institutions and the PMU. In addition, all project implementation entities should have
clear responsibilities and accountability and an adequate evaluative capacity.
II THE PROJECT
20.   Project Objectives. This project would continue to assist the Government in (i)
implementing its basic and secondary education reform program aimed at achieving improved
quality and efficiency; and (ii) improving access to accommodate the projected increase in upper-
basic and secondary school enrollments. The project would be executed over 5 years by the
Ministry of Education and Sciences (MES). The Secondary Education Support Project (total cost
US$184.3 million equivalent) will finance technical assistance, training, equipment, construction
and rehabilitation.
21.   Project Description. The first component (total base cost US$7.3 million equivalent) would
help the MES to improve educational delivery mechanisms by financing the implementation of the
following quality- and efficiency-related measures:
(1A)  strengthening the education performance evaluation and assessment system by financing
institutional support for central and provincial MES evaluation services and for the
National Institute of Education Sciences6 (INSE) (US$1.6 million) through the provision
of:
- local and overseas training in assessment for (i) INSE researchers, (ii) inspectors and
pedagogical counselors, and (iii) MES selected staff;
- overseas training in pedagogical research for INSE researchers;
- technical assistance to (i) prepare and supervise the training program, (ii) assist the
INSE in establishing a national assessment system, and (iii) assist the INSE in its
program of pedagogical research;
- equipment for the INSE (computers, printers, software);
- documentation center for the INSE (rehabilitation of an existing building, books and
periodicals, computer network).
(1B)  promoting more effective teaching and training practices for about 26,000 teachers,
pedagogic and orientation counsellors and inspectors at school, provincial and central
levels (US$4.5 million) through the provision of:
- local and overseas training in assessment techniques, alternatives teaching and
education management strategies for about (i) 300 inspectors and pedagogical counselors,
(ii) 100 MES management staff at the regional and central level, (iii) 700 school
directors, and (iv) 25,000 teachers.
6/ The INSE is responsible for providing technical guidance and services to the MES management and decision makers. It is a public
institution under responsibility of the MES. Its tasks include (i) executing pedagogic research and specific studies at the request of MES;
and (ii) development of tools to promote assessment and evaluation of educational performance.



8
- technical assistance to evaluate the in-service training program.
(1C)  strengthening the central and provincial MES administration and planning services to
improve the existing information and feedback mechanisms between the different
decision-making levels (US$1.2 million) through:
- technical assistance to (i) develop, implement and test a management information
system (MIS) linking lycees, DREs7 and the central MES, (ii) supervise the training
program designed for the MIS users, and (iii) help the MES working committee to be
created under the project to study the basic and secondary education management
system;
- local training for the MIS users (about 200 staff at the central, provincial and school
level);
- study tours for the MES working committee to be created under the project to study
the basic and secondary education management system;
- MIS equipment support (about 200 computers and software for schools, DREs and the
central MES).
22.  The Second Component (total base cost US$151.9 million equivalent) would provide
support for improved access by financing:
(2A)  the construction of about 30 upper-basic and 44 secondary schools in under-served areas
(US$102 million):
- 30 upper-basic schools with a capacity of about 700 students each (criteria for site
selection will be based on indicators related to access in underserved and/or rural areas);
- 44 secondary schools (including 6 with boarding facilities) with a capacity of about 750
students each (criteria for site selection will be based on indicators related to access in
underserved and/or rural areas);
(2B)  rehabilitation of upper-basic and secondary schools in provinces and areas where these
are mostly needed and the establishment of a preventive school maintenance system
(US$12 million):
- rehabilitation of priority upper-basic and secondary schools based on need assessment
as determined by the survey undertaken by the DREs;
- equipment, overseas training (for about 25 staff) and technical assistance to establish a
preventive maintenance system within MES' Direction des Batiments et de
l'Equipement;
(2C) provision of instructional equipment for about 380 upper-basic and secondary schools,
training and technical assistance for its proper use, and institutional support for the
7/ Directions R6gionales de I'Enseignement, i.e. MES provincial office



9
National School Equipment Maintenance Cente? (CNM) (US$37.9 million):
- libraries for 23 CREFOCs9 (about US$30,000 equivalent of books for the 23
CREFOC, subscriptions, local training for documentalists and local technical assistance);
- libraries for about 380 lyc6es (including rehabilitation of existing school libraries,
books for about US$8,000 per lyc6e, local training for documentalists and local technical
assistance);
- institutional support of the INBMI'° to support the generalization of computer
instruction in secondary schools (local and overseas training, technical assistance and
equipment);
- computers and related equipment for about 380 computer labs in secondary schools;
- science equipment to support the implementation of the secondary education new
curriculum (about 260 technical education school laboratories, 50 robotics school labs,
200 physics school labs and 300 biology school labs and pedagogic equipment for 23
CREFOCs;
- institutional support (training, technical assistance and equipment) of the CNM" to
improve the use and maintenance of pedagogical equipment in upper-basic and secondary
schools.
23.   Selection Criteria for Civil Works. The school construction program will support the
separation of upper-basic and secondary school buildings, which is one of the objectives of the
reformn, and will focus on underserved areas. The rehabilitation program will be based on the
results of a comprehensive survey determining the most urgent needs and that was conducted by
the DREs. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would select sites for the
construction of schools under the subcomponent 2A, and basic education schools and secondary
education schools to be rehabilitated under subcomponent 2B, so as to locate and rehabilitate
schools where: (A) the projected need of additional pupil-places is the highest; and/or (B) the
overall and female enrollment rates are the lowest. Furthermore, the Government will take all
measures necessary to ensure that the basic education schools and secondary education schools
located in these areas are provided with adequate boarding facilities.
Sl The 'Centre National de Maintenance' is reaponsible for distribution and maintenance of pedagogic equipment. It also trains technicians
nd laboratory arsistants for secondary schools. The CNM has 6 regional 'antennas' distributed over the country.

m. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
24.    Summary of Project Costs.  Total project costs are estimated at  US$184.3  million
equivalent including contingencies amounting to US$25.0 million or 16% of total base costs
(US$159.3 million). About US$98.3 million equivalent is in foreign exchange (53% of total
project cost). Project financing would consist of a Government contribution of US$86.0 million
equivalent for local cost and a Bank Loan of about US$98.3 million equivalent. The project costs
include construction, site development and professional services for new buildings; rehabilitation of
existing facilities; provision of furniture and equipment; training; technical assistance; incremental
recurrent costs for the project items; and taxes (about US$2.6 million equivalent). Base costs
estimates reflect May 1994 prices. Summaries of project costs by components and by category of
expenditure are given in Tables 1 and 2.

25.  Basis of Cost Estimates.
(a)   Base Costs. Costs for the construction, furniture and pedagogical equipment are based on
average unit costs of recently awarded contracts for similar works. Costs for computers and
software are based on international prices and include installation and user training. The
costs of refurbishing existing facilities are derived from a comprehensive school survey
undertaken at the Gouvernorat level. Costs for specialist services include fees, travel,
accommodation and subsistence and are based on recent consultant contracts. Costs for
overseas training of MES staff include travel, living expenses, and tuition when applicable;
they range from US$5,000 per staff month for study tours to about US$7,000 per staff
months for fellowships. Costs for local training have been estimated at about US$15 per
day per person, which include transportation, subsistence, accommodation and trainer fees.
(b)   Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance for unforeseen
physical variations (US$15.9 million), equal to 10% of the estimated cost of project items.
Price contingencies between negotiations (May 1994) and the end of project implementation
are estimated at US$9.1 million equivalent, or 6% of base cost. Total contingencies
represent 16% of the base cost. The following annual rates of price increases have been
applied: 5.5% every year over the project life for local costs, and 2.0% in 1995, 2.5% in
1996, 2.7% in 1997, 2.5% in 1998, and 2.6% in 1999 for foreign costs.
(c)   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component was estimated as follows:
a. civil works: new constructions: 45%, rehabilitation: 41 %; b. pedagogical material and
furniture: 50%, technical equipment: 100%, and libraries: 90%; c. foreign specialist
services and overseas training: 100%; and d. local training and architectural fees: 0%.
Including contingencies, the resulting foreign exchange component is estimated at US$98.3
million, or about 53 % of total costs.
(d)   Customs Duties and Taxes. Equipment and goods imported directly for use by Government
ministries are exempt from duties and taxes. The rate of local indirect taxes on civil
works is 18% (US$2.6 million equivalent).
26.  Incremental Recurrent Costs. Under the proposed project, additional recurrent costs
would be generated by: (i) the recruitment of teachers and administrative staff for the new schools;
(ii) the recruitment of staff for the building maintenance unit, the Centre National de Maintenance
(CNM) and the INSE documentation center; (iii) subscriptions to specialized publications for the
CREFOCs; and (iv) overhead and operating costs for equipment. The total additional recurrent
base costs generated by these items (including US$46.6 million equivalent in teacher/staff salaries
for newly operational schools financed under this project) during the project implementation period
are estimated at US$49.6 million equivalent, including contingencies. Maximum annual
incremental recurrent base costs generated by the project would be US$10.1 million equivalent,
which represents less than 1 % of MES' recurrent budget in 1992-93.
27. Project Financing. The proposed World Bank loan of US$98.3 million would finance 53%
of total project costs excluding taxes, which would cover 100% of foreign exchange costs. Project
financing would be in accordance with Table 3. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that the Government shall take all necessary measures to ensure that adequate and timely financial
arrangements are in place at all times for the continued and successful operation of the Project,



13
including, without limitation, the provision, beginning with the FY 95 budget and for each
following FY budget until Project completion: (i) to the MES, of the necessary budgetary
resources required to maintain an adequate level of the MES' annual recurrent and investment
budget for basic education; and (ii) to the CNM, the INBMI, the INSE and the PMU, of the funds
necessary to allow them to suitably meet each of their recurrent and investment costs for the
Project.

Management and Implementation.
28.   Overview. The Project's components and sub-components would be implemented by
existing line institutions of the Ministry of Education (MES). A Project Management Unit (PMU)
will be established in MES' Direction des Batiments et de l'Equipement (DBE), which will be
responsible for the overall management and coordination of all project-related activities. A
Management Committee will be created in the PMU which will include representatives from every
executing agency and technical staff whose number, qualification and experience will be
satisfactory to the Bank.   Before Loan Effectiveness, the PMU will have been established in
accordance with draft proposals regarding its management structure, staffing, objectives and
responsibilities as agreed during negotiations, and will be operational.
29.   Project Implementation. The implementation responsibilities under the project are as
follows:
(a)   the strengthening of the education performance evaluation and assessment system would be
implemented by MLES' Direction Gen6rale de la Formation Continue (DGFC) and the
Institut National des Sciences de l'Education (INSE);
(b)   the DGFC would be responsible for the coordination and implementation of all training
activities, with the assistance of the Direction Generale de l'Enseignement Secondaire
(DGES) and executing bodies such as the Centres Regionaux de Formation Continue
(CREFOCs), the Institut Superieur d'Education et de Formation Continue (ISEFC) and the
General Inspectorate, when applicable;



14
(c)  the Direction Gen6rale de la Prospective, de la Statistique et de l'Infonnatique (DPSI) would
be in charge of implementing subcomponent IC (strengthening the central and provincial
MES administration and planning services), with the assistance of executing bodies such as
the 23 Directions R6gionales de l'Enseignement (DRE) and the 380 secondary schools;
(d)  the Direction des Batiments et de l'Equipement (DBE) of the MES, with the assistance of
executing bodies such as the 23 Directions Regionales de l'Enseignement (DRE) and the 23
Directions Regionales du Ministere de l'Equipement et de l'Habitat (MEH), would be
responsible for all civil works activities and for the equipment supply under subcomponent
2C. For the new upper-basic schools, BDE/MES' responsibilities will include review and
approval of individual school designs prepared by local design firms, participation in bid
reviews and award of contracts, while the day-to-day construction monitoring will be carried
out by the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Equipment in each of the 23
Govemorates. For the new secondary schools, DBE/MES will retain direct control over all
phases of design and construction, from architect selection through construction monitoring.
(e)  activities aimed at strengthening the capacity for equipment maintenance would be under the
responsibility of the DBE of the MES;
(f)  the activities related to the strengthening of computer teaching would be coordinated and
implemented by the Institut National de Bureautique et de Micro-Informatique (INBMI).
30. Project Coordination and Management. The PMU's responsibilities regarding project
coordination and management would be as follows:
(a)  overall management and supervision of project activities;
(b)  loan and project accounting;
(e)  bring issues that may arise and which cannot be resolved at the level of theimplementing units
to the immediate attention of MES management and/or the Bank for resolution;
(f) liaise with other concerned Tunisian Government agencies and with World Bank
representatives to ensure satisfactory project administration and supervision;
(g) establish the annual work program that will:
(i)  state expected quantitative and qualitative achievements;
(ii)  include Government financed activities within the annual recurrent budget of the MES,
and;
(iii)  secure available funds for activities financed from the Bank loan;
(h) organize, prepare and execute Annual Project Implementation Reviews (APIR) and Mid-term
Project Implementation Review (MPIR):
(i)  collect annual progress reports from all Project executing agencies not later than
September 15 of each year;



15
(ii)  prepare and submit to the Bank the APIRs and MPIR, based on subcomponent progress
reports, before September 30 of each year; the objective is to assess past achievements,
to present an action plan for the coming year and to (a) analyse costs and financing for
the preceding year and (b) submit detailed budgets for the coming year;
(iii)  before December 31 of each year, prepare final APIR and MPIR reports based on the
joint review observations and conclusions and submit these reports to the MES and the
Bank.
31. The cost of the PMU during the project life is estimated at US$0.2 million equivalent. This
includes technical equipment, consulting services and overheads. The following activities would be
financed under the project:
(i)  regular visits by PMU staff to supervise field activities;
(ii)  training and trips related to project management and supervision for the PMU director;
(iii)  technical equipment necessary for effective project management (computers, software,
office equipment and stationery);

The PMU staff would assist the PMU director in the execution of his duties.
33. Procurement. The project elements and their estimated costs, and the procurement
arrangements for the components to be financed by the Bank are summarized in Table 4.
Recurrent and other costs financed entirely by the Government are shown under N.B.F. (non Bank
financed). All goods works and services to be financed from the Bank loan proceeds would be
procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines - Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits (May 1992), following the standard bidding documents (for goods and works contracts).

34. Equipment and Materials. Equipment to be financed under the project include office and
educational equipment, furniture, desktop computers, books and resource materials, and vehicles.
To the extent practicable, these items would be grouped into major packages of goods, the contents
of which could typically be provided by one supplier. Contracts for equipment and materials
estimated to cost more than US$350,000 equivalent each will be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB). In comparison of bids for equipment procured through ICB, domestic
manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%, or the existing customs duty,
whichever is lower over the c.i.f. (cost insurance freight) prices of competing imports. Contracts
for goods costing between US$100,000 and US$350,000, up to an aggregate of US$4.7 million,
will be procured through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). Contracts for goods costing less
than US$ 100,000 equivalent each, up to an aggregate of US$4.1 million, may be awarded through
local shopping procedures, on the basis of three price quotations from suppliers. Furniture for
the INSE documentation center and for schools, as well as pedagogical equipment may be procured
through local competitive bidding (LCB). Contracts for goods which the Bank agrees are of a
proprietary nature (US$4.8 million aggregate) such as computer software'2 and books and reference
materials may be awarded through direct contracting after negotiations with proprietors or
publishers, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. In order to assure a timely
start-up of project implementation activities, it was agreed during negotiations that the Government
will submit to the Bank for its review and approval proposed awards for 2 bids for the supply of
instructional materials required under subcomponent 2C of the project no later than June 30 1995.
35. Civil Works. Works under the project consist of: (a) construction of about 30 upper basic
schools and of about 44 secondary schools (including 6 with boarding facilities) in underserved
areas; (b) urgent repairs of existing secondary schools; and (c) rehabilitation and restructuring of
an existing building for INSE's documentation center. Works contracts are of small value (from
121   Computer software for education is very specific in nature (school management, teacher training assistance and pupil orientation and
selection).



17
US$0.9 to US$2.1 million per site for schools, US$10,000 and US$25,000 for school repair, and
about US$0.2 million for the documentation center) and are widely dispersed geographically. The
local construction industry is well developed, has high standards of quality of workmanship, and is
cost-competitive. Therefore, these contracts are not expected to attract foreign contractors, as
demonstrated under the Loan 3054-TUN, and would be awarded through LCB among qualified
contractors, in accordance with procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. Nevertheless,
interested foreign contractors will not be precluded from participating in the construction bids.
The MES has been responsible for the implementation of many school building and rehabilitation
contracts under the ongoing Education and Training Sector Project (Loan 3054-TUN) and lessons
from that experience will be applied in this project. The same MES implementation unit as for Ln
3054-TUN will be responsible for supervising the construction and rehabilitation activities under
this project. Civil works for school rehabilitation costing less than US$30,000 each, up to an
aggregate of US$4 million may be awarded through direct contracting according to procedures
acceptable to the Bank. In order to ensure a timely start-up of project implementation activities, it
was agreed during negotiations that the Government will submit to the Bank for its review and
approval the report on the evaluation and comparison of bids for proposed awards for 3 bids for
construction of civil works required for the schools under subcomponent 2A of the project no later
than September 30 1995.
36. Technical Assistance. Consultants for technical assistance financed under the project
would be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981)." Technical assistance
would consist of specialized services involving consulting firms and individual experts (US$9.7
million aggregate) in the following areas: (a) packaged services including architectural and
engineering services for the building design, and rehabilitation and construction supervision of the
schools and INSE's documentation center; (b) foreign and local specialized services in the
development, implementation and follow-up of training programs; and (c) specialized services in
testing and assessment systems and public administration. The project would also finance long-
and short-term training and fellowships abroad and locally (US$7.1 million aggregate) procured
from educational organizations (US$2.2 million) and directly from MES in-service training
department (US$4.9 million). In order to assure a timely start-up of project implementation
activities, it was agreed during negotiations that the Government will submit to the Bank for its
review and approval the proposal evaluations and evaluation reports for the consultants' services
required to carry out subcomponents IA and IC of the project no later than June 30 1995.
37. Incremental Operating Costs. The Government would entirely finance (US$3.0 million
equivalent total cost) staff salaries, equipment maintenance services, and other incremental non-
salary recurrent costs. These expenditure items would be procured in accordance with standard
Government procedures.
38. Contract Review. To ensure compliance with Bank Procurement Guidelines,
procurement documentation (i.e. advertisement, bidding documents, evaluation reports, etc.) for all
contracts for goods to be awarded through ICB estimated to cost the equivalent of $350,000 or
more would be subject to prior review by the Bank, as well as (i) each contract for goods to be
awarded under LCB estimated to cost the equivalent of US$250,000 or more (ii) the first 2
contracts for goods to be awarded under LCB, regardless of the price; (iii) each contract for works
to be awarded under LCB estimated to cost the equivalent of US$1.5 or more; and (iv) the first 3
contracts for works for the execution of subcomponent 2A of the project, regardless of price.
Procurement documentation for all training, fellowships, and consultant contracts costing more



18
than US20,000 for individuals and US$75,000 for consulting firms (Terms of Reference, letters of
invitation, short lists, evaluation reports, and draft contracts) would be subject to prior review by
the Bank. The remaining contracts would be subject to selective post reviews by the Bank.
39. Procurement Information to be Provided by the Borrower. The PMU would
promptly inform the Bank of contract awards and procurement issues, and would include the
following procurement information in periodic progress reports: (a) revised cost estimates for
individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates of allowances for physical and
price contingencies; (b) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,
contract award, and completion time for individual contracts; and (c) status of aggregate limits on
specified methods of procurement.
40. Disbursement. The project would be implemented over 5 years. The Project closing date is
June 30, 2000. The proposed project would be disbursed over a period of about 6 years according
to the following categories:
(a)  civil works        44% of total expenditures
(b)  equipment           100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-
factory costs) and 80% of local expenditures for other items
procured locally)
(c)  technical assistance  100%
(d)  training            100% of foreign expenditures
41. The Government would finance the balance of project costs, including taxes.

42. All disbursements would be fully documented with the exception of the following for which
the Bank may require withdrawals from the Loan Account to be made on the basis of statements of
expenditures for: (i) goods under contracts not exceeding $250,000 equivalent, excluding the first
two contracts for goods to be awarded under LCB regardless of the price; (ii) works under
contracts not exceeding $350,000 equivalent, excluding the first three contracts for works for the
construction of schools regardless of the price; (iii) services of consulting firms under contracts not
exceeding $75,000 equivalent; and (iv) services of individual consultants under contracts not
exceeding $20,000 equivalent, all under such terms and conditions as the Bank shall specify by
notice to the Borrower. The required supporting documentation would be retained by the PMU for
at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last
disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available for review by the auditors
and by visiting staff upon request.



19
43. Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government may
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, a Special
Account in which the World Bank would make an initial deposit of US$4 million. This Special
Account will be located in the Central Bank. The Special Account would be replenished monthly
or whenewer the undisbursed balance of the account falls below an amount equal to 50% or less of
the amount of the initial deposit, which ever comes first. Documentation requirements for
replenishment applications would follow the same procedures a described above.
44. Project Accounts. In addition, project accounts in Tunisian Dinars (DT) will be
established by the Government for counterpart financing. In order to ensure timely payment for
small contracts, contractors will be paid from the DT accounts, which will then be replenished
from the Special Account for the amount covering the expected expenditures for not more than a
month (30 days) or whenewer the undisbursed balance of the project account falls below an amount
equal to 50% or less of its total amount.
45. Project Sustainability.  The maximum incremental expenditures during project
implementation will amount to less than 0.1 % of MES' recurrent budget for 1992-93, which is
expected to remain at its current level over the 8th and 9th Plans. The strengthening of the
building and equipment maintenance units will help to sustain project investments. The project
impact indicators will reinforce monitoring and evaluation practices at central and Gouvernorat
levels. This will also contribute to a more flexible and effective system.
46. Accounts and Audits. The PMU would maintain separate accounts for all project
activities, in conformance with international accounting practices. Project accounts including the
Special Account would be audited in accordance with the March 1982 Bank "Guidelines for
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank". The Bank would be
provided within nine months of the end of each fiscal year with an audit report of such scope and
detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on
disbursements against a certified statement of expenditures. The separate opinion should mention
whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal
controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal
application.
Supervision. Monitoring and Evaluation
47. Status of Project Preparation. The PMU manager has already been selected.
Underserved areas where schools are to be constructed and rehabilitated under the project have
been identified. School lists resulting from applying the site selection criteria were agreed upon
for the construction of 25 upper-basic schools and for 40 secondary schools. The additional 5
upper-basic schools and 4 secondary schools sites will be identified before the end of 1994. The
comprehensive school survey establishing priority schools to be rehabilitated has been completed.
The detailed architectural and engineering studies with estimated costs for the remodeling and
upgrading of the INSE documentation center will be completed before the end of 1994 and sent to
the Bank for review and non objection. Regarding laboratory construction and rehabilitation,
agreement was reached to build 6m x 10m school science laboratories with sinks located in
continuous fixed counters along the long sides of the room. A more flexible furniture layout
would offer advantages not available in the present fixed layout. Further evaluation and
experimentation with alternative school science laboratory layouts will be carried out during project
implementation.



20
48. Project Implementation Reviews. The PMU will prepare and submit to the MES and
the Bank, not later than September 30 in each of its Fiscal Year beginning with the FY after the
FY ending on December 31, 1994, an Annual Project Implementation Review (APIR) or Mid-
Term Project Implementation Review report, of such scope and in such detail as the Government
and the Bank shall have agreed, on, inter alia: (i) the progress achieved in carrying out the project
during the preceding FY or previous mid-term project implementation period, as the case may be,
with special focus on project achievements measured on the basis of the Impact Indicators and the
agreed project objectives and time schedule; (ii) proposed revisions to be introduced to the Impact
Indicators; (iii) a detailed review of incurred and prospective annual and recurrent and investment
expenditures for implemented activities; (iv) guidelines for the preparation of the project evaluation
reports; and (v) as applicable, a proposed annual project implementation work program for the
following FY , including a detailed breakdown of the Government's and the Bank's financing share
necessary, and/or a proposal for restructuring any component of the project. No later than
October 31 in each FY, the MES and the Bank shall exchange views on, respectively, the progress
reports for the preceding FY or the previous mid-term project implementation period. Promptly
thereafter, the Government shall: (i) cause the PMU to introduce such modifications into the
annual and mid-term progress reports, and the Impact Indicators, as shall have been agreed upon
with the Bank, and to submit the finalized reports to the Bank not later than December 31 in each
FY; and (ii) take all action which the MES and the Bank shall have agreed is required on the part
of the Govermnent to ensure the successful and timely implementation of the project and to achieve
its objectives.
49. Impact Indicators. To allow the timely execution of the monitoring and evaluation
activities, the Government has developed a list of impact indicators, in coordination with the Bank.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on a number of already-defined Impact Indicators and
the Government shall define to the satisfaction of the Bank: (i) not later than December 31, 1994,
the Baseline Values necessary for the application of 5 of the impact indicators; (ii) not later than
December 31,1995, the Baseline Values necessary for the application of 4 additional impact
indicators; (iii) the Baseline Values necessary for the application of 8 further impact indicators
upon the completion of the necessary studies; and (iv) not later than December 31, 1996, the
Target Values necessary for the application of 19 of the impact indicators.
IV PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISK
50. Project Benefits. The project's major benefit would be to assist the Government
maintaining the momentum of the ongoing education reform. Project-financed school construction
would create 48,000 new pupil places in upper-basic and secondary education over the project life
(out of the total of 180,000 needed). New pedagogic inputs (in line with the revised curricula),
support for improved management at central, regional and school levels and inservice training for
about 26,000 teachers and staff would benefit more than 700,000 grade 7-13 school children.
Higher retention and transition rates would improve the system's overall efficiency. The
Government would be able to establish clear benchmarks for educational performance and output
through improved evaluative and assessment capacity of the MES and INSE, which would lead to
more efficient resource utilization and better planning. Finally, it will also result in lower adult
illiteracy and avoid the need to develop more costly VT capacity for school dropouts. Continued
growth of private education at secondary and higher education levels would further help to achieve
sustainable financial sector development.



21
51. Project Risks. The project's main risk lies in the traditional reluctance of teachers and
staff to change their working habits and skills. Teacher, parents and education managers alike
have attitudes formed by the present system. This risk has been minimized by the use of extensive
and effective information feedback including various national organizations (unions, employer
federations, parent and teacher associations), that has resulted in a national consensus about
education policy. Secondly, Tunisian and Bank investments will only have their desired effects if
the system is structured to implement the reform's objectives broadly and deeply. Broad
ownership increases its chances of success. New training practices, allocation of additional
budgetary resources, continuous consultation of all stake holders, incentives for teachers and
inspectors to acquire and use new practices and knowledge are measures the Government has taken
to align all parts of the education system around the reform goals. Thirdly, secondary and higher
education expansion should not divert the Government's attention from the problems at lower
levels. This includes a continuous effort to improve basic education school retention rates. To help
mitigate these risks, agreement was reached on education policy targets and sector performance
(impact) indicators and their baselines.
52. Project Objective Categories. Quality improvements, reduction of inequities in the
delivery of educational services, and improved access to secondary education will contribute to
better chances for further training and employment, and thus to social promotion. This project
would contribute improved school completion rates access and better academic performance of
poor urban/rural children. School sites for construction will be selected on the basis of indicators
related to national and regional educational needs (taking into account available gender and poverty
assessment data). During project implementation, regional education management would also be
made more aware of gender and poverty considerations through training, technical assistance.
53. Environmental Considerations. This is a category C project. School design and
construction will take into account: (i) adequate water supply, sanitary needs and waste collection;
(ii) adequate disposal of construction waste; and (iii) adequate safety standards. Priority would be
given to environmental topics in the curricula, development of guidelines for teachers and
instructors on how to include environmental topics in their teaching and the purchase of
environmentally safe and relevant equipment.
V AGREEMENTS, CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATION

Secondary Education Support Project
Project Impact Indicators
1.    Objective. The impact indicators developed within the framework of the Secondary Education
Support Project have been created with a view to comparing, in time and space, the real impact of the
project in relation to the Project's initial objectives, i.e. (i) improving the quality and efficiency of the
educational system; and (ii) increasing the number of pupil-places in upper-basic and secondary
schools.
2.    Activities. Two categories of indicators will be defined and monitored: (a) the,first category is
linked to the quality of management and project implementation of the MES institutions and services
which benefit from the Project; and (b) the second category will measure the performance in terms of
quality and efficiency of the basic and secondary education system.
Indicators linked to management quality and project implementation of MES institutions and
services which benefit from the Project
3.    Sub-component 1C. The Directorate of Planning, Statistics and Information (DPSI) will
provide, on an annual basis:
(i)  the number of hours (neededlnecessary) per person per year from the central administration,
the DREs and scholastic establishments which are necessary for the publication of annual
statistics so as to provide an impact indicator on the evolution of planning and administrative
efficiency;
Cui)  the qualifications of newly appointed teachers per Gouvernorat and the average number of
pupils per teacher in upper-basic and secondary schools will provide indicators on resource
allocation development and the reduction of differences therein between different Gouvernoras
4.    Sub-component 2B. In order to measure the development of efficiency and cost-effectiveness
in the National System of Preventive Maintenance of basic and secondary school network the Direction
de Batiments et de l'Equipement (DBE) will provide, on an annual basis:
(i)  the average elapsed delay between a school's request for maintenance assistance and the
completion of repairs; this delay will be measured in each maintenance unit for a given
representative number of interventions to be determined;
(ii)  the average national recurrent and investment budget for maintenance;
(iii)  the average annual unit maintenance cost measured over a representative sample number of
interventions as defin'ed under (i) above.
5.    Sub-component 2C. In order to measure the development of efficiency and maintenance of
pedagogic equipment, the Centre National de Maintenance (CNM will provide:
(i)  the national investment and recurrent budget for maintenance of pedagogic equipment,
