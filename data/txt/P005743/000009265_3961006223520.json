Support Project\n            will continue to assist the Government in: 1) implementing\n            its basic and secondary education reform program aimed at\n            achieving improved quality and efficiency; and 2) improving\n            access to accommodate the projected increase in upper-basic\n            and secondary school enrollments. The project will be\n            executed over 5 years by the Ministry of Education and\n            Sciences (MES). The first component will help MES to improve\n            educational delivery mechanisms by financing the\n            implementation of the following quality and efficiency\n            measures: 1) strengthening the education performance\n            evaluation and assessment system by financing institutional\n            support for central and provincial evaluation services; 2)\n            promoting more effective teaching and training practices for\n            about 26,000 teachers, pedagogic and orientation counselors\n            and inspectors at school, provincial and central levels; 3)\n            strengthening the central and provincial MES administration\n            and planning services to improve the existing information\n            and feedback mechanisms between the different\n            decision-making levels. The second component will provide\n            support for improved access by financing: 1) the\n            construction of about 30 upper-basic and 44 secondary\n            schools; 2) rehabilitation of upper-basic and secondary\n            schools in provinces and areas where these are mostly needed\n            and the establishment of preventive school maintenance\n            system; and 3) provision of instructional equipment,\n            training and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1994-08-04T00:00:00Z"}
