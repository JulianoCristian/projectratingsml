Positive lessons suggest that the definition of\n            realistic objectives, closely tied to the Government's\n            priorities in relation to education reforms, was essential\n            for the project success, and, the success of individual\n            components is, by and large, due to the sustained commitment\n            of the relevant government officials. Moreover, the sound\n            analytical preparation, and policy consultations facilitated\n            implementation, and achievement of development objectives,\n            while the flexibility in the training approach enabled a\n            responsive training redefinition, tailored to specific\n            needs, as suggested by the successful in-service training\n            for teachers, which showed positive effects on the quality\n            of education. Negative lessons however, indicate that\n            institutional weaknesses were apparent in the drafting of\n            the education assessment system, which prevented the\n            application by the Ministry of Education (MoE), to include\n            this key component for quality improvement (thus postponed\n            to the following operation). Furthermore, the lack of\n            experience with procurement guidelines, was conducive to\n            delays, and, the absence of integrated software, to\n            facilitate a proactive project management prevented higher\n            project ratings. Unfortunately, no provisions were made in\n            project accounting practices, to quantify, and include\n            in-kind contributions from MoE, as part of the total\n            expenditures by the Government."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
