                        Development Policy Grant III

                           SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                          Meeting of the Executive Directors
                                September 16, 2010



      The Executive Directors approved the grant from the Trust Fund for Gaza and
West Bank in the amount of US$40 million equivalent to the Palestine Liberation
Organization (for the Benefit of the Palestinian Authority) to help finance the Palestinian
Reform and Development Plan for the Development Policy Grant III (IDA/R2010-0273).

        Executive Directors welcomed recent, but precarious, economic growth in the
West Bank and Gaza and broadly supported the project, which is aligned with the Interim
Strategy endorsed by the Board in 2008. They agreed with the project's aim to support
important ongoing efforts to strengthen the fiscal position and improve public financial
management. Further fiscal reform efforts were encouraged, including pension and
electricity sector reforms, while emphasizing the need to mitigate the effects of reforms
on vulnerable groups. The importance of easing restrictions on movement, trade and
access to resources in order to promote private sector growth was also noted. Executive
Directors also stressed continued close collaboration with the IMF. Finally, Executive
Directors appreciated Bank staff efforts in a challenging and uncertain environment.
