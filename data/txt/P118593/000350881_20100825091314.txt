                    PALESTINIAN REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN
                          DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT III


Borrower                    Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) (for the benefit of the
                            Palestinian Authority)

Implementing Agency         Ministry of Finance (MOF) of the Palestinian Authority

Financing Data              Terms: Grant from the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank
                            Amount: US$40 million

Operation Type              The proposed operation is for budget support and is a follow-up to
                            two previous PRDP DPGs approved by the Board on June 5, 2008
                            and April 28, 2009. The proposed grant would be disbursed in a
                            single tranche upon satisfactory completion of the prior actions.

Main Policy Areas           The PRDP DPG III will continue to support the PA as it implements
                            the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP). The PRDP
                            DPG III focuses its support on two areas: (i) strengthening the PA's
                            fiscal position; and (ii) improving public financial management.

Key Outcome Indicators      The PRDP DPG III is designed to help the PA strengthen its fiscal
                            position by reducing its public sector wage bill to less than 23
                            percent of GDP and Net Lending to less than 5 percent of GDP by
                            2010. The PRDP DPG III also supports the PA's efforts to improve
                            public financial management. Key indicators for this are producing
                            a timely budget, providing 2009 accounts to its external auditors and
                            implementing commitment controls.

Program Development         The proposed operation will help the PA continue to implement the
Objectives and              PRDP. Like the PRDP DPG I and DPG II, the PRDP DPG III will
Contribution to CAS         specifically support efforts to strengthen the fiscal position and
                            increase government transparency and accountability.

Risks and Risk Mitigation   The PRDP's success depends on parallel actions by the PA, the
                            Government of Israel (GOI) and the donor community.
                            The key risks are:
                            (i) The PA must maintain strong political support for the PRDP in
                            order to take actions such as maintaining the public sector wage bill
                            at an affordable level, moving electricity generation from local
                            governments to commercial distribution companies, initiating reform
                            of the public pension system and reforming public procurement.
                            The PA has successfully mobilized popular support for its actions in
                            the West Bank and because of the success of the reforms supported
                            by the previous DPGs, it is expected to continue to gain support.
                                   - ii -
               (ii) The PA will not be able to meet its fiscal goals without
               substantial private sector growth. However, since the PRDP was
               announced in late 2007, the GOI has only marginally relaxed its
               movement restrictions and continues to restrict access to resources
               such as land and water. The PA is continuing to attempt to address
               the GOI's security concerns. In addition, the international donor
               community is continuing to monitor the closure system and its
               economic impact.
               (iii) Donor support is the third determinant of the PRDP's success.
               The PRDP assumes high and sustained donor assistance during the
               plan's life. In the long run, the PA is striving toward fiscal
               sustainability, but until they reach this goal, they will depend upon
               large amounts of untied budget support that will allow it to pay
               wages and basic operational costs.            Because of the PA's
               commitment to reform, donors provided about US1.355 billion in
               budget support in 2009, less than in 2008 but still substantial. To
               encourage continued high levels of budget support, the World Bank
               will continue to operate the multi-donor trust fund it established in
               2008. In addition, this proposed third DPG sends a strong signal to
               donors that the World Bank considers progress on the PRDP
               adequate and that donors should continue to support it.

                             DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT III
                             TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA


                                   I.      INTRODUCTION

1.       Since the establishment of the Caretaker Government in mid-2007, the Palestinian
Authority (PA) has not only rebuilt its basic operating systems that had decayed during the
previous government but has made significant progress in creating new and stronger institutions
that will be needed by a future Palestinian state. In December 2007, the PA presented its
Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) to donors at the Paris Donor Conference.
This comprehensive plan lays out a three-year program of reforms to help re-start economic
growth and improve the welfare of citizens. Despite enormous political challenges, the PA has
steadily implemented the plan and will soon issue a new national plan that builds on the PRDP.
Gaza continues to be split from the West Bank, ruled by another government and isolated by
Israeli closures. The peace process is moribund. However, the PA has been able to gain
widespread public support for its reform program and has made significant strides improving the
efficiency and transparency of its operations. It has been particularly successful in strengthening
its fiscal position and improving public financial management - the areas supported by the World
Bank's Development Policy Grants (DPGs).

2.       The PA's success has attracted large amounts of international aid, including substantial
amounts of budget support. Untied budget support is essential for the PA to function. Total
expenditures and net lending were US$3.189 billion in 2009. However, domestic revenues are
estimated to have only covered about 50 percent. The biggest expenses include salaries
(including pensions) and "net lending", much of which are payments by the central government
to the Israel Electricity Company for power supplied to Palestinian municipalities and other
distributors. The PA has been taking steps to control spending but there is limited room for
further reductions. Consequently, until economic growth recovers enough to allow the PA to
substantially raise domestic revenues, there will remain a need for large scale external financing.
It is critical that this external support be provided through the PA's Central Treasury Account
(CTA) because using the CTA helps the PA develop budget discipline and strengthen its public
financial management systems.

3.      Given the importance of untied budget support, the Bank has made helping the PA raise
budget support a major focus of its work in West Bank and Gaza (WBG). The Bank has directly
provided two DPGs of US$40 million each in 2008 and 2009. In addition, the Bank manages the
PRDP Multi-Donor Trust Fund, (PRDP-TF) which disburses untied budget support based on the
PA's progress on implementing the PRDP reform agenda. Since its inception in 2008, the
PRDP-TF has disbursed nearly US$500 million. But the Bank's contribution goes beyond
directly providing budget support. The Bank's quarterly monitoring of the PA's performance in
                                                    -2-


consultation with the IMF gives other donors confidence to provide budget support on their own
account. The provision of this third DPG will send a strong signal that the Bank believes that the
PA's reforms are on track and that other donors should have confidence to continue to using the
PA's CTA.

4.      With support from the Bank DPGs, the PA has made significant progress towards
strengthening its fiscal position and improving its PFM system. However, providing budget
support in WBG continues to be a risky prospect. For the DPG III to be successful in assisting
the PA to maintain the reform momentum and develop institutions required by any future
Palestinian state, the PA, GOI and donors must all play their part. The PA must maintain the
political will and popular support to implement difficult but necessary reforms. It will not be
possible for the PA to become fiscally sustainable unless private sector growth rises to the level
needed to support basic services for the Palestinian population. This will require the PA to
continue to improve the business environment especially through increased security. But private
sector growth mostly hinges on the GOI continuing to relax its economic restrictions in response
to an improving security situation. Finally, the entire reform agenda depends on the readiness of
the donor community to provide sustained high levels of budget support while the PA
implements its reforms and the Palestinian economy recovers.

                                    II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN WEST BANK AND GAZA

5.      Growth in WBG accelerated in 2009 and initial estimates suggest real growth reached 6.8
percent, well above the 5 percent projected in the PA's 2009 budget. Most of the growth was in
the West Bank, where the IMF and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) estimate real
GDP growth was 8.5 percent. However, despite the continued closure of Gaza, growth there was
estimated to be positive at about 1 percent.1 Initially PCBS estimated real growth for WBG in
2008 at 2.3 percent, which would be a real per capita decline in GDP. However, they have
recently issued revised estimates that put real growth at about 5.9 percent implying an increase in
per capita GDP. Thus, the 2009 performance is the third consecutive year of per capita GDP
growth and may signal that at least the West Bank economy is beginning to recover after years of
decline. But growth is still less than what might be expected from an economy recovering from
such a low base. Initial estimates for the first quarter of 2010 indicate that real GDP increased
by more than 12 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009. Thus, it appears that growth in
2010 is on track to exceed that of 2009 and meet or exceed the baseline scenario proposed by the
IMF and MOF.

6.     The revival of growth in the West Bank is impressive, but it is also precarious. It is being
driven by a combination of large sustained inflows of donor assistance, PA government reforms
that have increased investor confidence and the loosening of some Israeli security restrictions.

 PCBS does not publish quarterly GDP estimates for West Bank and Gaza separately. However, these figures were
presented by PA officials in meetings with donors.
                                                             -3-


However, the high level of external assistance over the past three years is probably the most
important factor. In 2009, the PA received more than US$1.355 billion in budget support
coming on top of US$1.8 billion in 2008 and almost US$1 billion in 2007. This does not
consider hundreds of millions more in aid that has flowed into the economy through the UN and
from bilateral assistance programs. The large amounts of budget support have allowed the PA to
maintain expansionary fiscal policies to support growth. In 2009, total PA commitments were
equivalent to around 52 percent of GDP, with wage expenditures alone around 24 percent of
GDP. The importance of government spending in the economy is evidenced by the changing
composition of GDP. The share of the mostly government funded sectors: Health and Social
Work, Water and Electricity, Education and Public administration and Defence, rose from less
than 21 percent in 1999 to almost 30 percent in 2009. In absolute terms, Public Administration
and Defence expanded more than any other sector in this period. The first quarter of 2010 shows
a similar pattern.

7.       In contrast to the public sector, important parts of the private sector have not been as
robust. Between 1999 and 2009, manufacturing output was flat and its share in GDP fell from
12.5 percent to 11 percent. Output in agriculture fell by 47 percent during the same period and its
share declined from 10.4 percent to 4.8 percent. The PA's reforms that have resulted in improved
security and more efficient service delivery along with the GOI's loosening of its security
restrictions have no doubt increased investor confidence. In widespread discussions with private
businesses, they reveal the importance they place on these measures. But there is not yet any sign
of a large scale revival of private investment in the productive sectors of the economy. Since
2007, real output in the Manufacturing and Hotels and Restaurants categories of GDP have
increased by 7.3 and 8.5 percent respectively, well below the overall increase of GDP of 13
percent. The biggest jump in private sector activity has been in the Construction and Real Estate
Service sectors, which have gone up by nearly 28 percent. Much of the investment in these
sectors is going to provide much needed housing. But according to interviews with financial
institutions, PA civil servants and NGO employees form the backbone of this market, which
again points out the importance of donor aid in driving the economy. The PA is making efforts to
revive private investment (see paragraph 45 below), but sustained private sector growth will
require a takeoff in investment, which will only happen when Palestinian enterprises have better
access to markets in Israel and East Jerusalem and access to land and resources in Area C.2

8.      The IMF estimates that growth in Gaza was 1 percent in 2009 despite the ongoing
blockade, but this still indicates falling per capita GDP. However, as mentioned above, estimates
from the first quarter of 2009 indicate that growth has picked up substantially. However,
positive growth does not signal that the Gaza economy is on the road to recovery. It is still too
early to see the effects of the GOI's decision in July 2010 to allow more imports, and the private
sector remains in a state of near total collapse. The recent growth instead reflects the
development of coping mechanisms that have allowed some economic activity to resume on a
very limited scale. Until, the first of July 2010, the GOI restricted goods entering legally through

Israel to a small number of goods for humanitarian purposes and continues to prohibit all
exports. However, they did make some concessions, including allowing the export of 21
truckloads of cut flowers and 29 truckloads of strawberries in December 2009 and the import of
103 truckloads of glass. But there is a sustained flow of goods arriving through tunnels from
Egypt and via other avenues. Fuel is readily available and there is a supply of spare parts and
limited inputs that have allowed some production to resume. In addition, store shelves are filled
for those who have money to buy.

9.       The improved availability of goods in Gaza has allowed some private sector activities to
resume - albeit in the context of an unregulated economy. In some cases, even industrial
production has restarted though on a limited scale and focused solely on the domestic market.
Monitoring by PalTrade and local business organizations finds that employment in the industrial
sector has increased from about 2,000 during 2008 to nearly 5,000 at the end of 2009. However,
that is nowhere near the 35,000 employed in June 2007 before the total closure. It should also be
noted that employment in 2007 was depressed because even then it was costly and difficult to
import and export. Gaza businesses are just trying to survive until circumstances permit them to
fully operate again. In many cases, enterprises have transformed themselves to offer different
services, such as a construction firm opening a restaurant or changing markets from export to
domestic. But most remain closed. A recent survey by the Palestinian Federation of Industries
found that only 54 percent of industrial establishments destroyed in the December 2008 fighting
were fully or partially rebuilt and only 23 percent of the work force was rehired.3 The longer the
closure goes on, the more difficult it will be for business to resume normal operations. Capital
and infrastructure is deteriorating and customers have switched to new suppliers. One of the
most difficult challenges is for firms to retain their skilled workers, when they are not operating.

10.    Despite the reported economic growth and recent easing of the Israeli restrictions on
imports, the vast majority of the Gaza private sector remains moribund and the economy is
sustained by government spending and humanitarian assistance. It is unclear how much
spending the Hamas government undertakes, but they have a large security force and a
substantial civil service. The PA regularly pays its more than 63,000 employees in Gaza, many
of whom are unable to work because of the current situation. The PA also maintains its large
system of social transfers to needy households in Gaza. In addition to this regular spending, the
PA has also undertaken substantial emergency spending in Gaza to offset some of the effects of
the recent fighting. In 2009, the PA detailed US$142 million in emergency spending to help
families that had lost their homes, make repairs to utilities and for other emergency requirements.
The international community continues to pour humanitarian aid into Gaza, led by UNRWA
which provides services for the more than 950,000 registered refugees. The Gaza private sector
is making a brave effort to survive, but it is only donor funded, government spending and direct
donor assistance that is averting a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

11.     The resumption of growth in WBG indicates that there has been a pickup in investment in
response to the improved business environment. It is not possible to know the precise level of
public investment since most of it is project finance from external sources, which are often not
reported to the Ministry of Finance. The 2009 budget called for US$503 million in development
capital expenditures but only US$215.5 million was actually expended. In addition, the PA
reports that there was another US$185 million in development projects funded directly by
donors. There are no published estimates of private investment; however, monetary statistics
suggest there has been an increase. Credit to the private sector at the end of December 2009 was
almost 23 percent higher than in 2008. At the same time, deposits only increased by 5 percent,
thus the Banking sector has increased intermediation and the productive use of available funds.
There are other indicators that also suggest that investment has increased. For example, the
number of business licenses issued in the West Bank in the fourth quarter of 2009 was more than
50 percent higher than in quarter four 2008 and the totalled licensed area was almost 54 percent
higher. However, looking at which sectors are growing, indicates that much of this investment is
in real estate, construction and the public sector, not in manufacturing, agriculture or high value
added services such as tourism.

12.     Trade with Israel reflects the increased inflows of donor assistance and economic growth.
PCBS has not yet produced recent balance of payments and trade data. However, the vast
majority of trade is with Israel ­ in 2007 Israel accounted for 88 percent of WBG imports and 72
percent exports­ for which the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics provides some information.
Official merchandise exports from Israel to WBG jumped by 25 percent between 2007 and 2008
reflecting the pent up demand when donor aid was cut off and PA salaries were not being paid.
But they fell by 15 percent in 2009, which partially reflects the cut off of fuel shipments to Gaza
in the first quarter of 2009 and the global decline in fuel and food costs. However, they were still
6 percent above 2007 levels. In 2009, merchandise imports from WBG were nearly 27 percent
lower than they were in 2008 and 22 percent below the 2008 figure. This may partially reflect the
increased difficulty Palestinian food producers have in entering the Israeli and East Jerusalem
                                                        -6-


markets. Falling exports to Israel is also consistent with the fact that most of the WBG growth
has been in government services and non-tradables such as construction.

13.     In 2009, inflation was lower and the NIS exchange rate stabilized. Falling global food
and energy prices along with the relaxation of some movement restrictions have helped reduce
prices in WBG. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased on average by 2.75 percent in 2009.
In the remainder of the West Bank where most of the PA's expenditures are made, it increased
by only 0.6 percent.4 However, inflation was much higher in East Jerusalem and Gaza, where
the CPI increased by 3.5 percent and 4.4 percent respectively. Compared to 2008, the exchange
rate was relatively stable during 2009 starting the year at about NIS 4 to the US Dollar and
dropping to about NIS 3.8 to the US Dollar.

14.     The Palestinian banking sector is highly conservative and was untouched by the world
financial crisis. Palestinian banks are strong, liquid and well regulated by the Palestinian
Monetary Fund (PMA). The PMA is one of the strongest institutions in WBG and among the
best managed monetary institutions in the region. With assistance from the IMF and World Bank
Group, the PMA is moving steadily to improve its systems and build the capabilities required by
a central bank for a future Palestinian state. The PMA is acquiring a real time gross settlement
system that is expected to be operational in 2011. Among other things, it is designing a program
of deposit insurance, building its research capabilities and developing PMA certificates of
deposits. Early in 2009, the PMA increased the share of assets that Palestinian Banks must keep
in WBG to 45 percent. This has encouraged some additional lending and along with the
improved investment environment has contributed to the increase in lending. The increase in
lending has also been helped by two ongoing loan guarantee schemes that not only provide
guarantees but provide technical assistance to banks to help them increase their lending to small
and medium enterprises. WBG uses the New Israeli Shekel, US Dollar, Euro and Jordanian
Dinar as its currencies, though most transactions are conducted in Shekels. Thus the PMA does
not control monetary policy or exchange rate policy.

15.     The most pressing issues facing the Palestinian banking system is maintaining its
relationship with Israeli banks. Israeli banks have broken all relations with banks in Gaza and
have quit accepting cash deposits from most counterparts in the West Bank. They have indicated
their desire to also end relations with West Bank banks. This led to a build-up of cash in
Palestinian Banks in the West Bank, which significantly raised their insurance expenses. In
addition, the Palestinian lost a large amount in forgone interest. In September 2009, the PMA
negotiated an agreement with the Bank of Israel to accept Israeli 300 million from Bank of
Palestine to the Bank of Israel for credit with Bank Hapoalim. In December 2009, a second
agreement was reached to transfer NIS 500 million to the Hapoalim and Discount Banks from
the Bank of Palestine and the Arab Bank through the Bank of Israel. But this was not fully
implemented and only NIS 150 million was transferred from the Bank of Palestine to the

Hapoalim Bank. This system of ad-hoc arrangements is inefficient and creates high levels of
uncertainty in the Palestinian banking sector.

16.     Unemployment in the WBG reflects the growth. In the West Bank, unemployment in the
fourth quarter of 2009 fell to 18.1 percent from 19.8 percent in the same quarter of 2008. At the
same time, the labor force participation rate rose from 42.8 percent to 44.1 percent.
Unemployment also dropped in Gaza; falling from 44.8 percent in quarter four 2008 to 39.3 in
the last quarter of 2009. However, part of this can be explained by the fact that the labor
participation rate also dropped from 38.8 percent to 36.9 percent. Unemployment in Gaza has
also been ameliorated by job creation schemes funded by donors. For example, in October 2009,
UNRWA announced that it was doubling its program to create 14,000 job opportunities a month.
The share of the West Bank work force employed in Israel and its settlements fell from 16.1
percent in quarter four 2008 to 13.4 percent in quarter four 2009. There are no recent poverty
estimates for West Bank and Gaza. The PCBS, with assistance from the World Bank, is
currently completing estimates. However, poverty levels are still high. A recent survey
conducted jointly by FAO and WFP found that 61 percent of the Gaza and 25 percent of the
West Bank population is food insecure.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

17.     Despite the continuing closure of Gaza, the IMF and PA have a baseline scenario where
real growth is projected to be about 7 percent in 2010 rising to 10 percent by 2012-2013 (Table
2). This assumes that the situation in Gaza will not deteriorate and that security will remain
stable in the West Bank allowing continued growth. It also assumes continuing large inflows of
external assistance. This results in reduced unemployment and at least in the West Bank,
recovering real per-capita GDP. These are strong assumptions, but estimates of growth in the
first quarter of 2010 indicate that the baseline growth rate will be attained or even surpassed.
The IMF also presents a pessimistic scenario where growth slows to about 4 percent over the
                                                       -8-


medium term. This would result in stagnating per capita income in the West Bank and a
continuing decline in Gaza. The pessimistic scenario assumes no progress in the peace process
and only ad hoc and limited further easing of restrictions in the West Bank and Gaza's blockade.
Given the recent fall in oil and food prices along with the Bank of Israel's sound management of
the money supply, the CPI inflation rate fell to about 4 percent in 2009 and is projected to hold
steady in the 3-4 percent range in the medium term.

18.    Despite the revival of growth and its extensive reform program, the PA's recurrent deficit
increased in 2009, mostly as a result of emergency spending in Gaza in the aftermath of the large
scale military operations at the end of 2008. The recurrent budget deficit on a commitment basis
was nearly US$1.6 billion, up from US$1.3 billion in 2008 and almost US$143 million more
than projected in the revised 2009 budget. Most of the deficit growth can be attributed to the
emergency situation in Gaza, which forced the PA to add US$300 million to the budget mid-
year. In addition, about US$141 million in arrears were brought forward from 2008 and reported
as 2009 commitments. Thus, commitments actually incurred in 2009 were below the revised
budget. Nonetheless, wage expenditures exceeded the budget by about 2 percent, mostly due to
compensation provided to public employees for the interest paid on loans they incurred in 2006
when the PA was unable to pay salaries.

19.      The original 2009 budget called for donor support of US$1.15 billion to fund the
recurrent deficit and another US$503 million for the development budget. It was hoped that there
would be an improvement in the quality of the budget compared to previous years by beginning
to shift donor funding from recurrent costs to development expenditures. In September 2009, the
projected support necessary for the recurrent and development budgets was raised to US$1.45
and US$1.1 billion respectively to respond to the needs in Gaza. However, at the end of the year
the recurrent deficit was nearly US$1.6 billion and including development spending made the
overall deficit more than US$1.77 billion. Only about US$1.355 billion in budget support and
another US$390 million in development financing materialized. Consequently, the PA was
forced to turn to borrowing from local banks and accumulating arrears of US$221 million. Total
domestic debt stood at about US$660 million at the end of 2009, up from about US$449 million
in December 2007.5 External debt stands at about US1.1 billion, most of which is concessional
debt incurred prior to 2000 and is not being serviced. Development expenditures through the
Central Treasury Account on a commitment basis were only US$215 million.6 Thus, because of


5
  The detailed records on international debt were lost in Gaza and with the help of the World Bank and other donors
the MOF is reconstructing them. The largest share of the debt is held by the World Bank, about US$320 million and
Arab countries and the Islamic Development Banks at about $500 million. There is no indication that there is
substantial international debt to private parties.
6
  The MOF tables report only US$45 million in development financing and US$215 million in development
expenditures. The MOF reports that US$10 million in community development projects were financed from the
Central Treasury Account. The remaining expenditures were financed from aid received in previous years but not
recognized in those years because previously the MOF only recognized development financing when it was spent.
In 2009, the MOF changed to a practice of recognizing development financing when it is received. In addition, the
PA estimates that there is US$185 million in development projects directly financed by donors.
                                                            -9-


the emergency in Gaza, there was no significant shift of external resources from recurrent to
development expenditures in 2009.

20.      The recently released 2010 budget commits the PA to resume the path to less dependence
on donor support for recurrent expenditures. The budget predicts a recurrent budget deficit of
US$1.24 billion and US$667 million in development expenditures. However, these projections
are based on strong assumptions and will require discipline on the PA's part. The projections
assume real GDP growth of 7 percent in 2010 and that the PA will be able to increase domestic
revenues by almost 18 percent through improved tax collection. The budget calls for the PA to
slightly reduce non-wage expenditures after they have consistently increased in the last three
years including by 35 percent in 2009. It also assumes that the PA will be able to reduce net
lending by 35 percent in 2010. Finally, the PA's decision to give a general 4 percent wage
increase to public sector employees has increased the budget7. However, the share of the wage
bill in GDP is still expected to decline from 24 percent in 2009 to less than 23 percent in 2010.

  The PA recognized that public sector wages were higher than in the private sector and unsustainable. To deal with
this challenge, the PRDP committed the PA to having no general wage increase and allowing inflation to slowly
lower real wages. However, due to unexpectedly high inflation of nearly 10 percent in 2008, the PA provided a 6
percent wage increase in 2009. Inflation in 2009 was only about 2.75 percent. The 4 percent general wage increase
provides a real wage increase for most PA employees.

   III.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

21.     The PA presented a draft PRDP to the Paris Donor Conference in December 2007 and
completed it in May 2008. The PRDP was developed internally by the PA, with limited input
from the donor community. It reflects the Government's belief that it must act aggressively to
control the budget and move towards greater self-sufficiency. During 2008, the PA made a
concerted effort to begin implementing the plan's most important elements and in 2009 it
continued to implement these reforms. In addition, it began developing a "Palestinian National
Plan" that builds on the PRDP and when it is completed at the end of 2010, it will supersede the
PRDP. The World Bank approved a Development Policy Grant (PRDP DPG I) in June 2008 and
another (PRDP DPG II) in April 2009 to support the PA's reform agenda. The PRDP is a
comprehensive and ambitious set of reforms that detail plans for spurring economic growth,
establishing good governance and moving towards the ultimate goal of an independent
Palestinian State. The focus of the PRDP is on improving the PA's fiscal position and
                                                      - 12 -


strengthening governance while directing the existing levels of expenditure and investment in the
social sectors and public goods to priority activities and supporting the environment for private
sector development. Because the PRDP was developed through widespread consultation across
both the government and civil society, the PA has been able to make good progress towards the
most significant goals. However, as the reforms have become more difficult and complex, the
pace of reform has slowed. The following section discusses the PA's most important reform
achievements over the past year and its goals for the immediate future.

A.      GOVERNANCE

22.    While global governance indicators of WBG generally present a negative picture,8 it
needs to be recognised that WBG is not a state and many of the indicators are strongly affected
by factors outside the direct control of the PA. These factors include the non-functioning of the
parliament, and the expired mandates of the President and the parliament. Within this
challenging context, the PA has taken a number of steps to strengthen governance.

23.     Mindful of the need to restore the trust of citizens in its capacity to govern, the PA has
concentrated on bringing safety, security and good governance to the territories under its control.
While its ability to govern effectively in Gaza remains compromised by Hamas' seizure of
control and the continuing Israeli restrictions, the PA has made important progress in restoring
law and order and better governance in the West Bank. But, they still have far to go to reach their
goal of a secure and stable internal environment in which social and economic development can
take place.

24.     In its short existence, the PA has made significant progress in building institutions,
required by any future Palestinian state, including passing progressive economic and social laws
and conducting peaceful free and fair elections. The PA used 2008 as a time to restore and
strengthen institutions that have been damaged by the withdrawal of donor assistance. In 2009,
the PA went beyond restoration and made important strides on building new institutions and
developing the capacity of existing ones.

25.      Security is one of four national goals espoused by the PRDP, the others being: good
governance, national prosperity and enhanced quality of life. Without first establishing security,
it is unlikely that the other PRDP goals, including the ones supported by the Bank's PRDP DPGs
will be attainable. In 2009, the PA made major progress in bringing safety and security to the
West Bank. The PA deployed a large number of newly trained security forces throughout the
major cities who have helped restore security and create a sense of normalcy. The improved
security situation has led the GOI to reduce some of its internal security restrictions and is often
cited by businesses as an important reason for the increasing economic activity.

                                           FISCAL REFORM

26.      Fiscal reform is a cornerstone of the PRDP reform process and is directly supported by
the Bank's development policy grants. As detailed above, over time, rising public expenditure
has created serious fiscal problems. Rapid growth in the wage bill crowded out non-salary
expenditures and the budget deficit had risen to unsustainable levels. Consequently, the PA has
become heavily dependent on international aid to fund not only development expenditures but
also much of the operating expenditures required to deliver basic services. In addition, a liquidity
crisis, precipitated by economic sanctions during 2006, led to the accumulation of a large stock
of arrears due to public sector employees (i.e., unpaid salaries) and to private sector suppliers,
reaching a peak of US$1.3 billion during 2007. In 2008, through a program of reforms and
substantial external aid, the PA was able to pay off the majority of the public sector arrears.

27.     The PRDP calls for a number of policy actions to address the fiscal crisis and during
2009, the PA continued to take steps to improve its fiscal position. However, while the reform
plan was implemented, the PA saw its fiscal position deteriorate because of unexpected costs
arising from the military operations in Gaza at the end of 2008. Major actions called for by the
PRDP to strengthen the PA's fiscal position include:

 i.      Wage bill reduction ­ In 2005, the number of public sector employees stood at just under
         137,000. However, due to wholesale hiring during the run up to the 2006 elections and
         during the Hamas tenure, PA employment reached a peak of 189,000 in 2007. As a part
         of the PRDP, the PA committed to reducing its work force to 150,000 and then
         expanding by no more than 3,000 workers a year. These new hires would mostly be in
         the health and education sectors. Through strict implementation of civil service laws and
         elimination from the payroll of employees who were not legally appointed, the PA was
         able as of March 2010, to hold its work force to 149,5807 which is below the target.
         However, of the 6,643 net new hires between December 2008 and March 2010, 2,665
         were in security and 672 were in the President's office while only 2,008 and 422 were in
         the education and health sectors respectively. The actual wage bill in the 2009 was about
         2 percent higher than in the budget and about 12 percent more than in 2008, including a 4
         percent general wage increase to make up for unexpectedly high inflation in 2008. By the
         end of 2009, the PA wage bill was 24 percent of GDP versus a budget target of 22.3
         percent. However, the 2010 budget projects that the PA will achieve the PRDP goal of a
         public sector wage bill that is less than 23 percent of GDP.

ii.      Net lending
         The cost of subsidizing citizens' consumption of energy and other utilities continues to
         represents a significant drain on government financial resources. This is primarily driven
         by the `net lending' phenomenon in the electricity sector which arises due to the non-
         collection (by utilities and municipalities) of electricity bills, and the diversion of utility
         revenues to fund municipal operations. This forces the central government to fund
         payments to the Israel Electricity Company (IEC) for bulk purchases of electricity in
                                                  - 14 -


          order to avoid service disruption. Net lending began accelerating rapidly in 2006 and by
          2007 was accumulating at a rate of approximately US$50 million per month; the PA and
          IMF estimate that it reached about US$535 million or nearly 11 percent of GDP for 2007.
          Under the PRDP, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is working with local government
          officials on actions that will progressively reduce net lending to less than 5 percent of
          GDP by 2010. These actions, include enforcement measures such as requiring citizens to
          present a `certificate of payment' of utility bills in order to receive any municipal services
          and deducting overdue bills from PA employees pay, and financial incentives for
          municipalities to pay the IEC. Combined, these actions are aimed at progressively
          bringing an end to the non-payment of electricity bills. One of the main features of this
          plan is the distribution of pre-paid electricity meters. By March of 2010, the Palestinian
          Energy and Natural Resources Authority (PENRA) reports having installed 170,000 pre-
          paid meters and is planning to begin sending them to Gaza. All of these actions are
          accompanied by provisions to ensure continued access to utilities services for those
          suffering extreme poverty.

          The Ministry of Social Affair's (MOSA) has expanded its poverty targeting database to
          assist the poorest households. In addition, the PA is investigating the feasibility of
          establishing a specific `lifeline' level of electricity which will be provided to ensure that
          poor and vulnerable families are not deprived of access. It is expected that this lifeline
          tariff could be introduced in 2011.

          Despite the actions listed above, net lending persists and was 6.1 percent of GDP in 2009.
          To eliminate net lending from electricity, the PA is pushing for utility provision to be
          based on economic principles and, within a finite timeline, provided under a full cost-
          recovery basis. In actions supported by the previous DPGs, the Government established
          electricity distribution companies across the West Bank and Gaza that will be run on a
          commercial basis, and called for all local government electricity departments to be
          transferred to their control. In 2009, the PA passed a new electricity law that among other
          things established a regulator for the electricity sector. The regulator is using its authority
          to ensure that electricity distribution is in fact moved from local governments to the
          commercially run distribution companies. These companies, owned by the local
          governments, will ensure that debts are paid to the IEC before dividends are distributed to
          the owners. Once this process is finished, net lending caused by electricity subsidies in
          the West Bank should effectively be ended.

iii.      Tax administration reforms ­ The PRDP calls for administrative reforms directed at
          further increasing the collection of tax and customs revenues. These include a variety of
          administrative and technical measures, including the creation of a `Large Taxpayer's
          Office', focused inspections on fast-growing businesses with high cash incomes,
          strengthened supervision at crossings, automation of administrative procedures, and
          specialized training. In 2008, in order to provide a boost to the economy, the PA
                                              - 15 -


       increased the standard deduction for most taxpayers. However, because of increased
       collection efforts and economic growth in the West Bank, domestic tax collections in
       2008 rose by 35 percent compared to 2007 and in 2009 they increased by more than 22
       percent.

28.     One of the most pressing problems facing the PA is the under-funding of public pension
plans. In August 2008, the Palestinian Pension Authority began drafting a major institutional
review. The review's structure and contents have been agreed with Bank staff. The stage ­
focusing on legal and institutional arrangements and updating the medium-term financial and
distributional projections of the pension system ­ was ready in draft by March 2009. This
document, together with the policy paper that was produced by Bank staff in October 2009,
served as the basis for the Caretaker Government to compare reform options. It has helped the
PA decide how it wishes to reduce the unfunded public pension liabilities while creating the
preconditions to expanding system coverage. In addition to the policy dialogue, the Bank ­
through the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative ­ is extending
technical assistance for upgrading the regulatory framework for privately managed retirement
products.

                            ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

29.     Improving accountability and transparency is one of the Caretaker Government's highest
priorities and was another area of focused support under the PRDP DPG I and DPG II.
Immediately after it came into office, the Caretaker Government made substantial efforts to
restore accountability and transparency to public financial management through reconstituting
the CTA, preparing budgets for 2007 and 2008, and preparing the PRDP. During 2009, the PA
continued to make progress and the focus will remain on this area in the coming years.

30.     In early 2008, the Caretaker Government appointed an "Accountant General" to
supervise treasury, cash and debt management, budget execution, payroll, and accounting and
financial reporting. It also established a new "General Accounting Department" to implement
the improved accounting system. During 2009, the capacity of the department was further
developed with a particular focus on the accounting function. In the course of preparing the
2008 financial accounts for audit, a number of weaknesses were indentified in the accounting
procedures. While the weaknesses in the 2008 statements were addressed, remedial action was
also taken to address these weaknesses as they affect future work. In addition, with the support of
the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the department has prepared a
procedures manual to define the policies and roles and responsibilities of the various
departments. The procedures will also support the transition from joint paper and electronic
controls to a fully computerised expenditure control system.

31.    The PA has introduced an upgraded computerized accounting system that is used for
payments. The system, which has facilitated a move to decentralized budget execution (and
hence greater accountability), has been rolled out to all budget institutions.
                                               - 16 -


32.  The PRDP details the `Open and Accountable Government' (OAG) program, which the
PRDP DPG III will continue to support through its focus on public financial management. The
OAG will consist of three sub-programs:

       System and process re-engineering  including capacity-building in implementing
       integrated policy-making, planning, budgeting and accounting processes (from the Prime
       Minister's Office through to line ministries and agencies), capacity-building for the office
       of the Accountant General, implementation of a government-wide accounting and
       financial management information system, and strengthening of internal financial control
       functions;
       Building effective oversight institutions  including capacity-building for independent
       audit functions and the Palestinian Legislative Council secretariat; and
       Monitoring and evaluation of government performance ­ including capacity-building for
       a dedicated function at the center of government to monitor, evaluate and report on the
       efficiency and effectiveness of government performance and service delivery.

33.      .As indicated earlier, good progress was made in 2008 and 2009 on implementing a new
government accounting system and building capacity in the Accountant General Department.
Capacity building of the State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau as an external audit
institution has also started, and will accelerate through a substantial project being started by the
European Union.

                        ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL SERVICE REFORM

34.     The PRDP contains the "Efficient and Effective Government" (EEG) program, which
consists of three sub-programs:

       Reform of the public sector legislative framework ­ drafting and upgrading laws and
       regulations that govern the mandates, structures and internal procedures of government
       bodies;
       Organizational and institutional development ­ including detailed functional and
       strategic capacity building reviews of all ministries and agencies, organizational
       restructuring and streamlining of the public sector, the introduction of e-government,
       assistance to ensure that the Central Elections Commission is properly prepared to
       conduct forthcoming elections, and upgrading of the post office system; and,
       Civil service management ­ including implementation of modernized human resources
       management systems and procedures, including merit-based appointments processes,
       employee performance evaluation mechanisms, reform of pay and grading structures, and
       leadership training.

35.    Unfortunately, little progress has so far been made on most of these areas. However, in
2009, the PA identified human resource management as a priority for the coming three years.
Containing the wage bill will require the PA to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the
                                               - 17 -


civil service. Without an effective civil service system, it will be difficult for the PA to be able
to resist pressure to increase hiring, raise wages and speed promotions. Consequently, civil
service reform is an integral part of the fiscal strategy and the PRDP includes steps to enhance
the efficiency and effectiveness of government by modernizing public administration and civil
service management. Unfortunately, as long as the private sector is moribund, it is politically
difficult to enact major reforms in this area. Consequently, the PA has not yet attempted a
comprehensive civil service reform and is instead approaching it step by small step. Since 2008 a
number of steps have been taken to strengthen the integrity of the payroll system and link it to
the new accounting system. In 2009, the MOF introduced a system to ensure that all new hires
by individual ministries were in line with the budget allocation for each ministry. In 2010, this
system was expanded to include ensuring promotions also fall within budget.

                                 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM

36.     The Palestinian government system is one of the most decentralized in the region and the
local governments are major service providers. They are also an important part of the net
lending equation since many have not been paying their bills to the IEC. This can be explained
by low collection rates and the fact that a handful of local governments are diverting the
revenues collected to finance other expenditures. Thus, improving local government finances is
essential for addressing the PA's own fiscal problem. The PRDP proposes the "Accountable
Local Government" (ALG) program which would: (i) introduce new legislation to clarify and
regulate the relationship between central and local government; (ii) establish a policy framework
which promotes fiscal autonomy and discipline at the local level; and (iii) build the operational,
administrative and financial management capacity of local government bodies.

37.     The Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) was set up as an independent
intermediary that channels funds towards municipalities for service delivery and also provides
them with technical assistance. The MDLF works in close collaboration with the Ministry of
Local Government, which is responsible for regulating the sector and setting policies.
Furthermore, the MDLF has harmonized donor assistance (managing over US$100 million in
funds over a 3-4 year period) to the municipal sector by applying for the first time, clear and
transparent criteria for allocating development grants. Accordingly, the MDLF is the PA's
preferred mechanism for channelling reform and development assistance to local governments
and disbursements must be coordinated with the MOF. The MDLF is the primary source of
development-linked assistance to municipalities, and to support the implementation of essential
administrative and financial management reforms. Several donors have already committed
significant assistance to the MDLF for a multi-phased Municipal Development Program, and are
likely to increase their assistance over the coming three-year period. A core part of this
assistance will include improving financial management practices and piloting different
approaches for enhancing local revenue generation. The PRDP DPG I supported the first
essential task of helping local municipalities develop modern accounting systems to allow them
to produce transparent budgets. The PRDP DPG II extended this effort by supporting the
implementation of the Integrated Financial Management System among pilot municipalities. It
                                               - 18 -


also supported the design and implementation of a Grant Allocation Mechanism to municipalities
based on the following criteria: 40 percent performance, 40 percent population and 20 percent
need.    Performance is measured against 12 indicators of commonly accepted "good
management" practices addressing planning, financial accountability and management. Funds
are allocated based on rank; cities with higher rankings will be eligible for more funding than
those with lower rankings.

B.     SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

38.      The PRDP states that while the Caretaker Government is committed to pursuing a private
sector-led approach to securing economic growth and social development for all its citizens, it is
also mindful of the need to protect vulnerable groups, including women and youth, recognizing
that it is essential that these groups are not left behind as the economy grows. Consequently, the
PRDP calls for heavy investment in social development and efforts to scale up on-going effective
social protection and social assistance mechanisms. The PRDP DPG I and DPG II supported this
as a way to mitigate any risks associated with pursuing the PRDP fiscal goals and the PRDP
DPG III will continue this support.

                                       SOCIAL PROTECTION

39.     With the population growing at approximately 2.7 percent per year, and with
unemployment and poverty rising, especially in Gaza, there is a pressing need to scale up
effective and on-going social protection instruments and make better use of existing resources.
This pressure to provide basic services and other assistance to the poor has distracted attention
from the pursuit of more strategic development goals. The PRDP recognized the need to
increase the efficiency and improve the management of social safety net systems and the PA has
developed a Social Protection Strategy.

40.      Social assistance in WBG is provided through a complex web of PA organizations,
NGOs and other external agencies implementing a series of uncoordinated social protection
initiatives. This has inevitably led to poor targeting and an inefficient allocation of resources. As
a result, in 2009, the PA cabinet formally approved a merger of the two main on-going cash
assistance programs ­ the EU funded Special Hardship Case (SHC) with the World Bank funded
Social Safety Net Reform Project (SSNRP) and their transformation to the "Palestinian National
Cash Transfer Program (PNCTP). This formal merger triggered the preparation of the PA's cash
assistance strategy outlining the major orientations of the PNCTP, including a PNCTP targeting
database based on a proxy means test (PMT), uniform payment modalities and amounts
regardless of funding source, and sound PNCTP monitoring and evaluation arrangements, among
other things. The PNCTP is expected to become fully functional in 2010. In this context,
MOSA is preparing a detailed action plan with milestones in order to closely monitor PNCTP
progress. In addition, there is a pressing need for MOSA to define clearly the PNCTP's
operating modalities through an updated PNCTP operations manual. This manual would include
detailed information on the PNCTP's updated poverty targeting formula methodology,
household eligibility and benefit levels, duration of benefit payments, etc.
                                               - 19 -


41.     To improve targeting of its cash assistance, MOSA has updated the PMT formula, using
data from the 2007 PCBS Household Budget and Expenditure Survey. As of end October 2009,
the PA had re-screened 37,000 SHC and SSNRP households to ascertain their eligibility to
continue to receive cash benefits under the updated PMT formula.9 The PA estimates that there
are about 160,000 households living below the extreme poverty line, and plans on screening
about 5,000 households quarterly to ascertain their eligibility to receive cash assistance through
the PNCTP. Unfortunately, the political situation in Gaza has prevented MOSA from
introducing the new system there. However, MOSA expects to begin making new home visits in
Gaza in 2010. Until that time, the current SSNRP and SHC programs continue to run in parallel.

42.     During 2009, the Bank provided an additional US$5 million funding from the Global
Food Crisis Response Trust Fund (GFRP TF) and another US$3.4 million from the GFRP TF
was approved in April 2010 to provide extraordinary payments to about 25,000 households
living below the extreme poverty line that were negatively affected by the recent fuel and food
crisis. The PA has demonstrated to the international community that it is putting in place the
necessary structures and systems to rapidly scale up its cash assistance and other safety net
programs during crisis situations, using state of the art poverty targeting mechanisms. This is
likely to provide further assurances to key donors to support the PNCTP. The Bank has been
working closely with key donors including the EU, WFP, and UNRWA to ensure their continued
support for the PA's targeting modalities.

                                EDUCATION, HEALTH AND EMPOWERMENT

43.     While the PRDP DPG III is focused on supporting the PRDP goals of strengthening the
fiscal position, including reducing net lending, and improving public financial management, it
also supports the social protection agenda. However, there are a number of other PRDP goals in
areas that have important fiscal implications, such as health and education that the PRDP DPG
III does not directly support. The PA sees education as a basic human right and seeks to
guarantee citizens' access to a comprehensive education system consisting of: pre-school, basic
and secondary education; formal and non-formal education; technical and vocational education;
and higher education. The PA's commitment to the education sector is illustrated by the fact that
PRDP reports that education accounts for more than 30 percent of proposed budget support for
recurrent expenditures and approximately 20 percent of donor support requested for the public
investment program. With the necessary levels of support from donors, the PA believes it can
modernize the education system in line with its vision of a future Palestinian state ­ a state with a
knowledge-based economy, connected to the global community that embraces humanistic values
and is tolerant. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) is implementing its
five year Education Development Sector Plan (EDSP) for 2008-2012. Donor commitment to the
EDSP is strong: key donors have shown their willingness to support the EDSP through a Sector
Wide Approach (SWAP) mechanism (through "pooled" or parallel funding arrangements) to
continue empowering the MOEHE to manage the sector in the most effective manner.

    About 2% were found to be non-eligible.
                                               - 20 -


44.      Until recently, Palestinians enjoyed a quality of health care that compared favorably to
most middle income countries. Prior to 2000, the health care system recorded high levels of
immunization, prenatal care and effective basic health services. However, strains on the system
are reflected in declining health indicators in, for example, waterborne communicable diseases,
access to vital services and substantial increases in malnutrition rates and conflict-related trauma.
There is no doubt that the system faces a unique set of challenges related to occupation
including, but not limited to, elevated levels of insecurity, fiscal pressures and restrictions on
mobility. The Bank completed an in-depth review of health sector financing and is currently
working with the MOH to disseminate key findings of this review such as a fragmented
institutional framework, unpredictable health financing and donor dependence, and increased
burden of disease. The MOH is in the process of preparing a 2011- 2013 Health Sector Strategy
to address these issues and build a strategic management capacity to reform health financing
among other things and increase the quality and affordability of public health care.

45.    The PRDP recognizes an urgent need to implement proactive programs to empower
youth and women in the Palestinian society and to help alleviate unemployment and poverty
through employment generation initiatives. The PRDP calls for a "Women's Empowerment"
(WE) program and a "Youth Empowerment" (YE) program to assist women and youth. These
are supposed to be coupled with an "Employment Generation Initiative" (EGI) to provide
productive, paid employment and micro-financing programs to unemployed and vulnerable
people across the West Bank and Gaza. There has been little movement on this front; however
the PA sees the small scale infrastructure projects supported by the community development
grants as being linked to this agenda, as they are intended to be labor intensive. While these
programs are important elements of the PRDP, they are not specifically supported by the Bank's
DPGs.

C.     ECONOMIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

46.      The PRDP envisions a dynamic private sector as the engine of economic growth in
WBG. Private sector growth is necessary to provide jobs for the rapidly expanding population
and tax revenues to support service provision by the PA. The PRDP contends that the Palestinian
economy has enormous potential for future growth and a revival from its current condition is
urgently needed. However, political uncertainty, combined with continued settlement expansion,
restrictions on movement and trade, and restrictions on access to resources, have strangled
investment and stripped the economy of the bulk of its productive capacity. In 2009, economic
growth revived in the West Bank but much of this growth can be attributed to increased
government spending instead of high levels of private sector investment. However, increased
investment in construction, the recent start of operation by the second mobile operator and
increased access of Israeli citizens to the West Bank are promising indicators of a slowly
improving business environment.

47.    Recognizing the centrality of private sector development, the PA is taking what steps it
can to revive private investment. The PA and the private sector collaborated to highlight
                                                - 21 -


investment opportunities in WBG in the second Palestine Investment Conference held in June,
2010. The new Minister of National Economy has made improving the business environment a
high priority. In 2010, the PA amended the Companies law, passed a secured lending law and
has taken steps to make business registration easier. In the coming year, the PA expects
substantial support from USAID and other donors for its work on the business environment. The
PA is also taking steps to spur growth by encouraging private public partnerships in
infrastructure projects and in the housing sector. There are already a number of large housing
projects being undertaken by private investors that are being facilitated by the PA. One of the
most important recent developments has been the reorientation of the Palestine Investment Fund
(PIF). Previously, this large investment fund held most of its assets outside of WBG and used its
dividends for the benefit of the Palestinian people. However, now it has brought home much of
its portfolio and is aiming to have up to 80 percent of its more than US$800 million in assets
invested in WBG. Among other things the PIF has partnered in a large loan guarantee fund, an
affordable mortgage and loan program, a number of housing projects and some smaller
businesses. In the coming year, the PIF plans to launch the first private equity fund in WBG.
Despite these substantial efforts, there is only so much the PA can do. Ultimately, private sector
growth, and the sustainability of the PA will depend upon improvements in the security
environment and the GOI reducing its restrictions.

D.     PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

48.     After years of conflict and under-development, Palestinian public infrastructure networks
and systems offer limited coverage, are poor in quality and are unaffordable for some vulnerable
groups. Household connection rates to utilities are high compared to the regional average but
actual consumption rates are low due to a combination of supply shortages and inefficient
distribution systems. Accordingly, substantial investment in public infrastructure is required.
Over the long-term, the PA will work towards ensuring that public infrastructure and utilities are
managed on a commercially-oriented and financially viable basis and, over time, increase the
level of private sector investment and participation in infrastructure and utilities. Again, this area
is not directly supported by the Bank's DPGs beyond issues related to net lending; however, the
Bank is active in a number of sectors including power, water and to a limited extent transport.

E.     CONSULTATIONS

49.     The PRDP has been successful because it was developed through wide ranging
discussions and consultations that included all stakeholders ranging from government agencies to
civil society. Working groups, that included representatives for all major stakeholders were
formed for different sectors such as health and education. The working groups drafted plans for
the sectors, which were forwarded to the Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development
(MOPAD). The MOPAD then pulled all of the sector plans together to complete the PRDP.
Once the PRDP was drafted, it was widely circulated and commented upon before it was
adopted. Because of the extensive consultations, the PRDP is generally accepted and has strong
support across the full spectrum of Palestinian society and within the donor community. The PA
                                             - 22 -


is currently taking a similar approach as it develops the new National Plan that will succeed the
PRDP.

50.     Many of the specific reforms supported by DPG III are quite sensitive. Therefore, the PA
continued to hold consultations to develop popular support for specific actions. Municipalities
were concerned that transferring electricity distribution would deprive them of funds they relied
on to provide basic public services. To gain a better understanding of this issue and develop a
strategy to address it, the Ministry of Local Government (MOLG), MOF and municipalities had
many meetings and conferences. Often the MDLF and World Bank assisted this effort by
holding workshops on the importance of electricity revenues for municipal finances and how
could the negative impact of the transfer be mitigated. Specific consultations on the transfer of
electricity distribution include:

       On November 16, 2009, the MOLG and the Bank presented the issue of municipal
       electricity arrears to the Municipal and Local Government Sector Working Group
       composed of key PA and donor actors in the municipal sector and discussed possible
       options/solutions.

       On February 17, 2010, the Bank team sponsored a large consultation with mayors,
       financial managers and directors of municipalities (over 50 participants attended) as well
       as representatives of the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority (PENRA),
       MOF, MOLG, MOPAD and donors. The consultation was based on the findings of Bank
       report which highlighted that electricity service provision places a soft budgetary
       constraint on municipalities: on average municipalities that provide electricity have fewer
       sources and collect less revenue than those which do not; they also tend to have higher
       deficits. This highlighted the need to establish hard budgetary constraints and to design
       policies that would mitigate the shock of transferring electricity distribution from local
       governments to commercially run companies.

       March 23 through March 25, 2010, the Bank team held bilateral consultations with seven
       municipalities (Jenin, Nablus, Beita, Ya'bad, Al Yamoon, Anabta and North Aseera) that
       will be directly impacted by the transfer. The consultations were to help the
       municipalities develop measures to mitigate the negative impact of the transfer on service
       delivery.

       On April 27, 2010, the Bank team had consultations with MOLG, MDLF, PENRA, and
       MOF to explore options on electricity transfer with a goal of minimizing the cost of
       losing electricity cash flow.
51.     In addition to the consultations listed above, the MDLF and Bank team sponsored
additional workshops where recent studies on the impact of introducing prepaid meters and the
importance of electricity revenues in municipal finance plans were presented. As the transfer of
distribution moves forward, PENRA plans to continue holding workshops and public meetings.
                                             - 23 -


52.     The outcome of the consultation process on transferring electricity distribution has been
the recognition by local governments that they cannot continue to rely on electricity revenues to
support operating expenses. The PA in turn has developed a better understanding of the financial
support required by local governments to help them transition from their reliance on electricity
revenues. Many issues remain to be resolved including how to value electricity assets, deal with
pensions for employees in the electricity sector, etc. But a robust consultation mechanism has
been established that will allow these issues to be effectively dealt with.

53.    Merging the cash assistance programs was another reform that the PA prepared for, by
holding extensive discussions with stakeholders. MOSA held four consultation workshops
across WBG to present the new cash transfer strategy. The workshops were held with relevant
stakeholders from NGOs, the private sector, civil society, local governments and beneficiaries.
MOSA supplied detailed minutes and recommendations from the workshops to the Bank team
that was preparing the second global food price crisis response grant in February 2010. The
consultations focused on explaining to the beneficiaries the new program benefit levels, how the
PMT formula was updated, which variables were added, changed or removed, the overall merger
with the EU program, and the reference to using 2007 PCBS households and expenditure survey.
Most importantly, they also discussed the phasing out process for households above the extreme
poverty line and the various programs into which they will be channelled, e.g. micro-finance.
MOSA is continuing to hold consultations as it makes additional changes to its cash assistance
programs.

54.     The PA has held extensive discussions on pension reform and again the Bank encouraged
and supported some of these. The MOF and Palestinian Pension Agency (PPA) technical staff
met regularly to develop the plan. One major meeting took place in October 2009 where the
Bank team presented its analysis on the sustainability of the current pension scheme and the
impact of possible parametric changes. In addition, the Prime Minister's budget speech makes
clear, that in lines with the PRDP, public pension reform is a high priority for the current
government. On July 26, 2010, the MOF and PPA hosted a forum on the pension reform plan. In
attendance were members of the Pension Governing Board, AMAN (local governance NGO),
Public Workers Union, Retirees Association and other members of civil society. The PPA team
made a presentation on the plan followed by open discussion, where a number of issues were
raised including:

       Is the purpose of the reform to merely save government resources or in the interest of the
       retirees? The PPA team explained that it was the government's attempt to ensure the
       sustainability of the Pension Fund and to protect future retirees. The MOF team also
       added that the PA's fiscal situation requires some retrenchment in pension outlays, and
       that the reform was in line with best international practices.
       Some in attendance questioned the elimination of early retirement and the lengthening of
       the retirement age. The PPA team cited several examples on why that was necessary and
       added that a number of industrial countries are doing the same.
                                                      - 24 -


        Another important point discussed was that the pension system is intricately linked with
        the Civil Administration Law. Some representatives argued that before moving on
        pension reform the PA should reform the Civil Administration procedures.
        The meeting also discussed and explained the proposal to move towards a Notional
        Defined Contribution in the proposal.
By the end of the meeting, all who attended had a thorough understanding of the proposed plan
the MOF and PPA were give significant feedback from the principal stakeholders.


                            Box 1: Bank Disclosure Procedures and Consultations

 The World Bank is committed to providing timely and full disclosure of its projects and actions to all
 stakeholders. In September 2009, the MENA Region presented an action plan to the Bank's Board of Directors
 detailing renewed efforts to implement the Bank's policies on disclosure and consultations. Among other things,
 the Action Plan calls for the Bank to provide translation of core operational documents (PIDs, PADs and PDs)
 into Arabic in countries where Arabic is the main business language. Consequently, all of the relevant
 documents for the DPG III will be translated into Arabic and made publicly available.

 The action plan also calls for Country Directors, Country Managers and Task Team Leaders to strengthen
 outreach to civil society stakeholders. The Bank's West Bank and Gaza maintains a directory of civil society
 organizations to assist Bank project teams as they conduct outreach to local society. In preparation of the DPG
 III, Bank teams consulted widely with all major stakeholders in the areas supported by the operation, including
 social safety net reform, electricity sector reform and municipal finance. The Bank will continue to engage with
 civil society as it supports the PA's reform process.




              IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS

55.    Since WBG is not a member country of the World Bank, there is no formal Country
Assistance Strategy. Instead, the Bank relies on strategy notes to guide its work and keep the
Executive Directors informed on activities. The latest Interim Strategy Note was developed
simultaneously with the preparation of the PRDP DPG I. The strategy was presented to the Bank
Board on April 22, 2008 and is designed to remain valid through 2010.

56.     The current strategy emphasizes the Bank's desire to carefully target its limited resources
to areas where the Bank can be most effective or can leverage additional donor funds. In addition
to supporting the implementation of the PRDP through untied budget support, under the most
recent replenishment, the Bank will devote additional resources to education, solid waste,
municipal finance, community development and the NGO sector.

57.      Along with grants, the strategy calls for the Bank to use its analytical ability and technical
assistance to leverage other donor funds. The Bank is continuing its work monitoring
restrictions on movement and access to resources and their impact on the economy. The Bank
has recently completed a study on access to water in WBG and a major poverty study is ongoing.
                                              - 25 -


The Bank continues to provide technical assistance to the telecommunications sector, PPA,
PCBS, and PMA where it is helping the PMA team design, acquire and implement an electronic
payments system as well as design a deposit insurance scheme. While the Bank will not be able
to devote significant resources to these areas, this analytical work has mobilized support from
other donors.

58.     The main effort of the Bank's strategy is to continue supporting the PA's implementation
of the PRDP through the proposed PRDP DPG III. The PRDP's success depends upon three
critical factors: (i) the PA effectively carrying out promised reforms; (ii) GOI relaxing the
closure regime to allow private sector growth; and (iii) the international donor community
providing full support for the PA's recurrent budget. There is little the Bank can do on the
second factor. Consequently, the Bank is focusing its efforts on the first and third factors. The
Bank continues to provide significant amounts of technical assistance to help the PA implement
its reforms. Through its ongoing policy dialogue, it is providing the government with advice and
encouragement to remain on track. But the Bank's most effective efforts are directed at
encouraging donor funding of the recurrent budget. The Bank, in consultation with the IMF,
produces quarterly reports on reform progress that provide donors comfort to increase their
support through the Central Treasury Account (CTA). This has been a successful effort as the
PA received nearly US$1.355 billion in budget support in 2009; over US$107 million of which
was provided through the Bank managed PRDP-TF. This proposed third DPG is designed to
both help the PA close its fiscal gap and to encourage donors to continue to provide untied
budget support through the CTA.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

59.      The Bank works closely with the IMF and other donors to support the PA's
implementation of the PRDP. As mentioned above, the Bank consults with the IMF when it
issues quarterly reports assessing the PA's progress on implementing the PRDP. To enable this,
the IMF team was closely involved in the development of the policy matrices for the Bank's
DPGs including DPG III. In WBG, the IMF and World Bank have a complementary division of
labor and constantly share information and consult on policy advice to the PA. The IMF
monitors the macro framework and helps the PA produce accurate and timely accounts. The
Bank also monitors the overall macro environment, but it concentrates on helping the PA address
the underlying structural issues such as what is driving net lending, transfer payments or pension
arrears.

60.    The IMF has resumed full contact with the PA following the establishment of the
Caretaker Government in June 2007 and is providing technical assistance on a variety of issues.
The IMF helped the PA produce the macroeconomic framework used in the PRDP and continues
to work with them to regularly update the macro-economic projections. The IMF also provides
technical assistance to strengthen public financial management and in doing so works closely
with the Bank's resident PFM expert and draws on analytical work done for the Bank's recent
Public Expenditure Review. The IMF's report on PFM was instrumental in developing the PFM
                                              - 26 -


section of the DPG III policy matrix. The IMF is providing technical assistance to PCBS to help
them develop better basic statistics. Here again, the Bank and the IMF collaborate closely.
Good basic economic data is essential to monitor progress of the PRDP reforms. Therefore, the
Bank has provided funding to support building the capacity of the PCBS. In this effort, the Bank
is coordinating closely with the IMF statistics team to identify exactly how the funds are best
utilized.

61.     The PA receives an enormous amount of external financial and technical assistance from
a wide variety of sources. The PA prepares its budget based upon its needs and previous donor
pledges. Throughout the year, the PA, along with the IMF monitors actual contributions and
seeks to encourage donors to fulfil their pledges. To help coordinate these disparate efforts, the
Bank participates in a robust system of donor working groups. The Bank co-chairs the
Economic Sector Working Group, which seeks to harmonize and coordinate the activities of the
various donors on all aspects related to public financial management, budget support, and fiscal
policy. The single largest source of budget support comes from the EU Palestinian-European
Socio-Economic Management and Assistance Mechanism (PEGASE) program and the Bank
coordinates its activities closely with the EU and other providers of budget support through the
working group. In addition, the efforts of the EU and other donors are informed by the Bank's
quarterly reports on the PA's reform progress.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

62.     The Bank's ongoing portfolio consists of 11 projects focusing on budget support,
electricity, water and sanitation, education, solid waste, municipal finance, community
development and the NGO sector with a net commitment amount of US$179 million. In addition
to this proposed PRDP DPG III, there are four other projects either approved or in the pipeline
for FY2010:

       Teacher Education Improvement Project. Objective: To improve the quality of
       teaching in general education schools in WBG and in doing so contribute to enhancing
       students' learning.
       North Gaza Emergency Sewage Additional Financing II. Objective: to provide a
       longer-term solution to the treatment of wastewater for north Gaza.
       Capacity-Building for Palestinian Economic and Regulatory Institutions. Objective:
       to improve the economic management and regulatory capacity of key Palestinian public
       institutions.
       Palestinian NGO IV. Objective: To provide social services to those who are poor,
       vulnerable or marginalized through NGOs and to strengthen the institutional capacity of
       these organizations.

63.    The proposed DPG III is integrally tied to the Bank's other projects in WBG and the
conditionality called for in the policy matrix complements the other projects. For example, the
provisions on net lending are in line with the proposals of the Electric Utility Management
                                             - 27 -


Project and the actions on the social safety net conditions are likewise drawn from the Social
Safety Net Reform Program. The Capacity Building Project directly supports the PPA and will
assist the PA in implementing its pension reform plan. It also helps develop the PA's ability to
monitor its economic performance.

64.      The Bank's analytical and policy work has from the outset laid the basis for its role in
WBG. Without large resources of its own, the Bank seeks to leverage other donors' funds and
one of the primary ways of doing so is by producing high quality analytical work and technical
assistance. This has been particularly important for generating budget support. The Bank's
support to the PMA has helped give donors confidence to use the banking system and
consequently the CTA. Technical assistance to the Pensions Authority has assisted the PA in
producing their action plan. More importantly, the Bank's robust technical assistance program on
municipal finance has been instrumental in helping the PA solve complicated issues around
transferring electricity distribution from local governments to the distributions companies. In
addition, the Bank projects such as the SSNRP and Electricity project have helped improve
internal PA capabilities thereby increasing donors' confidence to use PA systems.

LESSONS LEARNED AND REFORM PROGRESS

65.     The PRDP DPG III draws on lessons from the Bank's extensive experience of providing
budget support to the PA. The most recent experience comes from the PRDP DPG I and PRDP
DPG II, which were disbursed in June 2008 and July 2009 respectively. The Bank is currently
managing the PRDP-TF, which allows donors to provide budget support based on the Bank's
monitoring of the PA's progress on implementing the PRDP. Also, from 2004-06, the Bank
managed a multi-donor trust fund called the Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund
for the West Bank and Gaza ("The Reform Trust Fund"). This trust fund provided untied budget
support that was disbursed based upon the satisfactory meeting of reform benchmarks agreed to
between the donors and the PA. The DPG series has been successful at supporting PA structural
reforms. As discussed in Section III above and seen in Annex ?, the PA has made progress on
controlling growth of the public sector wage bill, reducing net lending and increasing the
efficiency of the social safety net. In addition, there have been substantial improvements in the
PFM system.

66.     The success of the proposed PRDP DPG III depends upon the PA being fully committed
to the reform goals. The Bank has a large body of evidence accumulated over decades of
development experience around the world, which shows that for successful reform, goals cannot
be imposed from the outside or be established in response to donor pressure. The previous
Reform Trust Fund was less successful than hoped because, while the benchmarks were
negotiated with the MOF, there was less buy-in from other ministries. Learning from this
experience, the MOPAD developed the PRDP in close consultation with all ministries and
various advisory groups that included civil society and set goals that were expected to be
politically and technically feasible. This careful preparation has paid off and over the past two
years, the PA has made steady progress in implementing the PRDP reforms supported by the
                                               - 28 -


PRDP DPG I and PRDP DPG II. They have also developed a system to keep donors regularly
informed on progress, via regular reports and an improved MOF website.

67.     The areas where the PA has had the most success are in controlling the wage bill and
rebuilding financial management capabilities. Indeed, the PA held the wage bill below the 2008
budget target and barely exceeded the 2009 budget target. The MOF resumed publishing revenue
and expenditure statements and introduced a number of other improvements in public financial
management. The PA has also made progress on enhancing the social safety net targeting
system. Net lending fell by nearly a third between 2007 and 2009 is projected to continue falling
as the PA takes more actions in Gaza. The PA has been less successful at tackling particularly
difficult issues such as pension reform. It is clear from past experience that this is something that
has to be done on a step by step basis after careful preparation and consultation. Consequently,
the newly adopted pension reform plan will be slowly implemented over the coming years.

68.     The highly volatile political situation makes it difficult to hold the PA to specific
benchmarks set years in advance. If the political situation deteriorates and violence resumes,
government reforms may stall, the private sector will again fall into decline and the PA will not
be able to meet its fiscal targets no matter how committed to reform. Passing legislation remains
difficult as the Palestinian Legislative Council does not meet. Changes in the donors' political
views also affect their willingness to meet their pledges or to hold fast to specific benchmarks.
Given these challenges, recent experience suggests that the best approach is to select a mix of
measures to deepen reform while also taking advantage of quick wins. While quantitative goals
should be set, the PA should be assessed on its progress towards achieving overall reform goals
in view of the current political situation and not be tied to specific quantitative benchmarks that
they may fail to meet due to circumstances beyond their control. This approach was successfully
used in the PRDP DPG I and DPG II and will be continued under the third DPG.

69.     Experience from both the PRDP-TF and the previous DPGs has revealed that it is
challenging to verify reform progress in a fully satisfactory manner. The management capacity
in many ministries is still developing and in the case of the Reform Trust Fund, it was at times
difficult for the PA to provide timely documentation to verify that they had or had not achieved
their goals. Consequently, the Bank was more deeply engaged in the PRDP DPG I and DPG II.
The leadership for the PRDP DPGs was located in the Bank's country office and the Bank
brought in a PFM expert to be resident in the country office and work extensively on the policy
dialogue. This same model will be continued for the PRDP DPG III.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

70.     The proposed PRDP DPG III is grounded in careful analytical work of which one of the
most significant pieces remains the World Bank's Public Expenditure Review (PER). The PER
was completed in early 2007 and details the PA's desperate fiscal position. It takes a more
strategic view of Palestinian public finances and addresses two critical and fundamental issues
that confront the PA and its partners. The first is the challenge of bringing aggregate expenditure
                                                        - 29 -


closer to likely revenues and available financing. Second, is the issue of the composition of
expenditure, and hence its overall efficiency. In addition, the PER provides an in-depth analysis
of the public financial management system and provides specific policy recommendations, many
of which have been incorporated in the PRDP. While it may seem somewhat dated, it remains
highly relevant. There has been a large amount of follow up work by both the Bank and the IMF
and the main findings of the PER are still accurate and serve as a good guide to policy. For
example ongoing analytical work on the civil service system is updating much of the PER and
verifying that its main recommendations are still valid.

71.    The IMF has done substantial analysis of the macro framework and the public financial
management (PFM) system, which complements the findings of the PER. The IMF's analysis is
summarized in bi- annual reports, the most recent of which was produced for the Ad Hoc Liaison
Committee meeting in April 2010. The IMF reports that the Palestinian public financial
management and procurement systems were restored to the level that they were prior to the
Hamas government and that the PA has made a number of improvements beyond that. In
December 2009, the IMF completed another PFM mission and in consultation with the PA,
updated a detailed action plan to improve the PFM system. This action plan focused mainly on
the accounting and budget execution systems and is reflected in the attached policy matrix. To
support the plan, the IMF has conducted follow on missions to assist with the implementation of
the new computerized accounting system and the introduction of cash planning.

72.     In March 2009, the IMF conducted a mission which focused primarily on budget
preparation issues but also reviewed progress on the earlier action plan. This mission gave
particular attention to the way the budget preparation is organised by the Ministries of Planning
and Finance, and the proposed budget program budgeting reforms. A further follow up mission
took place in December 2009.

73.     The Bank has produced a number of other analytical pieces that inform both the PRDP
and proposed PRDP DPG III. The Bank's power sector review has been used to help set the
goals for reforming the power sector. In addition, Bank staff compiled all available information
and produced a short report on how the PA can tackle the problem of unpaid utility bills and
reduce net lending.10 To extend this work, the Bank supported a report on the impact of pre-paid
meters on municipalities and another paper that analyzes municipal finances and the importance
of electricity revenues in municipal budgets for funding current operations. This paper reveals
that electricity revenues are only important for a small number of local governments and the
issue of unpaid bills is not as widespread as originally thought. In addition, the Bank supported a
just completed paper that analyzes the major expenditures and sources of revenue for

10
  Net lending refers to the PA's financial support to municipalities and other public entities, chiefly to cover utility
expenses. These outlays are recorded as "net lending" because they notionally should be repaid and are therefore
considered assets by the PA. Net Lending is conducted in two ways: 1) the PA provides cash to entities; and 2) GOI
deducts from the tax clearance revenues what the municipalities owe in utility payments. The majority of net
lending consists of payments for electricity, rebates to the Palestinian Petroleum Agency for part of the taxes it
incurs on fuel purchases and purchases of fuel for the Gaza Power Plant.
                                              - 30 -


municipalities. The PA will only be able to achieve budget sustainability if the private sector
grows. To provide an understanding of the constraints to private sector growth, the Bank
completed an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in 2007. The ICA, along with on-going
analytical work on movement and access showed concretely the impact of the GOI's closure
regime on the private sector. In October 2009, the Bank finalized a short paper on pension
reform. This paper examined the current PA public sector pension system and analyzed possible
parametric changes. The PA relied on this report along with supplementary analysis in
developing its pension reform plan.

74.     In 2004, the Bank and PA conducted the first Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR) for WBG. This report analyzed the public procurement system, including its policies,
organizations, procedures and practices. The report also made a number of recommendations to
assist the PA in improving its public procurement system. In June 2008, the Bank produced a
Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP) to assess the current state of the system. The CPIP
essentially confirmed the findings of the earlier. In 2009, the Bank initiated a Country Fiduciary
Assessment that combines both the financial management and procurement assessment tools.
However, in view of the large number of financial management reforms in the process of
implementation, it was decided to postpone completion of the assessment till 2010.


   V.      THE PROPOSED PALESTINIAN REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN
                       DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT III

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

The proposed operation will help the PA continue to implement the PRDP. Following on the
DPG I and DPG II, the DPG III will also support efforts to strengthen the fiscal position and
increase government transparency and accountability.

75.     The proposed operation is designed to support the PA as it continues to implement the
reform program detailed in the PRDP, by supporting actions in two policy areas: (i)
strengthening the fiscal position and (ii) improving public financial management. The PA
implemented the plan throughout 2008, 2009 and the first half of 2010. As detailed in World
Bank monitoring reports, the PA is making steady progress. To have the largest impact, the
proposed PRDP DPG III maintains the focus on the same two policy areas supported by the
previous operations. These are critical building blocks for the government of an independent
Palestinian state and are also crucial for attracting continued international donor support. The
Bank's involvement in monitoring and providing technical assistance for the reform agenda
described in previous operations' policy matrices has helped strengthen the PA's capacity to
achieve its desired reforms and to also build the required support among donors. This third
operation is expected to have a similar impact. The prior actions for the past two DPGs and how
they relate to the prior actions for DPG III can be found in Annex 3.
                                              - 31 -


76.     The Bank supports the PRDP process in two complementary ways. First, it administers
the PRDP-TF, as requested by the PA. Second, it will provide additional budget support with its
own funds through the proposed PRDP DPG III. The PRDP-TF is operating successfully and
since its inception has disbursed nearly US$500 million in untied budget support to the PA CTA.
The PRDP DPG III is a single tranche operation for which the related funds will be released on
completion of the prior actions discussed below. Releases from the PRDP-TF are made on a
quarterly basis, provided the Bank is satisfied with the PA's progress towards the PRDP's reform
goals, which are evaluated by the Bank in consultation with the IMF ­ currently on the basis of
indicators of progress for the PRDP DPG II and going forward, on the basis of indicators set out
in the policy matrix for the PRDP DPG III attached as Annex 2 to this report. Additional
disbursements from the PRDP-TF may be made on the written request of the PLO in
extraordinary situations which, in the opinion of the Bank, would justify additional
disbursements. It is envisioned that if the PA continues to make progress on their reform agenda
and there is available funding, then the Bank may be asked to provide additional DPGs.
However, given the unstable nature of the political environment and the uncertain size of future
Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB) replenishments, this remains a single tranche
operation.

77.     At the request of the PA, the Bank, in consultation with the IMF, will continue to provide
reports detailing the status of the reform process. These reports are used not only by the Bank to
determine whether to release the funds from the PRDP-TF, but also by a variety of other donors
to inform their decisions on support to the PA. The donor community expects to see the PA
continue to make significant strides towards controlling its budget deficit by controlling the wage
bill and reducing net lending. The PA has committed to reducing the wage bill from around 27
percent of GDP in 2007 to less than 23 percent by 2010. The change in total net lending will
depend on the cost of fuel, electricity demand and how soon the PA can regain control of Gaza.
However, currently the PA is projecting that net lending will decline from around US$535
million in 2007 to about US$250 million by 2010 and to US$224 million in 2012. The PA has
also committed to strengthening the PFM system by improving the standard accounting system
used across all ministries, producing budgets in a transparent manner, improving commitment
controls, and continuing to publish accounts that are subject to external audit.

POLICY AREAS

i) Strengthening the Fiscal Position

Prior Action 1: The 2010 Budget Law of the Palestinian Authority includes provisions to ensure
that all promotions in the Palestinian Authority are supported by adequate budget allocations.

78.      Wages and salaries are the largest expenditure in the PA budget and until recently were
the fastest growing component of the budget. By 2007, wages and salaries for public employees
exceeded total domestic revenues and were continuing to grow. Consequently, the Prime
Minister and his team determined that to strengthen the fiscal position, it is essential that they
                                              - 32 -


control the public work force. The PA has made progress and has brought the wage bill down
from more than 25 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 24 percent in 2009. Continuing to hold the
line on employment and the wage bill is a prerequisite for achieving the macroeconomic stability
required by the PRDP. To gain control of the wage bill and bring it in line with the PRDP plan,
the Caretaker Government has instituted a number of reforms. The 2010 Budget law includes
provisions to ensure that all promotions in the PA are supported by adequate budget allocations.
Later in the year, the PA plans to introduce a new integrated human resources and payroll
system, which will streamline and automate personnel actions. These actions combined with
earlier reforms will help control the wage bill and are substantial steps towards achieving the
budget projections of reducing the public sector wage bill to less than 23 percent by 2010 and
less than 19 percent in 2012.

79.     To maintain progress, the PA must keep a tight lid on new hiring and the 2010 budget
commits the PA to hold to the PRDP commitment to annually make only 3,000 new net hires.
Because of the sharp and unexpected rise in inflation in 2008, the PA was not able to stick to its
PRDP commitment of no general wage increase and the 2009 budget provided a 4 percent
increase. The 2010 budget also contains a 4 percent pay rise and the Minister of Finance has
indicated that the PA will continue to follow a policy of providing small annual general salary
increases.

Prior Action 2: The Council of Ministers adopted a plan for pension reform that seeks to
control the growth of pension liabilities.

Prior Action 3: The Council of Ministers adopted decision to ensure that Palestinian Authority
employees may not draw pensions until they reach statutory retirement age.

80.     The PA public pension system is extremely generous and one of the PA's largest and
growing liabilities. Currently, it is unfunded and effectively operates as a pay-as-you go system
where current employees' contributions are used to support payments to retirees. This is not
sustainable and consequently in July 2010 the Council of Ministers adopted a public pension
reform action plan that seeks to limit the growth of pension liabilities. To begin implementation
of this plan, the Council of Ministers adopted a parametric change in 2010 that forbids drawing
pensions before the statutory retirement age. The ending of early retirement is expected to save at
least NIS21 million annually. Going forward, among other things, the action plan calls for an
increase in the retirement ages, centralization of administrative records, and for the PA to
investigate the options of converting to a Notional Defined Benefit system.

Net Lending
81.     Net lending is one of the largest single expenditures in the budget and its largest
component is the cost of electricity delivered to the municipalities from the IEC for distribution
to consumers but not paid for by the municipalities. This debt to IEC is deducted by the GOI
from the tax revenues they collect for the PA. This situation is very costly and the PA has been
making a concerted effort to control it. Net lending dropped from NIS2.2 billion in 2007 to about
                                                     - 33 -


NIS1.9 billion in 2009. Because of the PA's reforms, it is projected to fall to NIS850 or about 2.5
percent of GDP in 2012.

82.      By 2007, a culture of non-payment had taken hold in large parts of WBG and over the
past three years the PA has taken steps to increase collection rates for electricity and re-establish
a culture of payment. The PA instituted a system of requiring citizens to show "certificates of
payment" (COP) attesting that they are current on utility bills to receive some government
services. The PA also began deducting utility payments from the pay checks of delinquent PA
employees. By far, the most effective step has been the introduction of pre-paid meters and the
PA reports that it has distributed nearly 170,000 in the West Bank and in 2010, began to send
some for installation in Gaza. Collection rates in the West Bank are reported to have risen to as
high as 80 percent in some local areas and PENRA sees little room to increase them as long as
residents of refugee camps remain exempt from efforts to collect payment.

                                Box 2: Prior Actions For The PRDP DPG III

 Prior Action 1: The 2010 Budget Law of the Palestinian Authority includes provisions to ensure that all
 promotions in the Palestinian Authority are supported by adequate budget allocations.
 Prior Action 2: The Council of Ministers adopted a plan for pension reform that seeks to control the growth of
 pension liabilities.
 Prior Action 3: The Council of Ministers adopted decision to ensure that Palestinian Authority employees may
 not draw pensions until they reach statutory retirement age.
 Prior Action 4: Electricity distribution in Nablus municipality transferred to NEDCO and NEDCO is effectively
 operating.
 Prior Action 5: SSNRP and SHC cash assistance programs merged into the PNCTP that is operating using a
 single payment modality in the West Bank.
 Prior Action 6: In 2009, the Palestinian Authority expanded the number of municipalities in which it collects
 property tax from 25 to 34 municipalities.
 Prior Action 7: A new economic and administrative budget classification has been developed for use in the
 preparation of the 2011 budget and is aligned with the economic classification based on the GFSM 2001
 structure.
 Prior Action 8: All line ministries are connected to the new computerized financial management system.
 Prior Action 9: New module for commitment control introduced into the Ministry of Finance's computerized
 accounting system to provide more control over capital expenditures.
 Prior Action 10: The Palestinian Authority's 2008 financial statements are prepared and submitted for audit to
 the Palestinian Authority's State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau.




83.     The problem of net lending for electricity will not be completely solved in the West Bank
until electricity distribution is moved from local governments to commercially run distribution
companies. In May 2009, the PA adopted a new electricity law that among other things
established a new regulator and called for the transfer of electricity distribution to licensed
distributors, i.e. distribution companies, by June 2010. Because of the difficulty to this
                                              - 34 -


undertaking, the PA will not meet the mid- 2010 target. However, led by PENRA, the PA is now
moving steadily ahead on making the transfers. The first critical step was to appoint the
members and activate the Palestinian Electricity Regulation Committee (PERC), which was done
in February 2010. Among other things, PERC will set operating standards for licensed
distributors and ensure they are operating on a commercial basis and not being used to subsidise
municipalities' current operations.

Prior Action 4: Electricity distribution in Nablus municipality transferred to NEDCO and
NEDCO is effectively operating.

84.       In previous years distribution companies were created throughout the West Bank: the
Jerusalem District Electricity Company (JDECO), the Southern Electric Company (SELCO), the
Hebron Electric Power Company (HEPCO) and the Northern Electric Distribution Company
(NEDCO). JDECO has been operating on a commercial basis for many years. HEPCO and
SELCO are operational but not on a fully commercial basis. NEDCO, ­ Northern Electric
Distribution Company ­ was established in 2008 to serve the northern West Bank but has not
been operational. Local governments in the Northern West Bank account for the largest share of
electricity net lending and this should cease once they all have transferred their distribution
systems to NEDCO and it becomes fully operational. In April 2010, the Council of Ministers
adopted a resolution directing that local governments transfer their electricity distribution and
affirming that the PA will provide funds to help local governments transition from their
dependence on electricity revenues. This has enabled the transfers to start. Nablus was the first
city transferred and NEDCO began operating, issuing bills and distributing electricity to Nablus
in June 2010. Over the next year to 18 months, PENRA expects to continue to supervise the
transfer of electricity distribution from local governments to the commercial companies
throughout the West Bank. This process will be done step by step beginning in the North and
then moving to the South. Within a year, PENRA expects that 80 percent of electricity
distribution in the Northern West Bank will be done through NEDCO. When the full transfer is
completed, net lending from electricity in the West Bank is expected to cease and the remaining
amounts will come from Gaza, where actions to reduce net lending have been hampered by the
political crisis.

Improve targeting of social safety net to ensure the most vulnerable populations are protected
85.     The push to increase collection rates raises the risk that the most vulnerable households
will not be able to afford electricity. However, the PA has committed to ensuring that all
households will have access to a basic level of service. Currently, no households are
disconnected for non-payment and households in refugee camps are still exempted from
payment. Some of the local governments have already established programs to assist the poor but
going forward the PERC has committed to working with PENRA to establish a lifeline tariff,
                                                     - 35 -


where a basic amount of domestic consumption is billed only at cost. This will allow for the
provision of a basic level of service at a minimum price for the poorest households.11

Prior Action 5: SSNRP and SHC cash assistance programs merged into the PNCTP that is
operating using a single payment modality in the West Bank.

86.      In addition to the lifeline tariff, the PA is continuing to improve its ability to effectively
target and deliver social assistance. The SSNRP and SHC cash assistance programs have been
merged into the Palestinian National Cash Transfer Program now using a single payment
modality in the West Bank. The new system uses a revised Proxy Means Test (PMT) formula
that was updated using 2007 PECS information and new cut-off points. The new PMT formula
requires that MOSA revisit households and update their data in the targeting database, while at
the same time visiting new homes. By June 2010, more than 40,000 households in the West
Bank had been verified using the new PMT and entered into the database. By the end of the year
another 15,000 are expected to be added. As households are verified, those above the absolute
poverty line will be phased out of the system and replaced by households who fall below.
Ultimately, only households below the absolute poverty line will be receiving cash transfers
while those with higher incomes will receive assistance from other programs. In 2010, MOSA
plans to begin payments to 4,000 new households that fall below the absolute poverty line the
West Bank. Adopting the PNCTP will not bring savings to the PA budget as new households
will be added, but it will improve efficiency and ensure that only the most needy are receiving
cash benefits. The political situation has prevented the households in Gaza from being revisited
and updated, however the MOSA hopes to be able to resume visits soon and by mid 2011, have
recertified using the new PMT all 24,000 households that are currently in the database in Gaza.
In the meantime, the old SSNRP and SHC systems continue to be implemented in parallel.

Improve Domestic Revenue Collection

Prior Action 6: In 2009, the Palestinian Authority expanded the number of municipalities in
which it collects property tax from 25 to 34 municipalities.

87.      The PA has made raising domestic revenue collection a key component of its strategy to
move toward fiscal sustainability. The PA expanded the collection of property tax and in 2009
increased coverage from 25 to 34 municipalities. In 2010, property tax collection is expected to
be rolled out to another 15 municipalities. At the same time that the coverage is being expanded,
the MOF has initiated a program to re-value property and in 2009 it re-valued properties in 15 of
the 25 municipalities originally covered by the tax. As a result of these actions, the MOF expects
property tax collections to rise from JD13.5 million in 2009 to JD23 million in 2010 and JD30
million in 2011.




11
  The PA has committed to doing this previously. However, without the activation of the PERC it was not possible.
Thus, it should be possible to do this within the next 18 months.
                                                      - 36 -


ii) Improving Public Financial Management

Prior Action 7: A new economic and administrative budget classification has been developed for
use in the preparation of the 2011 budget and is aligned with the economic classification based
on the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001 structure.

88.      Improved public financial management and greater transparency are necessary to not
only increase government's efficiency, but to attract donor support for untied budget support.
This is a top priority for the PRDP and the proposed PRDP DPG III. The program begins with
re-establishing basic controls and moves on to developing a system of internal and external
audits. Producing annual budgets in a transparent manner is a key component and the PA has re-
established its budgetary system and is regularly producing budgets again. The MOF has also
developed a new economic and administrative budget classification for use in the preparation of
the 2011 budget that is aligned with the economic classification based on the IMF's Government
Financial Statistics Manual 2001 structure.12 In the next year MOF expects to include an annex
to the 2011 budget that provides detailed financial information for all major development
expenditures.

Prior Action 8: All line ministries are connected to the new computerized financial management
system.

89.     The PA continues to strengthen its system of internal controls and improve the
accounting system. The MOF has completed connecting all line ministries to its computerized
accounting system. The completion of this system will allow the PA to both introduce new
controls on spending by line ministries and with a new budget module to streamline the
preparation of the budget. It is anticipated that the 2011 budget will be developed and adopted
by January of 2011. In 2010, the budget was not finalized until the end of March and the PA
operated for the first quarter of the year on the basis of the 2009 budget.13 The MOF has also
developed financial management policies and procedures for budget execution to support the
new computerized financial system. The implementation of the computerized system has allowed
the MOF to strengthen the CTA by closing all non-zero balance line ministry and agency bank
accounts for recurrent expenditures not required by donor agreements.

Prior Action 9: New module for commitment control introduced into the Ministry of Finance's
computerized accounting system to provide more control over capital expenditures.

90.      In the past, the MOF has not had mechanisms to control expenditures except for the
annual budget. As a result when expected external support did not arise, arrears accumulated.
Consequently the PA has had difficulty controlling growth in arrears, particularly in the capital
budget. In 2010, a new module for commitment control of capital expenditures was introduced
into the MOF's computerized accounting system. This will help limit accumulation of arrears by

12
   While GFSM 2001 is an accrual methodology the economic classification will be based on the cash accounting
system used in West Bank and Gaza.
13
   Law number 7 of 1998 on regulating the Public Budget and the Financial Affairs allows the PA to operate on the
basis of 1/12 of the prior year budget until the new budget is passed.
                                                     - 37 -


providing a mechanism for the MOF to restrict capital expenditures to available resources.
Because the MOF has not had a strong system of controls, it has been difficult for them to
accurately estimate arrears on a timely manner. For example, in 2009, more than US$142 million
in arrears were unexpectedly brought forward from 2008. The MOF has still not finalized
precise estimates of arrears for 2009 and thus it is not possible to specify how much the new
controls will reduce arrears in 2010, especially as they only were implemented in the middle of
the year. However, the new system should ensure that going forward, no commitments in the
capital budget can be incurred without approval of the MOF and this should not only reduce
arrears but also allow the MOF to report the position on a timelier basis.

Prior Action 10: The Palestinian Authority's 2008 financial statements are prepared and
submitted for audit to the Palestinian Authority's State Audit and Administrative Control
Bureau.

91.      Auditing and reporting remains an important feature in the PA's plan to strengthen
accountability. In 2009, the MOF accelerated its program of internal audits and among others
produced audits for Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Social Affairs, and Bureau of the
Chief Justice, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, Ministry of Interior, Palestinian
Land Authority, Ministry of Transportation and Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. Most
importantly, the MOF prepared its 2008 financial statements and sent them for audit to its
external auditor - the State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB). The SAACB is
currently finishing the audit with the assistance of Deloittes accounting firm. Compiling the 2008
accounts took more time than expected and many issues were encountered. However, with the
help of the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, the MOF has dealt
with these issues and in the future the financial statements will be prepared on a much timelier
manner. It is expected that the 2009 accounts will be prepared in line with the cash based
International Public Sector Accounting Standards and the audit will be completed before the end
of 2010.

                              Box 3: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

 Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
 Unlike previous reform plans, the PRDP was developed through wide consultations both within the Caretaker
 Government and with elements of civil society and is therefore fully owned by the PA. The policy actions
 supported by the operation focus on key measures that the Caretaker Government believes are necessary and
 politically possible for the success of the PRDP.
 Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated and accountability
 framework
 The policy matrix attached to this document was carefully discussed and coordinated between the PA, the IMF,
 the Bank and other key stakeholders. The matrix reflects the Government's priorities, progress made in the last
 year and lesson learned from the DPG I and II. Progress will continue to be monitored through quarterly reports
 detailing progress that the IMF and the Bank will review.
 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
 The reform program supported by the DPG III focuses on strengthening the fiscal stance of the PA. This will
 require continued support from the donor community and political commitment on the part of the authorities. The
                                                       - 38 -

 Bank is supporting these efforts by maintaining the PRDP-TF and through the proposed PRDP DPG III.
 Principle 4: Choose only actions that are critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 The PRDP is wide ranging and covers many sectors. However, the PA has asked the Bank to maintain its focus
 on two critical areas: 1) strengthening the PA's fiscal position and 2) improving public financial management.
 This focus allows the Bank's efforts to be more effective and to determine specific conditions that are both
 critical to the success and can be effectively monitored.
 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
 support
 The PA has committed to providing quarterly progress reviews that will be reviewed by the Bank in consultation
 with the IMF. Tranche releases from the PRDP-TF will be based upon these reviews. However, in exceptional
 circumstances when the PA requests it and the Bank agrees, emergency release may be made. Other donor
 agencies will also use the quarterly reviews to inform their own funding decisions. An important component of
 the PRDP is improving the PA's budget process and establishing a monitoring and evaluation program linked to
 the budget. This will allow predictable and performance based financial support.




                              VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

92.     A major focus of the PA's plan is to control growth in the government work force and
collect utility bills, both of which have the possibility of negatively impacting the most
vulnerable parts of society. A large share of the Palestinian population depends on the wages of
public employees. The dependency rate is estimated to be about 6-8 for each public employee
and there are currently about 150,000 employees. Consequently, if the private sector remains
stagnant and Israel does not allow increased employment of Palestinian workers in Israel, the
inability to increase public employment could lead to increased poverty rates. The economic
crisis has left many households in a position where they cannot pay their utility bills. As noted
above, by some measures over half the Gaza households and nearly a quarter of the West Bank
households are in poverty. Thus, increasing collection rates must be done carefully to not cause
undue hardships on the most vulnerable groups.

93.     The PA recognizes these risks, and as they pursue their PRDP goals, they will make
protecting vulnerable groups their top priority. Consequently, the PRDP DPG III will continue
to have social protection as one of its pillars. The PRDP DPG III actions are complementary to
and will likely enhance the performance of other Bank projects and PA programs such as the
SSNRP and the EUMP.

94.     To ensure the protection of the most vulnerable households, which are often those headed
by women, the PRDP DPG III is supporting the rapid expansion of the targeting data base and
unification of the main cash assistance plans by the MOSA. The Ministry has verified the status
of more than 40,000 households using the new PMT formula and is expecting to add another
15,000 in the West Bank and 24,000 in Gaza by mid-2011. This will help direct aid to the most
vulnerable households to ensure that those that might suffer the most from any negative impacts
                                              - 39 -


of the PRDP receive support. An accurate database and a unified system will help the PA
provide assistance to reduce any gender disparities since female headed households appear to be
one of the most vulnerable population groups. In addition, it is expected that the unified cash
assistance plan, combined with an accurate targeting database, will attract additional financing
from other donors. The implementation of the unified system will mean that some households
that were previously receiving benefits will be dropped since they no longer meet the minimum
requirements for cash assistance. To mitigate the effects of this, households will be provided
payments as they are removed from the system over time. In addition, they may be re-directed to
other social assistance programs including micro-finance, food assistance, temporary
employment generation programs, or vocational training activities.

95.     Efforts to collect electricity bills could negatively impact the most vulnerable groups.
However, the PA, with Bank support, is working to mitigate this risk. The pre-paid meters are
being installed in the more affluent areas first and no households are being disconnected for non-
payment. The Bank's team working on the power sector is ready to assist the PA to develop a
pricing policy and methods of collection that will allow the poorest consumers to still obtain
electricity while increasing collection from those more able to pay. The PA is investigating
options such as establishing a lifeline tariff that provides for basic needs at a minimal cost or
providing pre-paid cards to the poorest families. In the long run, as collection efforts increase,
pre-paid meters may benefit the poor. In many countries, the poorest households cannot afford
service on credit and the introduction of pre-paid meters actually increases access to electricity.

96.     The Bank's social protection team is working closely with the PA to implement its Social
Protection and Reform Integration Program. This program sets explicit quality and service
standards for both governmental and non-governmental providers and ensures uniform payment
modalities and amounts. Assessing the impact of PA programs requires good data on poverty
levels. The targeting database, with its variables to measure consumption, is one source. But the
PA needs the ability to asses overall poverty trends throughout WBG. The PCBS regularly
conducts the Palestinian Expenditure and Consumption Survey (PECS), which provides an
excellent source of information on household poverty including by gender. The Bank is
providing technical assistance to the PCBS to help it increase the reliability and accuracy of its
data; most notably it has an ongoing technical assistance program on poverty estimation. This
will allow it to be used to help monitor whether the PRDP actions are having a negative impact
on poverty and to target the social safety net to mitigate any such poverty increases. In addition,
the Bank's Capacity Building for Palestinian Economic and Regulatory Institutions project is
providing PCBS capacity building on its national accounts, data quality and agricultural census.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

97.    The PRDP DPG III operation will not have significant likely effects on the country's
environment, forests and other natural resources. The environmental and natural resource
implications are driven to a large extent by the nature of an operation. In the proposed operation,
none of the prior actions as listed in the policy matrix will have environmental impacts or risks.
                                            - 40 -


Additionally, the proposed PRDP DPG III does not have any investment lending subcomponent
involving physical investment. Although DPGs are not formally subject to Bank safeguards
Policies, a review of the environmental implications of this operation concluded that the PRDP
DPG III operation will not have significant effects on the country's environment, forests and
other natural resources.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

98.     As discussed above, the PA has asked the Bank to monitor progress on the PRDP and the
Bank will continue to do so based on the reforms described in the attached policy matrix. The
PA has been producing quarterly reports, which the Bank reviews in consultation with the IMF.
The Bank focuses on progress on structural reforms while the IMF provides detailed input on
fiscal and PFM issues. In the previous Reform Trust Fund, monitoring proved to be a major
challenge. Many of the benchmarks had been developed without input from the PA line
ministries and the Bank team was located in Washington. However, in PRDP DPG I and II, the
policy matrix was taken directly from the PRDP, which was developed after wide consultation
throughout the PA and among other stake holders. The policy matrix reflected what all parties
not only thought important but also achievable and what could be monitored. The PRDP DPG
III continues this approach. The matrix is drawn from the PRDP and reflects lessons learned
from the last operation.

99.    The Bank team managing the PRDP DPG III is located in WBG and is thus able to have
daily contact with their PA counterparts. The Bank team continues to include a Governance
Advisor who is a PFM expert at the Jerusalem office to work alongside the Country Economist
monitoring the PRDP DPG III. The task team leaders for the social safety net reform and
municipal finance assistance are also resident in the WBG office. The main ministries
responsible for implementing the reforms supported by the PRDP DPG III are the MOF, MOSA
and PENRA with which the Bank has developed a strong relationship. The PFM expert works
closely with the IMF mission to both provide assistance to the MOF and monitor progress on
budget related and PFM issues.

100. The MOSA must report on its achievements in building the social safety net as a part of
the SSNRP and the Bank team managing that project closely monitors these activities. For the
collection of utility fees, data must be collected from the regional distribution companies and
from PENRA. The Bank's power team works with these parties as part of the EUMP and will
thus be able to collect the required data and assess progress. The combination of close
cooperation with the IMF and other donors, the leveraging of other projects and careful
consultation in the preparatory phase of the PRDP DPG I and II across the entire PA eliminated
many of the difficulties monitoring progress that are encountered in the previous budget
operation. This will be continued for the PRDP DPG III.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management System

101. According to the last Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in
2004, the Palestinian PFM system is judged to be adequate insofar as the Bank's criteria and
standards for approval of a general budget support operations are concerned. The CFAA has also
concluded that the fiduciary risk level in the Palestinian PFM system was significant due to
weaknesses in the PFM systems. Recent IMF reports state that the PA's PFM system has
improved significantly beyond the level that it was in prior to the most recent elections in early
2006 and the cut-off in direct aid.

102. The CFAA and later follow-ups (by the Bank and other donors) reported major
improvements in the PFM systems of WBG. Notable improvements in PFM include the
following:

       (i)      Launch of the new accounting system that will help consolidate budget
                implementation process, strengthen payment controls and improve fiscal
                reporting.

       (ii)     All PA revenues are now paid into the CTA.

       (iii)    An orderly system of budgetary appropriation is now in force.

       (iv)     MOF is exercising firm control over budget expenditures and has imposed strict
                limits on non-wage expenditures.

       (v)      The MOF has placed financial controllers in each ministry.
                                             - 42 -


       (vi)    A central internal audit department was established in MoF and there is now a
               program to create internal audit departments in line ministries in line with the
               devolution of the payment function.

       The central treasury account has been strengthened and zero balance bank accounts have
       been established for line ministries with all other accounts except those required by
       donors closed.

       (vii)   The State Audit and Control Bureau is to receive substantial technical support to
               develop its capacity as an external audit agency as part of a new project of the
               European Union.

       (viii) Control over the civil service payroll has improved significantly. While there used
              to be separate payroll systems for West Bank and Gaza, and for civilian and
              security sectors these have now been consolidated. A link between the payroll
              and the accounting system has also been established allowing ensuring that all
              payments are checked against available budget.

       (ix)    System of direct salary deposit: The salaries of the PA's civil and security
               servants are all paid through direct deposit into personal employee bank accounts.
               The MOF is now exploring with the Palestinian Monetary Authority options to
               make non-wage expenditure payments through direct deposit.

       (x)     The establishment of the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF) has brought all PA
               equity holdings, including virtually all state-owned enterprises (SOEs), within a
               centralized and commercially-oriented management framework. PIF has annually
               been publishing its annual report and audited financial statements (for 2003 and
               after), and these are available on its website.

103.     However, much more remains to be done to further consolidate progress and address the
challenges facing the PFM systems. The PA has recently prepared a PFM reform strategy as an
input to the development of the Palestinian National Plan (a successor to the PRDP). The
strategy identifies reforms in a range of areas including tax administration, budget preparation,
budget execution and reporting, and audit:

       Further integration of donor programming into the annual development budget. Having
       donors channeling their funds through the CTA unless there are good reasons to the
       contrary, will require strong PA leadership and a much enhanced level of effort by donors
       to harmonize their planning, disbursement and procurement procedures with those of the
       PA.

       While the budget is now presented on the basis of ministry programs, the definition of the
       programs and their use for management and accountability purposes will need to be
       improved over time.
                                             - 43 -


       Although external audit development has started, building the capacity of the institution
       to a satisfactory level will require 2-3 years of well-monitored capacity development.

       Improved cash management and forecasting and improving the link between the forecasts
       and the commitment control system that has now been established.

104. It should be noted that these measures have all been identified by the PA itself as PFM
reform objectives and are being supported by this proposed PRDP DPG III.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

105. The Bank would sign a Grant Agreement with the PLO for the benefit of the PA, which
would include the prior actions listed in the attached policy matrix for tranche release.

106. The PRDP DPG III is a single tranche operation. The amount of the PRDP DPG III will
be disbursed in one tranche comprising the full amount of the grant provided the macroeconomic
framework is satisfactory and the Bank is satisfied with the implementation of the program by
the recipient.

107. Flow of Funds. The Bank would disburse funds into a GBP British Pound Deposit
Account maintained under the CTA of the MOF. As the Palestinian Monetary Authority does not
yet function as a full-fledged central bank, the Deposit Account would be held with a
commercial bank, as is currently the case with the CTA. The MOF would convert the GBP
amount into New Israeli Shekels (NIS) at the going exchange rate and transfer them to the MOF
treasury account when needed to cover budgetary financing needs.

Auditing

108. As discussed before, the 2004 CFAA concluded that the fiduciary risk level in the
Palestinian PFM system was significant. While, there has been progress since then, the risk
remains significant. Accordingly, the PA will hire an independent external auditor acceptable to
the Bank to perform a one-time audit of the PRDP DPG III Deposit Account at the MOF. The
audits will comply with international standards and be completed and submitted to the Bank
within six months from the release of the single tranche payment. These audits would be
financed by the PA. The audit would cover and ensure the following:
                                               - 44 -


        Validate and certify the transfer and deposit transactions relating to the grant and
        confirmed by PA MOF mentioned above;
        Verify the extent to which the Bank's requirements under the grant agreement are being
        met, and whether the PA's procedures are adequate to achieve this result;
        No funds are kept in or paid into the relevant Deposit Account other than those disbursed
        by the Bank for this particular operation;
        All withdrawals from the relevant Deposit Account for payments are for legitimate
        budgetary purposes, following procedures established by the PA's MOF;
        The MOF follows adequate disbursement procedures as per PNA and governmental
        standards including accuracy of exchange rate conversion.

109. In addition, a confirmation letter is required from the MOF that the funds have been
received and deposited into the DA and that an equivalent amount has been transferred to the
single treasury account. In this case, MOF needs to provide to the Bank (within 30 days) a
written confirmation that this transfer has been completed, and provide to the Bank any other
relevant information relating to these matters that the Bank may reasonably request.

110. Due to the progress in the PFM reforms summarized above, and with implementation of
the additional fiduciary requirements proposed by the Bank, the Bank has a reasonable assurance
of the reliability of the MOF PFM system for the use of funds under a budgetary support
operation.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

The PRDP's success depends on parallel actions by the PA, GOI and the donor community.

111. The PRDP calls for the PA to move towards fiscal stability, within the expected level of
external support by 2010. However, it will take many years for the PA to achieve fiscal
sustainability and that will only be possible if there is a political settlement that allows the
economy to flourish. It is unlikely that the PA will continue to regularly receive the high level of
support seen in the recent years. Thus, to maintain the support it needs, the PA must make rapid
and steady progress on the announced reforms. The Caretaker Government has demonstrated its
willingness to take politically difficult actions, including holding the line on the public sector
work force, collecting utility bills, and implementing security sector reform. In addition, it has
taken actions to extend its security control in some of the most problematic parts of the West
Bank. The PA has increased its transparency and improved public financial management and is
continuing to make steady progress on this front.

112. However, progress becomes more difficult as the reforms become more politically
sensitive. Consequently, the PA will need to continue to maintain its strong domestic political
support. Holding down the public sector wage bill will continue to be a difficult challenge given
the slow growth in the private sector. The 2010 budget calls for all development expenditures to
be donor financed and not funded by the CTA. However, in the absence of donor financing, the
                                              - 45 -


CTA has been used to continue funding the community development projects. If the required
donor finance does not come later in the year, this program could impose a large and unexpected
burden on the PA's budget. The most demanding task facing the PA is to control the security
environment. While the PA has made progress, so far, it has not made enough progress to lead
the GOI to fully relax its closure regime.

113. The PA will not be able to meet its fiscal goals without substantial private sector growth,
which will provide the jobs needed by the expanding population and the tax revenues required to
fund government services. The PRDP was formulated on the optimistic assumptions that over the
next three years, real growth will average more than 8 percent annually. However, sustained
private sector activity is largely dependent on the GOI relaxing its closure regime and allowing
Palestinian enterprises reliable access to markets. In the past year, the GOI has made some
improvements including opening movement within the West Bank and allowing Palestinians
from Israel to visit and shop in the West Bank. However, much of the recent growth has come
from the donor supported public sector and conditions remain such that a sustained high level of
private sector growth is not likely. If the security situation deteriorates, private sector growth
and consequently the PA's fiscal position will suffer even more.

114. Donor support remains the third determinant of the PRDP's success. The PRDP assumes
high and sustained donor assistance throughout the plan's life and continuing into the future.
The PA is striving to improve its fiscal position, but for the foreseeable future they will remain
dependent upon high levels of aid. Specifically, it will require large amounts of untied budget
support that will enable it to pay wages and the other basic operational costs. Without such
support the PA will not be able to deliver basic services let alone achieve the popular support
required to undertake the most politically difficult actions. The donors have responded with
exceptional generosity and total budget support in 2009 is estimated at US$1.355 billion. In
2010, the budget projects a need for about US$1.24 billion for recurrent expenses but there is no
guarantee that this will be achieved. By the end of June 2010, the PA reported only having
received US$525.1 million, nearly US$100 million less than needed during the period. As a
result, the PA has once again had to resort to domestic borrowing and accumulating arrears. In
addition, many donors front loaded their assistance in the early part of the year and it is likely
there will be a larger shortfall in the last half of the year. Thus, if new sources of aid are not
identified the PA will have to resort to additional borrowing and continue to build up arrears to
the private sector. This could negatively affect growth and also jeopardize confidence in the PA.
However as long as the PA maintains steady progress on structural reforms, it is expected that
the budget deficit will continue to decline; falling to less than 9 percent of GDP in 2011
compared to 26 percent in 2009. Thus, the PA should be able to manage arrears and debt that it
incurs in 2010.

115. The issues of movement and access and economic restrictions are fundamentally political
issues that the Bank has little influence over. However, the Bank has taken a number of steps to
mitigate the risks associated with the donors not providing enough timely support or the PA not
following through with its reform plan. These actions include:
                                               - 46 -


       The Bank has worked with the PA to place some categories of public expenditures into
       projects such as putting social safety net payments into the Social Safety Net Reform
       Project. This will help attract donor project funding for recurrent public expenditures
       within the framework of a project;

       The PRDP-TF provides donors a convenient mechanism to provide such untied budget
       support where they can be assured that their funds will be closely monitored. The PRDP
       DPG III, by risking the Bank's own money, signals the Bank's continued trust in the
       PA's financial controls and will also increase donor willingness to participate;

       The quarterly monitoring by the Bank in consultation with the IMF will quickly detect if
       the reforms are off track or if funds are being improperly allocated. This frequent
       monitoring gives donors comfort to increase their disbursement and use the CTA;

       The Bank has established a website to keep donors, NGOs and the public appraised of
       reform progress and has a consultant dedicated to providing communications and
       outreach to all stake holders.

       Finally, the Bank and the IMF are providing significant technical assistance to help the
       PA implement its planned reforms. The IMF is active in the PFM areas while the Bank is
       providing assistance in a wide variety of areas including: PFM, Telecoms, power sector,
       payments system, municipal finance, public pensions and social sectors. As mentioned
       above, the Bank maintains its field-based staff to improve its monitoring and delivery of
       assistance.

116. WBG is an unstable and high risk environment. But this country risk affects all projects
in the portfolio and is not unique to the proposed PRDP DPG III. Because the PRDP DPG III
provides untied budget support, there is a risk, not associated with other projects, that the funds
could be used for purposes they are not intended for. However, this is significantly reduced by
the quarterly monitoring and the continuous policy dialogue between the PA, the Bank and the
IMF. The success of the previous DPGs and the continued development of the PA's internal
capabilities indicate that these risks are declining. Despite the risks associated with this project,
it is a high value operation that the Bank should support. The Caretaker Government has
demonstrated its deep commitment to reform and has been able to galvanize international
support. The GOI has reduced some of its movement and access constraints and is willing to do
more within the parameters of their security requirements. These factors create an important
opportunity for the Bank to make progress on its agenda in WBG. Continuing support of the
Caretaker Government and its reform program will help the PA to create institutions that will be
needed by a future Palestinian State.

Economic Conditions and Outlook

The overall macroeconomic situation continued to improve in 2010 in the West Bank and
Gaza (WBG), following solid growth in 2009. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has continued
institution-building and economic and security reforms, supported by generous aid. The
Government of Israel (GoI) has relaxed some restrictions on movement and access in the West
Bank during 2009. In 2009, real GDP growth in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) is estimated at
6.8 percent for 2009, consisting of 8.5 percent growth in the West Bank and 1 percent in Gaza.
Real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2010 (compared to the first quarter of 2009) is estimated
at 11 percent for the West Bank and 14 percent for Gaza. The solid growth reflects continued
recovery of private sector confidence due to the Palestinian Authority (PA)'s reforms supported
by donor aid. Looking ahead, the strong growth outturn for the first quarter of the year, along
with the recent GoI measures to relax Gaza's blockade, make projected real GDP growth of 7
percent for 2010 feasible.

The unemployment rate in the WBG remains high at over 22 percent. In 2009, the
unemployment rate averaged 18 percent in 2009, reflecting the pickup in growth. In Gaza, the
unemployment rate in 2009 was unchanged at about 39 percent, reflecting the still suppressed
economic activity. The WBG unemployment rate declined from 25 percent to 22 percent in the
first quarter of 2010, and is expected to decline further in the remainder of the year, especially in
Gaza with the relaxation of the blockade.

The PA's 2010 budget builds on the last year's progress in institution-building and public
finance reforms. In 2009, even though the war in Gaza burdened the budget with substantial
non-wage emergency spending the recurrent deficit on a cash basis was in line with the budget
target. However, non-wage expenditure commitments were above budget and a shortfall in donor
aid, relative to the budget's financing requirements including Gaza's emergency spending,
resulted in non-wage arrears. The 2010 budget aims to reduce the recurrent deficit on a
commitment basis to $1.24 billion from $1.59 billion in 2009.

Fiscal performance in the first half of 2010 has been broadly as envisaged in the 2010
budget, with the exception of a shortfall in non-tax revenue. Recurrent expenditures and tax
revenue are in line with budgeted amounts, while non-tax revenue are somewhat lower than
budgeted due to delays in the transfer of dividends to the budget from the Palestine Investment
Fund (these are expected to be transferred by October). The annualized recurrent deficit on a
cash basis for January to June is estimated at $1.3 billion compared to the budgeted $1.2 billion.
Recurrent external aid disbursed during January to end-July 2010 is estimated at $0.5 billion,
                                               - 62 -


about $200 million less than envisaged in the budget. The external financing shortfall (reflecting
less-than-expected aid from Arab donors) has contributed to the accumulation of expenditure
arrears, and an increase in net indebtedness to commercial banks by about $200 million. There is
little scope for additional loans from commercial banks, given the already high level of
indebtedness to banks, which has reached about $0.8 billion by August 4, 2010. There is thus an
urgent need to raise external financing for the budget to allow the payment of salaries in early
September (to cover the August wage bill). Despite the delays in aid disbursements, the PA has
been pressing ahead with structural reforms and institution-building, which are expected to
reduce external financing requirements for 2011 and beyond. The external financing shortfalls is
not expected to adversely affect fiscal sustainability once adequate aid is disbursed as envisaged
in the 2010 budget.

Inflation declined during 2009, and has remained low so far in 2010. The twelve-month CPI
inflation rate fell to 2 percent in mid-2009, rose to 4 by end-2009, and further to 5 percent by
February 2010. Inflation decreased further to 3.7 percent by end-May 2010. The CPI fluctuations
reflected largely changes in world petroleum and food prices.

Domestic banks have not been significantly affected by the global crisis and private sector
credit continued to grow in the West Bank, but has been subdued in Gaza. Overall, banks in
the WBG have had very limited exposure to global markets, and applied conservative lending
practices domestically. Non-performing loans (NPLs) and watch list loans fell as a share of total
bank loans from 11 percent at end-2008 to about 3 percent at end-June 2010. In the West Bank,
private credit rose by 23 percent in real terms in 2009, and by 34 percent in the first half of 2010,
reflecting the improved economic conditions. The rise in private credit also partly reflected the
increased supply of loanable funds as the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) lowered the limit
on bank deposits placed abroad from 65 percent to 55 percent of total deposits. However, in
Gaza real private credit contracted by 15 percent in 2009, reflecting subdued private investment,
before rising by 5 percent in the first half of 2010 as conditions improved with a slight easing of
import restrictions. Since 2008, the Palestinian Monetary Authority has been making steady
progress in institutional reforms with intensive Fund technical assistance.

Risks and Challenges

Concerted actions by the PA, the GoI, and donors are essential to sustain the economic
recovery and reduce risks to the economic outlook:

       To maintain the growth momentum in the West Bank, lifting remaining restrictions on
       movement and access is essential, including those on external trade, especially on exports
       to Israel, as well as on economic activity and investment in Area C.

       The impact of the war in Gaza and persistent blockade has worsened the humanitarian
       situation and severely restrained growth. The recent measures to ease restrictions on
       consumer imports and inputs for public reconstruction projects should help the recovery.
       However, it is important to also remove restrictions on imports of inputs for private
       investment, lift restrictions on exports and on the movement of people into and out of
                                               - 63 -


       Gaza. It is also important to lift remaining controls on entry of cash into Gaza, and
       reestablish correspondent relationships between Palestinian and Israeli banks.

       Given the difficult liquidity situation and its potential adverse impact on private sector
       and bank confidence, it is important for the PA to maintain a fiscal stance in line with the
       2010 budget and for donors to ensure timely and predictable aid disbursements. It is
       important to prevent a repeat of the 2009 situation when expenditure commitments
       exceeded available cash, leading to significant arrears accumulation and domestic bank
       borrowing. Toward that end, the PA should continue to enhance commitment controls
       and cash management as well as strengthen tax administration. It is also important for the
       PA to make full use of the new computerized accounting system and undertake a careful
       prioritization of its planned expenditures with a view to postponing lower priority
       spending commitments. This could involve delaying recruitment of new public sector
       employees, or postponing lower priority investment projects. Donors, for their part,
       should urgently disburse the aid envisaged in the 2010 budget, especially in view of the
       limited scope for further bank borrowing by the PA.

Status of IMF Relations

WBG is not a member of the IMF and therefore not eligible for financial assistance. Since the 1993
Oslo Accord, the Fund has been providing policy advice and technical assistance in the
macroeconomic, fiscal, and financial areas. IMF staff is producing regular reports on implementation
of the PA's PRDP fiscal plan and public finance reforms. Together with World Bank reports focused
on structural reforms, the assessment of overall reform progress will be taken into consideration by
donors in their disbursement decisions.
