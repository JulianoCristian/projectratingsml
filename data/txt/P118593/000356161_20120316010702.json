Grant Project for\n            West Bank and Gaza were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            reforms are possible even in the most difficult political\n            environment. Complex reforms are best done in stages. The\n            reforms began with the creation of a functional accounting\n            system, which in the next stage was extended beyond its\n            initial function of recording transactions to its use as a\n            control mechanism. Keep your eye on the broad objective. The\n            risk of the multi-stage approach to complex reforms is that\n            the broad objective may get lost while focusing on the\n            technical steps of the initial stages. Anchor reforms in\n            institutionalized processes. Multi-donor cooperation yields\n            a bigger reform impact. Political will at the highest levels\n            is needed to maintain reform momentum."}, "docdt": "2011-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
