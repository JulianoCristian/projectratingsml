The project commences\n            January 1, 1969 and consists of an eight-year portion of the\n            program including the planting of 2,500 acres of eucalypt\n            and 2,500 acres of pine each year, and the maintenance of\n            the plantations. The project would contribute to a\n            diversification of Zambia's primary production, result\n            in substantial foreign exchange savings, and is expected to\n            stimulate the establishment of secondary wood-using\n            industries. The rate of return to the economy is estimated\n            at 13 percent. The financial rate of return would be about\n            10 percent."}, "docdt": "1968-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
