The mill would use\n            locally grown cotton and imported polyester and rayon, and\n            the project output would represent about 11% of\n            Tanzania's projected total fabric production in the\n            mid-1980s. The project includes provision for financing of\n            technical assistance to TEXCO, and a training component. The\n            project faces no substantial risks with regard to technical,\n            marketing and pricing aspects. The management risk would be\n            minimized with the involvement of experienced international\n            firms during implementation and initial operations of the\n            project, and a training program has been designed to ensure\n            availability of trained manpower."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
