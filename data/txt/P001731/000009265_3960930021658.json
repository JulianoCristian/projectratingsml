The private\n            sector incentives component addresses trade, tax and\n            regulatory reform. The public sector resource management\n            component includes restructuring recurrent budget\n            expenditure, civil service reform, and improved investment\n            programming. Specific actions include elimination of export\n            taxes and quantitative restrictions on imports,\n            simplification of import taxation, introduction of a\n            value-added tax, price liberalization, reduction in labor\n            market regulations, reduction in the relative size of the\n            wage bill in the government budget, a major reduction in the\n            size of the civil service, increased budget allocations for\n            expenditure on health, education and routine road\n            maintenance, and strengthening budgetary control and public\n            investment programming."}, "docdt": "1990-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
