the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAL I)\n            for Mali. The project was intended to support the\n            government's adjustment efforts in two key areas of the\n            second year Policy Framework Paper (PFP): (i) improving the\n            economic incentive system; and (ii) improving public\n            resources management. Measures to improve the economic\n            incentive system included:( i) simplificationan d\n            rationalizatioonf foreign trade taxation; (ii) restructuring\n            of indirect and direct taxation; and (iii) removal of\n            regulatory constraints inhibiting private sector\n            development. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) it was unrealistict o\n            hope to achieves ustainable overall growth of the economy in\n            the face of deteriorating terms of trade without a\n            substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate; (ii) a\n            longer term institutionald evelopmentp roject, in which\n            other donors participate, could be a better instrument han a\n            Technical Assistance (TA) component     that accompanies a\n            SAL; (iii) the extentt o which a countryh as met the general\n            tranche release criterion of maintaining an appropriate\n            macroeconomic framework may be difficult to evaluate\n            objectively; and (iv) while it is appropriate to set\n            quantitative targets for budget allocations to specific\n            sectors, budget execution could differ significantly from\n            budget allocations and, although the sectoral target may be\n            met globally,the intrasectoral patterns may be inconsistent\n            with desired sector development and efficiency objectives."}, "docdt": "1996-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
