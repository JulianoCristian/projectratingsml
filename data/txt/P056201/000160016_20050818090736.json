poverty and achieving the\n            Millennium Development Goals through implementing the\n            Government's Action Plan for the Reduction o f Absolute\n            Poverty (PARPA). The operation is designed as an exceptional\n            two tranche PRSC in order to further harmonize with the\n            other donors providing budget-support. This is the second\n            operation within the framework of three operations that were\n            designed as part o f the First PRSC approved in July 2004\n            (Report no. 29262-MZ). This two-tranche credit completes the\n            support envisaged within the framework of the first PRSC.\n            The PRSC 2 will continue to support the Government's\n            reform agenda of promoting growth, accelerating human\n            resource development, and strengthening governance and\n            public sector management. The second tranche of the proposed\n            PRSC 2 would focus on two pillars: (1) crosscutting actions\n            to strengthen public sector performance by enhancing\n            efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources,\n            and (2) enhancing the investment climate."}, "docdt": "2005-08-04T00:00:00Z"}
