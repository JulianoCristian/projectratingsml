       Mozambique-SecondPovertyReductionSupport Credit (Cr. No. 4111-MZ)
                        Release of SecondTranche -FullCompliance

                                  TrancheReleaseDocument


 1.      The Board approved the two-tranche Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC 2, Cr. No. 411I-MZ) o f SDR 83.3 million on September 13, 2005 to support the
Government o f Mozambique's primary objective of reducing absolute poverty and
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the implementation of
the Government's Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA). The
operation was designed as an exceptional two tranche PRSC in order to further
harmonize with the other donors providing general budget support. PRSC 2 was the
second operation within the framework of three operations that were designed as part o f
the First PRSC approved in July 2004 (Cr. No. 3950-MZ). This two-tranche credit
completes the support envisaged within the framework o f the first PRSC. The focus of
PRSC 2 was to continue supporting the reform agenda supported under PRSC 1 by
requiring actions to improve public sector capacity and accountability, and the investment
climate. These actions were drawn from the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
agreed between the Government and the donors providing general budget support.

2.      Following the Board decision, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) for
PRSC 2 was signed on September 16, 2005 by the Borrower and the International
Development Association (IDA). The Credit was declared effective on October 13, 2005.
The effectiveness tranche of SDR 41.65 was released on October 13,2005.


                                   I. Background

3.      Mozambique has staged a dramatic recovery from the damage o f the civil war that
ended in 1992. Infrastructure has been improved and is now approaching its pre-war
levels, and incomes have risen considerably. The poverty headcount fell from 69% in
1996/7 to 54% in 2002/3. On average the economy grew by 8% annually between 1996
and 2005. This- accomplishment can be attributed to the Government's phased but
determined approach to stabilization and structural reforms, as well as to concessional
assistance (half o f Government expenditures), a remarkable agricultural "catch-up", an
expansion of agricultural exports, and fast expansion intourism, construction, and certain
manufacturing subsectors. Another factor was the authorities' success in attracting
"mega-projects" in aluminum smelting, natural gas, and titanium mining, and a resulting
tripling of exports inthree years.

4.      The recent Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) entitled `Sustaining Growth
and Poverty Reduction' has examined the growth-poverty linkages. The preconditions for
healthy growth were met with a reasonably stable macro environment, a comprehensive
privatization program, steady progress towards liberalizing key sectors (for example
telecoms, air transport), and progress in freeing up internal and external trade. In
addition, there were several idiosyncratic factors behindthis growth, including significant
concessional assistance, on the positive side, and recurrent droughts or floods, and a still
growing HIV/AIDS pandemic, on the negative side. The CEM analyses did not find any
Dutch disease effect as a result of the foreign aid flows. Productivity gains due to these
financial inflows were larger thanthe currency appreciation effect.

5.      Growth contributed to reducing poverty in the period 1996 to 2003 by increased
consumption growth. While GDP grew at 8% in the period 1992 to 2003, private
consumption as measured by the national accounts grew at a more modest 2-4%,
dependingon the specific time period. Growth in agricultural output, partly due to area
expansion and partly due to improved productivity, reduced poverty directly in rural
areas (and in some urban areas). Non-farm activities in rural areas likewise helped to
reduce poverty directly, particularly in the three southern provinces where there were
stronger market linkages.

6.      As the economy grew, structural change occurred. Value added was faster inthe
service industry compared to agriculture, and there was a migration from rural to urban
areas. During this period, Government spending -backed up by donor support - focused
on the PARPA priorities o f education, health, roads, water and agriculture, which helped
reduce poverty, directly or indirectly. These expenditures resulted in increased
enrollments andbetter health indicators.

7.      The mega-projects contributed greatly to exports and value added, but have so far
had a small impact on employment and fiscal revenues even though they have had a
growing impact on local business via backward linkages. The main contribution of the
mega-projects to poverty reduction has been the signaling effect that large corporations
have confidence to invest in Mozambique. The Government is aware that mega projects
should contribute more at least to fiscal revenues. The new coal mine concession at
Moatize brought an initial payment o f US123 million, equivalent to 2% o f GDP. Also
the large Cahora Bassa dam and power station will soon become Mozambican property
and i s expected to start paying its concession fee and other taxes by 2007, exemptions
that were granted as part o f the independence agreements in 1975.

8.      The Government is aware that poverty reduction requires vibrant SMEs,
particularly in the rural areas, and labor-intensive exports. PARPA 11, which will cover
2006-09 and i s being finalized, will rebalance the poverty reduction agenda by focusing
not only on the social sectors, but also on labor-intensive growth in all regions of the
country.

9.      Mozambique appears to be well placed to experience a long period o f sustained
per capita growth and to achieve several of the Millennium Development Goals, such as
the halving of the poverty rate by 2015. Nevertheless there are many remaining


                                              2

 challenges. It has been estimated that with swifter progress in certain key reforms, the
 growth rate could be as highas 7 or 8% inthe longterm, and that poverty reduction could
 be quicker. It is important to control inflation and manage foreign exchange fluctuations.
 Improvement in revenue generation is critical to be able to spend on priority sectors and
 make many of the investments sustainable. Total domestic revenues are projected to be
 13.8% of GDP in 2005, which i s above the 12.6% collected in 2004 but well below the
 average for Sub-Saharan Africa.

 10.      Mozambique's fiduciary accountability, accounting, auditing and procurement,
 need to be further strengthened. The Government has embarked on a sequencedprogram
 of reform, starting with the new financial management law in 2001 and accompanying
 regulations in 2002, which set the basis both for modem budgeting and accounting
 procedures and for procurement reform. The electronic financial management system e-
 SISTAFE (the Portuguese acronym for "Integrated State Financial Management
 System") is beingpiloted in three ministries in2005 and 2006 and expected to be rolled
 out in the mid-2006 in other sectoral ministries. In parallel, the regulations and
 institutions governing procurement have been revised in 2005 following international
 standards to promote competition and transparency.

 11.     Further reforms - legislative, regulatory, and administrative - are required to
promote private sector initiative in business and removing barriers to investment by
domestic and foreign firms. Rapid expansion of exports has been one of the sources o f
growth during the past 10 years in Mozambique. Much needs to be done to improve the
support services for exports andto promote more labor-intensive export production.

 12.     The PovertyReductionSupport Credits (PRSCs):The PRSCs constitute direct
budget support operations designed to align the policy agenda supported by the Bank and
other donors with the national priorities formulated in the PRSP. The Bank signed the
Memorandum o f Understanding betweenthe Government and the donors providing direct
budget support in 2004, thereby committing itself to harmonization. PRSC 2 was
designed as a two tranche operation. The first tranche was for the national budget year
2005 and the second tranche for budget year 2006. This two-tranche approach was
proposed as an exceptional measure in order to adhere to the Paris Declaration on
Harmonization; align future PRSCs with the budget cycle; enhance predictability; and
allow the amounts o f future PRSCs to be based on the findings of the annual April/May
Joint Review.

13.      PRSC 1 was approved as a single-tranche operation by the Board inJuly, 2004 for
US$60 million equivalent and disbursed in September, 2004. The PRSC 2 prior actions
and second tranche conditions were drawn from the Government's PAF matrix and
approved by the Board in September, 2005. The first tranche was disbursed in October,
2005. PRSC 2 continued supporting the reform agenda supported under PRSC I,i.e.,
cross-cutting institutional reforms to improve public financial management including
public procurement, and the beginning o f second generation reforms. A key element i s
rolling out e-SISTAFE (Integrated Financial Management System) in the Ministries o f
Finance and Education and Culture and all their provincial directorates. Additionally, the



                                               3

coverage o f the budget was to be extended by including significantly more donor-
financed health expenditures within the budget framework - for example over 30% of
health expenditures were off-budget in 2004 with significant off-budget expenditures in
other sectors as well. After the study on off-budget expenditures inthe health sector was
completed inMarch 2005, ajoint government-donor task force was set up to recommend
better procedures for getting all donor projects into the budget. As a result, new
guidelines for the preparation o f the 2006 budget were issued and the current budget
contains a significantly larger share of donor-financed projects. A new procurement code
based on international standards was to be introduced, together with a new financial
institutions law, a new commercial code, a decree to ease restrictions on hiring foreign
labor, andnew laws to simplify red tape and strengthen anti-corruptionmeasures.

14.     The process of monitoring the PAF takes into account all sectors. Improved
service delivery inPARPA priority sectors (Le., agriculture, health, education, rural water
supply, infrastructure, justice and related governance sectors) and governance issues are
being monitored through the Joint Sector Working Groups. Progress in achieving all the
indicators contained in the PAF i s assessed twice a year through the Joint Review in
April and the Mid-Year Review in September. Over the past year the sector working
groups have become the best mechanism for policy dialogue, donor harmonization, and
reaching agreement between the Government and the donors involved in a specific
sector. Furthermore, ajoint Budget Working Group meets on a quarterly basis with the
Government to monitor budget execution, particularly in the priority sectors. Even
though all priority sectors are being monitored by the Bank incooperation with the Joint
Sector Working Groups, it was decided that no sector-specific prior actions and second
tranche release conditions would be chosen for PRSC 2; rather, they would be cross-
cutting ones related to public financial management andthe investment climate.


                          11.     Recent Economic Developments

Macroeconomic Progress

15.    In December 2005, the IMF completed the third review under the PRGF.
Preliminary data about the performance of the economy in 2005 became available in
February 2006. Real GDP growth was 8.9% in 2005 with major contributions from
construction, transport, telecommunication, electricity production and water supply. A
drought had a significant impact inthe second semester of 2005. Agricultural production
grew by only 1.5% in 2005 and emergency food had to be imported for over 800,000
people (annual agricultural growth was 11.4% on average during the 2001 - 2004
periods). The drought, the rising oil prices and the related pressure on the exchange rate
was reflected in the inflation by the end of the year. The consumer price index increased
by about 5.5% in December 2005 alone reaching an end-of-period inflation of 14% and
an average rate of inflation of 7.3% for 2005.

16.    Regarding the exchange rate, the picture i s one o f volatility and the reversal o f the
appreciation o f 2004. The exchange rate became more volatile as the market and



                                             4

 monetary authorities were adjusting to the foreign exchange auction system introducedin
 January 2005, and as the economy had to absorb successive external (rising oil prices)
 and internal (drought) shocks. The appreciation o f the exchange rate that started around
 the middle o f 2004 due to the rise in exports and higher than expected aid inflows was
 reversed by May 2005. Partial stability was achieved in the middle o f the year by better
 liquidity management and the implementation of a 50% provisioning requirement on
 loans in foreign currencies to non-exporters. However, there were some weeks of
 instability o f the foreign exchange markets in October and November, 2005, before the
 exchange rate returned to the level prevailing in mid-2005. The causes of the exchange
 rate movements are currently being analyzed by the Fund and are being discussed with
 the Authorities.

 17.      Fiscal slippages that occurred in 2004 were corrected last year and fiscal
 performance corresponds to the program again. The primary domestic deficit at end June
 2005 was about 1% of GDP which was considered better than had been expected, due to
 lower current and locally financed investment expenditures as a result o f limits imposed
 on the 2005 budget. The wage bill i s within the ceiling, while the share of priority
 expenditures was above target at the end o f June 2005. Revenue performance has
 improved with greater collection from corporate taxes as a result o f improved revenue
 administration.    Reforms o f public expenditure management systems have improved,
with some delays. Budget execution reports are beingproduced based on e-SISTAFE in .
the Ministries of Finance, Planningand Development and Education and Culture. There
are capacity limitations to rolling them out more rapidly inother ministries.


                              111.     Progressof the Program

 18.      Overall progress in the Government o f Mozambique's medium-term strategy to
sustain broad-based growth and reduce poverty has been good. Economic growth has
been impressive during the past ten years (around 8% on average) through prudent
macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and donor assistance. Poverty has been
reduced due to a rapid growth in agricultural as well as nonfarm activities in rural areas.
Mozambique i s expected to achieve several o f the MDGs by 2015, including halving the
share o f the population living inpoverty. Second wave reforms, which are now starting,
are important to consolidate macroeconomic stability, improve governance, and develop
the private sector while buildingup human capital. Revenue mobilization i s key to lessen
aid dependency. The draft PARPA 11, which will be discussed by Cabinet in the coming
weeks, outlines a strategy to reduce poverty by rebalancing the priorities. P A W A I
focused very much on the social sectors; P A W A I1 continues to emphasize the
importance o f human development, but also emphasized the need for broad-based
growth, particularly inthe rural areas and among small and mediumenterprises.

19.     Prospects for 2006 are good with economic growth expected to be around 7.9%
and inflation around 7%. Despite increases in the oil import bill, the external account
deficit i s projected to decrease due to increased foreign grants. The fiscal framework for
2006 is on track. Expenditures will be tightly controlled, ensuring that the deficit stays



                                              5

 within target. Revenuegeneration is critical and total revenues are expected to increase to
 14.5% o f GDP through enhanced revenue administration and the aggressive collection of
 tax arrears. Budgetary expenditures will reflect a constant share of current expenditures,
 including the wage bill at 7.5% o f GDP. Despite this resource constraint, it was possible
 to hire about 10,000 teachers and 2,000 health workers. Total share of spending on
 priority sectors will remain at around 65% which i s the PARPA target.


    IV.    Actions Taken to Fulfillthe SecondTranche Conditions,as set out inthe
                        Development CreditAgreement,Schedule2

 20.    The second tranche conditions focused on two pillars: (i)   cross-cutting actions to
 strengthen public sector performance by enhancing efficiency and effectiveness inthe use
 of public resources, and (ii)enhancing the investment climate. The conditions were
 chosen to ensure that the second generation reforms are on track. They are evidence of
 the new Government's strong commitment to improve the quality of public financial
management and to enhance the institutional environment for accelerated growth and
poverty reduction. Conditions for second tranche release and their implementation are
discussed below.

21.     Condition I:Adoption of a newprocurementcode and start of its implementation
as evidenced by: (a) the approval of a revised implementation action plan; (b) the
carrying out of procurement audits in at least two of its ministries in accordance with the
activity plan of the internal audit subsystem; (c) the preparation of a training program
for civil servants and suppliers; and (d) the preparation of terms of reference for the
elaboration of standard bidding documents.

The Borrower has adopted a new procurement code in December 2005 and started its
implementation. A revised implementation action plan was approved by the Minister of
Finance and procurement audits were carried out by IGF (the Government's internal
auditor subordinated to the Ministry o f Finance) in the Ministry of Education and
Culture, the Ministry o f Labor, and the National Institute of Social Security. A training
program for civil servants and suppliers was developed and several courses will be
provided to key civil servants before June 12, 2006 when the new procurement code will
enter into force. Finally, a consultant was hired to elaborate standard bidding documents,
and she has already submittedthem indraft version.

This condition is considered as met.

22.     Condition 2: Revision of the I888 Commercial Code through the adoption of a
new Commercial Code.

The new Commercial Code was approved by the Cabinet as a Decreto Lei on December
27, 2005, and subsequentlysigned by the President based on the authorizationto do so by
Parliament. The new Commercial Code i s available on the following official website:
http://www.utrel.gov.mz/IndexAssunto .htm.



                                             6

  This condition i s considered as met.

  23.     Condition 3: Rollout of the e-SISTAFEto the Ministry of Education and Culture.

  e-SISTAFE was rolled out to the Ministry of Education and Culture in November, 2005
  at the central level and all its provincial directorates. Inthis Ministry, all steps o f budget
  execution are now done through e-SISTAFE, and payments to the suppliers are done
  through the Single Treasury Account. Documentary proof of such transactions has been
  found satisfactory by the Bank's financial management specialists.

  This condition i s considered as met.

  24.     Condition 4: conclude the study on off-budgets in the health sector, and initiate
  the implementation of the study's recommendations as evidenced by the inclusion in its
  2006 budgetary proposal of         (a) the revenues and expenditures resulting )om         the
   "special clinic" (clinica especial) and the "special care" (atendimento especial); and (6)
  a larger portion of the revenues and expenditures @om the external common funds, if
  compared with its 2005 budget.

  Ajoint task-force of donors and Government was created in2005 to propose mechanisms
  to bring externally financed projects as much as possible into the budget. A study o f off-
  budget expenditures in the health sector that was completed in March 2005 found that
  over a third o f all externally financed programs in the health sectors were off-budget.
  Most o f the health budget expenditures are from three pooled funds: one for importing
  drugs; one for supporting general health expenditures at the level o fthe Ministry; and one
  for supporting health expenditures directly at the provincial level. In 2005, about $43
  million o f expenditures from these three pooled funds was included in the budget 2005,
  while the rest was off-budget. In 2006, the amount o f these three pooled funds that was
  includedinthe budgetincreased to $93 million.

. This condition i s considered as met.

  25.    Condition 5: Legal reforms: submit bills to its Parliament revising: (a) the
  organic law of judicial courts including commercial sections; and (b) Revision of the
  Notary Code.

      a) The Government submitted a Bill to Parliament containing the Organic Law of
         Judicial Courts and this Bill provides the government with the ability to create
         courts o f "specialized jurisdictions," which will be interpreted as to include
         commercial courts.
      b) The Government submitted a draft bill to Parliament requestingauthorization to
         revise the draft Notary Code. This procedure follows the rules established under
         the new Constitution. The draft Notary Code i s available to on the website:
         www.utrel.gov.mdIndexAssunto.htm.




                                                 7

This condition is considered as met.

26.     Condition 6: Combat corruption: increase, in real terms, the resources allocated
in its 2006 budgetary proposal for the anti-corruption unit,   ifcompared with its 2005
budget.

The budget in 2005 for the Anti-Corruption Unit was about $38,000 for recurrent
expenditures (without salaries) and about $58,000 for investment expenditures. In 2006,
the budget for the newly created Central Office for the Fight Against Corruption, which
replaced the previous Anti-Corruption Unit, is about $1,020,000            for recurrent
expenditures (without salaries) and about $387,000 for investment expenditures. This is a
very significant increase o f resources in2006 compared to the 2005 budget.

This condition i s considered as met.

27.    Considering that all six conditions for the release of the second tranche o f the
Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit to Mozambique (Cr. No. 411I-MZ) have been
fully met, it is recommendthat the second tranche be disbursed.
