6.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) covers the implementation and
results of a series of two programmatic operations, PRSC1 which was approved by the Board as
a single-tranche operation on July 6, 2004 for SDR 40.9 million (US$60 million equivalent) and
PRSC2 which was a approved by the Board as a two- tranche operation on September 13, 2005,
for SDR 83.3 million (US$120 million equivalent). The contribution of PRSC1 to the series was
already discussed and rated in the Simplified Implementation Completion Report (SICR) dated
November 29, 2005 as follows: outcome: satisfactory; sustainability: highly likely; institutional
development impact: substantial; Bank performance: satisfactory; and, Borrower performance:
satisfactory. The World Bank Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) has reviewed the SICR and
agreed with the SICR ratings, except for sustainability which was rate likely instead of highly
likely. IEG ratings will continue to apply for PRSC1. This full ICR accordingly rates the
contribution of PRSC2 to the results of the programmatic series.

6.1     Context at Appraisal


 Mozambique had made considerable progress since the end of the conflict in 1992, maintaining
 8 percent average annual growth and successfully fighting poverty, as demonstrated by the 15
 percentage point reduction in poverty, from 69 percent in 1997 to 54.5 percent in 2003.
 Structural reforms were also initiated in Mozambique in the 1990's, even before war ended. It
 has reformed the financial sector, privatized most state-owned companies, made progress in
 trade policy and introduced new tax legislation, among others. It has maintained prudent
 monetary and fiscal policies in spite of shocks, gradually reducing inflation and allowing for
 increased spending on roads, health and education.

 In July 2005, during the appraisal of PRSC2, available data showed that the recent performance
 of the economy continued to be positive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was
 robust at 7.8 percent in 2003, and an estimated 7.2 percent in 2004 (Table 1). The external
 sector recorded notable improvements, with a 24 percent reduction in the trade deficit mainly
 due to an increase in exports from the mega-projects. The performance of the financial sector
 was also positive, as commercial non-performing loans fell from 27 percent to 6 percent of
 gross loans, indicating a reduction in the risks to macroeconomic stability from the banking
 sector. The exchange rate which had appreciated by about 25 percent in 2004 had been
 reversed by May 2005. However, the fiscal performance in 2004 was below expectation across
 most major categories of taxes with government revenues reaching only 12.3 percent of GDP
 against the target of 13.4 percent. The investment to GDP ratio was also lower in 2004
 reflecting mainly lower private investment as a result of slow down in the mega projects
 investment phase. The second review (June 2005) of the Poverty Reduction and Growth
 Facility (PRGF) approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Board in June 2005
 concluded that the performance under the PRGF program during October 2004 and Mach 2005
 had been mixed, mainly due to the slippages in tax collection. Nevertheless, the review also
 concluded that prospects for 2005 remained favorable, including for strong growth, further
 deceleration in inflation and maintenance of a sustainable external position.

        In December 2004, Mozambique held general elections. The new President, from the same
        party as the previous president, was elected with 64 percent of the votes. In March of 2005, the
        new Government submitted its Five Year Program to Parliament, where it outlined an ambitious
        reform program to reduce absolute poverty. Subsequently, the operational plan of this five year
        program, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan (PRSP2, PARPAII according to the Portuguese
        acronym) was approved by Cabinet in 2006.

        But despite a sustained positive economic performance, Mozambique remains one of the
        poorest countries in the world, with GNP per capita of US$ 270 in 2004 and 70 percent of the
        population still living in rural areas. The Bank had been supporting Mozambique to fight
        poverty and ensure long term sustainable development since 1984, and since 2001, aligning the
        objectives of its program in support of the Government's Action Plan for the Reduction of
        Absolute Poverty (PARPA) of 2001. The PARPA was updated through a Progress Report in
        March 2003 and a matrix of priority actions and indicators aligned with the budget planning and
        execution process, the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), in April 2004. The PAF
        was agreed between the Government and the G-15 donors (now G-18) and became the basis for
        the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed among the same parties, including the World
        Bank, in April 2004. The PAF matrix provided a framework for policy dialogue and decisions
        linked to progress in PARPA implementation. Through the PRSC program, the Bank operates
        alongside the Group of 15 Donors (now G18) providing budget support against progress in
        implementing actions and indicators identified in the PAF and agreed with all development
        partners.



       6.2       Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

        The Program Development Objectives (PDO) of this PRSC series were to support the
        Government of Mozambique's primary objective of reducing absolute poverty and ultimately

progressing towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by supporting high
growth and improving service delivery. The PRSC program would achieve these objectives by
supporting implementation of the Government's PARPA, and by monitoring the completion of
specific actions identified in the PAF which would be monitored on an annual basis. The
specific objectives of PRSC1 and PRSC2 were common to both operations and they were: (i)
building public sector capacity and accountability through strengthening public financial
management, decreasing aid dependency, improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and
accelerating public sector reform; (ii) improving the investment climate through strengthening
the financial sector, easing constraints in the regulatory environment, and expanding
infrastructure services; and (iii) enhancing service delivery in health, education, and water and
sanitation. More specifically, the PRSC series objectives are the following:


    1. Building public sector capacity and accountability
    · Maintaining a sound macroeconomic policy framework: the key objective was to
        maintain an adequate macroeconomic policy framework.
    · Improving public financial management: the key objectives were: (i) maintain near 65
        percent the share of direct poverty reducing expenditures in total actual expenditures;
        (ii) improve the management of public expenditures; and, (iii) realize higher revenues to
        enable fiscal adjustment.
    · Improving governance: the key objectives were: (i) introduce clear, transparent
        procurement practices leading to few procurement problems and costs; (ii) build local
        authority capacity in planning, budgeting, financial management to manage
        decentralized infrastructure for service delivery; (iii) strengthen the regulatory
        framework for business; and, (iv) higher Government of Mozambique (GoM) capacity
        to identify corruption issues and develop plans to address them more aggressively.

    2. Improving the investment climate
    · Strengthening the financial sector: The key objectives were: (i) achieve more effective
        supervision of banking and non-banking financial institutions, that is, increase capacity
        of the Bank of Mozambique to regulate and supervise banks and non-bank financial
        institutions; (ii) move towards more efficient and profitable banks; and, (iii) a complete
        divestiture of the GoM from the banking system.
    · Improving the regulatory environment: the key objectives were:(i) reduce degree of
        effective protection to local industries; and, (ii) allow for an efficient and flexible labor
        law, allowing Mozambique businesses to restructure, increase hiring, and profit from
        knowledge transfers and becoming more competitive.

    3. Expanding service delivery. Key objectives for each sector follows.
    · Education: increase access and retention in primary education and reduce gender
        discrepancies.
    · Health: reduce mothers and infants mortality rate and increase access to basic health
        services.
    · Water and Sanitation: increase access to potable water and adequate sanitation.

6.3   Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The PDO was not revised throughout this PRSC series.

6.4    Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The main policy areas supported by this program were public sector capacity and accountability
and improving the investment climate. Improving service delivery to health, education and
water and sanitation was a third area supported by the original program, but with only one prior
action attached to it. The Program envisaged to initially focus on policy dialogue on cross-
cutting, fiduciary issues, including governance and public financial management, supporting
specific cross cutting actions to strengthen public sector performance and enhance efficiency
and effectiveness of the use of public resources. Reforms linked to public financial
management included the implementation of an Integrated Financial Management System
(SISTAFE), reforming public procurement, implementing revenue-enhancing measures,
achieving demonstrable results in the public sector reform program, advancing decentralization
to local authorities, and implementing a sound anti-corruption strategy. Some of the actions
linked to the investment climate included a new financial institutions law, a new commercial
code and a decree to ease restrictions on hiring foreign labor. Although only one action was
linked to service delivery in social sectors (keeping public expenditures in priority areas at
about 65 percent of total public expenditure) results in this area were positive.

The areas of support of the Program are closely link to the Government of Mozambique's
strategy to reduce poverty delineated in the PARPA. The PARPA emphasizes economic
growth, public investment in human capital and productive infrastructure, and institutional
reform to improve the environment for private investment. To implement this strategy the
PARPA identifies six areas for action: governance, macroeconomic and financial policies,
health, education, infrastructure, and agriculture and rural development. The goals, objectives
and strategies of PARPA were supported by this PRSC series.


6.5    Revised Policy Areas

Policy areas remained the same throughout the period of this PRSC series.

6.6    Other significant changes

The first PRSC series was originally designed as four single-tranche operations to be disbursed
over a period of 4 years (FY04-FY07). However, after the appraisal of PRSC1, the fourth
operation was dropped as part of the first series because by FY07, a new PARPA would justify
the initiation of a second PRSC series. Furthermore, the second PRSC was made an
exceptional two tranche credit to harmonize with other budget-support donors and better align
with the Mozambique's budget cycle, and to enhance predictability of budgetary resources.
This was also to allow future PRSCs to be based on findings of the annual April /May Joint
Review and the September Mid-Year Review. Another reason for the change was to be able to
disburse PRSC funds early in the Mozambique budget year to ease the treasury's cash flow
difficulties in the first semester arising from the cyclical nature of tax revenues.

7.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

7.1    Program Performance

Overall performance of this PRSC series was satisfactory. PRSC1 prior actions were completed
by the Government before Board presentation on July 6, 2004. Table 2 below lists those prior
actions and shows their "completed" status. Measures to be implemented under PRSC1
included those that would trigger PRSC2. Table 2 also shows those prior actions and their
status. Among them, the approval of the new commercial code and the new procurement
decree were not implemented on schedule, but were approved by end 2005. E-SISTAFE was
rolled out in the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and in all its provincial directorates by November 1,
2004, and direct budget execution in the Ministry of Education (MINED, now MEC- Ministry
of Education and Culture) and MoF was completed at end of 2005. The overall assessment of
performance by the Government in 2004 was judged to be satisfactory by the Joint Review
concluded on May 14, 2005 and PRSC2 was approved by the Board on September 13, 2005.
The first tranche was disbursed in October, 2005 for US$60 million equivalent and the second
tranche was disbursed on March, 2006 for another US$60 million equivalent, after conditions
for the second tranche release were met. The conditions for the second tranche release were
chosen as important indicators for the second generation reforms to improve the quality of
public financial management, and enhance the institutional environment for accelerated growth
and poverty reduction. The second tranche conditions with their status are shown in the third
part of the Table2.

It is worth mentioning that PRSC1 had a program matrix which was somewhat different from the
PAF. PRSC2, however, took the PAF as its original program matrix. All prior actions for
PRSC2 as presented in the original program matrix remained the same. However, some prior
actions were only implemented as part of the second tranche release conditions for PRSC2 due to
delays in implementing the reform program in the months before and after elections, such as the
adoption of the new Procurement Code and new Commercial Code. Two conditions were added
to PRSC2, one was related to the inclusion of off-budget items into the budget, and the other was
related to judicial reform (submission of bills to Parliament revising the organic law of judicial
courts including commercial sections, and the Notary Code). It should be highlighted that
PRSC2 had no specific condition regarding service delivery beyond the requirement of
expending 65 percent of total expenditures in priority sectors.

7.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation

 Four factors affected the implementation of this first PRSC series positively, and two,
 negatively. The factors with positive effect were the following: first, was the design which
 appropriately initially focused on cross-sectoral actions to improve public financial
 management before beginning particular sectoral reforms. These reforms were owned by the
 GoM and they were based on extensive analytical work (see section 10.1); second, was the
 successful coordination effort among donors - formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding
 signed in April 2004, which made it possible for budget support to be more effective. The
 budget support process became even deeper with the G-15 group acquiring three new members
 including the African Development Bank (now, G-18); third, the change in the design of
 PRSC2 into two tranche allowed for coordination with the other donor's budget support and
 GoM budget cycle; and, forth, the PRSC as well as the donor group use the same government
 planning and reporting documents that are submitted to Parliament to make the assessments on
 performance and budget support. This enhances domestic accountability and puts pressure in
 GoM to improve the quality of such documents.

 The factors that affected implementation negatively were the following two: the presidential
 and parliamentary elections in December 2004 delayed the approval of the labor law and
 procurement law, and in order to harmonize with the MoU, the time period of this PRSC series
 was shortened to less than two years instead of three which only allowed for the use of two, not
 three Joint Review's results.

7.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

 Design. The Memorandum of Understanding signed in April 2004 by Government and partners
 providing budget support (G15 at the time) included an M&E system with PARPA objectives

                                             11

and targets to monitor the effectiveness in the use of donor resources channeled through budget
support in the priority sectors of the PARPA. This Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)
was updated for progress made and new targets set during the annual and mid-year Joint
Reviews, which are the basis for Government to provide information to Parliament and in the
quarterly budget execution reporting of the priority programs. The Joint Review process
assesses the performance of the government in the previous budget year. The review focuses on
evaluating progress with regard to the indicators defined in the PAF and makes an overall
assessment of progress. The PAF provided since the initial implementation of the Joint Review
mechanism a platform for a unified accountability mechanism for Government to report both
externally to donors and internally to Parliament. The system contributed to reducing the
transaction costs for the Government since no separate reporting mechanisms to the donors
were required. The PAF has been fine tuned over time to reflect progress in the dialogue. With
the recent approval of the Strategic Matrix as the overall monitoring framework of PARPA II,
consultations within the G18 have led to the definition of fifty PAF targets derived from the
Strategic Matrix. The PRSC policy matrices have been aligned with the PAF, incorporating the
specific areas targeted by Bank's support.

Implementation. Since the approval of PRSC1, there have been two Joint Reviews and two
Mid-Year Reviews (MYR). The MYRs are mainly forward-looking and formalize agreement on
the performance indicators for the following year, incorporating the results of the Joint
Reviews. The last MYR was concluded in September 2006 when the Government of
Mozambique (GoM) met with the Programme Aid Partners (PAPs) and observers. Despite
improvements of the M&E system to monitor PARPA and PAF, and therefore, the PRSCs, the
establishment of a sound system remains a challenge. PRSC2 annex 6 discusses the M&E
system and its recommendations have been discussed with the relevant joint Working Group for
Poverty Analysis and Monitoring Systems and the Government. Important steps were taken
during the preparation of PARPA II and the PAF for 2007-09 towards improving the Strategic
Matrix, and the PAF as a result, and a results-based approach was adopted with technical
support from the Bank.

Utilization. The Strategic Matrix is the first comprehensive PARPA monitoring framework
which includes actions, output indicators and outcome indicators linked to the PARPA
objectives. Implementation of the Strategic Matrix will be put to test in the coming year and a
monitoring plan specifying responsibilities and cost of monitoring for each indicator will be
defined in the course of 2007. It is therefore preliminary to define the extent to which the M&E
system has been utilized. As regards utilization of the PAF monitoring indicators, the backward
looking exercises carried out during the Joint Reviews have provided inputs to Government and
partners on the status of key policy actions and achievement of targets in the priority areas of
the PARPA. In particular, there has been feedback of M&E results into policy actions. For
example, low budget execution in water generated a series of meetings among the authorities to
remedy the problem. Also, low VAT refunds in the transport sector was tackled first by
requesting a study by the EU on the subject which recommendations are being address by the
GoM with help of the donors, including the IMF and WB. Another example is the MTEF
approved by the Cabinet as a result of monitoring of levels of budget executions.

7.4   Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

The next PRSC is expected to be presented to the Board in January 2007. The next series of

                                            12

        PRSCs would provide budget support in 2007-09. The focus would continue to be on the three
        pillars as in the current series: (a) the improvement of public financial management, such as the
        rollout of e-SISTAFE to all the sector ministries at the central, provincial, and eventually the
        district levels. The Government is also expected to enhance governance by adopting and
        implementing an anti-corruption strategy. (b) The improvement of the investment climate by
        reforming its labor legislation, reducing red tape further, and improving the regulatory
        framework where necessary. (c) It is expected that the third pillar, service delivery, would
        become a more important focus of future PRSCs. In particular, prior actions would be chosen
        to support rural development, which is a top priority for the new government and essential in
        the fight against poverty, as 70 percent of the population still live in rural areas.

       8.      Assessment of Outcomes

       8.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

        The objectives supported by this PRSC series continue to be relevant to current country and
        global priorities. In September 2006, the government formally approved its revised Action Plan
        for Reducing Absolute Poverty, PARPAII which primary objective is to sustain broad-based
        growth and thus make further inroads into poverty reduction while maintaining consistency
        with the MDGs. For the first time, the PARPAII includes a strategic matrix of key indicators3,
        a joint effort by the government, donors and civil society. These indicators will be fully
        integrated into and monitored through the annual instruments of the Economic and Social Plan
        (PES in Portuguese) and BdPES (Balanço do Plano Económico e Social). This planning and
        monitoring process will be a key issue for implementation of PARPAII and PAF, from which
        donors, including the World Bank will choose the areas of support. PARPAII arranges the
        priority areas for public policy to sustain growth and poverty reduction, and improve service
        delivery under three pillars: (i) economic development; (ii) human capital; and (iii) governance.
        The three main areas of concentration of this PRSC series are contained in these three pillars.

        Regarding the relevance of this PRSC series to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the
        CAS identified the PRSCs as key financing instruments for the period 2004-2006. A few
        months before the First PRSC, the country team had finalized a results-based CAS (FY04-
        FY07) after extensive consultations with country team members and other stakeholders,
        including the Government, NGO's, the private sector, opinion leaders and the donors. It
        proposed a series of PRSCs, representing about 40% of total IDA financing, to support reforms
        aiming, among other tings, to improve the financial sector, built public sector capacity and
        accountability, improve the investment climate and improve service delivery. Within this
        background, this PRSC series program was designed to have a series of annual one tranche
        operations that would support the PARPA and the pillars identified in the CAS, which were also
        designed to support the PARPA. Since the first PRSC was not in line with the budget cycle and
        donor's budget support, the PRSC2 was designed as an exceptional two tranche operation to
        bring Banks' PRSC cycle in line with Government's budget and other donors. The CAS that is
        under preparation now will continue to use PRSCs as important financing instruments to attain
        its objectives, all under the harmonization umbrella with other donors.




3The previous PAF was developed after the PARPAI was approved. Now it is an integral part of PARPA II.

8.2   Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The Program Development Objectives were achieved to the extent that most envisaged
outcomes in the original Program Matrix were attained. However, these envisaged outcomes
are mostly intermediate outcome indicators. The long term development outcomes can not be
measured in the short term given the lag between policy measures and measurable development
outcome results. Table 3 presents those policy measures supported by PRSC1 and PRSC2, the
outcomes expected as presented in the original program matrix and the results achieved by the
end of PRSC2. A summary of the results presented in Table 3 is as follows:

    · Mozambique maintained an adequate macroeconomic framework.
    · The Government of Mozambique is better able to manage public expenditures through
       the adoption of the e-SISTAFE which was rolled out in the MoF, Ministry of Planning
       (MoP) and MEC, both at the central level and its provincial directorates.
    · The groundwork was laid for improved Governance. Two laws were approved: the
       anticorruption law and the law on decentralization. The budgetary allocation in 2006 for
       the newly created Central Office for Fight Against Corruption (formerly Anti-
       Corruption Unit) was 10 times larger than the allocation in the previous budget. Also,
       three key measures were adopted in the area of public sector reform: (i) land registration
       process was reduced to 90 days; (ii) industrial registration process was simplified and
       expedited; and (iii) visitors visas are now issued at the Mozambique's borders.
    · Steps have been taken to improve procurement practices. The new procurement code
       was approved according to international standards and procurement audits have been
       carried out in several ministries. Also, standard bidding documents have been
       elaborated and training has started. These are helping procurement practices to be more
       transparent and should lead to fewer procurement problems and costs.
    · The capacity of the Bank of Mozambique to regulate and supervise banks and non-bank
       financial institutions has been strengthened by the approval of the new Financial
       Institutions Law.
    · The legal framework for businesses was strengthened through the approval of the new
       Commercial Code. Moreover, the Notary Code was revised and the Code of Registry of
       Legal entities was approved. These have paved the way for the reduction of the time to
       start a business. In addition, hiring of foreign labor became more flexible by the
       adoption of Decree 57/03.
    · Indicators that support poverty reduction through public sector services directed to the
       most needed populations have shown improvements as shown by monitoring of the PAF.
       Allocation of budgetary resources towards service delivery in priority areas was 63
       percent of total expenditures in 2004 and 66.3 percent in 2005. PAF targets for 2005 in
       education and health were attained or surpassed.

The results achieved by component, as presented in the Program Matrix, follows below:

Component 1: Public Sector Capacity and Accountability

Macroeconomic framework. The economy continued to perform well in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
GDP grew 7.9 percent in 2003, 7.5 percent in 2004, and 7.7 percent in 2005. Inflation
continued to decline gradually from the peak of 16.8 percent period average rate in 2002 to 6.4
percent in 2005. The fiscal deficit also continued to decline steadily from 17.3 percent before

                                            14

        grants in 2002 to 8.9 percent in 2005, despite low revenues in 2004 which recuperated in 2005.
        The external current account deficit narrowed in 2003 and 2004, but expanded to 17.0 percent
        of GDP (before grants) in 2005 mainly driven by higher imports due to higher oil and cereal
        prices. Nevertheless, the current account deficit was kept at the lowest level since 2000, except
        for 2004. The performance of the financial sector was also positive.

        Public Financial Management (PFM) has improved. PFM systems have shown major
        improvements through the rollout of the integrated financial management system (e-SISTAFE)
        according to the latest Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA)
        assessment. The Homoine version of e-SISTAFE was satisfactorily rolled out to three
        ministries (MoP, MoF and MEC) by March 2006. The ministries to which the system was
        rolled out are now satisfactorily executing their budgets for goods and services and capital
        expenditures4. The new e-SISTAFE will soon allow for full tracking of the sources of funds
        and the expenditures by functional, program, and geographical classifiers. Also, donor-
        financed projects are starting to be integrated gradually into the e-SISTAFE and coverage of the
        budget has increased. A Joint donor-government task force was set up in 2005 to recommend
        better procedures for including all externally finance projects in the budget. Off-budget study
        in health sector concluded in March 2005 found that one third of budgets expenditures are from
        externally finance sources and most are from three pooled funds. US$43 million from these
        three funds were included in the 2005 budget, and US$93 million were included in the 2006
        budget. Other donor financed projects have also started to be gradually integrated into the e-
        SISTAFE but the level of off-budget projects remain high and some of these projects are
        characterized by reporting difficulties and low execution rates. Not withstanding, the gradual
        inclusion of off-budgets has allowed for better external aid management.

        Governance. The review of the Governance pillar in the Mid Year Review of 2006 identifies
        the major challenge in this area to be the difficulties in identifying indicators perceived as being
        objective and sufficiently comprehensive. Nevertheless, within the scope of measures
        supported by this PRSC series, there were positive developments.

             · Decentralization. The approval of the Decentralization Law- Local Organs of State-
                  (Lei 08/30-LOLE), together with the previously approved legislation of the Integrated
                  Financial and Management Information System (IFMIS) (SISTAFE Lei 09/02) and their
                  respective regulatory decrees, provided a framework for decentralized planning and
                  finances as it establishes the district as a budget entity for the first time5. Furthermore,
                  the government has allocated a direct transfer to districts (of US$300,000 each) for the
                  first time in 2006, in line with their new status as budget entities. However, the
                  Government has to clarify, via concrete guidelines, the uses of these funds (some
                  confusion exists) and the execution autonomy of districts. But the PAF matrix
                  indicators for 2005 on decentralization were partially met, and progress in the PAF 2006
                  indicators, are positive. For example, the decentralization policy and strategy were
                  prepared and the district Administrative Tribunal audits have already started at the
                  provincial level.
             · Procurement is moving in the right direction. The new procurement code was approved
                  according to international standards and procurement audits have been carried out in

4Payments of salaries continue to be executed centrally by the accounting department of the Ministry of Finance.
5Municipalities have been autonomous elected local governments since 1998 following the publication of the legal
framework known as the "'Pacote Autarquico''.
                                                             15

                     several ministries. Also, standard bidding documents have been approved and published
                     and training has started. These are helping procurement practices to be more transparent
                     and should lead to fewer procurement problems and costs.
               · Corruption. The corruption perception index for 2006 published by Transparency
                     International, which is based on a series of surveys, places Mozambique number. 99
                     (score 2.8) out of 163 countries. This is the same score rating as in 2005 (no. 97 out of
                     158) and 2004 (no. 90 out of 145) and a slightly better rating than in 2003 (= score 2.7 =
                     no. 86 out of 133 countries). Compared to other countries in Africa Mozambique is
                     rated better than Malawi (105), Uganda (105), Angola (142), Kenya (142) and Nigeria
                     (142) but still a league away from the better performing countries such as Botwana (37),
                     Mauritius (42), South Africa (51), Namibia (55), Ghana (70), Senegal (70), Burkina
                     Faso (79), and Madagascar (84). In the report by the World Bank, "New Governance
                     Matters, 2006, the comparison with the above mentioned countries remains valid.
                     Although the 2006 budgetary allocation for the Central Office for the Fight Against
                     Corruption increased by more than ten folds the allocation in the previous year budget,
                     the number of cases prosecuted has not increased.
               · Legal framework for businesses has been strengthened through the approval of the new
                     commercial code. The previous code dated from 1888. Moreover, the Notary Code was
                     revised and the Code of Registry of Legal entities was approved. These have paved the
                     way for the reduction of the time to start a business. Doing Business Report 2007, based
                     on data to end 2005, shows that the number of days to register a business has come
                     down from 153 days to 113 days. Also, land registration in 90 days, industrial
                     registration expedited and visas issued at boarder have also contributed to improving the
                     regulatory framework and investment climate for doing business.

          Component 2: Investment Climate. Parliament's approval of the Commercial Code and
          approval of the Code of Registry of Legal entities paved the way for the reduction of the time to
          start a business. The Government of Mozambique through its Cabinet approved the electronic
          publication of firms' articles of incorporation in the process of starting up a business. Prior to
          this approval, there was a requirement that the articles of incorporation be published in the
          Official Gazette. On average, this process took 80 of the 113 days to start up a business. With
          this "stroke of the pen" reform will now result in a reduction in the time it takes to start up a
          business from 113 days to about 30 days. The creation of the computerized registration of firms
          in 3 of the country's 10 provinces allows for faster and more accurate firm registration. The
          intention now is for the authorities to roll out this computerized registry to other provinces.
          Additionally, the simplification of the licensing process could also be implemented to further
          reduce the time and cost of starting up a business. The publication of the articles of
          incorporation used to take 80 days. With the approval of the electronic publication, this step
          can be done in 1 day. As such, the total duration is significantly reduced.



6The PAF for 2005 is somewhat different than the 2004 PAF. Therefore, the indicators in the Results Framework, Annex 7
of PRSC2 PAD which is part of the 2004 PAF and was used to monitor progress under PRSC2, has less indicators than the
2005 PAF which was evaluated during the 2006 Joint Review. However, this section will also refer to the indicators in the
2005 PAF since they are also relevant to show progress.
7The annual data for completion rates are available only in May, after the Joint Review, therefore, the assessment for these
targets are based on data from 2004.
8It was considered partially attained despite showing a decrease because there was a change in the methodology of
calculation of this indicator.
9Although targets were not reached, the outcome represented increases over previous year values (see Annex 1).
                                                             16

Financial sector. The capacity of the Bank of Mozambique to regulate and supervise banks and
non-bank financial institutions has been strengthened by the approval of the new Financial
Institutions Law. The passing of the law enables the Central Bank to issue prudential
regulations for the governance of both the banking and non-banking sector. With the law in
place, the Bank of Mozambique has completed the drafting of the prudential regulations
required to comply with the Basel I principles, together with an accompanying inspection
manual. Both are currently being subjected to a review process, while arrangements are
simultaneously being made for hands on training of inspectors who will be responsible for
implementing the regulations. The new regulations and inspection manual will in the future
contribute to more effective supervision.

Regulatory environment.

        · The degree of effective protection to local industries has been reduced through the
            reduction of import duties from 30 percent to 25 percent. In January 2006, the
            maximum import duty for SADC countries was reduced to 20 percent and in late
            2006 it is expected it will be reduce to 20 percent for all countries.
        · Initial steps to achieve and efficient and flexible labor law allowing Mozambique
            businesses to restructure, increase hiring, and profit from knowledge transfers and
            becoming more competitive have been taken. However, the approval of Decree
            57/03 is not the only measure necessary to achieve the envisaged outcome. More
            flexibility for firms to hire foreign labor is a step forward. However, there are other
            measures that need to be taken to fully achieve the expected outcome, such as a
            complete reformulation of the Labor Law.
        · The Government submission of bills to Parliament revising the Organic Law of
            Judicial Courts to provide for the creation of commercial courts, and the revision of
            the Notary Code are positive steps towards improving the regulatory environment
            for doing business in Mozambique, but still there are few measurable indicators that
            show this improvement. One of them is the reduction in the time to do business, as
            mentioned earlier.

Component 3: Sectoral service delivery. Indicators that support poverty reduction through
public sector services directed to the most needed populations have shown improvements as
shown by monitoring of the PAF. The estimated expenditure of budgetary resources towards
service delivery in priority areas was 63 percent of total expenditures (excluding bank
restructuring cost, net lending and interest payments) in 2004, 66.3 percent in 2005 and is
projected at 69.5 percent for 2006. The Joint Review of 2006 shows that most PAF targets for
2005 in education, health, HIV-AIDS and infrastructure were attained or surpassed. Out of 15
indicators, ten were met or surpassed, two were partially met, two were not met and one could
not be measure, as follows6:
    · Education: EP1 (Primary School 1) net enrolment rate for girls and total target of 77
        percent and 79 percent were surpassed to 81 percent and 83 percent, respectively; and,
        EP1 completion rate for girls and total target of 36 percent and 43 percent reached 39
        percent and 48 percent, respectively7.
    · Health: the number of institutional deliveries target of 49 percent was attained and the
        utilization rate measured by the number of consultations per inhabitant per year
        surpassed the target of .93 to reach 1.01 (DPT3 -diphteria, pertusis and tetanus vaccine-
        and HB-hepatitis B vaccine) was not attained.

                                              17

    · HIV-AIDS: percentage of funds channeled by CNCS-SE (National Council for the
        Combat of Aids) to CSOs ( Civil Society Organizations) and to public and private
        sectors (percent of total funds used by CNS-SE in all types of expenditure) target of 55
        percent reached 60 percent; percentage of community initiatives or CBOs (Community
        based Organizations) supported by CNCS-SE to support orphans and vulnerable
        children in the country (percent of total applications of CSOs, and institutions from
        public and private sector) target of 20 percent reached 25 percent. However, the number
        of HIV positive pregnant women and neonates receiving PMTCT Prophylaxis
        (Prevention of Maternal to Child Treatment) did not reached the target.
    · Roads, the number of kilometers rehabilitated target of 1,091 km reached 1,902 km and
        the number of kilometers periodically maintained target of 1,635 reached 1,932, but the
        number of kilometers under routine maintenance was not attained.
    · Water and sanitation, the percent of population with access to potable water was
        considered to be partially attained (it reached 40.4 percent instead of 44.2 percent) and
                                           8

        the indicator on the percent of population with access to sanitation services could not be
        measured.

Regarding agricultural and rural development, which was also part of the Results Framework
utilized to monitor progress during PRSC2 supervision, the Joint Review found that out of 8
indicators, two were attained, and six were partially attained. Under agricultural services,
proxies were used to measure the percent of agricultural assisted explorations that adopted at
least one new technique during the last 12 months. These proxies, the total farmers assisted by
public extension services and number of vaccinations against New Castle, were partially
attained (instead of 196 thousand and three million for each targeted proxy, 176 thousand and
two million were reached, respectively)9. Also, for the percent of cattle farmers that vaccinated
their livestock, proxies were used. These proxies, the number of cattle vaccinated for Anthrax
and for Black Leg, the targets were partially met ( instead of 660 thousand and 250 thousand
target, respectively, 502 thousand and 198 thousand were reached, respectively representing,
nevertheless an of 48 and 41 percent over the previous year value, respectively). The target for
the percent of area (Ha) with irrigation schemes constructed and/or rehabilitated with public
resources was partially attained (instead of reaching 2,900 hectares, it reached 2524 hectares,
representing a growth of 57 percent in relation to 2004). The only target to be fully attained
under agricultural services was the percent of cereal production for maize, sorghum and rice
commercialized by the formal sector (reached the sixteen percent target). Under management
of natural resources, one target was surpassed (percent of concessions with application plan
approved target was 37 percent; it reached 50 percent) and one was partially attained (the
percent of processes received that are authorized in 90 days target of 90 percent reached 70
percent).

8.3     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

 Rating:   Satisfactory

 The overall outcome rating of the program is assessed as satisfactory because most targeted
 outcomes as presented under the program were reached. The previous section supports this and
 reflects the continuous record of policy implementation by the Mozambican Government.
 Moreover, the monitoring of the PAF shows improvements in indicators that support poverty
 reduction through public sector services directed to the most needed populations, such as
 increases in the EP1 net enrollment rate, EP1 completion rate and in number of medical
 consultations per inhabitant.


8.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


 Continuing to improve the welfare of the population requires policy action to improve
 efficiency and effectiveness of the state in service delivery. These measures should contribute
 to improvements in welfare of the poorest in the medium term. As mentioned in section 8.2,
 monitoring of the PAF shows many of the targets for 2005 related to poverty reduction through
 privileged orientation of public services to the most needed populations have improved. Out of
 15 indicators, ten were met or surpassed; two were partially met; two were not met; and one
 could not be measure (see section 8.3). Furthermore, a study on poverty done by three
 Scandinavian countries for the National Statistical Institute of Mozambique (INE) in March
 2006 shows that poverty might have declined to 50 percent by end of 2005.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

  PRSC2 continued to strengthen institutional development. First, the creation of national
  technical teams focused on translating poverty reduction strategies into results is a gain that
  will endure; second, the approach of using pooled funds freely available to the budget to
  finance development activities started a new and more efficient approach to managing them by
  strengthening local planning and budget execution systems and accountability rather than
  creating parallel structures: this is a gain that will also endure; third, the reporting done donors
  is the same that is done to Parliament, therefore strengthening local accountability; and forth,
  there is a reduction in transaction costs due to increased donor harmonization.

9.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating:   Moderate

 The risks to sustain the development outcomes for Mozambique are moderate. There are four
 potential risks that could influence the development outcomes already achieved as well as the
 development outcomes that were set in the new PARPAII. Those risks include: (i) potential for
 macroeconomic instability mainly due to external factors, poor financial sector performance, or
 unsustainable accumulation of new debt in the future. Exogenous risks have been properly
 handled these past years and indications are that they will continue to be in the coming ones.
 Regarding the financial sector, the measures supported by the PRSCs have already reduced the
 risks for the banks to accumulate a high share or bad performing loans and accumulation of new
 external debt is been monitored by the IMF and Fund through the annual debt sustainability
 analysis; (ii) unpredictability of donor disbursements, which has been mitigated by intensive
 efforts in donor harmonization and the signing of the MoU by all parties (originally 15 donors-
 now 18). Moreover, the GoM has assumed strong ownership of the Joint Review process in
 April/May 2005, which has consolidated mutual trust in the process; (iii) weak administrative
 capacity to implement reforms and effective decentralization. To mitigate this risk, the
 Government and donors agreed during the Joint Review to develop an integrated strategy for
 capacity development in public finance management, and to strengthen the coordination and
 management of reforms. To strengthen capacity at the district level and to improve control
 mechanisms (auditing), several decentralization projects are being integrated into a national
 program that is expected to deliver capacity building and oversight more effectively; and, (iv)
 potential for deterioration in governance that can compromise economic reforms and poverty
 reduction efforts. The Bank has noted that reforms in the legal and judiciary fronts are not
 moving at the desired pace. Deterioration in governance can have deleterious effects on
 economic growth and compromise poverty reduction. The GoM has already taken steps to
 mitigate this risk and continues to pursue improvements in this area through various fronts.
 Furthermore, the Bank has held an active policy dialogue with the authorities on the subject.
 The G-18 also closely monitors developments associated with governance in its quarterly
 meetings. Therefore, despite the potential risk to the development outcomes of past and future
 operations, there has been and will be sufficient risk mitigation to render this issue a score of
 moderate.




10.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

10.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

 Rating:   Satisfactory

 Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry for PRSC2 is rated satisfactory as supported by
 the following information. The identification and design of PRSC2 built on the CAS (Report
 No. 26747-Moz) as well as on the Government's PARPA. This ensured the strategic relevance
 of the reforms and the ownership by the Government. Furthermore, the strategic relevance of
 the PRSC2-supported reforms was derived from extensive analytical work completed over the
 past few years, including two PERs (FY01 and FY03), a Poverty Assessment (FY04), A CEM

                                             23

 (FY01), a CFFA (FY02) a CPAR (FY03) , a ICA (FY03) and a FSA (FY03). It also used
 lessons from the mentioned analytical work and incorporated inputs from another CEM (FY06),
 a PSIA on the impact of school fees (FY05), and a Public Financial Management and Fiduciary
 Risk assessment undertaken with the donors (2004). The analytical work done by the Bank and
 the assessments done by the Fund on the macroeconomic situation and the control environment
 of the Central Bank, and the joint FSAP done in 2003 assured that the structural, financial and
 macro-economic aspects were adequately reflected at entry. The fiduciary aspects were also
 judged to be adequate at the design stage of PRSC2; they had improved significantly as a result
 of actions taken under PRSC1, i.e. the introduction of e-SISTAFE in the Ministries of Finance
 and Planning. At entry, it was also made clear that significant challenges remained, and they
 were supported by prior actions and conditions of PRSC2, such as the approval of a new public
 procurement code and the extension of e-SISTAFE to the Ministry of Education, which is a
 large spending ministry. Lessons learned from PRSC1 were incorporated in the design of
 PRSC2. For example, PRSC2 adhere more closely to the PAF than PRSC1 and PRSC2 was
 designed to coincide with the budget cycle of the Government and other donor's budget support
 disbursements. Also, discussions during the Joint Review of 2005 were the basis for the pre-
 appraisal of this operation. This allowed assessing and confirming the implementation of those
 key reforms identified in the program and help recognized the most likely risks so they could be
 mitigated. Another aspect that played an important role in the design of this program was the
 strong multi-sector team effort that went into this operation. Poverty and social development
 aspects were taken into account in the design of the operation based on the analytical work;
 however, no gender-specific work related to macroeconomic issues was done before entry. It is
 only being done in FY07. The M&E arrangements were adequate but not perfect. The strength
 lies in the fact that all 49 Performance Assessment Framework indicators are being monitored
 jointly with the G18, monitoring key policy actions, intermediate outcome and outcome
 indicators. The weakness of the M&E system (i.e. the PAF) lies in the fact that it was not
 designed with a clear results framework in mind.

(b) Quality of Supervision

  Rating:  Satisfactory

 The Bank's supervision of the PRSCs was aligned with the supervision of the joint Direct
 Budget Support program of the now G18. In order to reduce the transaction costs for the
 Government, the Bank carried out all supervision jointly with the other donors. The main
 supervision activities were the one-month long Joint Review in the Spring and the three-week
 long Mid Year Review in the Fall of each year. The MoU specifies that the Joint Review takes
 place each year in April/May (Year n) with the objective to assess the performance of the
 government in the previous budget year, which corresponds to the calendar year (Year n-1).
 The review focuses on evaluating progress with regard to the 50 indicators defined in the
 Performance Assessment Framework and makes an overall assessment of progress, i.e. it looks
 at sector-specific and overall development impact. The second event is the Mid-Year Review
 in September. This review is mainly forward-looking and formalizes the agreement on the
 performance indicators for the following year (Year n+1). Both the Joint and the Mid-Year
 Review are a multi-sector exercise, and the multi-sector PRSC team participated in all relevant
 sectors. The MoU also specifies that quarterly meetings take place to analyze the Quarterly
 Budget Execution report, and the Bank participated in these meetings. In addition, supervision
 was undertaken on a continuous basis throughout the year in collaboration with the other
 donors. The Bank participated in the Troika Plus meetings (consisting of three donors/a
 chair/co-chair and outgoing chair, forming the troika chairmanship - EC and WB are permanent

                                             24

 members, thus forming the Troika Plus), the overall coordination mechanism set up by the G-
 18, and the Joint Government-Donor Steering Committee. Furthermore, 23 joint sector working
 groups meet on a regular basis with their government counterparts to monitor the
 implementation of the agreed actions at a sector level and progress toward achieving results.
 The Bank co-chaired some of the working groups, and the PRSC team was active in almost all
 of the remaining working groups. More specifically, World Bank was represented in the
 Quality Assurance Group (QAG) of SISTAFE, co-chaired the Financial Sector, the
 Macroeconomic Growth and the Procurement Reform Working Groups, and it gave technical
 assistance to finalize the Strategic Matrix of PARPAII. The Bank also conducted the policy
 dialogue based on the CEM and the poverty analysis. All Bank sector missions working for the
 PRSC team liaised closely with and through the respective joint sector working groups to assure
 maximum coordination with all other sector partners and utilized the Results Framework (PAF)
 to monitor progress. Furthermore, the Bank participated in joint IMF-Bank missions to monitor
 progress in the macroeconomic framework. The joint staff assessment mission to evaluate
 progress of the PARPA was carried out at the same time as the Joint Review. Supervision of
 the PRSC also benefited from the technical assistance provided to the Government under Public
 Sector Reform Project, the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project, and the Enterprise
 Development Project (PODE). For the reasons stated above, Bank supervision for PRSC2 is
 rated satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

  Rating:           Satisfactory

 Given that Bank performance for quality at entry and for supervision was rated satisfactory, the
 overall Bank performance is also rated as satisfactory

Borrower performance under PRSC1 was rated as satisfactory in the SICR. Government
performance under PRSC2 was also satisfactory from design to implementation. The
Government was in the driver's seat during the design of the original program presented in the
PRSC1 PAD, and continued to be during the appraisal and preparation of PRSC2. The
Government determined the core reforms and guided the definition of the main indicators,
actions and outcomes to be achieved. This was possible because the Government had prepared
the PARPA and then the PAF, which updated the PARPA and the core of the country's reform
program. The Government stressed the need for all partners to harmonize with the PARPA and
PAF, and the need for substantial, coordinated budget support, as this would increase
ownership, which will also increase sustainability of actions in the future and would avoid
creating parallel systems where accountability is primarily towards the donors. The
Government was also at the center of the implementation process. The monitoring was
undertaken through regular monitoring, such as the quarterly budget execution reports and
semi-annual PES (Economic and Social Plan) and PAF matrices reviews. The Ministry of
Finance monitored the PES and PAF matrices. There was continual reporting to the Parliament,
which strengthened the accountability foundation of the reform. The new Government had a
remarkable commitment to the program as stated in the Letter of Development Policy and saw
the measures through to conclusion. The conclusion of the prior actions and triggers for this
PRSC series is a reflection of this commitment. While there were some slippages under PRSC1
in implementing the reform program during the months before and after the general elections of
December 2004, the delays were made up during the implementation of PRSC2 as part of the
conditions for the second tranche release.

11.   Lessons Learned

Looking at what we learned from this PRSC series that can be incorporated in the next series,
are the following four lessons:

    · Adherence to the PAF matrix is important. Choosing prior actions and triggers from the
        PAF is important to maintain donor harmonization. It became evident during PRSC1
        that small deviation from the PAF in the wording chosen for the Program Matrix could
        create frictions between the Bank and other donors. PRSC2 incorporated this lesson by
        adhering to the PAF matrix more strictly than PRSC1. Future operations should
        continue to adhere to the PAF matrix, but given that PAFs change not only in content,
        but in format from one year to the next, an effort should be made to consolidate the PAF
        structure.
    · Budget support is more effective if provided in coordination with other donor's
        assistance in synchrony with the Government's budget process. Under PRSC1 donor
        financing was not well coordinated. This resulted in some uncertainty about the
        availability and timing of disbursements. It also made it difficult to have shared views
        among donors regarding comprehensive budgeting. This changed with PRSC2. The
        MoU of the G18, which includes the World Bank, aligns general budget support with
        the Mozambican budget cycle. This improves the predictability of resource flows, and
        harmonizes the donors regarding policy benchmarks, the reporting and review process.
        In addition, largely as a result of donor harmonization and peer pressure, some reforms
        that had long been advocated, e.g. increasing budget coverage for externally financed
        projects and own revenues ­ this was an important recommendation of the 2001 PER ­
        were implemented. The effect can be seen in the 2007 budget which now covers more
        externally financed projects, and makes it possible to achieve more complete reporting

                                             26

     on budget execution. The effect of this lesson will be the enhancement of the quality of
     future PRSCs which will be aligned with the Government's budget process and other
     donor's budget support disbursements.
   · Define monitoring indicators and a results framework early. PARPA I was approved in
     2001, but the first PAF was only developed in 2004. As some of the choices were made
     in an ad hoc manner, the indicators in the PAF kept changing from one year to the next
     making multi-year monitoring more difficult and the link between the changed PAFs
     and PARPAI not always easy to establish. This was the case with PRSC1 and PRSC2.
     With PARPAII, it should be easier for future operations to define the monitoring
     indicators and results framework at an early stage because the PAF is an integral part of
     PARPAII.
   · Selection of key measures to be supported by the PRSCs should take into account
     political time tables. Experience with PRSC1 showed that timing of reform
     implementation should be more realistic by taking electoral cycles into consideration,
     i.e. the labor law and procurement law were designed to be approved during an election
     year, and therefore were delayed. Future operations should be realistic about the timing
     of measures taking into account the political time table.
