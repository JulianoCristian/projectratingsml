                    SDR 83.3 million ($120 millionequivalent)

 Terms              Standard IDA terms (40-year maturity, 10-year grace period)

 Tranching          Two tranche operation: FirstTranche - SDR 41.65 million($60
                    million equivalent); Second Tranche - SDR 41.65 million ($60
                    million equivalent)
                    The proposed operation i s a two-tranche Poverty Reduction
                    Support Credit (PRSC) that will support the Government of
                    Mozambique's primary objective o f reducing absolute poverty and
                    achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through
                    the implementation o f the Government's Action Plan for the
                    Reduction o f Absolute Poverty (PARPA). The operation is
                    designed as an exceptional two tranche PRSC in order to further
                    harmonize with the other donors providing budget-support. This
                    i s the second operation within the framework o f three operations
                    that were designed as part o fthe First PRSC approved inJuly 2004
                    (29262-MZ).     This two-tranche credit completes the support
                    envisaged within the framework o f the first PRSC. The proposed
                    PRSC 2 will continue to support the Government's reform agenda
                    of promoting growth, accelerating human resource development,
                    and strengthening governance and public sector management.
                    The main benefit of the operation is to help the Government of
                    Mozambique make further progress in reducing absolute poverty,
                    improving the delivery o f services and achieving the MDGs. It i s
                    aligned with the direct budget support programs of 16 other donors
                    and ensures a joint focus on the priorities set out by the
                    Government in its comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, and
                    on a common set of indicators to measure progress. The resource
                    flow and improved aid effectiveness should accelerate progress
                    towards the MDGs. Furthermore, the operation will help the
                    Government to maintain macroeconomic stability while pursuing
                    an ambitious reform agenda that cannot be fully financed from
                    domestic sources.


                                          1

The mainrisks associated with the operation are:
(i)Macroeconomic instability as a result ofterms oftrade
shocks, regional instability, or deteriorating financial sector
performance. Some of these risks, such as terms o f trade
shocks or regional instability, are exogenous. Considering the
highlevel ofreserves, the fourfold increase of exports over the
past five years, a flexible exchange rate regime and low
external debt vulnerability, the likely impact should be
manageable, even though no stabilization mechanism exists at
this point. Regarding financial sector performance, the new
Financial Institutions Laws - approved in 2004 as a prior
action for PRSC 2 - gave the Central Bank much more power
to supervise the banking system, and prepared the ground for
introducing International Financial Reporting Standards in the
banking system. The new legal framework and strengthened
supervision have reduced the risk o fbanks accumulating a high
share of non-performing loans, as has happened inthe past.
(ii)Unpredictability of donor disbursements for budget
support. This i s being mitigated by intensive efforts in donor
harmonization, and the signing o f a Memorandum of
Understanding by all parties.
(iii)Political will to carry out the reforms. The new Presidenl
and the Government have reaffirmed their commitment to the
reform agenda as articulated inthe five-year program tabled ir
Parliament in March 2005. The political and social risks are
thus considered to besmall.
(iv) Weak administrative capacity to implement reforms, suck
as inpublic financial management, procurement and improvec
service delivery. To mitigate this risk, the Government anc
donors agreed duringthe Joint Review to develop an integratec
strategy   for  capacity    development     in public   financt
management,     and to      strengthen   the  coordination anc
management o freforms.

                                      PROPOSEDCREDIT TO
                               THE REPUBLIC OFMOZAMBIQUE
                FOR A SECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT


                                   I. INTRODUCTION


1.      This program document proposes a two-tranche Second Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC 2) to the Republic of Mozambique for SDR 83.3 million ($120 million
equivalent), on standard I D A terms. The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's
strategy to support the implementation of Mozambique's Action Plan for the Reduction of
Absolute Poverty (PARPA), and the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF; Annex 1A)
agreed among the seventeen extemal partners (the G-17)' providing direct budget support
(DBS).    The PRSC framework was to include three annual operations to be delivered over
FY04-06. As articulated inthe FirstPoverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC l),              the PRSCs for
Mozambique will deepen the Bank's support for the Government's reform agenda of
accelerating growth and reducing poverty by: (i)building public sector capacity and
accountability through better public financial management, decreasing aid dependency,
improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E), accelerating public sector reform and fighting
corruption; (ii)improving the investment climate through strengthening the financial sector,
easing constraints in the regulatory environment, and expanding infrastructure services to
maintain Mozambique's current highgrowth rates; and (iii)       enhancing service deliveryinhealth,
education, rural water and sanitation. While the PRSC operations will provide financial support
for implementing the whole PARPA, they are to disburse against the upfront completion o f a
numbero fspecific reform measures identifiedinthe PAF.

2.       The PRSCs constitute operations designed to align thepolicy agenda supported by the
Bank and other donors with the national priorities. They are generally considered to be single
tranche operations - however in order to be more harmonized with the other budget support
donors, PRSC 2 has been designed as a two tranche operation. The first tranche i s for national
budget year 2005 and the second tranche for budget year 2006, expected to be released in
January 2006. This two-tranche approach i s proposed as an exceptional measure in order to
adhere to the Paris Declaration on Harmonization; align future PRSCs with the budget cycle;
and allow future PRSCs to be based on the findings o f the annual AprilMay Joint Review and
the September Mid-Year Review. Furthermore, disbursing the PRSC funds early in the
Mozambican budget year would ease the treasury's cash flow difficulties in the first semester
arising from the cyclical nature o f tax revenues.

3,      The PAF indicators being tracked are a subset of the 250 indicators that the
Government is monitoring to measureprogress of the PARPA. Some are output indicators and
others are process indicators, the sum total o fwhich would contribute to the reduction o fpoverty
outcomes. In some instances, there is a lag in the impact on poverty o f some o f the indicators

`The 17 donor are Belgium, Canada, Denmark,EU, Finland,France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands,Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,UK,andthe World Bank

                                                   3

that are being measured, for instance legal or procurement reforms. However, the partners
involved in DBS are confident that the indicators being measured will contribute to overall
poverty reduction. They are good proxies for State capacity, governance, the quality o f service
delivery, and a better investment climate that fosters growth. The trend in investor confidence,
for example, provides evidence that the reform agenda i s on track and will lead to the desired
poverty reduction outcomes.

4.      The First Poverty Reduction Support Credit was successfully deployed. PRSC 1 was
approved as a single-tranche operation by the Board on July 6, 2004 for SDR 40.9 million
(US$60 million equivalent) and disbursed on September 23, 2004. PRSCl covered primarily
cross-cutting issues: (i)macroeconomic stability; (ii) finance reforms, including the
                                                         public
design and implementation o f a new integrated electronic financial management system
(SISTAFE), budget comprehensiveness, improved accounting and accountability, strengthened
internal controls, reform o f the procurement process, and improved linkages between budgeting,
planning and the delivery o f service; (iii) efficiency o f the delivery o f services through civil
                                           the
service reforms; and (iv) the investment climate for private sector development.           Overall
progress o f the reforms has been satisfactory and the Government continues to pursue a far-
reachingreform agenda.

5 .     Conditions for PRSC 2 are based on the Government's monitoring indicators for its
PARPA. The PRSC 2 prior actions and second tranche conditions are drawn from the
Government's PAF matrix. The focus o f PRSC 2 i s to continue supporting the reform agenda
supported under PRSC 1, i.e. cross-cutting institutional reforms to improve public financial
management including public procurement, and begin second generation reforms. A key element
is rolling out e-SISTAFE (Integrated Financial Management System) in the Ministries o f
Finance and Education and Culture and all their provincial directorates.         Additionally, the
coverage o f the budget will be extended by including significantly more health expenditures
within the budget framework - currently over 30 percent o f health expenditures are off-budget.
A new procurement code based on international standards will be introduced, together with a
new financial institutions law, a new commercial code, a decree to ease restrictions on hiring
foreign labor, and new laws to simplify redtape and strengthen anti-corruptionmeasures.

6.      The process of monitoring the PAF takes into account all sectors.              In addition,
improved service delivery in PARPA priority sectors Le. agriculture,health, education, rural
water supply, infrastructure, justice and related governance sectors, is being monitored
through the Joint Sector Working Groups. Progress in achieving all the indicators contained in
the PAF i s assessed twice a year through the Joint Review in AprilMay and the Mid-Year
Review in September. The sector working groups have become over the past year the best
mechanism for policy dialogue, donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the
Government and all the donors involved in a specific sector. Furthermore, a joint Budget
Working Group meets on a quarterly basis with the Government to monitor budget execution,
particularly in the priority sectors. Even though all priority sectors are being monitored by the
Bank in cooperation with the Joint Sector Working Groups, it was decided that no sector-
specific triggers would be chosen for PRSC 2, but only cross-cutting ones.

7.      The PRSCs are based on extensive analytical work completed over thepast few years.
This includes two PERs (FYO1 and FY03), two Country Economic Memoranda (CEM, FYO1,

                                                 4

FY06), a Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA, FY02), a Country Procurement
Assessment Review (CPAR, FY03), an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA, FY03), a
Financial Sector Assessment (FY03), a Public Financial Management and Fiduciary Risk
assessment undertaken with other donors (2004), a Country Health Status Report (FY05), a
PSIA on the impact of school fees (FY05), and a poverty profile publishedby the Government
(2004). Bank-IMF work on tracking public expenditures in HIPC countries has also played a
role inprogram design.

A.        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS INMOZAMBIQUE

a. Recentperformance and outlook
8.        Mozambique's economy continued to perform well in 2003 and 2004. Real GDP
growth was robust in both years at 7.8 percent in 2003, and an estimated 7.2 percent in 2004
(Table 1). The marginal decline reflected a slow-down inconstruction related to the completion
o f a number of private sector mega projects as well as a decline inmarine production. Growth in
most o f the other sectors continued to be buoyant. This was fuelled by a number o f factors
including: (i)       continued good performance in agriculture (8.9 percent), transport services (16.4
percent) and government services (9.4 percent); and (iii)                           hlloperationoftwo megaprojects-
MOZAL Aluminum IIand the gas pipeline (15.4 percent). End-of-period inflation was at 9.1
percent; money supply growth was also within the program at 5.9 percent. The extemal sector
recorded notable improvements, with a 24 percent reduction in the trade deficit due to an
increase in exports from the mega-projects, as well as an associated rise (30 percent) in net
international reserves to 4.8 months o f import cover (of goods and non-factor services including
imports for the mega-projects). The performance o f the financial sector was also positive, as
commercial non-performing loans fell from 27 percent to 6 percent o f gross loans, indicating a
reduction in the risks to macroeconomic stability from the banking sector. Linked with these
improvements ineconomic fundamentals and reflecting the weakness o f the dollar, the nominal
exchange rate appreciated by 21 percent against the U S dollar and by 4 percent against the Rand
in2004. TheIMFestimatedthe realeffective exchange rateto have appreciated by25 percent in
2004. The appreciation had, however, been reversed inApril and M a y 2005. Fiscal performance
in2004 was below expectation across most major categories of taxes with government revenues
reaching only 12.3 percent o f GDP against the target o f 13.4 percent2. As a result, the
government's primary deficit target was exceeded by 0.7 percentage points, reaching 3.8 percent
of GDP. The investment to GDP ratio was high in 1999/2000 reflecting mega-project
investments.          The decline in 2004 has been due to reduced government investments from 11.7
percent of GDP to 9.1 percent o f GDP and private investment fell from 14.2 percent o f GDP to
 10.9 percent o f GDP. The fall in private investment in 2004 mainly reflects the partial
completion inmega-project construction. The private investment rate is expected to rise again as
a new mega-project (Moatize coal mine) will soon start its implementation phase.




 GDP restatement: a recent development is ME'S(Instiluto Nacional de Estatistica) publication o f final GDP figures up to 2002 and a new
estimate for 2003, replacing previous DNPO estimates. While the new GDP figures do not question the high growth rates estimated previously,
both the growth rate and the GDP deflator for each year from 2000 have been restated. The result is higher nominal GDP figures, thus
modifying the calculation of GDP ratios compared to the ratios mentioned in the PAD for the PRSC 1.

9.      Mozambique held general elections in December 2004, and the new Government
reaffirmed its commitment to continue and even accelerate economic and governance
reforms.    The newly elected President, from the same party as the previous president, was
elected with 64 percent o f the votes. The governing party Frelimo gained 160 seats out o f 250 in
Parliament, thereby strengthening its Parliamentarymajority. Some o f the results were contested
by the opposition parties, but the overall outcome was never in doubt given the wide margin.
There was no violence aAer the elections, as some observers had feared, and the opposition
members o f Parliament took up their seats when Parliament reconvened. The new Government
was formed in February, 2005. It submitted its Five Year Program to Parliament in March,
where it outlined an ambitious reform program to reduce absolute poverty. The Program
emphasizes the need to: strengthen the market economy; develop a crash program for vocational
training; accelerate legal andjudiciary reforms; promote entrepreneurship for small and medium
businesses; and accelerate rural development by empowering district administration and
communities.

10.     A new PRGF was approved by the IMF'sBoard in June, 2004, and the second review
was completed in June, 2005. The main conclusion o f the review was that the performance
under the PRGFprogram during October 2004-March 2005 was mixed. The slippages primarily
reflected a weakening o f tax collection, and delays in the implementation o f the reform agenda
caused by the political transition. The review recommended that a second wave o f reforms
should focus on increasing tax revenues, strengthening public sector operations, reducing the
costs o f doing business, promoting labor-intensive sectors, and developing rural development.
The review concluded that the prospects for 2005 remained favorable, including for strong
growth, a firther deceleration ininflation, andmaintenance o f a sustainable external position, as
the Government i s committed to take the necessary fiscal measures, pursue a monetary program
consistent with a fbrther reduction o f inflation, take measures to strengthen the banking system,
foster private sector development and revive the public sector reform.

11.     The medium-term macroeconomic outlook for 2005 and 2006 continues to be good.
Average GDP growth for 2005 and 2006 is projected to be about 7 percent per year. Monetary
policy is expected to maintain inflation at single digit levels (7.5 percent average for 2005-2006,
Table 2). Fiscal policy i s expected to move towards a more sustainable deficit, and increasingly


                                                  7

 to channel resources to priority areas in line with the government's poverty reduction strategy.
 The overall fiscal balance before grants is expected to be around 10.3 percent by 2006, and the
 domestic primary deficit around 2.8 percent o f GDP. The trade balance will continue to be
  greatly affected by the developments in the mega-projects (Mozal, Pande Gas and Areias
 Pesadas-Heavy Sands). Also, a concession contract for another potential mega-project, the
 Moatize coal mine, was awarded to an international firm3in November 2004. The current
  account balance for 2005 and 2006 i s expected to widen in relation to 2004 due to higher
 imports as the second phase o f the gas pipeline comes into construction, and due to higher
  international oil prices, but still will be narrower than the average o f the last few years. Terms of
 trade are expected to deteriorate slightly, about 4 and 3 percent in 2005 and 2006 respectively,
  due to higher oil price projections o fUS$42 per barrelin2005 andUS$38 per barrel in2006.

  b. Impact of growth and reforms onpoverty reduction

  12.       The results of the Second National Household Survey of 2002/03 indicate that the
 proportion of the population living below the poverty line declined by about 15 percentage
 points since 1996197 (First Household Survey), from 69 to 54percent. A decline was apparent
  in both monetary and non-monetary measures. Progress in reducing monetary poverty was
  substantial, as reflected in the headcount as well as measures o f depth and severity, but it
  showed regional unevenness. The most progress was recorded in the Central Region, which in
  1996 had been the poorest region, with less progress in the North, bringing the numbers in the


   Brazilianminingcompany CVRD-CompanhiaVale do Rio Doce. This will be oneof the largest investment in Mozambique (US$1-2 billion
  dependingon thevarious componentsconsidered). Incomparison, the largestinvestmentthus far hasbeen the constructionof the aluminum
  smelter Mozalphase Iand I1with an investment o f approximately$2 billion. The Sasol gaspipelinewas a$1.2 billion investment, of which
  $800million were spenton the Mozambicanpart.

                                                                     8

region closer to the national average. According to the poverty analysis, all groups in society,
including the poorest, benefited from economic growth. In addition inequality in real
consumption between provinces and regions has diminished. However, the gains recorded hide
the complexity and diversity o f the way in which poverty affects different groups in society,
gender, geographical and other disparities persist. For example some key groups, including
female-headed households, orphans and vulnerable children, have not benefited hlly from the
gains inpoverty reduction. The levels o f chronic malnutrition (stunting) are also very high, with
41 percent recorded in2003 among children 6 to 59 months old. To improve the understanding
of these issues, further work, especially qualitative analysis still needs to be done, especially in
the context o f the PARPA11preparation.

13.    Non-monetary measures also showed improvement. The share of food in total
expenditures fell for all quintiles, and there were improvements in the quality o f houses and
possession o f radios and bicycles (which are good proxies for household income). Access to a
safe water sources, a latrine or other sanitation facility improved. Access to health care also
improved. Enrollments increased inall quintiles, although amongst the poorest there was still a
lag. With respect to distance to services (health and education), a gap exists between the top
quintile and the other quintiles, with the exception o f distance to a primary school, which
appears to be equal in all quintiles. Notwithstanding this, primary schools are still on average
quite a distance away, which has a disproportionatelynegative effect on disadvantaged groups in
rural areas, and contributes to late entry and high drop-out. According to the recent Poverty and
Social Impact Analysis (PSIA), the most important factor affecting school retention i s distance
to school. This was even more important than registration fees, levies for school related
expenses and school materials. Access to upper primary education and beyond i s also severely
constrained.

14.     One key reason for the good poverty performance is that inequality did not change
much, so aggregate growth in consumption reached poor households. Overall, household
consumption per adult equivalent increased by 4.6 percent p.a., and the lowest quintile in rural
areas seems to have had the fastest growth rate. This was also confirmed by the data from the
agricultural income survey. Inall the regions the strong growth o f consumption in agricultural
households helped decrease poverty. There was also a shift in the composition o f income in
households in the rural areas, with the non-farm sector increasing its share. However, an
important unknown i s the inequality within the quintiles (as opposed to between groups such as
rural-urban and the provinces) which means that there could be significant variation within
quintiles.

 15.    Mozambican households have diverse sources of income. In rural areas subsistence
agriculture provides about half o f total income, with the rest coming from sales o f agricultural
products, and from employment income. In urban areas the majority o f income i s from
employment, followed by self-employment. The fastest growing sectors o f employment seem to
be trade and private services from the agriculture sector. Men are three times more likely as
women to be in wage employment, and 1.5 times as likely to be in self employment. Only 16
percent of the total labor force receives a wage.

B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

16.     Mozambique's good macroeconomic performance has been crucial to its excellent
growth record in the past decade, but needs to be well managed. Nevertheless there are two
interrelated areas o f concern - price stability and fiscal control. Without continued improvements
inthese areas, the country's highgrowth rate could be put at risk. Additionally, the impact of
HIV/AIDS and malaria on the population has serious consequences ifnot controlled.

17.     Price stability is essential because the immediate losers from rapid inflation are the
poor, as it acts as a regressive tax. Inthe medium term the poor lose further, because investors
are driven away and growth and employment opportunities decline. Despite the country's good
growth record and progress on the macroeconomic front, there i s still a potential for price
instability. Reorganization of the banking system in the mid-1990sYtogether with tight money,
resulted insingle-digit inflation up to 1999. But there have been two phases of inflation brought
on by lax monetary policy in the wake o f banking crises, one starting in 2000 (exacerbated by
the response to the massive floods), with inflation o f 17 percent in2002, and another in 2003/4,
with inflation rising again to 17 percent in early 2004, subsequently falling to 8 percent by
January and 4.5 percent inApril 2005. Inthese instances, monetary policy hadto be tightened by
increasing reserve requirements, raising the bank rate and/or accelerating the sale o f foreign
exchange reserves to the public. The authorities' present program i s to have inflation fall to 8
percent in2005 and 7.3 percent in2006, so as to reinforce the expectationo f low inflation.

18.      The second source of concern lies in uncertain domestic revenue mobilization.
Mozambique has maintained an exemplary record o f fiscal discipline inthat it has only on a few
occasions resorted to borrowing from the banking system. However, revenue performance was
weak across all tax segments in2004. Thus, insteado frevenues reaching 13.6 percent o f GDP as
stated inthe Performance Assessment Framework, they reached only 12.3 percent4. The PARPA
envisages raising revenues to 16.7 percent by 2010. Hence, there will need to be greater efforts
to rake domestic revenues by strengthening tax administration.                  Inthe short term this will
require actions, such as conducting audits o f large taxpayers.               Inthe medium term, actions
envisaged include the creation o f the Central Revenue Authority, the integration o f domestic tax
and customs operations, and harmonizing computer data systems to improve VAT collections.
Some further actions could also be taken to broaden the tax base (e.g. fwther extensions o f VAT
to a wider range o fbusinesses), but since the base has already been considerably extended inthe
past five years with the introduction o f the VAT and the extension o f income tax to civil
servants, the scope i s limited. Therefore, the main instrument for increasing domestic revenues i s
a stronger implementation o fthe existing set o f tax arrangements.

 19.     Thepublic external debt has been considerably reduced through twoHIPC operations.
Combined with the country's excellent prospects for exports, the net present value o f foreign
debt service i s projected to fall from its 2005 level o f 89 percent o f exports to 65 percent by
2010, and 49 percent by 2020. Values o f 125-150 percent are considered inthe HIPC context to
indicate a debt overhang problem. Hence by this standard, Mozambique i s well clear o f a
growth-reducing debt overhang, at least on the external side.

20.     Mozambique's exchange rate system is a managedfloat. The real effective exchange
rate slightly depreciated between 1999 and 2003. In2004, however, the real effective exchange
rate, as calculated by the IMF, appreciated by 25 percent. This was due to three main factors -- a
recent increase inforeign investment, an improvement inthe ability o f the country to export, and
the depreciation o f the U S dollar in the international market. In early 2005, the Central Bank
introduced an auction system to sell foreign exchange. As the financial markets had to get used
to this new instrument, the exchange rate has been rather volatile since then. By April 2005, the
appreciation trend was reversed. In general, even though aid has amounted to 11-19 percent o f
GDP, this has not caused a significant appreciationo fthe currency. As the forthcoming Country
Economic Memorandum shows, calculations based on a general equilibrium model indicate that
the increase in productivity generated by the aid flows (e.g. roads, education) has compensated
for the aid-driven upward pressure on the prices o f nontradables, thereby sparing the country
from "Dutch disease."

21.     Greater efficiency of public expenditures will be crucial for growth and poverty
reduction in thefuture. Domestic revenues are projected to increase as a percentage o f GDP
over the coming years. But foreign aid, currently about 11percent-19 percent o f GDP, is likely
to remain stable in dollar terms in the next 5-10 years. As a result o f the fast GDP growth, its
share i s projected to decline. At the same time there is a need for increased effort and efficiency
inservice delivery ifthe Millennium Development Goals areto be achieved. For example, inthe
case o f the education sector, the Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFAFTI) estimates that
inorder to achieve universal completion of primary education (up to grade 7),the Government
will need to increase substantially public expenditures on primary education alone, while at the
same time addressing structural issues related to teacher management, deployment and
compensation structures to increase the efficiency and improve the quality o f the system.
Mozambique's fiduciary accountability i s weak, although the Government i s taking measures to
improve it. The weakest areas are accounting, auditing and procurement. Mozambique scored 6
out o f 15 by one assessment5, and 5 out o f 30 by another - less than the sub-Saharan African

 average.6 It will be critical to improve the accountability and effectiveness o f public financial
management for sustained broad-based growth and further human development in the next
 decade.

 22.       Government has started modernizing its public financial management system. The
 Government has embarked on a reform program in this area, and has followed the right
 sequencing, starting with a new financial management law in 2001 (known by its Portuguese
 acronym as SISTAFE) and accompanying regulations in 2002, which set the basis both for
modem budgeting and financial management procedures and for procurement reform. The
integrated electronic financial management system - e-SISTAFE - was introduced in the
Ministry of Finance in 2004. Currently all fund releases from the Central Treasury Bank
Account to bank accounts of spending units are processed through e-SISTAFE, providing the
means to control the receipt o f accounting retums from spending units against their next fund
release. Accounting returns from spending units are further supported by the submission o fbank
reconciliation statements, which are also monitored. The data captured in e-SISTAFE and the
 accounting retums from spending units enable the compilation o f financial statements by the
Ministry o f Finance. Roll-out o f e-SISTAFE to the Ministry o f Education and Culture will be
piloted in2005. During this phase the pilot ministry will be connectedto e-SISTAFE to directly
execute and account for its revenues and expenditures, against the budget controls o f the
Ministry of Finance and through the Single Treasury Bank Account. Next will be a rollout to
 other key sectoral ministries during 2006 and 2007. This will soon enable more accuracy in
 accounting andpermit greater timeliness inauditing, thereby facilitating parliamentary oversight.
 Subsequently, improvement of the classifiers (program, functional, regional) should follow so as
to provide detail sufficient to permit analysis o f poverty impacts. Budget comprehensiveness is
 another goal which will be facilitated by the e-SISTAFE rollout, though further work will be
needed to get proper accounting of donor-funded spending. In parallel, the regulations and
 institutions goveming procurement are being revised according to international standards to
promote competition, transparency, value for money, and reduce the opportunities for
 corruption.

 23.       A variety of measures are called for to improve Mozambique's competitiveness and
 raise employment. Further reductions in import duty rates will be implemented, in accordance
with the SADC protocol, and in particular the top import tax rate will be lowered from 25
 percent to 20 percent in 2006. Although important progress was made with taxation o f foreign
 investors through the recently passed Code o f Fiscal Incentives, the tax law inrespect of mining
 enterprises needs to be modified further to allow for specific features o f miningbusinesses (in
particular the need for accumulation and carry-over, and to accommodate the cyclicality o f
mining).Greatly increased efforts are needed to improve andbroadenthe coverage and improve
 the quality and reliability o f electricity services, and lower the cost. The costs o f bank finance
need to be reduced by further strengthening banking supervision, establishing commercial
 courts, simplifjang the relevant judicial procedures, and improving the credit register.
Mozambique has a notoriously difficult set o f procedures for registering new firms, and so the
 Government i s working to reduce the time and cost involved inregistration. Inthe future it may
be necessary to consolidate the three Government entities dealing with this work, and introduce
computerization.

24.     I t is now easier to hire skilled foreign workers. The Government has undertaken to
revise the labor law to make employment arrangements more flexible - which was raised as a
priority in the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA).       More flexibility in hiring expatriate
workers is especially important to attract foreign direct investment. It was possible to achieve
this objective by adoptinganew decreewithout havingto wait for the reform o fthe overall labor
law (currently scheduled for 2006). The adoption of this new decree (57/03) -which revoked the
decree 25/99 - was considered as a prior action. There i s also a need to increase the relevance
and quality o f the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system to ensure it
responds to the existing and emerging needs o f the labor market, whether in formal or informal
sector employment. In time, a better skilled workforce will help to decrease the reliance on
foreign or imported labor, particularly at semi-qualified and qualified technician levels. The
Government i s working with external partners and the World Bank to transform the fragmented,
supply-driven training delivery system into a demand-driven one that would function under a
unifylngtraining policyandthat wouldbebased on labor specific occupational standards for key
sectors o f the economy.

25.     The Impact of HIV/AIDS on economicgrowth is serious. Current projections indicate
that in2010 the Mozambican economy will be 14-20 percent smaller than it would otherwise be
due to the impact of HIVIAIDS. Per capita GDP growth will be between 0.3 percent and 1.0
percent lower per annum due to reduced productivity growth, humancapital accumulation, and
reduced physical accumulation. In addition, population growth will be reduced. By 2000,
approximately 100,000 Mozambicans had died from AIDS since the beginning o f the pandemic.
However, projections o f the number o f accumulated AIDS deaths over the coming decade show
that this figure may climb as high as 1.2 million deaths by 2010, and the projected population
growth between 2000 and 2010 i s estimated to be about 1.6 percent per annum, as opposed to
the 2.5 percent it would be in the absence o f the pandemic. Life expectancy projections show
that by 2010, average life expectancy may be 36.5 years, as opposed to a projected 50.3 years in
the absence of the pandemic. Inaddition, the impact on the productivity o f the public sector is
serious, particularly for sectors that are heavily dependent on human resources such as
education. Teacher absenteeism is very high in some provinces, which disrupts the normal daily
routine o f students and affects their learning as many teachers are not temporarily replaced
during periods o f illness. Serious thought needs to be given to providing for a national public
sector workplace policy, backed by high level Government support, that addresses the needs o f
specific sectors.

26.     Critical impact on labor and vulnerable groups. HIV/AIDS primarily affects
individuals in the 20-45 year age group - prime years both in terms o f work and family
responsibilities. Another strikingly vulnerable group is young children who are at risk o f
infection through mother to child transmission (MTCT). The probability o f transmission o f
infection o f a child from a pregnant HIV positive woman, either during pregnancy, childbirth or
through breast feeding, is approximately 30 percent. Given a M T C T transmission rate o f 30
percent, and prevalence rates at antenatal clinics in the range o f 15 percent to 30 percent,
between one and two children in'20 become HIV positive through MTCT. Also, by 2010, about
one child in four will have lost at least one parent. Since children represent a large share o f the
population, orphans are projected to account for about 10 percent o f the population in 2010.
Additionally, since the primary school age group has one o f the lowest prevalence rates (also
considered the `window o f hope'), the Ministryof Education and Culture is launching a national


                                                 13

school health initiative in all primary schools that will include HIV/AIDS prevention messages
and activities. The impact o f the slowly increasing availability o f Antiretroviral treatment
(ART) needs to be taken into consideration for future growth projections, and research is now
planned to look at the impact o f comprehensive care and treatment on the current demographic
projections (which were concluded prior to the initiation o f an affordable care and treatment
program by the Ministry o f Health). This new five year M o H Strategic Plan (PEN Saude) and
the National Strategic Plan (PEN 11) have both now factored in the need to scale-up access to
care and treatment, together with maintaining a sound focus on prevention, advocacy, stigma
reduction, and impact mitigation as the pillars to a broad-based encompassing strategy,
mainstreamed across all sectors.

27.     Malaria is a serious public health problem and the number one "killer" disease.
Malaria accounts for 35 percent o f deaths among children below five years o f age, 60 percent o f
admissions in pediatric wards, and 40 percent o f overall outpatient consultations. Among
pregnant women, the disease i s associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and is a contributing
factor to at least 30 percent o f maternal deaths. Inaddition, malaria causes significant morbidity
in children and adults resulting in high levels of school and work absenteeism. It has been
estimated that in Sub Saharan Africa, malaria reduces GDP growth by an estimated average o f
1.3 percent per year. For Mozambique this may be even higher given the transmission pattern o f
the disease during all seasons, and constraints in access to preventive and curative health
services, particularly in rural areas. The poor suffer the most from malaria infection.        The
govemment o f Mozambique has a Malaria Control Program focused on three strategies: (i)
health promotion and education; (ii) control (use o fbednets, larvae control, etc.); and (iii)
                                       vector
early diagnosis and adequate treatment, including the Intermittent Prophylaxis Treatment (IPT)
for pregnant women. This program, however, has been under funded and needs significant
improvements in its coverage. The Global Fund approved a small US$12 million package, and
program implementation has begun. The government is committed to scale up malaria
prevention and control inline with the Abuja targets and its Plan of Action to Reduce Absolute
Poverty (PARPA).

                           111.       THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

28.     ThePARPA is the Government's strategy to reduce absolutepoverty. InApril 2001 the
Council o f Ministers approved the PARPA for 2001-2005, later endorsed by the Bank and Fund
Boards as Mozambique's first full PRSP. The PARPA's public action strategy emphasizes
economic growth, public investment in human capital and productive infrastructure, and
institutional reform to improve the environment for private investment. Growth is expected to
come from large-scale capital-intensive projects financed by private foreign capital, productivity
and value-added gains in agriculture and manufacturing, and a general expansion in intemal
trade, transport and services. To implement this strategy, the PARPA, in line with its poverty
diagnosis, identifies six priority areas for action: health, education, infrastructure, agriculture and
rural development, govemance, and macroeconomic and financial policies. The PARPA also
identifies actionable measures within each priority area and establishes targets and milestones in
an operational matrix. A new PARPA for the period 2006-2010 will be elaborated inthe coming
months, based on the newly elected Government's Five Year Program and a consultation
process. The Government expects the revised PARPA to be ready by early 2006.


29.      The PARPA's goals, objectives and strategies were established in a context of post-
conflict economic recovery and poverty reduction, and continue to be appropriate to
Mozambique's circumstances today. A sound program of economic reform and management -
based on privatization, financial sector reform, investment promotion, trade and price
liberalization, prudent macroeconomic management and substantial public investment - has
underpinnedMozambique's ongoing economic transformation and growth record. The PARPA
has improved on the Government's previous poverty reduction strategies.' Inparticular, there is:
increased country ownership;           improved prioritization; better monitorable targets; and
improvement in the integration o f macroeconomic policies, institutional reforms and sector
programs. There is need for further development o f the poverty analysis (regarding gender,
 HIV/AIDS and vulnerability to exogenous shocks), and o f the prioritization, sequencing and
 implementation o f the policy actions identified, which tend to focus on access to the relative
 exclusion o f quality and efficiency. It also identified a need to deepen and institutionalize the
 participatory process, which the Government has begun through the Poverty Observatory.
 Recently the Government and its partners also agreed that the PARPA progress indicators need
 to bereduced innumber andrevised to reflect the MDGs.

 30.     Government is developing an institutional mechanism to monitor the PARPA. Since
 April 2003 the Government has reoriented implementation to achieve three major goals: (i)
 improving the effectiveness o f Government systems; (ii)              increasing extemal assistance in the
 form o f budget support; and (iii)    improving the reliability o f budget execution. Since the end o f
 the conflict period extemal resources have been mainly transferred through direct project
 financing channels from the donors to the beneficiaries, resulting in parallel structures. About
 60% o f all extemal aid was not reported in the budget in 2004 - being so-called off-budget
 expenditures. In addition, unpredictability of donor aid has resulted in delayed and untimely
 budget allocations from the Ministry o f Finance (MoF) to the line ministries. A key step inthis
 process occurred when the Government worked with the extemal partners to develop a single

plan o f actions for the entire partnership, with a tighter prioritization o f actions and indicators
than i s given in the PARPA itself. This action plan is known as the Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF) matrix, which i s now part o f the PES, the Economic and Social Plan
submitted to Parliament.

31.      The PARPA is managed through the public planning system. This i s the five-year
government program (2000-2004), and i s subordinated by two main bands o f instruments: (i)
medium-term planning instruments- which include the sectoral and provincial strategic plans
and the medium-term financial framework (MTFF); and (ii)                    annual operation instruments, the
Economic and Social Plan (PES) and the State Budget (OE). Each year the PES determines the
targets and actions in line with the MTFF and the State Budget in line with the prevailing
restrictions on resource availabilities. It thereby determines the level of funded activity to be
executed. The PES is the critical link inrelation to which measures to achieve the following are
required: (i)   improvement in the interaction among Government institutions resulting in a more
consistent and detailed annual planning, hence reflecting the targets and actions to be carried out
in the year; (ii)     improvement in the implementation management o f PES and OE; And (iii)
improvement inmonitoring and review processes of PES andrelated reports, eliminating ad-hoc
reports not provided inthe planningprocess. The monitoring instruments o f the PES and OE are
the Balango do Programa Econbmico e Social (BdPES), and the quarterly budget execution
reports. The BdPES is a semesterly progress report submitted to Parliament. Its annual version
also serves as the annual PARPAprogress report.

32.      The Government works with the donors to refine the PAF matrix and to monitor
implementation. The Government and the G-17 have agreed to hold biannual meetings, in
April/May (Joint Review) and September (Mid-Year review) to review progress on the PAF
matrix, which forms the basis o f direct financial support to the budget. The most recent review
meeting took place inApril/May, 2005. This review assessedthe implementation o f the PARPA
and PAF in 2004. The main documents used for the assessment were the Government's annual
report on PARPA implementation (BdPES) for 2004, the budget execution report for 2004, the
Government's annual plan (PES), the Government's medium-term financial framework (MTFF),
and the State Budget (OE). The conclusions were formulated in an Aide Memoire agreed
between direct budget support donors and the Government in the context o f the Joint Review
which was completed on 12-13 May 2005. This review consisted o f a backward looking exercise
that assessed performance in 2004, and a forward looking exercise that articulated the need to
achieve the targets for the next two years. Joint government-donor working groups completed
detailed reviews invarious focal areas', and subsequently a supra technical group, co-chaired by
the Ministries of Plan and Development and Finance, reviewed the group outputs, and
articulated key overall actions which the Government agreed to implement over the period 2005-
2006.

33.      The PARPA implementation process is aligned with the MTFF, PES, and the OE.

        measurement o f fiscal outtums and reported in MoF's annual report on PES
        implementationto the parliament (FebruaryMarch).


    0   The sequence and timing o f existing SWAP and sector review processes i s aligned with
        the annual PARPA andPES review process, which would occur about three-four months
        after the end o f the fiscal year (i.e. in April/May), thus allowing fiscal results from the
        previous fiscal year (January to December) to inform these reviews.


    0   The PARPA and PES review allows all parties to review past progress and make
        indicative commitments on the basis o f actual outcomes inthe previous fiscal year.

34.     The Public Expenditure Review (PER) process will be annualized and integrated into
the cycle by being split into twoparts - a review of the outtums of the previous fiscal year to be
undertaken in time for the annual PARPA and PES review, and in addition a review of the next
fiscal year's budget inAugust, before the Council o f Ministers finalizes and submits the budget
to Parliament inSeptember.

A.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PARPAIMPLEMENTATIONPROGRESS


35.     PARPA implementation progress has been considered to be satisfactory since its
inception. Spending inthe priority sectors o f education, health, roads, water and agriculture has
produced good results and has helped reduce poverty directly and indirectly.               Increased
education spending has raisedthe gross enrolment rate inlower primary schools from 56 percent
in 1995 to 100 percent by 2001. The completion rate for the primary level (EP1) rose from 20
percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2003. Health spending increased access to health facilities and
services (e.g. vaccinations). Road rehabilitation and maintenance has also increased with the
number o f roads ingood or fair conditions rising from 57 percent in2000 to 70 percent in2003.
Lncreased spending on water resulted in greater access to safe water in the period 1996/97 to
2002/3 from 12 percent to 27 percent in rural areas and 54 percent to 64 percent inurban areas.
About 20 percent of farmers received extension services in2003 compared to about 7 percent in
2000.

36.     The Joint Review of May 2005 confirmed the continued good progress in
implementing the PARPA in 2004. The Mozambican economy continued to grow strongly. Real
GDP growth was 7.8 percent in 2003, and is estimated at 7.2 percent in 2004, primarily
reflecting a slow down in construction related to the completion o f two private sector mega
projects. Growth in most o f the sectors continued to be buoyant, including agriculture (8.9
percent), transport (16.4 percent), government services (9.4 percent) and mega-projects (15.4
percent). The end-of-period inflation rate declined to 9.1 percent (from 13.8 percent at end-
December 2003), despite a sharp rise in petroleum prices. The composition of growth indicates
that its base continues to be broad, and should have contributed to a further reduction in the
poverty level; but this can only be confirmed when a new household survey i s undertaken (Table

                                                   17

3). The banking system has reduced its vulnerability as the share o f non-performing loans has
decreased. Mega project-led exports have contributed to a significant decrease in the trade
deficit, which coupled with higher-than-projected donor support and private capital inflows,
boostedreserve accumulationto 4.8 months o f imports (including imports for mega projects),

37.      There was uneven progress in achieving the 2004 PAF targets due to political
economy factors. A major factor contributing to the mixed performance in 2004 was the
preparation and holding o f the presidential and parliamentary elections in December 2004.
Subsequently it took some time for the new Government to be formed, and Parliament passed
the budget for the year 2005 only in May 2005. Nevertheless, most PAF targets in service
delivery were broadly met, while several targets inthe areas o f public financial management and
governance reforms were only partly met. In particular, approvals o f the procurement and
commercial codes have been delayed and fiscal performance was below expectations, with the
collection o f revenues lower by about one percentage point o f GDP than programmed, which
contributed to the domestic primary deficit target being missed by 0.7 percent o f GDP. The
budget-support partners agree that the incoming Government has a unique opportunity to drive
forward on second-generation reforms, and to use the revision of the PARPA to further embed
these processes in Government policy across the board. The new Government has shown its
commitment to reform by making up after the Joint Review for the delays that have been
experienced in late 2004 and early 2005. After an extensive consultation process with all
stakeholders, the new procurement code is almost ready, and the first actions for its
implementation are already prepared. The Commercial Code is scheduled to be approved during
the next session o f Parliament in October. An equally important law to simplify the business
environment, the Commercial Registration Code, i s also ready to be approved at the same time,
and the Government has already signed a contract in June 2005 to computerize the entire
commercial registry. The latter action alone will reduce the time required to register a business
or a brand name by 30-50 days.

38.      Programme Aid Partners (PAPs) have madeprogress in improving the effectiveness of
their funding. There is improved donor harmonization, but there remains a need to continue
improving alignment and predictability. External consultants evaluated the performance o f the
PAPs against a PAP performance matrix (PAPPA) agreed to in 2004 as part o f the MoU. They
concluded that the donors made progress regarding harmonization, but still have a mixed record
inimplementing thebest-practice principles for directbudget su~port.~

39.      The new Government's Five Year Program indicates that PARPA 2 will focus on
accelerating shared growth.          The focus will be on improving the business environment
especially in rural areas. This would include simplifying red-tape for the private sector to
flourish; reform of the judiciary system; ensuring a corruption-free society; improved
agricultural services; and infrastructure investments, particularly in rural roads and electricity.
The new Government is committed to a major push invocational and technical training to raise
labor productivity. The share o f social sector expenditures will be maintained, but the quality
and timely delivery will be monitored more carefully at the district and community level. The
fight against HIV/AIDSandmalaria is also a top priority.

 40.     Monitoring of PARPA Implementation has improved, but challenges remain. There
 was limited progress against the PESPAF indicators relating to the integration o f PES, OE and
 Medium-Term Financial Framework (MTFF), using the single process methodology, and
 strengthening the BdPES. However, the 2004 PES and OE are a good representation of
 improved linkages between core actions, outputs and outcomes to be achieved towards the
 implementation o f the PARPA. The MTFF defines the base framework for 2004, and gives a
 perspective for the period 2005-2008, but its dissemination to the line ministries i s still weak.
 The Government has included the MTFF inthe 2005 budget. The BdPES is a better reflection o f
 the PES implementation, but still needs to provide more information on main policy
 developments and issues. Inaddition, the sector and provincial monitoring systems are not yet
 fully harmonized with the BdPES preparation. Although the relationship between the PES and
 OE has improved, it still needs to be strengthened in the areas o f identifylng costs, improving
 budget comprehensiveness with inclusion o f off-budget items and the beginning o f budget
 programming.

 A.l Building Public Sector Capacity &e. strengthening public financial management,
 decreasing aid dependency, and accelerating public sector reform)

 41.      Performance in public financial management has been mixed. In the area o f budget
 execution, spending in priority areas continues to be the main focus o f fiscal policy, Based on
 preliminaryfigures, spending in priority sectors remained below the 65 percent target at 63.3
 percent o f total expenditure, o f which 50.4 percent was in education and health. This shortfall i s
 explained by low reported rate o f externally financed projects. Progress in improving the
 comprehensiveness o f the budget is slow, with some own revenues and many off-budget
 activities not being captured. Execution o f the externally financed investment expenditures
 remains low at 52 percent, probably reflecting weak reporting rather than execution. The flow o f
 funds, from the perspective o f sectors and provinces, remains irregular and unpredictable. The
 reports from the key sectors (e.g. water, health, education, agriculture) show that consistency o f

                                                         19

information between different sources and stakeholders remains unsatisfactory. To ensure
efficiency o f public expenditures in the education sector issues o f teacher management,
deployment and compensation inthe expanded system needs to be monitored (Table 4).

42.     e-SISTAFE was rolled-out in the Ministry of Finance on November 1, 2004 allowing
financial execution of the State budget. This is significant as it will make budget execution
more efficient and transparent over the short to medium term. The indicator for progress in
rolling out the system was that general budget execution o f the 2004 State Budget, as well as
direct budget execution in the Ministries o f Finance and Education and Culture through e-
SISTAFE, would have been initiated. However, this has not been accomplished for the Ministry
o f Education and Culture (MEC) for a number o f reasons, and hence the 2004 PES/PAF
indicator i s considered to be partially met.

43.     Therehas been progress in the review of the internal and external auditfunctions. The
MinistryofFinance (MoF) completed the diagnostic study on the internal control institutions at
national level, the strategic plan 2005-2009, and a 2005 activity plan. A value-for-money audit
in the road sector, due to be conducted in 2004, was actually carried out at the beginning of
2005, and a draft report has been released. Concerning external audit, neither the assessment o f
the progress towards the 2004 PESPAF target, nor the discussion on the indicators and targets
for 2005-2007, took place. However, there was improvement in 2004 on the external audit by
the Auditor General ("Tribunal Administrativo") o f the General State Accounts, in terms o f
timeliness, quality and scope o f the audit report, which was debated inthe National Assembly in
April 2005.

44.     The 2004 PES/PAF indicator to approve a new procurement regulation was not met.
This was partly due to delays inconsultations with the different stakeholders. A well functioning
Public Procurement System has four pillars: (i)        a legal procurement framework, (ii)    modemized
procurement procedures, (iii)    the institutional capacity, and (iv) independent control and appeal
mechanisms to ensure the integrity o f the system as well as to have Anti-Corruption measures
incorporated. The Government has prepared its action plan to bring the procurement system up
to international standards.

45.     Performance in the tax system was mixed. The target to submit the draft legislation on
the creation o f a Central Revenue Authority to parliament was achieved, as the draft law was
submitted to Parliament in August 2004. Revenue collection was 12.3 percent o f GDP, about


                                                   20

one percentage point less than the target.8 Weak performance was observed across all categories
o f taxes. Greater efforts to improve tax administration are essential to maintain fiscal stability
and accelerate progress towards achieving the MDG's.

46.      Progress has been made on anti-corruption, but much remains to be done. The
national study on good governance, corruption and service provision was completed in the first
semester of 2005. It i s under consideration by the Council o f Ministers, and will serve as the
basis for the formulation o f an anti-corruption strategy. The study, however, has not yet been
officially published. The Anti-Corruption Law was approved in2004, and the HighAuthority for
Combat o f Corruption has recently been formally created and two regional delegations have
been established. Many alleged corruption cases were reported to the Gabinete Central de
Combate 6 Corrupcio (Anti-Corruption Unit), but the number o f completed investigations and
convictions has been very low. The Government has signed, but has not yet ratified the UN
convention and the SADC protocol on corruption. An institutionally comprehensive anti-
corruption strategy needs to be prepared, with strong political backing and clout.

47.      Overall progress in the area of public sector reform was slow. In the area o f public
sector reform the three targets agreed for 2004 have been partially met, with limited impact on
service delivery. The PESEAF target for completion and approval o f functional analyses (FAs)
o f Ministerial staffing was only partially met; out o f the six FAs only two have been formally
approved i.e. MINAG andMIC, and presentation o f the remaining four has been rescheduled for
2005. Preparatory work was undertakenfor the Medium-Term Pay Policy.

48.      There has been notable progress in decentralizatioddeconcentration against the
PESPAF targets, but a number of challenges remain. The targets for the introduction o f
participative district planninghave been achieved, and in some cases have exceeded the output
target. The regulations o f the Local Government Law were approved in April 2005.
Improvement inbudget execution and fiscal decentralisation needs to take place so that the local
authorities have greater autonomy. There i s some concem that the Government has focused
more on consolidation o f the municipalities rather than on their efficiency, and resources need to
be targeted to areas with greater poverty. Other concems are the quality of budget allocation,
execution and accountability mechanisms at the sub-national level. The percentage share o f the
budget going to provinces and districts has to some extent stagnated.

49.      Littleprogress was noted in the area of thejustice sector reforms and administration;
stronger Government commitment is essential. Progress was made in legislative reform and
training programs and an integrity study o f the judiciary was completed. However, the long-term
vision document, an essential part o f the reform program, was not completed. With regard to the
judiciary, a review o f the 2004 targets shows little progress, Despite an increase in the
productivity o f case disposition meeting the 2004 PAF target, the backlog and the total volume
o f judicial cases continues to increase. Slow processing o f civil cases, and highjudicial costs,
constitute barriers to contract enforcement. The target for decreasing the number of detainees
awaiting accusation and trial was not met. The ratio between investigated and sentenced cases in
the area o f corruption and economic crime continues to be low, and communication with the
public onthe resolution o f certain highprofile cases is still outstanding. Ifthe constraints are not

* This ratio isbased on the new GDP figures calculatedby the National Statistics Institute. It should be noted that
the ratios contained inthe PAF use the old GDP estimates.

                                                      21

overcome, they will continue to affect the appropriate functioning o f the administration o f
justice services, and the sector's capacity to contribute to poverty reduction. Henceforth, the
challenges continue to be enforcement o f human rights, access to justice, including both formal
and informal justice delivery and contribute to the promotion of social justice and a favorable
business and investment climate.

A.2 Improving the Investment climate (strengthening the financial sector, regulatory
environment, and expanding infrastructure)

50.      The overall performance of the enabling environment for private sector growth and
participation has been mixed. Generally there has been a slow down in the reform process
which could impact on growth inthe coming years. Key areas where a greater focus i s required
include banking efficiency, tradability o f land-use titles, labor law reform and energy availability
and efficiency for private sector growth.

51,      Overall progress in the financial sector was satisfactory. There was progress in four
main areas: (i)    the strategy for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) has been
presented; (ii)  the regulations related to the Banking Institutions law (LICSF) were approved;
 (iii) withdrawalofGovernmentparticipationinBancoAustralwas completed; and(iv) a
      the
chart o f accounts for the insurance sector was published. Areas where progress has been slower
 include the forensic audit o f Banco Austral, where it took a long time to find an international
reputable company willing to carry out such an audit, and the strategy for the Government's
withdrawal from Banco International de Mogambique (BIM), which is still under development.
 The Government is committed to establishing a Financial Investigations Unit and have it
 operational byDecember 2006.

 52.     Progress against the PES/PAF indicators for business environment is mixed, with
 optimismfor future improvement. Of the four PESPAF 2004 targets under the Ad Hoc Legal
 Reforms section: (i)   Amendment o f the Labor Law is in progress; (ii)Commercial Code i s
 delayed but progressing; (iii) regulations for licensing commercial and industrial activities are in
 place, as are (iv) inspections o f commercial and industrial activities. Much remains to be done
 at the level o f the PESPAF's Strategic Objective for 2004 which states "Creation o f favorable
 environment for private sector action". The approval o f the commercial code would be a step in
 this direction.

 53.     Growth in the agriculture sector remains strong. The growth inthe sector continues to
 be through expansion inlanduse and productivity gains inthe northern belt o f the country. The
 growth in output o f 9 percent was due to the increase in basic food crops (6 percent), and in
 export products (10.5 percent). Within basic food crops, grains contributed around 10.7 percent,
 with the maize contributing around 16 percent, while cassava maintained the growth same as in
 the previous year, around 4.3 percent. Amongst the cash crops cotton (69.9 percent), tobacco
 (33.7 percent) andtea leaf (19.2 percent) achieved significant outputs increases.

 54.     Some progress in agriculture service delivey, although the institutional reforms
 required to sustain this growth are slow. Most services indicators exceeded their targets, except
 for livestock vaccinations, which were below target by 50 percent. Some advances were
 recorded inthe institutional reform of the Ministryo f Agriculture (MINAG), namely the revision


                                                   22

and approval o f its statues and functions, and the ones for newlycreated or restructuredresearch
institutions; however, less then expected progress was made in drafting the plan for staff
resource development and deployment to the districts. The Ministry finalized the preparation o f
its strategy document for PROAGRI 2 (the agriculture strategy document). Delayed disburse-
ment continued to hamper the normal implementation o f the Ministry's work plan and budget,
resulting in only 62 percent o f the planned 2004 budget being executed. Specific budget
execution concerns include: (i)     lack o f a uniform mechanism for the flow o f information on
execution for projects outside o f PROAGRI' system; (ii)          information regarding execution o f the
external investment budget at the provincial level not being sent to central level; and (iii)          the
lack o f information on MINAGs procurement account.

55.      The energy sector shows progress in the majority of the indicators set in the sector
policy and strategy. Most notably the Ministry implemented the goals for connecting new
consumers, the Master Plan (2005-20) for grid extension has been completed, and distribution
networks for low-cost technologies andintermediate energy types are being established. The first
large-scale gas project has been implemented, and future areas for exploration and investment
have been identified. New sources of funding for FUNAE (National Energy Fund) have been
identified, but yet to be approved. Significant progress has been achieved in drafiing new
regulations for natural gas distribution and for the electricity sector.

56.      Overall the trend in the road sector is positive. The indicators o f progress were largely
achieved which included: the routine maintenance target was accomplished (103 percent); the
rehabilitation indicator was significantly exceeded (184 percent), largely by rehabilitating the
tertiary roads using the Road Fund(RF) budget; and funds for periodic maintenance were about
80 percent o f the planned amount. The RF transferred funds from periodic maintenance to
emergency and rehabilitation works (in breach o f its policy o f giving priority to routine and
periodic maintenance over rehabilitation and new construction) largely in response to urgent
repair works needed on priority roads. Progress in institutional reforms has been satisfactory
with the separation o f the RF from the Road Agency, namely Administraqio Nacional de
Estradas (ANE). Both have an independent oversight Board with private sector and user
representation. Other reforms include: the technical and financial audits o f road sector
expenditure programs which are regularly performed by the RF; the gradual phasing out o f force
account operations which have been replaced by increased private sector participation;
introduction o f improved financial management systems and transparent procurement methods;
and direct transfers to the Provincial Authorities for routine maintenance. However, further
improvements need to be made in: instituting better reporting systems with separate accounts for
routine, periodic and rehabilitation works; monitoring and evaluating performance and
outcomes; increased funding for periodic maintenance and adequate provision o f counterpart
 funds; and the organizational structure and institutional capacity o f ANE. Institutional capacity
o f ANE for implementation o f projects and supervision services is limited. Additionally, the
 flow o f timely investment funds from the Ministry o f Finances are matters o f major concern.
Another area o f major concern is the bureaucratic and lengthy process o f contractor and
 consultant payments. This has resulted in significant RF debts related to late payment, interest
 and claims (approximately $10 million in 2004), and has a detrimental impact on private sector
 development, especially o f smaller companies.

 approach.

A.3 Enhancingservice delivery(health, education, rural water andsanitation)

57.      Delivery of key services showed good overall progress. Ineducation progress seems to
be satisfactory in terms o f enrolment levels. Despite promising progress in girls' enrolment,
regional and gender inequalities continue. Close attention is required to monitor primary school
completion rates, with a particular focus on regional and gender dimensions. As mentioned
previously, there i s a further need to address structural issues related to teacher education,
management, deployment and compensation, at all levels. The proportion o f unqualified teachers
continues to increase, particularly in disadvantaged provinces. Another important issue to be
addressed i s that o f monitoring leaming outcomes. Currently there i s no student leaming
assessment in place. Finally, the preparation o f the investment framework for the Second
Education Sector Strategic Program (ESSPII) has yet to be finalized. Inhealth there was positive
overall progress, both in MDG indicators measured by the demographic and health survey o f
2003 and in the PESPAF indicators, although DPT coverage rates stagnated in 2004. In
HIV/AIDS the targets for 2004 were satisfactorily met, but implementation of an equitable
multi-sectoral HIV response remains a major challenge. Inwater sector the coverage target was
partially achieved, but the government i s still facing significant challenges in improving
sanitation services. (Table 5)

58.       Overall performance against the three H I V A I D S PAF/PES indicators in 2004 was
satisfactory. The target for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) was 81
percent met. Although this target was not fully achieved, overall progress is positive, as 2004
was the first year o f implementation o f the program PEN Sa~de,and there were significant
challenges in scaling-up access to care and treatment. The target for antiretroviral (ARV)
treatment was exceeded. The HIV prevalence rate still shows an upward trend consistent with
the projected HIV prevalence done earlier for the period 1998-2010. There was significant
progress in the application o f the "Three Ones"- namely the establishment o f one national
 strategic plan; one coordinating mechanism; and one national monitoring and evaluation system.
Political leadership at all levels and across all sectors i s crucial to an effective national response
 - yet the Aids Council (CNCS) Board (which should spearhead this effort) didnot meet in2004,
 compounding the fact that political leadership has been sub-optimal. HIV/AIDS is inextricably
 linked to gender inequality and poverty, and must be tackled through a coordinated multi-sector

                                                   24

response, yet few sectors have mainstreamed HIV/AIDS programs. The M E C has made progress
on mainstreaming HIV/AIDS and education and launching school level activities with the
support o f various partners, including the World Bank. The upsurge in the number o f orphans
and vulnerable children has stretched coping mechanisms beyond their limits. Civil society
engagement at all stages o f strategy development and implementation i s key to the achievement
ofPAF/PES, PEN11and PENSaitde targets, but has yet to be adequately recognized. Significant
delays inthe development o f a workable Grant Management System have detracted CNCS from
focusing on its core business o f coordinating, leading andmonitoring the national response.

59.      I n the education sector, the net enrollment indicator from the PES/PAF matrix was
achieved. The performance o f the education sector has on the whole been positive over the
period 2003 and 2004. Gross Enrolment Rates (GER) has continued to improve from 110.4
percent in2003 to 121.2 percent in2004 at EP1 level (primary). EP2 level (secondary) has also
shown some improvement where the GER has increased from 35.5 percent in 2003 to 42.7
percent in 2004. Net Enrollment Rates (NER) has shown some positive trends, with EP1
schools registering an increase from 67.9 percent in2003 to 75.6 percent (73.2 percent for girls)
in2004. It is important to note that the PAF target for NERwas set at 72 percent total for EP1,
where girls would have attained 69 percent. Similarly, EP2 schools have also seen the NER
increase from 4.3 percent in 2003 to 5.6 percent in 2004. These rates reflect serious constraints
in access beyond EP1and a highproportion o f over-age pupils inthe system. Greater attention
needs to be made to ensure that quality o f education is not compromised during the necessary
expansion of the system. Repetition rates at EP1 have dropped from 21.9 percent to 20.8 percent
over the same period; with less than satisfactory result for EP2, where the repetition rate has
actually increased from 19.5 percent in2003 to 20.3 percent in2004.9

60.      The education sector continues to progress, but a focus on quality is critical. The
Government abolished the payment o f compulsory fees that were being made inprimary schools.
While this is an important step forward, the desired impact interms o f additional enrollment and
retention through the primary cycle remains to be seen: the G o M did not provide additional
resources to offset the loss o f revenue from school-based fees and levies which for most primary
schools i s the only source of revenue to cover day to day expenses. The implementation o f the
New Curriculum for Basic Education and literacy and non-formal education, as well as the
HIV/AIDS Strategy, constituted areas o f progress. Important changes were seen at the post-
secondary education level. The revision o f the secondary School curriculum is in process to
improve the quality and relevance o f this sub-sector. A reform o f Technical-Professional
Education i s also in progress with the participation o f the private sector, national, and
international partners.

61.      Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education and Culture faces serious challenges. The
Education Sector Strategic Program (ESSP) 11has not been finalized as foreseen inthe PES/PAF
because o f some weaknesses in the planning capacity at MEC. The difficulties observed in the
area o f financial management led to low budget execution, hindered the disbursements o f
education (FASE) funds, and caused delays in salary payments for teachers and subsidies for
 literacy trainers, thereby compromisingMEC's programs. Teacher training, includingin-service
training, and distribution o f text books still do not respond to needs inthe sector. Similarly, in


   This might be the result o f the new curriculumwhich effectively has removed the exambarrier between grades 6
 and 7, only for students to sit for the exam at grade 7.

                                                          25

the area ensuring greater gender balance progress was weak. Additionally the major issue with
expansion i s that the Government has been hiring new teachers without the requisite
qualifications. Recent statistics indicate that over the years the proportion of unqualified teachers
has been increasing and the recent spurt o f hiring nearly 5000 new teachers is likely to
exacerbate this situation."

62.     The Health sector performed positively in 2004. In addition to the 2.1 percent increase
in the global volume of activities, two out o f three targets set in the PES/PAF were achieved.
Only the coverage o f DPTHeB (3rd dose) remained unchanged compared to 2003, a weakness
which can be attributed to problems with the management o f the vaccination programme (PAV),
particularly in logistics (vaccine supply and the regular operation o f the cold chain in the health
units) and the poor performance o f the outreach teams. Expansion o f basic and essential
obstetric services and interventions within the network also contributed to the overall positive
performance, resulting in a reduction o f infant and under-five mortality rates per 1,000 live
births from 147 to 124, and from 219 to 178, respectively, based on Demographic and Health
Surveys o f 1997 and 2003. Provision o fHIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services improved,
with the entry into operationo f 113 voluntary counseling and testing sites and 25 Day-Hospitals.
Access to ARV treatment remains limited and a systematic analysis o f how men andwomen are
affected differently by HIV/AIDS, i s still being institutionalized inthe sector. The share o f total
budget allocated to the health sector has fallen, from 14 percent in 2002 to 11percent in 2004,
although its execution has shown some improvements.

63.     I n water and sanitation, the PES/PAF indicator for access to safe water is for 41
percent coverage, with the sector achieving 39.8 percent in 2004, implying an overall
satisfactory performance*1. Sanitation coverage figures for rural and urban areas are based on
various surveys, but these do not allow the monitoring o f the indicator on an annual basis. The
government i s still facing challenges in the improvement o f sanitation services. First steps in
improving the monitoring system for which the National Department o f Water (DNA) is
responsible were made, with some provinces and cities having updated sector databases. Budget
execution figures are still not finalized as the budget execution report do not coincide with either
DNA or DPOPH (Provincial Directorate o f Public Works and Housing) financial figures. The
final figures will only be available once the General State Accounts are completed. Internal
investment spending at central level has improved to 55.5 percent, but this is still too low.
Treasury difficulties continued to hamper budget execution in the sector. Execution o f the
external component o f the investment budget at the central level, however, i s alarmingly low at
22.8 percent, due to slow disbursement o f funds. The majority o f the provinces (Tete, Sofala,
Maputo, Gaza, Nampula, Inhambane andNiassa) have reported investment execution rates o f at
least 70 percent, and some report on-time disbursements from Ministryo f Finance (MoF), while
others report execution rates below 60 percent due to late disbursement from MoF. Progress has
 also been registered in international river management, in the elaboration o f National Water
Resources Strategy, and inthe revision o fthe National Water Policy and Water Act.

B.      DONORHARMONIZATION

64.     Intensive efforts towards donor harmonization have taken place in thepast two years.
Good progress has been made inharmonizing donor programs", and improving their alignment
with government policy, with agreements andmechanisms developed to handle donor-donor and
donor-government relationships. Considerable effort has been invested in this, both interms of
discussions and evaluations. This section will review the progress made.

65.     The proportion of external funds subject to the budget process, and the level of
discretionay expenditure in the budget, have increased. The volume andproportion o f aid that
i s channeled through the budgetary process has increased consistently over the last five years.
While the first harmonization moves by donors were to pool funding in sub-sector and sector
arrangements outside the nationalbudget, inthe last two years sector-wide approaches have been
increasingly channeled through treasury accounts as earmarked funding. More hndamentally,
the level of funds allocated as general budget support has increased from around $100 million in
2000 to $154 million in 2003, and around $250m pledged for 2004 (Table 6). Part o f 2004's
growth in general budget support (GBS) i s due to the fact that some significant donors (EC,
DFID) have increased the overall level o f aid and the proportion allocated to GBS; and part to
the fact that other donors havejoined the club.

66.     Policy dialogue has become morefocused on key publicpolicy and public expenditure
issues and processes. The main vehicles for this have been the Framework Agreement on Joint
Donor Programme for Macro-Financial Support in the year 2000 and the Memorandum o f
Understanding o f 2004 (Annex 2).           The latter was also signed by the Bank. The negotiation
process and the agreements themselves have established the key principles, conditions and
working arrangements amongst donors, and between donors and the Government. Inparticular,
the M o U established the commitments o f donors interms o f disbursements, and o f Government
in terms o f the priority to pro-poor expenditure and improved financial management. This was
further strengthened by the establishment o f ajoint donor-government Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF), setting targets for government achievement. In order to ensure mutual
accountability, donor performance is also assessed each year by independent consultants through
the Programme Aid Partners Performance Assessment (PAPPA).

67.      There are many challenges ahead. Late donor disbursements remain one o f the factors
contributing to low budget execution rates. In2004 donors set up their own monitoring system.
There has been relatively little attention so far to broader issues o f domestic accountability, and
to cross-cutting issues andreforms that go beyond particular sectors. The national authorities are
perceived by donors as claiming increased ownership throughthe dialogue over the principles o f
GBS collaboration. There remain questions about whether the practice has over-burdened
government with heavy joint review processes, and assertion by donors o f their own policy
priorities inthe PAF.

68.      Technical assistance andlor capacity-building has become morefocused on key public
policy and public expenditure issues and processes. While systems have been established to
harmonize objectives and strengthen joint planning between government and donors,
weaknesses remain in the government's capacity to plan and execute budgets. There is a
program for the reform and computerization o f the public financial management system
(SISTAFE), but many bilateral donors see this as being too focused on financial reporting and
accounting, and not enough on prioritization and budgetary allocation. There i s also a cross-
governmental program o f public sector reform led by a technical unit for public sector
restructuring (UTRESP). Nonetheless, donors and government are focusing more on the more
urgent need to build the capacity o f Ministries o f Planning and Development and Finance.
Current technical assistance within the ministry i s managed on a project basis by diverse donors;
there i s now a recognition o f the need to systematize this.

69.      Donors have aligned more of their aid with national goals and systems. While the
PARPA is the formal basis o f alignment, all the largest donors and many o f the smaller ones
have now aligned themselves through the government's own planningprocesses: the economic
and social plan (PES) and a shared matrix o f performance targets (the PAF). This is seen by
government and donors as a major advance towards alignment and national ownership.
Moreover, by setting indicators the PAF `concretizes' shared objectives which were otherwise
only qualitatively stated (ifat all) inthe PARPA. The PAF and the joint review process have the
effect o f aligning goals both inthe annual setting o f targets and intheir monitoring.



                                                 28

70.     Donor activities in Mozambique have become more harmonized. There are now
carefully worked out procedures for harmonization between the GBS donors, and these
arrangements also involve a wider range o f associated observers. The importance o f GBS as a
proportion o f aid i s growing. The main donors not being a member o f the G17 are the USA and
Japan. They have an observer status inthe G17, and they participate inthe Joint Sector Working
Groups. The latter is also tme for the UNsystem. UNDP and the specialized agencies participate
fully inthe Joint Sector Working Groups; some ofthem are chairedby staff from the UNfamily.     I

However, all the donors that contribute to GBS also provide other forms o f aid that i s less
harmonized; for most of them, other forms o f aid are more important. Even so, sector working
groups and the PAF discussions influence priorities not only o f GBS expenditure but also o f
project aid.

71.     Nevertheless, there are issues about the gap between plan and reality. Disbursement
have sometimes not been made according to plan. Also the Bank found the constraints o f the
MoUand o fthe slimmed down 50 PAFindicators too restrictive. Therefore, the Bank's PRSC 1
contained a Program Matrix that was different from the PAF, even though it had signed the MoU
earlier. Starting with the proposed PRSC 2, the Bank will now adhere fully to the PAF and no
longer elaborate a separate Program Matrix.

              IV.     BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY


A.       CONSISTENCYOFTHE PRSCWITH THE CAS

72.      The PRSC is consistent with the CAS. Bank support to the PARPA i s through the
FY04-07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No. 26747-Moz). The base case scenario
o f the CAS envisages programmatic support through four consecutive PRSCs to support
Mozambique's efforts in building public-sector capacity and accountability, improving the
investment climate, and expanding service delivery. The PRSCs would systematically address
the issues o f poverty reduction across sectors identified in the PARPA. It would continue to
support the maintenance o f macroeconomic stability, but the focus would increasingly shift to
cross-cutting public sector management and sector-level issues, with the key challenge being to
replicate a strong macroeconomic policy and implementation record at the sector level to
facilitate economic transformation and permanent poverty reduction. One o f the key CAS
objectives is to achieve a full alignment o f Bank instruments with the principles o f local
ownership and leadership. Because Government policies and the Government budget are the key
instruments for implementing the PARPA, the Bank is committed to supporting and aligning
with the budget process.

B.       COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF

73.      The IMF approved a PRGF in 2004 which complements Bank support. InJuly 2004
the IMF approved a new arrangement under the PovertyReduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
to support the Government's economic program for the period 2004-2006. The structural
reforms supported by the PRGF aim to consolidate macroeconomic stability and sustain strong
broad-based growth, consistent with the PARPA. The Bank and the IMF cooperate closely
within their respective mandates in assisting the government implement the PARPA. The IMF
leads the policy dialogue on macroeconomic policy (including fiscal, monetary, and exchange
rate policies), the integrated financial management information system (SISTAFE) and tax and
customs reforms. The Bank leads the policy dialogue on public expenditure management, sector
structural reforms, reforms o f the civil service, and poverty and social impact analysis. Areas of
close collaboration include banking supervision, financial sector issues, trade issues, the
PARPA, and external debt sustainability (Annex 3).

74.      The required progress for the PRGF in 2005 is evident. The program for 2005
envisages growth o f 7.3 percent, and a further decline in inflation to 8.5 percent by year's end.
The fiscal program seeks to increase revenues through improvements in tax administration and
the expiration o f some tax benefits, and to reduce the domestic primary deficit to 3.3 percent o f
GDP, with the view of providing appropriate room for credit to the private sector. The overall
deficit after grants i s projected to widen in 2005, owing to a substantial increase in capital
outlays financed with concessional project loans, and with a part o f the proceeds from a signing
fee paid in 2004 by a Brazilian company for coal prospecting and exploratian inMoatize. (This
signingfee was treated as a "below the line" financing item.) Several steps are envisaged toward
establishing a Central Revenue Authority by 2006, and strengthening public expenditure
management and fiscal transparency.



                                                  30

75.     The PRGF program includes additional measures to improve liquidity sterilization.
Further steps will also be taken to strengthen the balance sheet o f the Bank o f Mozambique,
improve banking supervision, and move towards International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) in the banking system. The enhanced supervisory regime for the largest bank was
discontinued following the approval o f the bank's financial statements for 2004, and a feasibility
study on the divestment o f the government's participation inthe bank will be completed by end-
September 2005.

C.     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

76.    I t is envisaged that programmatic lending will be complemented by investment
support. PRSC support will coexist with investment support to well-articulated sector programs,
and with technical assistance to the development o f government systems and capacities
necessary for an increased reliance on those systems and capacities to channel external support.
The share o f programmatic financing in overall financing inFY04 and FY05 was approximately
30 percent (or $60 million out o f $207 million o f new financing over the two years taken
together). PRSC 1 covered primarily cross-cutting issues, policy dialogue, and other Govern-
ment actions with no specific conditions related to service delivery. PRSC 2 would continue to
strengthen the capacity built under PRSC 1. Future PRSCs would increasingly embrace sector
progress and support the new Government's focus on development at the district level, thus
enabling both Bank and Government to learn and continuously evaluate the appropriateness o f
this approach.    The PRSC process recognizes that conditionality in itself is ineffective in
improving economic policy, and that domestic considerations, which are relatively immune to
donor pressures, are the prime factor in achieving and sustaining economic and institutional
reform.   The PRSC's will continue to draw conditions exclusively from the PAF matrix, as
revised each year duringthe Mid-YearReview inSeptember.

77.     The primary aim of the PRSC is to help achieve and monitor progress towards a
strategic subset of objectives defined in the PAF matrix. Given that the proposed operation is
part o f the first cycle o f a PRSC multisectoral program, a strong focus on PARPA
implementation is required. Disbursements will be contingent on progress towards a subset o f
the PARPA's medium-term objectives as set out in the PAF matrix. Emphasis is placed on
establishing an adequate M&E system for prior actions and triggers included inthe PRSC series,
taking care to ensure that this system also strengthens the Government's poverty monitoring
system, including the Poverty Observatory. The resources provided through the PRSC will
complement Government and other resources.

78.     ThePRSC series serves as a vehicleforpolicy dialogue. The policy dialogue focuses on
public sector capacity and accountability with a strong focus on strengthening financial
management, improving the investment climate and expanding service delivery. Technical
assistance i s beingprovided through separate projects for public sector reform program, judicial
reform, and regulatory reform in selected infrastructure sectors, private sector development, and
decentralization to municipalities and local governments. A financial sector technical assistance
operation will soon be presented to the Board. The PRSC series i s also complementary to
parallel efforts to reduce poverty supported through a large portfolio o f investment projects in
HIV/AIDS, education, strengthening local governments, water supply and sanitation, roads,
railways, and other infrastructure.


                                               31

79.     As of March 2005, total Bank commitments were $945 million. Details of the
investment programs are in the attached Table 7. The investment portfolio of 19 projects is
diverse and supports the three pillars o f the CAS. Inthe agriculture and environment sector
support has been provided to a sector-wide assistance program (SWAP) that seeks to improve
the impact o f public expenditures and provide an enabling environment for sustainable and
equitable growth in the rural areas. The Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Management Project
pilots an integrated approach to sustainable development in two coastal areas. Inthe education
there are two programs strengthening the capacity o f public institutions. The Education Sector
Strategic Program supports the implementation of the National Education Strategy and the
Higher Education project supports the entire higher education system. In transport and
infrastructure there are four investment programs supporting rehabilitation and maintenance of
roads, railways and ports and improved communications. The water sector programs aim to
improve delivery of water supply systems in both urban and rural areas. Strengthening the
investment climate and encouraging private sector participation has been supported through
projects in the communications and minerals sector, and through the private enterprise
development project.

D.      LESSONSLEARNED

80.     There is evidence of greater country ownership of the PARPA process. As donors
support programmatic lending with direct budget support and its alignment and harmonization
with the PARPA, PES, OE, BdPES and the quarterly budget execution reports, there is greater
government ownership. The harmonization process i s predicated on using Government
documents rather than independentassessments as the basis for planning and monitoring. While
some o f the documents and data still need to be improved, and the various planning instruments
integrated into a single process, the new approach launched with the M o U has increased
Government's ownership of the process, and it has enhanced domestic accountability, as
Parliament analyzes the same documents as the development partners. It i s clear that donors
need to be sensitive to limited government capacity. But it is better to work with documents that
have full domestic ownership even if they do not (yet) measure up to best practice planning and
monitoring standards. This process has resulted in an increased work-load for the central
ministries, and has strengthened the role o f the Council o f Ministers. The Ministries o f Finance
and o f Planning have to engage in substantive discussions on priority allocation o f resources,
targets and indicators with the line Ministries. Previously this was done by the line ministries
together with the key donors, but now the focus has changed and made this a more internal
process. The bottom line for Government: ownership means more coordination work, more
dialogue inter- and intra- ministries andmaking tough choices on allocating resources.

81.     Donor harmonization is taking root. The signing o fthe Memorandum o f Understanding
with the Government and 17 donors providing direct budget support, and the agreement on the
Performance Assessment Framework in April 2004, opened a new era in policy dialogue,
partnership, and donor harmonization. For the first time, the Bank participated in this
harmonization mechanism with its first series o f PRSCs. Two Joint Reviews were held inApril
2004 and May 2005 and a Mid-Year Review in September 2004. In-between, regular meetings
took place according to the structure described inAnnex 2. Canada and Spain started to provide
direct budget support and signed the M o U in 2005, thereby turning the G15 into the G17. A
bilateral agency chairs the G I 7 group for a year on a rotating basis. The Chair for 2004-05
(April-April) was held by Switzerland. Sweden is chairing in 2005-06 and the Netherlands in
2006-07. The harmonizationprocess has been evaluated by independent consultants working on
behalfo f the G17, and by a Development Assistance Committee (DAC) expert group.

82.     Transaction costs are still significant as theprocess is new. Duringthe year, the burden
on the government has somewhat diminished, but it i s high during the period o f the Joint
Reviews. On the donor side, the numerous working groups, sub-groups, and coordination
meetings imply a significant and almost permanent time commitment. But coordination among
donors has become more effective and meaningful, and the consensus between the government
and the donors has been strengthened. As hrther experience i s gained, simplification o f the
harmonization structure will have to be contemplated to reduce transaction costs for both the
Government and the donors.

83.     Monitoring indicators have changed to reflect realities. As the Government and the
donors become familiar with the PRSC process and changes occur inthe economy, the technical
review teams have focused on indicators that will reflect in a more appropriate manner progress
inthe implementationof the PARPA. It was agreed that at the time of the midyear review in


                                                34

September, changes to the indicators for year n+l could be made. Hence inSeptember 2004, the
2005-2007 indicators were defined. In September 2005, the indicators for 2006-2008 will be
agreedupon.

84.     Monitoring the PAF indicators has been a positive experience. The self-imposed limit
o f monitoring not more than 50 indicators has forced a healthy discipline in setting priorities.
However, there are instances where sector and thematic working groups continue to analyze
many issues, rather than focusing on a few to judge whether progress has been satisfactory or
not. Monitoring indicators were given little importance inthe past, but now they play a key role
as nearly $300 million worth o f direct budget support are dependent on indicator-measured
progress. Experience has shown that the choice o f the indicators and activities to be monitored
still requires more analytical work, policy dialogue, and better quality data. This will be
addressedduringthe revision o f the PARPA.

85.     Processesand approach within the Country Team change. On the Bank side, preparing
and supervising the PRSC has encouraged the country team to find new ways to work inmulti-
sector teams, and to find new and innovative ways to carry out policy dialogue through the
various lending instruments. During the first phase o f the PRSC series, when attention was
focused on cross-cutting issues o f public financial management, accountability and investment
climate, some o f the sector specialists felt marginalized. As the team has moved into preparing
PRSC 2, and as more experience has been gained in working with the budget support
harmonization structure and the sector working groups, the synergies o f a multi-sector team are
starting to bear h i t s and allow for a much more effective method o f policy dialogue with both
the Government andthe other donors.

86.     With regard to the reform efforts supported by the PRSC, significant progress has
been made, while still much remains to be done. Introducing e-SISTAFE has started an
irreversible change process in the public administration and the investment climate is beginning
to improve as a result o f a stronger financial sector and new legislation simplifying procedures.
On the other hand, some o f the other items on the public sector reform and governance agenda
have not moved decisively - an experience shared by other African countries, as recent Bank
research has shown."      The PRSC and DBS harmonization experience has also shown that many
sector ministries are not interacting effectively with the central ministries o f Planning and
Development and Finance. They are still more used to talking to donors about projects. As direct
budget support becomes an ever more important instrument, this is bound to change, which will
reinforce local ownership and accountability.

E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNING OFTHE PRSC

87.     As Table 8 shows, the first PRSC series is built on analyticalwork that was completed in
implementingthe PARPA, and that informs the PRSC with respect to the adequacy of policies
and institutions inareas relating to fiduciary and environmental safeguards.

PSIA on Primary        FY05    The analyses conclude that school fees are not the major constraint to
 school fees                   enrollment and retention. I t is rather the distance to primary schools in
                               rural areas, and the existence o f other direct costs (school materials) that

 88.       Poverty Assessment. Usingthe nationally representative household surveys o f 1996-07
 and 2002-03, the poverty headcount i s estimated to have fallen from 69 percent to 54 percent in
 the intervening period. Thus, the goal set inthe PARPA of a poverty rate o f 60 percent by 2005
 has already been achieved, with the reductions slightly swifter in rural areas. These findings,
 which indicate that the Government's overall poverty program i s on the right track and achieving
 results, broadly agree with results from other data sources: (i)          MINAG data indicate that the per
 capita growth rate o f cereal crop production was 14 percent in the six-year period 1996-2003
 (i.e. a little over 2 percent annually), and mean household income increased by 61 percent; (ii)             a
 qualitative indicators survey (QUIBB) in 2000/01 found that poverty had decreased by nine
 percentage points, using an econometric technique to link the (purely qualitative) QUJBBwith
 the household survey o f 1996; (iii) the household and agricultural surveys, dramatic increases
                                         in
 were found in the numbers o f bicycles, radios and other assets over 1996-2003; and finally (iv)
 education and health indicator surveys found strong improvements, particularly in the areas of
 primary school attendance, vaccination coverage, and attended births, over 1996-2003.

89.       Country Economic Memorandum. A new Country Economic Memorandum12 reviews
the economic performance inrecent years, provides a thorough analysis o f the poverty profile in
Mozambique based on the new household survey data, and analyzes the linkages between
economic growth, macroeconomic policies, and poverty inMozambique. It suggestspolicies for
the optimal use o f Mozambique's natural resources - land, forestry, fisheries, mining and water
-and for integratingtheir management into the overall growth strategy. Analytical work on
rural development andtourism, supported bythe Bank, has contributed to this exercise. Some o f
the findings o f these inquiries are expected to be incorporated into the new PARPA for the
period 2006-2010.

90.       Public Expenditure Reviews. PERs were completed in FY02 (in conjunction with the
CFAA) and in FY04, in a participatory process that brought together central and sectoral
government institutions, local and international academic and research institutes, the private
sector, and a variety o f donors. The recommendations o f these PERs focused on improving
budget formulation, execution and reporting to enable better tracking and informed decision-
making conceming poverty-related expenditures. As the Bank and other donors provide larger
proportions o f their assistance inthe form o f budget support, the PERprocess will be annualized
and closely integrated with the Government's budget cycle to support specific reforms in the
budget process. To improve results-based M&E, some public expenditure analysis and review
will be progressively integrated into the cycle o f financial management (e.g. through analyzing
several sectors each year).

91.       Public Financial Management. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) was completed in 2001 in collaboration with several donors and the Government, an
IMF Review o f Standards and Codes (ROSC), and a joint Bank-IMF assessment o f the
Government's capacity to track poverty-reducing expenditures, have also been completed. All
noted recent improvements and continuing challenges in Mozambique's public financial
management and fiduciary systems. They also identified specific action plans for dealing with
weaknesses in coordinating support and policy dialogue on these issues. Government actions
being supported by the PRSC series play a central role in helping to implement these action
plans.

92.       Procurement. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was prepared in
2001, but it was only in 2004 that the Government agreed to take action. In line with these
recommendations, and with the support o f this PRSC, a new procurement decree following
international best practice will be submitted to the Council o f Ministers for approval following
extensive consultations with main stakeholders including development partners.

93.       Financial Sector Analyses. Since 2000, the Bank has completed a study o f the financial
sector, AAA on Mozambique's compliance with the Base1 Principles, and a formal financial
sector assessmentjointly with the IMF (FSAP). The May 2003 FSAP assessment found that the
potential vulnerabilities of the banking system lie mostly in its loan portfolio; that banks are
exposed to high credit risk due to high and volatile lending rates (themselves due to volatile
inflation, high interest rate spreads and a poor lending environment); that high interest rate
spreads result from large provisioning requirements, high overheads, and (for smaller well-run
banks) high profit margins; and that the poor lending environment results from high corporate

leverage, a low number of bankable projects, a weak repayment culture, and various legal and
institutional impediments to credit selection and recovery. It also found that the volatility o f the
Metical threatens financial sector stability and development by promoting dollarization and
raising the cost o f domestic public debt. The PRSCs address a number o f these issues by
supporting Government action to strengthen banking supervision; improving market oversight
through transitioning the banks to international financial reporting standards (IFRS); completing
the Government's divestiture from the banking system; and improving the lending environment
through needed legal reforms (including the adoption of a new Commercial Code). Inaddition,
a proposed Financial Sector Technical Assistance investment project will facilitate the
implementation o f the mainFSAP recommendations.

94.     Legal and Judicial Sector Assessment. This Bank assessment, which i s under
Government review, found that: (i)   Mozambique's legal andjudicial sector institutions have not
kept pace with economic growth in the 1990s, with the result that public confidence in them i s
low, and they are now perceived to be a deterrent to investment and a hindrance to growth; (ii)
the sector's key problem is a relative lack o f skilled human resources; (iii) sector needs to
                                                                                 the
develop results-focused management practices and a culture o f accountability for results; (iv)
while some laws (e.g. regardingland and labor) are ahindranceto growth and should be revised,
the main effort should focus not on legislative but on administrative reform; (v) sector
institutions must fight and be seen to fight corruption, or their reform efforts overall will become
irrelevant. The PRSC series has responded to these findings by including conditionality linkedto
corruption; helping to institute a results-focused management process within Government; and
benchmarking Government actions intended to improve the administration o fjustice (also to be
supported through a proposed legal capacity strengthening project).

95.     Investment Climate Assessment. The Bank, together with the Investment Promotion
Center and the Confederation o f Economic Associations o f Mozambique, completed an I C A in
2003. From an analysis o f 193 firms surveyed in 2002, the I C A found that the most severe
constraints to doing business in Mozambique included: (i)     lack o f access to and the high cost o f
finance (cited by 78 percent o f the sample); (ii)   Mozambique's uncertain policy environment;
(iii)the costs imposed byregulatory and administrative procedures; and (iv) inadequate
infrastructure. The PRSC series i s helping the Government to complete actions designed to ease
some o f these key constraints, including the time and cost involved in registering a business;
labor regulations governing short-term hires, expatriate hires andretrenchment benefits; the time
involved in clearing imports and exports; as well as the cost and reliability o f electricity and
telecommunications services. Policy dialogue will also address emerging issues, such as delays
inthe Government paymentofVAT refunds.

96.     Education PSIA. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA, FY05) has studied the
impact o f school fees on primary school enrollment and retention. It was undertaken to fill the
information gap on the impact o f direct costs (formal and informal school fees and related
schooling expenses), and opportunity costs on enrollment and pupil retention in primary
education. The main recommendations were for the Government to: (i) the current policy
                                                                            revise
on school fees, to clarify the type (if any), purpose, frequency o f fee contributions, payment
mechanisms and accountability o f funds; (ii)    initiate public information campaigns to educate
communities on the right o f children to attend primary school; (iii)    increase resources that are
channeled directly to the schools, mainly through the Direct Support for Schools program, to


                                                 38

ease the burden on households, especially when it comes to purchasingpupil's school materials;
(iv) ensure better deployment o f teachers so as to distribute qualified teachers, especially inrural
areas; and (v) build schools closer to the communities, so as to reduce the travel time to school,
and consolidate lower and upper primary schools into one physical place to increase the
likelihood o f continuation from one level to the next.

97.     Better Public Health Spending to Reach the MDGs. The main sector issues identified
are: the lack of adequate human resources (in 2003, Mozambique had one doctor per 40,000
inhabitants compared to one for 22,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa) and low pay; uneven geographic
access and utilization o f health services; weaknesses in quality o f services; irregular application
o f user charges that are a disincentive to receiving care, and low budget execution. Key
recommendations include the need to focus on strengthening management and improving the
coverage and skill levels o f paramedical staff. There i s a need for Mozambique's budget to be
more strategically designed so as to allocate funds for operations and investment in areas where
they would have the strongest impact in achieving better health outputs and outcomes. To that
effect, the government would need to focus on: (i)    increasing the staffing o f health facilities in
the most rural areas; (ii) increasing the ratio o f health personnel to population in the Northem
provinces; (iii) introducing contracts with appropriate incentives to encourage health personnel
to practice inrural and difficult areas; and (iv) preparing and implementing a medium-termplan
to reach the appropriate mix o fhuman resources for the health sector.

98.     OED review of aa'justment lending in Mozambique: During FY02, OED reviewed
eight IDA projects, including four adjustment operations, in Mozambique during FY90-FYO1.
The adjustment operations aimed to help stabilize the post-war economy, improve public sector
management, transform the economy from a centrally-planned to a market-oriented one,
reallocate public spending to poverty-reducing activities, and begin to create the conditions for
private sector-led growth. While querying the adjustment operations for having failed to achieve
poverty reduction through private sector-led growth-a          doubt that the recently completed
poverty assessment indicates may be misplaced-the          OED review also identified several key
lessons. First, Government ownership and successful implementation o f an adjustment program
may not suffice to achieve its objectives. Inaddition the operation needs to be developed in full
appreciation of Mozambique's political economy at the micro level, and complemented by
projects that could ameliorate some o f the weaknesses. This i s particularly true regarding the
ability of Mozambicans to participate effectively in the privatization program. Second,
sequencing financial sector reforms is critical to both financial and private sector development.
In particular, weak state-owned banks should be privatized before they are restructured or
recapitalized; state-owned banks should be privatized before large numbers o f other enterprises
are privatized, or else inappropriate resource allocation may occur; state-owned banks should be
privatized without permitting a sizeable residual government ownership, as this ownership could
result in continued connected lending, insolvency and budget obligations; and the absence of
world-class prudential regulations and supervision as well as a functioning legal system when
the private sector enter the financial sector may invite moral hazard problems. The PRSC series
has taken these lessons into account.

                                 V.     THE PROPOSEDPRSC2

A.     BACKGROUND

99.    PRSC 1 and theproposed PRSC 2 constitutea series of operations designedtoprovide
budget support over threeyears based on thepolicy agenda andpriorities of the PARPA. The
PRSCs concentrate on the issues considered to be binding constraints to growth and poverty
reduction. They are: (i)  improving the management o f public finances to enhance the efficiency
and efficacy of expenditures and improve govemance; (ii)      enabling private sector development,
and (iii)improving the delivery o f services. While recognizing the importance o f each o f the
sectoral areas in the PAF, the PRSC series has focused the policy dialogue initially on cross-
cutting issues, particularly govemance, public financial management, and the investment climate
before including prior actions in other PAF priority areas, such as education, health, water and
rural development. Within this general framework, there were four key considerations:

   0   A focus on the Government's PAF and PARPA implementation processes is highly
        appropriate.

    0   A focus on planning, budgeting and managingpublic service delivery, including through
        government restructuring and the introduction o f e-SISTAFE, will have an important
       medium- and long-term benefit for service delivery.

    0   As indicated in the ICA and the upcoming CEM, Mozambique's growth opportunities
        can be further enhanced through second-generation reforms that address constraints to
        businesses, including the high cost o f banking, labor law inflexibilities, and the high
        costs involved inbusiness registration. The recent C E M points to possible improvements
        for agricultural productivity and rural development through a better management o f the
        country's abundant natural resources, and the link between secondary and tertiary
        education and poverty reduction. Hence the areas o f focus correspond to the govern-
        ment's agenda o f sustainedprivate sector-led growth for poverty reduction.

    e   While the Bank continues to support sector development programs through investment
        projects, the policy dialogue in these sectors will be complemented and enhanced by the
        general budget support. The donor harmonization mechanism allows for the Bank to be
        involved effectively inpolicy dialogue also insectors where it has no specific investment
        project, since all priority sectors are being monitored closely through the PAF.

100.    Theproposed PRSC 2 will support the national policy priorities defirzed in the PAF,
which is based on the PARPA. The financing needs and levels are based on the medium-term
financing plan contained in the Government's Medium-Term Financial Framework (MTFF).
The Letter o f Development Policy (Annex 4) confirms Government's commitment to
implementing the reform program and PARPA. All o f the expected results are based on the
PARPA's objectives, and on the results framework for the CAS for FY04-07.




                                                   40

101.    The proposed PRSC 2 is concentrating on completing actions in three key building
blocks of the PAF that arefundamental to sustaining growth:

    a) Building public sector capacity and accountability.          This component focuses on
        maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving public financial management, and
        enhancing governance. The govemment has started to implement the new integrated
        electronic financial management system, e-SISTAFE; improve procurement practices in
        line with international practice; restructure key ministries to improve the delivery o f
        services; proceed with decentralization; and strengthen the fight against corruption.
   b) Improving the investment climate. Actions are intended to: (a) strengthen the financial
        sector by enhancing supervision by the central bank, proceed with divestiture o f
        government interests in the banking system, and transition the banking sector to
        international financial reporting standards, (b) improve the regulatory framework by
        reducing impedimentsto entry and exit; (c) improve the labor market environment; and
        (d) expandinfrastructureservices, thereby reducing costs o fproduction andmarketing.
    c) Expansion of Service Delivery. The govemment continues channeling at least 65 percent
        (excluding interest payments) o f its expenditures to the priority sectors o f the PARPA
        (agriculture, health, education, rural water supply, infrastructure, justice and
        related governance sectors), with the objective o f achieving basic outcome and output
        indicators established inthe PAF and PARPA.

102.    I t is proposed that the PRSC 2 be designed as an exceptional two tranche operation to
allow for the transition to afully harmonized approach. The first tranche of the PRSC 2 would
provide financing for the 2005 Mozambican budget year, and the second tranche for the 2006
budget cycle. The Bank signed the M o Uwith the G o M and the other Programmatic Aid Partners
in 2004, but the modality of PRSC 1 still required several exceptions that prevented the Bank
from full harmonization. The first tranche o f PRSC 2 is already more aligned with the MoU, as
the prior actions are exclusively taken from the PAF, which serves as the Program Matrix.
(PRSC1 had a separate Program Matrix that was different from the PAF.) The second tranche o f
the proposed PRSC 2 would already follow the M o U rule that budget support for year n+l be
firmly committed inthe year n. Given the exceptional transitional character o f PRSC 2, budget
support for 2006 i s based on a set o f triggers, rather than prior actions. Starting with PRSC 3
(tentatively scheduled for Board presentation in December 2006), the Bank's budget support
would be fully harmonized, and again inthe form o f single tranche operations with a set o fprior
actions.

103.    The PRSC 2 would deepen the harmonization process. The programmatic policy
dialogue - outside of investment operations - between the Bank and G o M is now taking place
through the sector working groups and the PAP structures. This new approach by the Bank of
seeking consensus among partners andwith the Government -rather than carrying out a separate
policy dialogue - i s inline with the Rome andParis Declarations on Donor Harmonization. As a
result o f the Bank's new OPBP 8.60, the PRSC 2 would disburse into the common account at
the Central Bank set up for direct budget support contributions from the other members of the
G17, rather than through a dedicated account, as was the case with PRSC 1, and the audit will be
donejointly. This is another move toward harmonizing procedures.



                                                 41

104.    Aligning the PRSC with the budget cycle of the Government of Mozambique and the
procedures of the other DBSpartners. The Rome and Paris Declarations strongly recommend
that budgetary support be predictable. Predictability based on past performance has been one of
the guiding principles of the M o U signed inApril 2004 and reconfirmed after the Joint Review
o f May 2005. Under the MoU, the normal procedures are as follows: donors make a firm
commitment about the amount and timing o f their budget support for year n+l four weeks after
the Joint Review inyear nis concluded. The Joint Review, which normally takes place inApril'3
assesses performance in year `n-1'. Therefore, the amount o f budget support in year `n+l' i s
determined by the performance o f the government in year `n-1'. Performance in year `n' only
affects the amount o f DBS in year `n+2'. As a safeguard against any slippages, the M o U
stipulates that budget support can be suspended, and consultations undertaken, if underlying
principles are violated, such as serious breaches regarding democracy, human rights, or loss o f
macroeconomic stability. A Mid-Year Review takes place in September o f each year, when the
performance inthe first semester i s reviewed, and the PAF indicators are updated and agreed for
the Government's performance inyear `n+1' (Annex 5).

105.    Thefirst tranche of PRSC 2 would be disbursed based on the achievements reached in
Calendar Year 2004 and early 2005. All the PAF indicators are jointly monitored by all
development partners through the respective sector working groups. A formal assessment was
made during the Joint Review in May 2005. The second tranche would be disbursed after the
completion o f a set o f triggers specified below. All o f the triggers are taken exclusively from the
PAF for 2005. They represent important reform actions inthe area o f improving public financial
management and the investment climate.

 B.       PRIORACTIONS COMPLETED

106.    The overall assessment of performance by the Government in 2004 wasjudged to be
satisfactory by the Joint Review concluded on May 14, 2005, even though some benchmarks
were not fully met, and not all the indicators could be achieved. Table 9 shows the status o f
the prior actions for PRSC 2. They correspond to the triggers defined inthe PAD o fthe PRSC 1.
Each prior action i s discussed in the subsequent paragraphs. The PRSC 1 PAD mentioned
maintaining macro-economic stability as a trigger, but this is considered to be a pre-condition for
the purpose o f PRSC 2. It has been hlly met, as inflation (9.1 percent) was contained below
target levels, and growth was strong at 7.2 percent.




l32005 was an exception. The delay was caused by the elections inDecember 2004.

 B 1. Component1 :BuildingPublicsector capacityand accountability

 107.      E-SISTAFE has been rolled out in the Ministry of Finance at the central level and in
 the provinces. Since November 1, 2004, e-SISTAFE has been deployed in the Ministry o f
 Finance. Currently all fund releases from the Treasury Single Account to bank accounts of
 spendingunits are processed through e-SISTAFE, providing the means to control the receipt o f
 accounting returns from spending units against their next fund release. Accounting returns from
 spending units are further supported by the submission o f bank reconciliation statements, which
 are also monitored. The data captured in e-SISTAFE, and the accounting returns from spending
 units enable the compilation o f financial statements bythe Ministry o fFinance. This has started


                                                         43

to profoundly transfom budget management and reporting. e-SISTAFE will be extended to all
the line ministries inthe coming two years, starting with the Ministry o f Education and Culture
inOctober 2005. Duringthisphasethepilotministrywillbeconnected to e-SISTAFE to directly
execute and account for its revenues and expenditures, against the budget controls o f the
Ministry o f Finance and through the Treasury Single Account. Switching from a manual
expenditure management and accounting system to a computerized one has been resisted for a
long time by civil servants who were experts in the old system, and were afraid of not being
capable o f adapting to the computerized one. Furthermore, it i s accompanied by the unification
o f thousands of public bank accounts into a single treasury account and other changes in the
rules o f expenditure management. e-SISTAFE will allow for expenditures to be properly
classified and tracked. Without it, it would also be very difficult to get all the donor-funded
projects on-budget. Government i s fully aware o f the risks. An extensive national training
program was designed, and a "change management" component was included in the design o f
the program inpreparation o f the introduction o f e-SISTAFE. Training and change management
will continue to be provided in the coming years to all the sector ministries at the central,
provincial, and district levels. The design o f the software, the hardware configuration, the
training program, and the implementation o f e-SISTAFE are being accompanied by a Quality
Assurance Group made up of international expert that reports every six months to the
Government and the donors supporting the new system. The Bank is an observer in the e-
SISTAFE Quality Assurance Group.

108.    The delay in procurement reform is due to the process required to ensure an efficient
system. The donors were to some extent overly optimistic as to the time required to ensure that
a proper procurement system is inplace. The benefits from a modem public procurement system
are clear, as it will enable the Government to achieve better results from the expenditure o f
public funds, discourage corrupt practices, and promote private entrepreneurial initiative in the
country. Moreover, having procurement in line with international standards will ensure its
acceptability by Development Partners, which will facilitate the harmonization o f procedures
with the country systems and lower transaction costs. The steps to be taken to proceed with the
implementation o f the procurement reform, and achieve its objectives, are the following: (a)
Legal Procurement Framework: (i)Have the lawhegulations finalized in accordance with
international standards and approved by the authorities; (ii) establish the institutions as provided
for in the regulations, including the supervisory and recourse functions, and provide the
necessary means for them to become functioning and carry out their responsibilities - i.e.
oversight, policy and audit; (b) Procurement procedures, to be modernized based on (i)         clear
guidelines and standard bidding documents to ensure transparent bidding, bid-evaluation and
award procedures, and trinsparent and accountable contract management. In addition, (ii)
procurement processing should become part and parcel o f the public expenditure chain
management; (c) Institutional Capacity should be achieved through: (i)       establishment in each
contracting entity of procurement management units, (ii)       staff in place trained to become
procurement proficient, capable to apply the regulations and procedures efficiently and
transparently; (iii)monitoring o f standards o f the Public Procurement system and keeping them
up to date (modemized), and (iv) make available initial and on the job training and technical
support; and(d) independent control systems and appeals mechanisms are inplace

B 2. Improvingthe InvestmentClimate

109. A new Financial Institutions law was approved by Parliament and promulgated in
2004, and the relevant regulations were issued. The new law creates a modem regulatory
framework and increases dramatically the supervision powers o f the Central Bank in parallel
with the transitioning o f the banking system to the International Financial Reporting System
(IFRS). It also sets new standards for non-banking financial institutions and for the micro-
finance sub-sector. Positive signs reflecting some stabilization are the large drop in the ratio o f
non-performing loans, and the fall in interest rates on lending (prime rate) from 28 percent at
end-2003 to 24.5 percent in October 2004 and 18 percent in May 2005. However, interest rate
spreads continue to be large. There continue to be structural problems inthe financial sector that
need to be addressed to improve access to modem financial instruments and expanding the
sector to the rural areas. A strategy is currently being developedto expand micro-finance.

110.    Important actions have been taken with respect to improving the regulatory
framework to reduce impediments to entry and exit and improve labor market flexibility. A
new industrial registry process was established simplifying entry and exit. In addition, the land
registry timing was reduced to a maximum o f 90 days under a new ministerial decree. With
respect to the labor markets, the government published a decree that improved firms' flexibility
inhiring expatriates. This was identified by the Investment Climate Survey carried out in2003
as an important constraint to doing business inMozambique. Inparallel the country is also now
issuing entry visas at the main border points, and additionally the visa requirement for citizens
from South Africa to Mozambique has been completely abolished for short visits since April
2005.

 111, Modernizing the Commercial Code is an essential precondition to allow for further
private sector growth, particularly of SMEs as they do not have a special status. The current
Code i s over a century old, dating as far back as 1888. A new Code has been elaborated inclose
consultations with the private sector, and the legal expertise has been financed by a Bank
technical assistance project. The draft Code was submitted to Parliament three years ago, and has
since been analyzed in detail by the technical commission. The revised version has the
agreement o f public officials, the private sector, the development partners and the relevant sub-
committee o f Parliament. Parliament is expected to approve the new Commercial Code during
the next session in October. Equally important for the private sector i s a new Commercial
Registry Code to simplify the procedures and cut red tape. This new Code is also ready, and
should be approved together with the Commercial Code in 2005. The Government has
contracted an international consulting firm inJune to computerize the commercial registry. This
will reduce the time required to register a company or a brand name by 30-50 days andwill be a
major step forward to facilitate the entry o f newbusinesses.


B 3. ExpansioninService delivery

 112.   As agreed in the PES/PAF, 65percent of the budget was to be targeted to the PARPA
priority sectors, of which 50 percent was for the education and health sectors. Budget
 execution for the priority sectors was slightly below the target at 63.3 percent. This shortfall is
 largely explained by a low "reported" execution rate o f externally financed investment projects.
 (Actual expenditures on externally financed projects are likely to be higher, as there are still

                                                  45

shortcomings in reporting project expenditures to the Ministry o f Finance.) About 30 percent o f
total government expenditures are invested in the health and education sectors. The
concentration of resources in the two priority sectors have meant that important outcomes have
been reached, despite the extremely low levels o f US dollars per capita expenditures that they
represent. However, continued focus on efficiency o f expenditures i s required and must be
closely monitored.

C.      TRIGGERSFOR SECONDTRANCHE RELEASE

113.     The second tranche of the proposed PRSC 2 would focus on two pillars: (i) cross-
cutting actions to strengthen public sector performance by enhancing efficiency and
effectiveness in the use of public resources, and (ii) enhancing the investment climate. The
triggers were chosen as important indicators that the second generation reforms to improve the
quality o f public financial     management and enhance the institutional environment for
accelerated growth and poverty reduction are on track. They are evidence o f the new
Government's strong commitment to the reform agenda. The specific set o f triggers for the
release o f the second tranche, scheduled to be inJanuary for the budget year 2006 are:

PublicSector Capacity and Accountability

        Adoption o f a modem procurement system in accordance with the best international
        practices, and a start on its implementationbased on the new procurement regulation and
        in connection with the e-SISTAFE. For 2005, the Government is committed to start
         operationalizing the new procurement system by approving a revised implementation
         action plan; carrying out procurement audits in a sample o f ministries; preparing a
         training program for civil servants and suppliers; and preparing the TOR'Sto elaborate
         standard biddingdocuments. (Trigger # 34 o fthe 2005-07 PAF inAnnex 1B)

         Rollout o f e-SISTAFE to the Ministry o f Education and Culture. This means that the
         Government's computerized financial and accounting system (e-SISTAFE) will be fully
         operational in the Ministry o f Education and Culture; financial and budget execution,
         accounting and reporting will be done on-line, and all financial transactions will be
         carried out through the Treasury Single Account. (Trigger # 31 o f the 2005-07 PAF in
         Annex 1B)

         Increase the coverage of the budget: conclude the study on off-budget expenditures in
         the health sector, and initiate the implementation o f the recommendations. For the 2006
         state budget cycle, the Government is committed to include in the budget for the health
         sector the revenues and expenditures resulting from the "special clinic" o f the central
         hospital, and a larger portion o f the revenues and expenditures from the extemal common
         finds compared to the 2005 budget. (Trigger # 28 o fthe 2005-07 PAF inAnnex 1B)

         Combat corruption: The Government is committed to increase, in real terms, the
         resources allocated in its 2006 budgetary proposal for the anti-corruption unit. The
         planned increase of budget resources would allow the anti-comption unit to hire more

     Preparingthe Next Series of PRSC's

114.    The next PRSC is expected to be presented to the Board around December 2006. The
next series o f PRSCs would provide budget support in 2007-09. The focus would continue to
be on the three pillars as in the current series: (a) The improvement o f public financial
management, such as the rollout o f e-SISTAFE to all the sector ministries at the central,
provincial, and eventually the district levels. The Government i s also expected to enhance
governance by adopting and implementing an anti-corruption strategy. (b) The improvement o f
the investment climate by reforming its labor legislation, reducing red tape further, and
improving the regulatory framework where necessary. (c) It is expected that the third pillar -
service delivery - would become a more important focus o f future PRSCs. Inparticular, prior
actions would be chosen to support rural development, which i s a top priority for the new
government and essential inthe fight against poverty, as 70 percent o f the population still live in
rural areas.

D.      MONITORINGAND EVALUATION
115.    The establishment of a sound M&E system remains a challenge. The First PRSC
appraisal document discussed the many problems in the existing system ,and there have since
been improvements. The Joint Review in May 2005 found that there was some improvement in
consolidation o f the various reports, but adequate systems still need to be operational inmany o f
the Ministries. A more extensive discussion of the M&E system to monitor the implementation
o f the PARPA and the PAF i s contained in Annex 6. The recommendations contained therein
have been discussed with the relevantjoint Working Group for Poverty Analysis and Monitoring
Systems and the Government.

116.    The donor working group is working to improve harmonization and alignment in
planning the monitoring systems/support. Technical assistance is being provided to
Government for the monitoring systems (including PARPA preparation) and to engage with civil
society (Annex 6).

E.      CREDIT AMOUNT AND TRANCHING
The Credit is a two tranche operation o f a $120 millionequivalent.




                                                47

                         VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.      SUPERVISION

117.    The Bank's supervision of the PRSCs is aligned with the supervision of the joint
Direct Budget Support program of the G17. In order to reduce the transaction costs for the
Government, the Bank carries out all supervisionjointly with the other donors. It participates in
the Troika Plus (consisting o f three donors/a chair/co-chair and outgoing chair, forming the
troika chairmanship -- EC and WB are permanent members, thus forming the Troika Plus), the
overall coordination mechanism set up by the G-17, and all the relevant coordination meetings
(see Attachment J on Structure o f PAP). All Bank sector missions working for the PRSC team
liaise closely with and through the respective joint sector working groups to assure maximum
coordination with all other sector partners. Additionally, the Bank missions will utilize the
Results Framework -Annex 7 - to monitor progress.

118.    The M o U defines two key review eventsper year. A Joint Review takes place each year
in April/May (Year n). It assesses the Performance of the government inthe previous budget
year, which corresponds to the calendar year (Year n-1). The review focuses on evaluating
progress with regardto the 50 indicators defined inthe Performance Assessment Framework and
makes an overall assessment o f progress. The second event i s the Mid-Year Review in
September. This review i s mainly forward-looking and formalizes the agreement on the
performance indicators for the following year (Year n+l). Both the Joint and the Mid-Year
Review are a multi-sector exercise, and Bank staffparticipate inall relevant sectors. The reviews
are prepared at the technical level by the variousjoint sector working groups.

119.    I n addition, the supervision of the PRSC is done on a continuous basis in
harmonization with the other direct budget support donors. The Task Team Leader for the
operation i s based inthe field, andparticipates inall relevant coordination andjoint government-
donor steering committee meetings. Progress in each sector i s monitored byjoint govemment-
donor sector working groups. Bank staff actively participates inthese meetings through its staff
inthe fieldoffices andWashington (through missionsor byvideoconference).

120.    Furthermore, the Bank participates in joint IMF-Bank missions to monitor progress
in the macroeconomicframework. The joint staff assessment mission to evaluate progress of
the PARPA was carried out at the same time as the Joint Review.

B.      DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

121.     Theproposed credit will follow disbursing and auditing procedures of per the MoU.
Details o f the disbursement and auditing arrangements as agreed and signed by the Program Aid
Partners (PAPS) are provided in Attachments G-H. The Bank's Credit will be disbursed and
audited accordingly.

C.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

 122.    The Program is a development policy lending operation that supports Government's
poverty reduction strategy, and is likely to have impact on the environment. The PRSC will


                                                 48

support the PARPA based on a review o f key multi-sector output/outcome indicators measuring
physical outputs e.g. kilometers o f road rehabilitated, irrigation systems rehabilitated etc and
process indicators. There can be bothpositive and negative impacts on the environment o f some
o f the budget support operations. However, many o f the sectors supported under the operation
have specific environmental safeguards in place such as in health, education and agriculture,
through other investment operations. Additionally there are other activities supported through
the budget e.g. revision o f the commercial code, where it i s difficult to assess the impact on the
environment.

123.    Analysis has recently been carried out of the sustainability of natural resources (land,
water, fisheries, forestry and mining). Natural resources are critical for growth and poverty
reduction in Mozambique. The basic conclusion o f the recent analyses, also reflected in the
upcoming CEM, is that the legal and administrative frameworks for exploiting these resources
are designed to protect the poor, but inpractice the actual outcome is the opposite. There i s also
a gap between regulations enacted and implementation - primarily due to lack o f capacity,
interferences and rent seeking behavior.        This includes clarifying regulations that create
uncertainty, introducing transparency, and improving monitoring capacity. An institutional
capacity assessment will be carried out as part o f the CSNCEA (see below) - based on which
technical assistance maybe provided to develop capacity.

124.    Additionally, there is a significant knowledge gap concerning the links between
poverty and communities' access and use of natural resources. Inparticular, very few studies
have attempted to understand communities' perspectives. Key questions include how dependent
communities are on natural resources, what access do they have to land, water, forests, fisheries,
mines, etc.; how do government policies impact on their livelihoods and the environment; and
the extent to which they are capable o f influencing government policies affecting natural
resources and their immediate environment. Mozambique has been chosen as a pilot country to
carry out a joint Country Social and Environmental Assessment (CSNCEA) analysis with the
use o f BNPP Trust Funds (Dutch). The work is expected to be carried out inthe next eighteen
months. The analysis will be based on the premisethat the environmental and social aspects are
linked in three major ways; (i) reduction programs should not damage the resource base
                                 poverty
and the environment on which the poor depend for their livelihoods; (ii)       improving the social
and environmental conditions can help reduce poverty and promote pro-poor growth and (iii)
mitigating measures, as needed should be identified as part o f the policy dialogue.

125.    A Report Card survey will be carried out. The survey will gather quantitative and
qualitative information from communities on their utilization o f natural resources, their
perceptions o f public management o f these natural resources, and the public support they would
like from government to manage and exploit these resources effectively and sustainably. Linked
to the Report Card will be efforts to empower communities to utilize the information gathered in
the Report Cards to pressure effectively for changes in public policy in this area. The second
part will look at the government's capacity to respond effectively by providing services and
regulation in this area. The work will involve a detailed review o f existing environmental
legislation, policies and legal framework. This will involve both literature review and country
interviews. Analyses of comparable fi-ameworks in similadneighboring countries will be carried
out, together with an assessment o f institutional capacity.

D.      R I S K S AND RISKMITIGATION


126.    One set of risks concerns the potential for macroeconomic instability as a result of
terms of trade shocks, regional instability, or deteriorating financial sector performance.
Some of these risks, such as terms o f trade shocks or regional instability, are exogenous.
Considering the highlevel o freserves, the fourfold increase o f exports over the past five years, a
flexible exchange rate regime and low external debt vulnerability, the likely impact should be
manageable, even though no stabilization mechanism exists at this point. However, if oil prices
remain at their current high level in international markets, then the fiscal position would need
some adjustment. Regardingfinancial sector performance, the new Financial Institutions Laws -
approved in 2004 as a prior action for PRSC 2 - gave the Central Bank much more power to
supervise the banking system, and prepared the ground to introduce Intemational Financial
Reporting Standards in the banking system. The new legal framework and strengthened
supervision has reduced the risk o f banks accumulating a highshare o f non-performing loans, as
has happened inthe past. Furthermore, a Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project has been
appraised and will soon be presented to the Board. This project should help reduce the
vulnerability o f Mozambique's financial sector.

127.    A second set of risks concerns the unpredictability of donor disbursementsfor budget
support. This i s being mitigatedby intensive efforts indonor harmonization and the signingo f a
Memorandum o f Understanding by all parties. The M o U was signed by 15 donor agencies in
2004; inthe meantime, two more partner countries - Canada and Spain -have signed the MoU.
The Government has also assumed strong ownership o f the Joint Review process in AprilMay
2005, which has consolidated mutual trust inthe process.

128.    A third set of risks concerns the political will to carry out the reforms. The new
President and the Government have reaffirmed their hll commitment to the reform agenda as
articulated in the five-year program tabled in Parliament in March 2005, thus the political and
social risks are considered to be small. The new Government has shown leadership and started to
address complex institutional reforms, such as legal, judiciary and other govemance reforms. It
i s also aggressively undertaking legal and organizational reforms to improve the investment
climate.

129. Afourth set of risks concerns weak administrative capacity to implement reforms such
as public financial management, procurement, and improved service delivery. To mitigate
this risk, the Government and donors agreed during the Joint Review to develop an integrated
strategy for capacity development in public finance management, and to strengthen the
coordination and management o f reforms.

                   BetweenGovernmentofthe Republicof Mozambique
                                           andthe
                                  ProgrammeAid Partners
                            for the provisionof DirectBudgetand
                                BalanceofPaymentsSupport


                                         Preamble


1.      This Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) sets out principles and terms for the
partnership between the Republic o f Mozambique, represented by the Government o f
Mozambique (GoM), and the signatory Programme Aid Partners (PAPs) listed in Attachment
B. Its annexes give operational expression to these principles and terms. Programme Aid
refers in this M o U only to Direct Budget Support and Balance of Payments Support. This
M o Ureplaces the `Joint Donor Programme for Macro Financial Support to the Government o f
Mozambique' that came into force in2000.

2.      This M o U will be attached as an annex to each o f the PAPS'bilateral agreements on
Programme Aid with the GoM. Bilateral agreements, which will be distributed to all
signatories o f this MoU, have precedence over this MoU. However, to the extent possible,
given existing contractual and statutory provisions, PAPs will not include in their bilateral
agreements any additional conditions or administrative and reporting requirements to those
agreed upon in this MoU. Where PAPs have existing bilateral agreements, these will be
amended in line with the MoU. In the exceptional cases where PAPs do have different or
additional conditions or administrative or reporting requirements intheir bilateral agreements,
these are shown inAttachment K.

Introductoryprovisions

3.      GoM and PAPs hereby declare their commitment to create an effective development
partnership based on mutual commitment, trust, respect and confidence. They do so in the
interests o f the people o f Mozambique, aiming to reduce poverty, and sustain development
gains. GoM and PAPs contributing Direct Budget Support are also aiming to promote peace
and deepen democracy. G o M and PAPs are determined to work inthe spirit o f the principles
o f NEPAD, Monterrey and Rome in a process o f open dialogue and mutual accountability. In
this context, GoM and PAPs declare their commitment to the modality o f Programme Aid,
given the potential to improve aid effectiveness and country ownership o f the development
process through increasing donor harmonization, increasing recipients' institutional capacities
in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating their programmes, strengthening
domestic accountability, reducing transaction costs, allowing allocative efficiency in public
spendingand increasingpredictability of aid flows.



                                              64

4.     G o M and PAPswish to develop a partnership based on frank and open dialogue on the
content and progress of Mozambique's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PARPA), Medium Term
Fiscal Framework (MTFF), Economic and Social Plan (PES), and the State Budget (OE).
G o M and PAPs will focus their dialogue particularly on the GoM's Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF), which i s a multi-annual matrix o f priority targets and indicators based on
the PARPA, updated on an annual basis through the PES process and agreed through cross-
governmental dialogue. Each year the signatories will attach the agreed PAF to this M o U as a
substitute and updated annex. GoM and PAPs believe that the PARPA, MTFF, PES and OE
are instruments o f good govemance, on which G o M is accountable to the Mozambican
citizens through the National Assembly.         The PARPA should be developed through
interactive and consultative processes with Mozambican political and economic stakeholders,
includingthe private sector and civil society. The Balanqo do PES for year n-1and the PES
for year nwill be submitted to these stakeholders for discussion. GoM and PAPs declare their
intention to conduct dialogue and monitoring and ensure delivery and use o f Programme Aid
inaway that workswith andstrengthens theseprocesses.

5.     Inthis spirit of development, partnership and commitment to poverty reduction, the
G o M andPAPs thus decide and agree as follows:

Section 1: Overall objective

6.      The overall objective o f Programme Aid is to contribute to poverty reduction inall its
dimensions by supporting the evolution, implementation andmonitoring o f the PARPA.

Section 2: Intermediate objectives

7.      The intermediate objective o f Programme Aid is to support poverty reduction in
Mozambique by:

            i)    Building a partnership based on frank and open dialogue on the content
                  and progress o f Mozambique's poverty reduction strategy as set out inthe
                  PARPA and made operational through the MTFF, the PES (including
                  priority indicators and targets as defined inthe PAF) and OE.

            ii)   Providing financing to the public sector for poverty reduction, clearly and
                  transparently linked to performance, in a way which improves aid
                  effectiveness and country ownership o f the development process, reduces
                  transaction costs, allows allocative efficiency in public spending,
                  predictability o f aid flows, increases the effectiveness o f the state and
                  public administration, improves monitoring and evaluation and strengthens
                  domestic accountability.

Section 3: Underlyingprinciples

8.      GoM and those PAPs supplying Direct Budget Support consider the GoM's.
commitments to peace and to promoting free, credible and democratic political processes,
independence o f the judiciary, rule o f law, human rights, good govemance and probity in
public life, including the fight against corruption, (with reference to commitments in the

                                              65

constitution, NEPAD and international agreements) to be underlying principles of govemance
for the provision o fbudget support.

9.      In addition, the following are considered by GoM and all PAPs to be underlying
principles for the provision o f ProgrammeAid:

    0   GoM's commitment to fight poverty (with reference to the Millennium Development
        Goals and PARPA), including through a pattern of public expenditure consistent with
        PARPApriorities;
    0   GoM's commitments to pursuing sound macro-economic policies (with reference to
        IMFprogramme `on-track' status or anequivalentjudgment).

10.     Concems regarding violation o f these underlying principles will be dealt with through
consultation and dialogue between PAPs and G o M at the appropriate level for decision-
making, at any moment one of the signatories thinks this to be appropriate. The violation of
an underlyingprinciple is understood as being above and beyond concerns raised about under-
performance against indicators andtargets expressed inthe PESPAF.

Section 4: Commitments

11.     G o M is, inaddition to the commitments included as underlying principles inSection
3, committed to:

     0  Implementingits PAFcommitments;
     0  Improving Public FinanceManagement, commitment to which will be reflected inand
        assessed annually through the PAF.

12.     GoM and PAPs are committedto improving the quality o fdevelopment cooperation in
Mozambique through:

     0  Strengthening dialogue on the PARPA, PES (particularly the PES priorities identified
        inthe PAF), MTFFand OE;
     0  Guaranteeing the timely availability o f all documentation necessary for this dialogue
        (as outlined in Section 5);
     0  Establishing an agreed disbursement schedule, in order to assist G o M in
        implementingits PESPAF commitments.

 13.    Inaddition, PAPs are committedto providing ProgrammeAid inaway that:


     0  I s aligned with Mozambican instruments, processes and systems o f financial
        management, including:
             o Providing assistance for and undertaking dialogue around the PARPA, PES,
                priority aspects o f the PES set out inthe PAF, the CFMP and the OE.
             o Usinggovernmentprocesses anddocumentation.
             o Following the government cycle for planning, implementation, monitoring,
                reporting and funding.
     0  Increases the predictability o f the flow of donor funds, including bymakingmulti-year
        agreements on Programme Aid, providing GoM with information on Programme Aid

                                                 66

       commitments in time for the information to be used in policy and budget planning,
       linking response mechanisms to agreed, realistic targets and indicators, disbursing
       according to the agreed disbursement schedule and not interrupting in-year
       disbursement, unless underlyingprinciples are violated;
       Ensures transparency of conditions and funding;
       Improves    harmonization by eliminating bilateral         conditions  and bilateral
       administrative and reporting requirements (as far as possible given existing legal and
       statutory requirements, which should also be reduced over time);
       Lessens the administrative burden o f their assistance on G o M by increasingly
      mounting joint missions, undertaking joint analysis, using joint procedures and by
      reducing the number o f visits and overlapping activities;
       Enhances the capacity o f the G o M to meet its commitments by providing appropriate
       technical assistance and capacity building.

Section 5: Reporting

14.    This section refers to reporting on G o M poverty reduction plans and performance and
PAP commitments and performance. Timing o f provision and content o f documents is shown
inAttachment D.

15.    G o M commits to provide PAPswith the following:

   a   Planning documents including the PARPA, PES (and PAF), MTFF and OE, as well as
       other information, reports and documentation relevant to these programmes and
       budgets, especially on macroeconomic and poverty reduction developments;
   a   Monitoring documents including Balanqo do PES (half year and year), Budget
       Execution Reports, the General State Account and annual audit reports (as indicated
       in Section 10, including the Administrative Tribunal Report on the General State
       Account and the quarterly reports on the flow o f counterpart funds );
   a   An annual report on fiduciary risk assessment within public financial management
       done by or with GoM;
   a   Other reports agreed upon by G o M andPAPs.

16.    PAPscommit to provide GoMwith the following:

   e   Information on multi-year commitments, indicative commitments, final commitments
       and disbursement schedules at a time that GoM can use it in policy and budget
       preparations. PAPs will provide G o M quarterly with updated information on the
       disbursement o ftheir Programme Aid;
   e   A report on performance against the PAP commitments, including on harmonization
       andalignment, on harmonization andalignment, outlined inSection 4, paragraph 13.

Section 6: Monitoring and dialogueprocess

17.    This section refers to monitoring o f and dialogue around GoM plans and performance
and PAP performance. Monitoring and dialogue processes will follow an annual review
process aligned with GoM's planning, budgeting and monitoring cycle. Monitoring and


                                              67

dialogue processes will use reports outlined in Section 5, focusing on the documents
submitted by GoM to Parliament. All formal performance assessments will be undertaken
jointly by G o M andPAPs and not bilaterally (except when PAP legislation requires a national
or institutional audit authority to undertake their own assessment o f PAP operations, inwhich
case the PAP will inform other PAPs and GoM, undertake a joint process where possible,
share results andpursue any concerns through the mechanisms o f this MoU).

18.     There will be two joint GoM-PAP reviews on Programme Aid: the annual review
(following the production o f the Balanqo de PES) and a mid-year review (prior to submission
o f the PES and OE to Parliament). The annual review i s focused on coming to ajoint view on
performance, which serves as the basis for commitments. The mid-year review focuses on
dialogue on forward planning and budgetingand agreement on the PAF. The joint view on
performance may include divergent opinions, where these are acceptable to all signatories. In
the exceptional case where ajoint view cannot be reached, following increasingly higher-level
dialogue, views will be reported separately.

 19.    Inthe annualreview:

     e  GoM and PAPswill assess performance against the PES, PAF and OE inyear n-1and
        inyear nup to the point ofthe review, basedonthe informationinthe Balanqo do PES
        and Budget Execution Report and other available information (including information
        inthe PES, PAFandOEinyear nas context for performanceassessment).

     e  G o M and PAPswill come to ajoint view on performance inyear n-1by the end o f the
        review. The most important factor indefiningperformance will be results as measured
        against indicators and targets committed to in the PAF. This will be seen inthe wider
        context of a holistic analysis o f performance against the PES and OE. It will focus on
        trends and the direction o f change. It will take into account the extent to which
        performance difficulties are being addressed, as shown in the PES, PAF and OE
        commitments for year n GoM and PAPs will assess PAP performance against
        commitments outlined in Section 4, Paragraph 13, based on the report mentioned
        above inSection 5, paragraph 16.

 20:    Inthemid-yearreview:

     e  G o M and PAPs will discuss performance in year n until the moment o f the review,
        based on the last budget execution report, the half year PES-report and other available
        information;
     e  G o M and PAPs will discuss G o M plans for year n+l on the basis o f the PARPA
         (when relevant), MTFFand headline information on the PES and OE;
     e   G o M andPAPs will agree the PAF outlined for year n+l, based on a G o M proposal o f
        priorities identified, through cross-governmental dialogue, duringthe PES process;
     e   G o M andPAPs will discuss PAP commitments for improvingaid effectiveness;

        response mechanisms (see Section 7);


                                                 68

        Details are given in Attachment E. G o M and all PAPs will come to a joint view on
        this assessmentbythe end o fthe review.

21.     There will be a follow up meeting twice a year (in June and December) to discuss
progress on issues raised duringthe reviews.

22.     Budget Working Group (BWG) meetings will take place four times a year, always in
combination with a review (April and August) or a follow-up meeting to a review (June and
December). At these BWG meetings GoM and PAPs will discuss budget execution up to the
end o f the previous quarter, based on budget execution reports. PAPs and G o M will agree on
the detailed disbursement schedule at the December meeting.

23.     The reviews will be linked to other dialogue processes, including the Poverty
Observatory. They will be complemented by and build on on-going dialogue throughout the
year. Ad hoc meetings will be arranged as required and agreed by the signatories to this MoU.
G o M will manage the process, including organizing and chairing all meetings and being
responsible for drawing up minutes. Attachment E shows the timing, participants and
activities o f the above reviews and Annex 5 shows the calendar o f the dialogue and
monitoring processes.

Section 7: Response mechanism

24.     This section describes the response mechanism, which is the link between GoM
performance and PAP commitments and disbursements o f Programme Aid for the coming
year (the World Bank has its own response mechanism as described in Attachment K).PAPs
may choose between making a single response based on the joint view o f performance or a
split response, with one part (fixed portion) being based on the joint view o f performance and
the other part (variable portion) beinglinkedto specific, transparent commitments drawn from
the PAF and agreed with G o M (see Attachment F). PAPs will define their financial
contributions intheir bilateral agreements with the GoM.

25.      The process o f commitment on funding will work as follows (see Attachment K for
exceptions) :

PAPswith a single response:
    0    Will use the annual review joint view o f Performance in year n-1to make bilateral
         decisions on the implications for their provision o f Programme Aid inyear n+l;
    0    PAPs will make commitments within four weeks after the end o f the annual review
         and confirmed commitments by 31 August. The commitment can only change
         between commitment and confirmed commitment if an underlying principle is
         violated.
PAPs with a split response:
    0    Will commit the fixed portion as above;
    0    Will make indicative commitments for year n+l for the variable portion within four
         weeks after the end o f the annual review and confirmed commitments not later than
         31 August, subject to timely reporting. These commitments may change between
         indicative and confirmed commitments on the basis o f further information about G o M


                                                 69

       performance on specific indicators in year n-1 and/or performance on specific
        indicators inyear nuntilthe moment o f the mid-term review.

26.     Once commitments are confirmed they cannot be changed and committed funds will
be disbursed, except when PAPs believe that there has been a violation o f an underlying
principle (see Section 3), or as a consequence o f a PAP parliamentary decision or when one of
the specific conditions for individual PAPs applies, as described inAnnex 10.

Section 8: Dispute settlement

27.     Ifany dispute arises betweenthe signatories (GoM andPAPs) as to the interpretation,
application or performance o f this MoU, signatories will engage in increasingly higher-level
dialogue inorder to reach an agreed and amicable solution.

Section 9: Disbursement process

28.     A disbursement schedule will be agreeduponbetween GoM andPAPsbefore the start
of the fiscal year at the December Budget Working Group meeting. It will take into account
the needs o f the budget, as identified in central Treasury planning. It may only be revised at
one o f the Budget Working Group meetings, if GoM and PAPs agree to do so. Details o f
disbursementprocedures are showninAttachment G.

Section 10: Auditing

29.     There will be annual audits 1) o f the financial records o f Programme Aid; 2) o fbudget
execution and 3) o f expenditure performance in relation to results (value for money). The
details are shown inAttachment H.

30.     Where independent auditors are used, GoM will be responsible for contracting the
auditors, who will be selected incollaboration with PAPs. The audit reports will be presented
on time (as set out inAttachment H), discussed and followed up within the framework o f the
reviews.

Section 11: Procurement

31.     Government procurement will be done on the basis o f Mozambican legislation on
procurement.GoM will as soon as possible reform and bring up to internationally acceptable
standards, its legislation and system o f govemment procurement. GoM and PAPs will agree
on a mechanism to follow up on the process and practice o f improving the procurement
system. Any concerns regarding procurement will be dealt with through the mechanisms o f
this MoU.

Section 12: Corruption

32.     Inthe context of GoM's commitments to combating and reducing corruption, as set
out in Section 3, GoM and PAPs will require that all staff and consultants dealing with the
provision and the use of Programme Aid will not offer to third parties or seek, accept or be
promised from or by third parties, for themselves or for any other party, any gift,

                                                 70

remuneration, compensation or profit o f any kind whatsoever that could be interpreted as an
illegal, fraudulent or corrupt practice. Any concerns regarding corruption with respect to
Programme Aid will be dealt with through the mechanisms o f this MoU. In the case o f
serious deviation or misuse o f state budget funds or acts o f large-scale corruption by members
or structures of GoM, GoM commits to make all due efforts to recover funds thus misusedor
misappropriated and take appropriate measures. PAPs reserve the right to unilaterally or
jointly withhold disbursements or claim repayment in full or in part o f funds in the case o f
misuse or fraud.

Section 13: Evaluation

33.     PAPs will decreasingly undertake bilateral evaluations o f the effectiveness o f
Programme Aid as an aid modality. PAPs will undertake a single harmonized evaluation by
2006.

Section 14: Responsibilities and structure

34.     GoM will determine (a) focal point(s) for Programme Aid and will define how it will
engage with PAPs for the activities provided inthis M o U(see Attachment J).

35.     PAP signatories will have a structure for the implementation and follow-up o f the
provisions of this MoU. The responsibilities and composition o f this structure will be agreed
upon by PAPs, inconsultation with GoM (see Attachment J). The PAPs will nominate one o f
themselves to act as chair o f the group.

 Section 15: Admission and termination

 36.     GoM will decide on each request for admission to the M o U and inform the PAP chair
 inwriting of its decision. The inclusion of a new PAP to the MoU shall be effected by an
 addendum in writing to the list o f signatories. PAPs that sign this M o U are entitled upon
 signature to become full participants inthe PAP structure.

 37.     PAPsnot having a valid agreement with the GoM, will not be considered to beparty to
 this MoU. Individual PAPs may withdraw from thejoint mechanisms and from this M o Uby a
 notice o f withdrawal. GoM may also rescind its bilateral agreement with any one o f the PAPs,
 upon which the PAP shall cease to be a signatory o f the MoU. GoM, or the PAPs acting in
 consensus, may terminate this M o U by a notice o f termination to the other party. The
 signatories will endeavor to provide as much notice o f termination as possible, not being less
 than three months written notice. In timing its notification o f withdrawal, a PAP will take
 account of the GoM budget cycle and the effects o f its withdrawal on the year incourse. Inthe
 case o f an individual PAP withdrawal, disbursements previously made will not be reimbursed
 by GoM, unless withdrawal accompanies events as provided for under Section 12 above. In
 the case of rescission or termination by GoM, funds still held in account (to be determined at
 the date o f termination by extemal audit) shall be reimbursedby GoM.

 38.     Agencies that have not signed the M o U or withdraw from it may request to become
 observers.



                                                71

Section 16: Effective data, duration and amendments

39.     The MoU enters into effect for each PAP on the date o f signature by G o M and the
relevant PAP, given that the PAP has a valid bilateral agreement. See paragraph 2 above for
the relationship between this M o U and bilateral agreements. The Joint Donor Programme for
Macro Financial Support to the Government o f Mozambique expires for each PAP on the date
o f entry o f this new MoU.

40.     Amendments to the M o Uwill be valid only if agreed inwriting between the G o M and
all signatory PAPs on the basis o f unanimity. Amendments to its Annexes have to be agreed
upon by G o M and a majority o f PAPS.The MoU will terminate five years after it enters into
effect, unless specifically renewed by agreement of the signatories.

     ATTACHMENT C: PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK (PAF)


While drafting the PES for the coming year (year n+l), G o M will each year identify from
among its goals and targets a concise list o f the highest priority indicators and targets in the
areas o f governance, system reform, and the priority poverty reduction sectors. This will be
done through a process o f cross-governmental dialogue. This short list, the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF), will orient the dialogue on priorities andperformance between
G o M and PAPs. The PAFwill also include, as far as possible, indicative targets and indicators
in these areas for the succeeding two years (year n+2 and n+3), based on medium term
commitments made inthe PARPA andMTFF.

At the annualreview meeting, the agenda and focus o f discussion on GoMperformance inthe
previous year (year n-1)will be oriented around performance against indicators and targets o f
the PAF (see Section 6). In the context o f this joint assessment o f performance in year n-1,
PAPs and G o M will discuss potential priorities for the PAF for year n+l.The PAF proposal
will thereafter be defined during the annual process o f cross-governmental dialogue on the
PES. The PAF for year n+l will then be agreed in essence between G o M and PAPs at the
mid-year review meeting in August each year (see Section 6 and Attachment E). The PAF
will be submitted to Parliament as part o f the PES andbe formally agreed between GoM and
PAPs and annexed inits final version to this M o U at the year-end meeting inDecember. G o M
will ensure particularly that its annual Balanqo do PES report addresses the results achieved in
the past year on all the items in the PAF. Performance against the PAF will be assessedinthe
context o f performance against the wider PES, as described inthe Balanqo do PES.

The annual review in2004 will be a transition year to take account for the fact that the 2003
PAF is not fully integratedwith the PES. Since the 2003 PES does not klly reflect the targets
and indicators for governance, system reform and priority poverty reduction sectors,
information in the Balanqo do PES about performance against the 2003 PES cannot provide
adequate context for assessing performance against the PAF. In the 2004 annual review,
information from the Balanqo do PES will therefore be supplemented in PAF priority areas
with information from recent GoM-donor sector, governance and system reform reviews. A
decision will be made at the end o f the 2004 annual review as to whether this transition
approach will also be necessary for the annual review in2005.

  European Commission (EC), Sweden and Switzerland will use a split response mechanism.
  These PAPSwill have a fixed and variable portions.

  Variable portions will be linked to the following targets and indicators selected from the PAF
  andagreed with GoM:

  EC: The decision to disburse will be based only on performance in year n-1. In case not
  enough information i s available at the annual review to make a commitment, an initial
  commitment will be made, to be confirmed after the mid-year review on the basis o f further
  information about G o M performance on specific indicators inyear n-1. Variable portion will
  bebased on:


      0  Outcome indicators for the social sectors: 50 percent, out o f which Education
         indicators (20 percent) andHealth indicators (30 percent);
      0  Budget execution indicators: (50 percent), out o f which ratio global budget
         executionhudget plan at central and provinces levels (20 percent), and same ratio in
         health, education and other PARPA priority sectors (30 percent) at central and
         province levels.

Sweden: The variable portion will be linked to financial sector and governance
targetshndicators selected from the PAF for year n+l agreed at the time o f the August mid-year
review in year n. These targets will be linked to 30 percent o f Sweden's total Direct Budget
Support (see also Sweden's procedures inAttachment K).

Switzerland: In making its assessment for preliminary confirmation o f commitments at the
mid-year review, Switzerland will also look at performance inyear n-1and inyear n, up to the
time o fthe mid-year review (see Attachment K for final confirmation o f commitments).

For the fixed portion (50 percent o f total Direct Budget Support), the assessment will be based
on the general performance against commitments in the PESPAF, including in particular
macroeconomic performance. This assessment will also take into account the discussions on
headline information of PES and OE for year n+l

Thevariable portionwill be basedonthe following PAF targetshndicators:
      0   Public Financial Management (linked to 20 percent o f total Direct Budget Support);
      0   Revenue mobilization (linked to 15 percent o f total Direct Budget Support);
      0   Private sector development including the financial sector (linked to 15 percent o ftotal
          Direct Budget Support).

1. Disbursementof DirectBudgetSupport

Installments will be requested in writing by the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF)
directly or via the Ministryo f Foreign Affairs from the PAP inquestion, copied to the Bank o f
Mozambique for information. Installments shall be deposited inthe Forex account designated
by the GoM for that purpose and heldbyBanco de Mozambique inFrankfurt. Within 48 hours
(2 working days) o f receipt o f the SWIFT, the Bank o f Mozambique will credit the Metical
equivalent counterpart funds to a specific MPF Transitory Account, specific to the Programme
Aid.

The Metical equivalent will be calculated on the basis o f the Central Bank (buying) exchange
rate on the 'data valor' o f the receipt o f the funds. The Metical equivalent will be transferred
from the specific Transitory Account to the Central Treasury Account in accordance with the
treasury plan and will be used as state budget revenue and recorded in the state account as
such. All interest earned, if any, will be added to the State Budget. PAP fknds covered by this
M o Uwill not be subject to payment o f any commission to the Bank o f Mozambique, with any
transaction costs incurred being deducted from the account itself. The Bank o f Mozambique
will immediately (within 3 working days) acknowledge receipt o f the foreign exchange funds,
inwriting, to therespective PAP andthe Ministry ofPlanningandFinance.

2. Disbursementof Balanceof PaymentSupport

Disbursement o f the credit will follow IDA'S simplified disbursement procedures for
adjustment operations. Accordingly, the credit proceeds will be disbursed incompliance with
the stipulated single tranche release conditions. Disbursement will not be linked to any
specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. Once the credit i s
approved by the Board, the Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated deposit account in
U S Dollars for the Borrower's use. As the single tranche is released on credit effectiveness,
IDA will disburse the proceeds o f the credit into the deposit account. IDA reserves the right
to require an audit o f the deposit account.

1. Audit of the financial records o f Pronamme Aid: A legally registered, private and
independent audit company meeting international standards on auditing and the qualification
of the auditors assigned will perform annual audits based on the quarterly financial reports.
The audit costs will be met by G o M from the OE. The Terms o f Reference for the audit is
shown inAttachment Io fthis MOU. The final audit report will be submitted annually to GoM
as well as to PAPs no later than three months after the year's end. The PAPs reserve the right
to review the audit. The auditor concerned should assist this review and should supply the
reviewer with all relevant documents relating to the audit.

2. Audit of State Account: In accordance with prevailing legislation, the Administrative
Court audits the General State Account (CGE) annually. Once the report i s submitted to the
Assembly of the Republic and published G o M undertakes to discuss the Administrative
Court's opinion with PAPs.

3. Value for money audit: Annual value for money audits will be carried out, on a sample o f
activities relevant for poverty reduction and financed through the OE, by the General
Inspectorate of Finance (IGF), where considered necessary by the signatories in close
collaboration with independent, qualified and recognized auditors, acceptable to all
signatories. Areas to be audited and Terms of Reference will be agreed upon between the
signatories to this MoU. Financing will be agreed upon between G o M and the PAPs upon
presentation of a detailed budget for the audit by the IGF. One VFM audit will take place
yearly until the capacity o f IGF has made it possible to undertake further value for money
audits. These audits will also contribute to the capacity building in increasing the proportion
of audit reports that come from normal auditing by the competent Mozambican audit
authorities.

                                          DRAFT

                                        BACKGROUND


1. The introduction of the PRS approach, donor and partner country commitments at
Monterrey and donor commitments at Rome all demanded new ways o f working between
donors and partner governments and among donors. The PRS approach required donors to
step back and for partner governments to take stronger ownership o f the development process.
Commitments at Monterrey and Rome demand that donors align behind partner government
plans and processes and harmonize among themselves.

2. In Mozambique most donors are committed to supporting the Government's poverty
reduction strategy, the PARPA. Since 2000, one o f the most important donor groupings for
promoting government ownership, alignment andharmonizationhas been the group o f donors
providing budget support. Over that time the group has grown considerably in size and has
sought to develop ways o f working that allow it to effectively support GoM's poverty
reduction strategy. In 2003-04 this led to the development o f a new Memorandum o f
Understanding (MoU) for Programme Aid (Direct Budget Support and Balance o f Payment
Support). The M o U was signed by 13 bilaterals, the European Commission and World Bank
(together known as Programme Aid Partners or PAPs).           The MoU includes a common
performance assessment framework (PAF) in which G o M identifies its priorities andjointly
with PAPsassessesperformance on an annual basis.

3. The new M o U (section 4) defines commitments to improving the quality o f development
cooperation and provision of Programme Aid, that imply certain changes in the PAP-
governmentrelationship. For donor behavior, this leads to:

    0   Need to align with government's instruments, processes and systems o f financial
        management, shifiing accountability from donors to the Mozambican citizens through
        the NationalAssembly;
    0   More strategic, on-going dialogue with G o M on those instruments and systems;
    0   Need to discuss and form a joint view on the range o f government policy and
        performance, including sector and cross-cutting issues relatedwork;
    0   Commitment to greater transparency, predictability and harmonization;
    0   Commitment to reduce administrative burden.

4. These changes in turn imply the need for a clearer organizational structure among PAPs,
and for terms o f reference which define the different levels o f PAPs' work and roles and
responsibilities for dialogue with the government and amongst PAPs. This will include sectors
and cross-cutting issues related groups.    This paper sets out the objectives o f the PAPs
structure, operatingprinciples and TORSfor each o f the groups.



                                              86

                     1. OBJECTIVES OF THE PAP STRUCTURE

1. The objectives o fthe structure areto:

8 Increase transparency between GoM and PAPs and within PAPs;
0 Reduce transaction costs (for GoM and later for PAPs);
8 Ensuremembershave a clear and adequatemandate;
8 Improve communication among PAPs andbetweenPAPs and Government;
0 Increase coherence across areas o fdonor and government operations;
8 LinkPAPs effectively to other donor structures and groupings, inparticular the DPGand
  the CG.

                             2. OPERATING PRINCIPLES

1. The operatingprinciples are that:

8  All PAPsthat are signatories to the M o Ushouldbepart o fthe structure. Observers may
   be invitedto all levels and groups;
8  All groups will normallyhave a,commonchair andco-chair, which rotate annually (the
   chair, co-chair andoutgoing chair forming the troika chairmanship). Additionally, E C and
   WE3 will bepermanent members, forming the troika plus;
0  Groups should be `slagvaardig' (strategic, lean, mean, decisive, non-bureaucratic,
   responsive to need, adding value);
8  Transparency and openness between PAPs and within PAP agencies.


                                      3. STRUCTURE

1. The PAPs structure for dialogue comprises the Heads o f Mission group (HoMs), the
   Heads o f Cooperation group (HoCs) and the Economists Working group (EWG).
   Additionally, there will be PAF coordination group, chaired by the troika HOCs and
   formed by the representatives o f Sector Working groups (SWG) and cross-cutting reform
   groups relevant for assessing PAFperformance.

2. The Troika plus, at HoCs level, has the mandate delegated by the HOMs group to
   represent the group as necessary, prepare and facilitate the PAPs decision making process
   associated to the MOUimplementation.

3. The secretariat assists the PAPs inthe dialogue between them and with the government
   through provision o f supporting services and facilitating information sharing.

4. The PAPs structure i s summarized as follows:

                            ATTACHMENT K: EXCEPTIONS

The following are exceptions to this MoU. PAPSundertake to reduce the number o f
exceptions to the M o Uover time (particularly those that are not caused by statutory or legal
requirements).

WorldBank:
The M o Uwill be referred to inthe World Bank bilateral agreement, rather than appearing as
an annex.

The World Bank will follow the same dialogue and monitoring process but will have its own
response mechanism and disbursement arrangements.

The World Bank will make a multi-year indicative commitment o f Balance o f Payment
Support under its Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).        The actual amount o f Balance o f
Payments Support for any given year will be more specifically determined duringthe appraisal
and negotiations o f an operation under a series o f Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs), and definitively determined after the operation i s presented to the IDA Board o f
ExecutiveDirectors for their approval. At present, appraisal and negotiations are expected to
occur annually inApril-May, and Board presentation in June o f the year n. IDA will use the
joint GoM and PAP assessment o f performance inyear n-1,particularly against prior actions
selected from the PAF and agreed with the G o M for inclusion inthe relevant PRSC operation,
to appraise and negotiation the credit for year n. The credit for year n will also identify
triggers, also selected from the PAF and agreed with the GoM, that will become prior actions
for the proposed credit for year n+l. IDA will normally disburse within one to eight weeks
from the date o f Board approval.

Switzerland:
Switzerland will only give final confirmation on commitment for year n+l after approval o f
OE and PES for year n+l by Mozambican Parliament that are consistent with PARPA
priorities.

 Sweden:
 Sweden will make commitments in May and August as provided in this MoU, but due to
 Swedish government procedures, final commitments for the fixed portion for year n+l can
only be legally confirmed in year n+l (usually March). The variable portion for year n+l i s
based on performance on selected indicators in the PAF for year n (See Attachment F), and
will be confirmed only after a performance assessment has been made at the Annual Review
 inyear n+l A transitional arrangement onthe variable portion will be applied in2004 on the
             .
basis on PAF 2003.

 Germany:
 Germany retains the right to interrupt disbursements if the Government of Mozambique fails
 to perform its payment obligations to KfW (German Development Bank). Germany will
 confirm its commitment as soon as possible depending on approval o f the German Parliament
 and/or release bythe German Ministryo f Finance.



                                               89

France:
France retains the right to interrupt disbursements if the Government o f Mozambique fails to
perform its financial obligations to the Agence Franqaise de DCveloppement (AFD - French
Development Agency), as agreed in `Contract0 de Reduqgo da Divida de Desenvolvimento',
signed by the Governments o f France andMozambique.

EuropeanCommission(EC):
The EC will follow the same dialogue and monitoring process, response mechanism and
disbursement arrangements. This M o Uwill be referredto inthe E C bilateral agreement.

However,
       This M o U remains subject to the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement or any
       subsequent framework for the European Commission-Mozambique cooperation; and
       to the actual andprospective availability o f funds under the relevant framework;
       The provisions inthe Financial Regulation o f the European Development Fundremain
       applicable to the EC programme o fbudget support;
       The EC's confirmed commitments and disbursements remain formally subject to final
       decision by the EuropeanCommission;
       With reference to Section 3, concerning the Underlying Principles presented in
       Articles 8 and decisions linked to an eventual breach, mentioned inArticle 10, the E C
       will follow the appropriate consultationprocedures and measures foreseen inthe Final
       Provisions o f the Cotonou Agreement, particularly under Articles 9, 96 and 97;
       Incase the assessment ofthe variable portionof its ProgrammeAid can only be made
       at the mid-year review, or even after, due to late availability o f the relevant data, the
       EC will not be able to confirm its commitment on the variable portion by 31 August,
       butwill strive to do it for December (yearn);
       For variable portions relating to data for years prior to the signature o f this MoU, the
       conditions o f the existing Financing Agreement will continue to apply;
       For the year 2004, disbursement o f one portion will be linked to specific conditions on
       the electoralprocess.

BelgiumandNorway:

  The economy continuedto performwell in2004. RealGDPgrowth decelerated slightlyto'an

  estimated7.2percent. Inflationdeclined morethan expectedto 9.1 percentat end-December

  2004 andto 4.5 percentat end-April2005 driven by lowerfood pricesand despite a shad

  increaseinpetroleumprices.The easingof inflationexpectationsalso contributedto a

  reductionin interestrates. Stronggrowth intraditionalexports,the completionoftwo

  megaprojects, and improvedterms of trade helpednarrowthe extemalcurrent account deficit,

  excludinggrants, by onethirdto 13.8percentof GDP in2004.This togetherwith greater-than

 ANNEX 6: MONITORINGAND EVALUATIONOFTHE PARPA-ISSUES NOTE

                               Monitoring and Evaluation

PARPAM&E System

1. The M&E strategy of the PARPA relied on the exiting sectoral M&E systems. The
PARPA guided the GOM in defining the state's medium-term and annualbudgets, programs
and policies from 2001 to 2005 with a focus on those sectors that play an important role in
terms o f the impact they have on poverty reduction and socio-economic development. Those
sectors included education, health, infrastructure (roads, energy, and water), agriculture,
governance, justice, and macro-economic and financial policies. The Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) strategy o f the PARPA relied mainly on the existing government
mechanisms for monitoring progress in implementing sectoral strategies, assessing changes in
the welfare level o f populations through periodic focused surveys, and ensuring flow o f
information to all stakeholders through periodic reporting.

2. Significant improvementsof the PARPA M&E system have been introduced. The
GOM introduced new monitoring and reporting mechanisms o f the PARPA since the
beginning of its implementation to ensure better coordination and integration o f planning,
monitoring, and reporting. They included: (i) the development o f the Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF), which focuses on a subset o f the PARPA priority actions and
indicators supported by its development partners,         (ii)the production of the PARPA
implementation review reports called "Balanqo de PES", which provides an assessment o f all
government activities reflected in the annual Economic and Social Plan (PES), and (iii)      the
poverty observatory consultative forum, through which the Balanqo de PES and other
qualitative studies are presented two times a year to civil societies andpartners at the national
level. Inaddition, the budget execution o f the priority programs is reportedperiodically inthe
budget quarterly reports.

3. Sector M&E systems are at different levels of development. The PARPA monitoring
system relies heavily on the existing sector administrative data which are at varying degrees o f
development and reliability. This situation creates inconsistency and discrepancies in data
quality and delay inthe time o f reporting. Tracking progress towards the PARPA outcomes is
uneven due to the fact that some sectors do not have an appropriate M&E system to collect
accurate and reliable information o f their sector indicators and therefore can't adequately
determine whether or not they are on track to achieve the targeted results. For example,
Education and Health sectors have relatively good statistical units which compile consistent
administrative data about the performance of their sectors. The Ministry o f Agriculture has
just finalized a plan for operationalizing its Management Information System (MIS), which
includes tracking outputs, outcomes and impacts for monitoring and evaluating the
performance o f the sector. The infrastructure sectors (energy, water, and roads) performance
monitoring systems still need further improvement, both at central and provinciaVdistrict
levels to provide reliable data on the PARPAPAF indicators.

4. Inadequate PARPA M&E implementation plan. The initial strategy for monitoring
PARPA implementation was not to create a new system for PARPA, but to rely on the
existing sector M&E systems. On the other hand, because of the diversity and complexity o f

                                              110

the flow o f information in each sector, this approach may only work well when a clear M&E
plan i s developed that clearly defines all institutional arrangements, responsibilities, tools and
methodologies for data collection, analysis, and reporting on each indicator. The existing
M&E systems were developed to monitor the performance o f the implementation o f the
sectoral strategies and plan and therefore vary by sector. The Health sector, for example, went
through several iterations o f defining indicators and monitoring arrangements. The
Agriculture sector has just finalized a performance M&E plan with a series o f output,
outcome, and impact indicators to be tracked by the agriculture management information
system. The data reported by such systems includes information which is not well structured,
to address specifically the need for reporting on the key PARPA results. Only a subset o f that
information may be needed for PARPAreporting needs.

5. A lack of improvedM&E capacity continues to be a challenge for implementingthe
PARPA M&E system. Inadequate skill in M&E still exists at the national, sectoral, and
provincial levels. It relates to the design o f results frameworks, methodologies for data
collection, analysis and interpretation, and approaches for the use and dissemination o f M&E
information to improve linkage between monitoring, planning, and budgeting.                Lack o f
capacity in M&E in one level o f the information flow chain would have a negative effect on
the quality and reliability o f the whole M&E system.           It is necessary to enhance M&E
capacity at the central and sectoral ministries to ensure reliability and sustainability o f the
M&E systems.        Statistical units/departments o f line ministries are very important to the
establishment o f a good and sustainable monitoring system, Technical assistance and
enhancement o f data collection and analysis i s needed for staff working with the existing
sectoral management information, especially at the provincial and district levels. Coordination
o f inter-sectoral planning and monitoring processes to achieve PARPA outcome results still
needs improvement. To fulfill its role o f planning and coordination o f PARPA integrated
M&E systems, the Ministry o f Planning needs to develop capacity in (i)          coordinating the
design and implementation o f monitoring and evaluation systems to enable acquisition and
production o f data necessary for reporting on overall progress in PARPA implementation to
different users including government, donors, and the general public, and (ii)    analyzing policy
andbudget allocationto facilitate the development o f annualized actionplans o f activities and
policies that will contribute to the achievement o ftargeted outcome and impacts.


M&ESystemfor PARPARevision

The government has already started the process o f revising the PARPA and the plan is for the
first draft o f revised PARPA to be finalized by the end o f September 2005. It i s important to
use this process to achieve the development o fbetter M&E system for PARPA, which include
the implementation o f the following recommendations.

6. The revision of the PARPA should use the outcome-oriented approach. Most o f the
key challenges facing the GoM in achieving better results in fighting poverty and increasing
economic growth are multidimensional and can be addressed only by adopting an outcome-
oriented or program-based approach to planning and budgeting. Therefore, it i s important to
adopt a new integrated approach in revising the new PARPA by first defining the outcomes
and results to achieve, second, identify programs intheir entirety as well as the relationships
between different sector interventions that would contribute to the achievement o f such

                                                  111

outcomes and results, and third, align the existing sector development strategies and plans
with the PARPA outcomes and link them to budget allocation. The recently developed five-
year government plan should be used as the base for the development o f PARPA IIto ensure
linkage and alignment o f objectives.

7. For the PARPA revision, develop a simplified results and policy framework. Based
on the lessons learned from the implementation of the previous PARPA, it i s necessary to
develop a simplified PARPA results and policy framework that clarifies the outcomes to be
achieved, indicators to measure for each outcome, and general policy actions to be
implemented to achieve each outcome. The development o f the new PARPA results
framework should be carried out using a participatory approach and discussed as openly as
possible to develop wide ownership and commitment. The results framework defined this
way, would lead to greater clarity on how various policy actions and outputs contribute to the
achievement o f the PARPA outcomes. This, in turn, will serve in facilitating the design and
development o f an integrated M&E system for PARPA andwill play a role inthe allocation of
funds to sector programs contributing directly to the achievement o f targeted outcomes.
Likewise, the framework would provide a basis for harmonizing donor's programs and
developing PAF annual actions and performance reviews so they better align with the PARPA
outcomes. The results framework should focus on using a short list o f key outcome and
impact indicators for monitoring the implementationo f PARPA. However, clear linkage to all
other monitoring level indicators o f the entire results chains (input and outputs) should be
defined. Input and output indicators could be tracked by management information systems in
each sector for monitoring the implementation o f sector strategies and programs. Important
process and intermediate indicators that are linked to the achievement o f key results
indicators, for which annual data is not possible to track and analyze, could be added to the
annual performance tracking systems such as the PAF.

8. For the revised PARPA, develop an integrated M&E implementationplan. In order
to establish a regular flow o f reliable information from the sectors into a monitoring and
reporting system on PARPA indicators, it i s necessary to develop a comprehensive and
integrated M&E system for PARPA. The development o f such a system should start with the
review o f the existing M&E systems, including systems at the provincial levels, to identify
systematic weaknesses surrounding data collection, analysis, and reporting on PARPA key
outcome indicators and implementation processes. This assessment i s required to streamline
information on the indicators that are to be reported within the framework o f monitoring
PARPA and provide input to the development of the PARPA M&E plan. The aim is to create
a framework for harmonizing and streamlining the existing systems to enhance timeliness,
quality o f data generated, and actual use o f M&E information for planning and policy
development. The resultant M&E plan would clarify institutional roles and responsibilities
within the integrated system, methodologies for data collection, analysis, and reporting for
each outcome indicator. This plan should be developed in the beginning o f the
implementation o f the revised PARPA, with close consultation with data providers and users
in each sector, to definehedefine indicators and other institutional arrangements, and
 especially to address any gaps that may slow down the M&E process. The institutional
 arrangements for monitoring should build upon existing capacity with a plan for further
capacity strengthening at all levels to ensure proper implementation o f the monitoring plan.
