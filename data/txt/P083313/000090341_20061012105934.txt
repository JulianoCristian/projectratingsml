              THIRD POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

                             Credit and ProgramSummary

Borrower:     The Republic o f Benin.

Amount:       SDR 20.3 million (US$30 million equivalent).

Terms:        Standard IDA terms; 40-year maturity with 10-year grace period.

Description:  The proposed operation constitutes the third o f a series o f Poverty Reduction Strategy
              Credits (PRSCs) designed to assist the Government o f Benin in implementing its
              Poverty Reduction Strategy, launched in December 2002.             PRSC series are an
              integral part o f the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved by the
              Board o f Executive Directors on July 3, 2003.

              PRSC-1 (US$20 million equivalent, approved on March 18, 2004) aimed to: (i)         help
              create the basis for private-sector-led economic growth by supporting the
              Government's macroeconomic program; (ii)support the GOB'Spublic expenditure
              management reform program; and (iii)      support the reform o f the public resources
              management in key sectors, including Health, Education and Water, focusing on the
              delivery o f basic services tailored to the needs o f the poor. PRSC2 ($30 million
              equivalent, approved June 14, 2005) expanded the coverage to three new sectors
              (Agriculture,  Rural Transportation and Justice),        while supporting continued
              implementation o f the Environment and Urban Sanitation and the Forest
              Management programs as well as re-launching reforms in civil service and
              decentralization.

              As a follow-on to PRSC-2, PRSC-3 (US$30 million equivalent) would maintain a
              core focus on economic growth and governance, supporting service delivery through
              improved public expenditure management, financial decentralization, and expanding
              results-oriented budgeting to new sectors. A new emphasis will be placed on private
              sector development, on civil service reforms that will help instill a practice o f
              monitoring and evaluation, including at the local level, and also on Justice sector
              reforms in order to improve the business climate.

Benefits:     The proposed PRSC-3 would help improve poverty reduction efforts by
              strengthening the effectiveness o f public expenditures and service delivery through
              improved governance and institutional capacity building as well as pursuing the
              necessary reforms to unleash private sector growth. The line ministries are expected
              to become more responsible in budget formulation and more responsive to
              performance monitoring reports.

Risks:        The mainriskis the economy's vulnerability to changes inworld cottonprices andor
              domestic cotton production. Ongoing discussions with the Government and the other
              donors to accelerate reform o f the cotton sector should reduce this risk and make the
              sector more sustainable. Other main risks are: (a) vulnerability to economic and
              political developments in Nigeria, which could damage Benin's development and
              poverty reduction efforts; (b) the consequences o f the establishment o f a new

                   government as a result o f the presidential election, which could create the political
                   conditions and institutional dynamics to increase fiduciary risk and slow the pace o f
                   reform; (c) inadequate institutional capacity, already strained by the progressive
                   expansion o f the PRSC program, which could slow the pace o f improvements in
                   public service delivery and the implementation o f core reforms.

Estimated
Disbursements:     SDR 20.3 million (US$30 million equivalent) will be disbursed upon Credit
                   effectiveness.

                                    1. INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government o f Benin has been successful in sustaining steady economic growth while
building a pluralist democracy over the past decade. Growth has generally exceeded that o f other
economies in the region, though unfavorable external shocks caused growth to slow from its recent
average o f 5 percent to 3 percent in 2004 and 2005; recovery to 4.5 percent i s estimated for 2006. The
Government's development program has succeeded inestablishing consistent fiscal discipline, opening up
the economy, privatizing most public enterprises, and improving the business environment. Most social
indicators improved progressively since the 1990s, particularly in education and health. However, as
noted in Benin's Poverty Reduction Strategy Progress Reports, these achievements have not translated
into significant progress inpoverty reduction.

2.      The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was approved by the Government in September
2002 and i s the result o f broad-based consultations with a wide variety o f stakeholders. It reiterates the
Government's commitment to sustaining reforms in areas critical for growth and poverty reduction over
the next 15 years. The PRSP outlines and prioritizes the Government's poverty reduction strategy based
on four pillars: (i)strengthening the macroeconomic framework; (ii)developing human capital and
environmental management; (iii)strengthening good governance and institutional capacity; and (iv)
promoting sustainable employment and participation o f the poor inthe decision and production process.

3.      Inaccordance with the PRSP, the PRSCs duringthe 2005-07 period will support the Government
o f Benin (GOB)in its efforts to reduce poverty through implementing policies designed to: (i)maintain
macroeconomic stability and accelerate economic growth focusing on the effective implementation o f the
privatization program, the setting o f a sound regulatory framework in liberalized sectors, improving the
private investment climate and the legal and judicial systems; (ii)improve the delivery, quality, and
coverage o f basic services while improving expenditure efficiency; and (iii)    support the GOB'Spublic
expenditure management reform program; focusing on transferring spending authority from the finance
ministry to decentralized levels o f government while maintaining fiduciary standards; and on moving
toward performance-based budgeting, under which progress would be monitored on the basis o f explicit
quantified indicators.

4.      InMarch2006Beninheldpresidentialelections, andanewgovernment was installedinApril. In
M a y 2006, the new Government organized a conference to launch the terms o f reference for the new
PRSP and the workmg groups that will develop PRSP2 during2006.

5.      Implementation o f the PRSC-3 program has been generally satisfactory. The PRSC-3 triggers as
presented in the PRSC-2 document have been largely met, and in the areas where they have been only
partially met, Government has forged agreements with the Bank and others donors to reflect a credible
new roadmap to accelerate the reform. The overall satisfactory implementation and progress o f PRSC-2
warrants the move to PRSC-3,

                2. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

6.       Benin experienced a decade o f good economic performance since the 1990s. However economic
growth has started to weaken after 2003. Real GDP growth rate averaged 5 percent over 2000-03 but
slowed to 3 percent in 2004 and 2005. This slowdown in the growth rate i s mainly attributed to the weak
performance o f the cotton ginning sector and an intensification o f trade restrictions in Nigeria. These
developments highlighted the vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks because o f its heavy
dependence on cotton and trade with Nigeria. However, economic growth i s expected to recover to 4.5
percent in 2006 reflecting a rebound in cotton and services sectors. Inflation was broadly contained
although high world oil prices and regional food price increases caused by draught in neighboring Niger
led to a temporary increase in inflation (5.4 percent in 2005 compared with 0.9 percent in 2004).
Although inflation remains low, Benin's competitiveness weakened due to the appreciation o f the real
effective exchange rate and delays inthe implementationo f key structural reforms.

7.       Despite a difficult international environment marked by declining world prices o f cotton and
higher oil prices, the external current account deficit (excluding current official grants) narrowed from 8.6
percent o f GDP in 2003 to 7.1 percent o f GDP in 2005. As a result, the overall balance o f payments
improved slightly from -0.4 percent o f GDP to 3.1 percent o f GDP over the same period. Consequently,
Benin contributed positively to the net foreign assets o f the regional central bank with gross reserves
averaging 11.4 months o f imports. Together with other WAEMU countries, Benin has maintained a
liberal trade and payment system and i s considered as a strong performer in trade liberalization. Import
licensing requirements were abolished, non-tariff barriers eliminated, and the regional common external
tariff (CET) was implemented, including simplified tariff rates and a progressive elimination o f tariffs
within the WAEMU area.

8.       Despite revenue shortfalls that followed economic slowdown, fiscal discipline has been
maintained with an overall budget deficit (on a payment order basis and excluding grants) averaging 3.6
percent o f GDP over 2000-2004 and limited to 3.1 percent in 2005. This was primarily achieved by
cutting domestically financed capital expenditures and non priority current expenditures.

9.       Medium-term growth context: To achieve higher sustainable growth rates consistent with
significant poverty reduction and reduce the vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks, the
government will need to deepen and speed up structural reforms to foster private sector development and
to promote economic diversification. Indeed, the economy i s still largely dependent on agriculture, in
particular cotton, and trade with Nigeria and therefore highly vulnerable to international shocks. The
agricultural sector contributes over one third o f GDP and provides employment to two thirds o f the
population and even greater proportion o f the poor. Inparticular, cotton i s a major source o f employment,
foreign exchange earnings (80 percent o f exports), government revenue, and banking activity for the
economy as a whole while exports and re-exports to Nigeria are estimated to be equivalent to 6.5 to 7.5
percent o f GDP.

10.      To diversify the country's export base, the government will need to improve the physical
infrastructure and public utilities, modernize the export institutional framework, facilitate access to land
and financial services, strengthen the judicial system, and otherwise ensure a favorable investment
climate for both foreign and domestic investors. The recommendations o f the Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS) and the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) should help the authorities
identify the critical trade and competitiveness measures. To complement these measures, a special
emphasis should be put on completing the cotton sector reform and speeding up the privatization
program, inparticular the Port o f Cotonouand telecommunications.

11.      The serious difficulties facing the cotton sector and the intensification o f trade restrictions by
Nigeria continued to be the major economic concerns for 2005 and beyond. The non-implementationof
the regulatory framework within which all the actors should operate, the absence o f a clear protocol
between Government and the inter-profession as to their respective roles and disorder in the importation
and distribution o f inputs and in the primary marketing o f cotton continued to put the sector under stress.
These disruptions led to a sharp decline in cotton production from 425,000 tons in 2004/2005 to 190,000
tons in 2005/2006. Given that cotton accounts for about two-thirds o f Benin's exports and i s the major
source o f income to about 350,000 poor farmers, such disruptions are likely to seriously affect growth and
living standards, especially inrural areas where most o f the poor are located. The new Government has
addressed these Weaknesses by improving the regulatory framework and its enforcement, and by
improving the management o fnegotiations on input supplies for the next campaign.

12.      Although significant progress has been made inthe area o f public expenditure management, there
are still some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The use o f exceptional spending procedures, in
particular through cash advance accounts or without prior authorization continued to be a major concern.
An evaluation o f the use o f these accounts by the recent country financial accountability assessment
(CFAA) estimated the amount spent outside the regular budgetary expenditure management process at
CFAF 84 billion or about 20 percent o f total spending. As o f end-may 2006, these payments are estimated
at 25 percent o f total executed expenditures. The government has started to address these weaknesses by
limiting the number o f cash advance accounts and treasury payments to a small number o f pre-identified
expenditures.

                                  2.1       RECENT     BUDGETPERFORMANCE

13.     Fiscal consolidation has been a major achievement through the early 2000s, but recent budget
performance has been characterized by declining revenue collection due to economic slowdown and
important budgetary pressures. These resulted in fiscal instability and severe cuts in the budget approved
by the parliament. Indeed, 2005 budget appropriations havebeen reducedby 1.O percent o fGDP to offset
recent budgetary pressures (mentioned in paragraph 4) and limit the level o f total expenditures to 19.6


                                                           3

percent o f GDP. Although the government has tried to the extent possible to protect priority sectors,
social public expenditures have been cut by 2.0 percent. On the revenue side, measures equivalent to 1.1
percent o f GDP have also been taken to increase tax revenue to 16.5 percent o f GDP. As a result, the
overall fiscal deficit (payment order basis, excluding grants) has been limitedto 3.1 percent o f GDP.

14.      The government continued to reflect the PRSP priorities by progressively increasing the
budgetary allocation for basic services although the scope for large increases in priority public spending
has been limited by lower than anticipated fiscal revenues and integration o f additional exceptional
expenditures. Total budget appropriations for basic education, health and rural water increased fi-om
CFAF 128 billion in 2004 to CFAF 142 billion in 2005, corresponding to an increase o f 11.O percent
compared with 6.0 percent for other ministries. Consequently, the share o f total budget allocated to these
three sectors increasedby one percentage point.

15.       However, the executed budget was less consistent with PRSP priorities than the budget voted by
the National Assembly as the original structure o f the budget prepared by the Government has been
distorted at the execution stage. The total payment in 2004 shows that the execution rates for priority
sectors (81 percent) are still lower than those in other sectors (86 percent), and the problem continued in
2005, There are strong indications that budget regulation, late spending authorizations, decision taken by
the government to limit the use o f cash advance accounts and lower absorptive capacity were the major
factors behind low execution rates inPRSP priority sectors.

16.       To raise the level and quality o f social expenditures, the Government will need to pursue the
overall reforms in public expenditure management while making a special effort to increase absorptive
capacities and enhance resource management in these sectors. It will also need to reduce budget
instability and introduce more flexibility into developing the macroeconomic fiamework.

17.       The Macroeconomic Framework for 2006-2008.                   The Government's macroeconomic
objectives over the period 2006-08 are to achieve higher sustainable growth consistent with significant
poverty reduction in a stable macroeconomic environment. Economic growth i s expected to progressively
recover to 5.5 percent while inflation would be limited to less than 3.0 percent on average. Economic
growth would be driven by an increase in cotton production initiated by the completion o f the refoms in
the sectors and by the progressive lifting o f trade restrictions inNigeria which would restore and allow for
an increase o f commercial activities. To sustain the overall GDP growth rate, the investment-to-GDP
ratio i s expected to increase from 18.8 percent in 2002-05 to 21.2 percent in 2006-08, fuelled by higher
public investment in the infrastructure and social sectors as well as private investment stimulated by the
privatization o f key public enterprises and improved investment climate. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio i s
projected to increase from 16.6 percent to 17.2 percent over the period while total government
expenditure would increaseby 2.0 percent o f GDP to 22.0 percent. Consequently, the overall fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) would widen from 3.5 percent o f GDP to 4.8 percent o f GDP. The external current
account deficit would narrow by 1.2 percent o f GDP on average to 6.7 percent in2006-08.

18.       Debt Sustainability. In March 2003, Benin reached its completion point in the context o f the
HIPC Initiative. In July 2005, a new debt sustainability analysis was conducted jointly with the IMF to
incorporate updated data and reflect the new international environment. Despite the difficult economic
environment, the external debt situation was maintained on a sustainable path with the ratio o f the net
present value (NPV) o f debt to GDP below 35 percent in 2005. Benin i s also one o f the first 19 countries
that have graduated from the HIPC Initiative and will receive 100 percent cancellation o f their eligible
debt under the MDRI. Total debt relief from the World Bank, the IMF and the African Development

Bank amounts to approximately U S $ l .1 billion. (25 percent o f 2005 GDP). This will help the country to
further reduce its debt ratios and keep its external debt situation on a sustainable path.

19.      Benin has a good track record o f servicing its debt on time with no arrears. Combined with
satisfactory implementation o f reforms and continued macroeconomic stability, Benin i s expected to
discharge its future obligations in a timely manner. The authorities established a national debt committee,
chaired by the Minister o f Development, Economy and Finance, which became operational in December
2003, The committee monitors Benin's external debt situation, reviews proposals for new external loans,
and makes recommendations for alternative financing sources in light o f the Government's objective o f
keeping the debt at a sustainable level. The Committee's database i s fairly comprehensive and up-to-date
and contains accurate stock data as well as projected debt-service flows.

20.      Financing requirements. After taking into account the recent macro-economic developments,
the external financing requirements in 2006 are estimated at US$172 million after projected debt relief`.
Based on Government projections, projects disbursements are estimated to represent US$84 million. The
remaining financing gap for 2006 represents US$90 million. It would be financed in part by program
financing from the African Development Bank, the European Union and other donors. The proposed
credit would constitute part o f IDA'Scontribution to filling the remaining gap.

             3. BENIN'S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

21.     Benin's poverty reduction strategy paper (2003-2005) was finalized in December 2002 and
endorsed by the Bank and Fund Boards in March 2003, when Completion Point was also reached. The
PRSP outlines and prioritizes the Government's poverty reduction strategy based on four pillars: (i)
bolstering the medium-term macroeconomic framework; (ii)strengthening human development and
environmental management, including improving the access o f the poor to quality basic services (basic
education, primary health care, water and sanitation, food security and nutrition, adequate habitat, and
rural roads); (iii)improving governance and institutional reforms, such as decentralization, public
administration reform, and the strengthening o f the legal and judicial system; and (iv) improving
employment or income-generating opportunities for the poor and strengthening their capacity to
participate in decision making and production. A PRSP dissemination conference was held in December
2004.

22.      Benin's first annual progress report (APR) o f the PRSP was discussed with stakeholders at a
conference in February 2005 and reviewed by the Bank and Fund Boards in June 2005. It notes
achievements in implementing the PRSP in areas such as public expenditure management and service
delivery in the social sectors; however it also records the slow progress on poverty reduction and in
reaching most o f the MDGs. The APR and the Joint Staff Advisory Note both discussed the recent
economic slowdown (to 3 percent in2004) and the consequent needto reduce budget allocations midyear.
Recovery to 4 percent growth i s estimated for 2005. Recommendations in the APR cite a number o f
measures for making strategy implementation more effective, including improvements in the economic
environment and in the quality o f social services, especially in disadvantaged areas. Benin's second
annual progress report o f the PRSP i s now in draft and was circulated for comment in August 2005. On
September 12,2005, Government sponsored a forum on the draft progress report, including a broad set o f
stakeholders and participation by donors.

23.      Progress toward the MDGs: The draft APR shows that some progress has been achieved in
improving access to basic social services but recognizes that further efforts will be needed to reach MDG
and PRSP targets. Inthe education sector, the primary gross enrollment ratio increased from 94 percent in
2003 to 96 percent in 2004 while the gross enrollment ratio for girls rose from 81 percent to 84 percent
over the same period. Even so, the primary education completion rate (50 percent in 2004) has fallen
short o f PRSP targets (56 percent) because o f highrepetition and drop out rates while gender differences
inprimary educationremainhighdespite falling trends.

24.      In the health sector, some progress has been realized in the higher utilization rate of health
services for children under 5 (from 78 percent in 2003 to 86 percent in 2004), a lower HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate and a decrease in child mortality from 107 in 2003 to 105 per thousand in 2004.
However, the maternal mortality rate remains high at 474 per 100,000 live births while the number o f
births assisted by trained personnel has remained constant at 76 percent. Malnutrition is still high and
malaria remains the most common and most deadly disease inBenin.

25.      The APR also describes the progress achieved in the water sector, in particular the significant
progress made by the Government in increasing access to potable water to the rural population from 36
percent in 2003 to 39 percent in 2004. Although Benin i s on track to reach the MDG for rural water
supply, this will require substantial resources for new construction and maintenance, along with
community participation to improve the quality o f service.

26.      While the current PRSP covers the period through 2005, the next PRSP will be developed during
2006 and cover 2007-2009. The most recent progress report lays out the Government's agenda for
continuing implementation o f the existing PRSP, as well as its calendar for developing the new PRSP in


                                                     7

the course o f 2006. Sectoral working groups are working on developing PRSP2, and donors consider
their dialogue with Government as part o f the input to the overall reflection that Government will conduct
inorder to producethe new PRSP.



   4. WORLD BANK STRATEGY FOR SUPPORTING THE PRSP

                               4.1     PRSCFRAMEWORK           RATIONALE

27.     The series o f PRSCs for Benin are intended to support the main planks o f Benin's PRSP:
sustaining macroeconomic stability and private sector growth; improving service delivery; and promoting
good governance, including results-oriented budget and administrative management

28.     The proposed series o f PRSCs (PRSC-3 in 2006 and PRSC-4 in 2007) will continue their role in
addressing the Government's request for donor harmonization around a common set o f measures in key
reform areas, and for increasing the share o f budget support in donor assistance. The PRSCs will also
continue to fulfill the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS for FY04-07, Report No. 26054-BEN, approved
by the Board inJuly 2003) plank for supporting a number o f sectoralpolicy reforms through development
policy lending via budget support.

29.     The proposed Credit i s the third in this series of PRSCs and the rationale for continuing Bank
support to the Country's reform programs through programmatic lending remains valid. The dialogue on
budget consolidation and policy and results-based instruments has substantially improved over time not
only with the Government but also with the main donors, leading to some remarkable achievements with
respect to the improvement o f donor coordination and harmonization o f procedures. (see section 7.6). In
addition, the program preparation, implementation and monitoring have contributed to strengthen the
quality o f interaction between the Ministry o f finance and the line ministries, while generating a
consensus among stakeholders on the key institutional reforms and capacity needs as well as the
definition o f a roadmap for addressing those issues progressively.

                     4.2     PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND SECTORAL COVERAGE

30.     The overall objective o f the proposed PRSCs i s to support implementation o f Benin's PRSP in
line with the CAS and toward attainment o f PRSP goals and the MDGs. They help to sustain core
reforms that promote economic growth and governance, supporting service delivery through improved
public expenditure management, financial decentralization, and expanding the application o f results-
oriented management. In order to reverse the recent economic slowdown and reduce vulnerability to
external shocks, Governmentrecognizes that a number o f structural reforms are needed inorder to remain
on track toward PRSP goals. The PRSC series includes both sectoral and cross-cutting programs to
support these reforms.

31,     PRSC-1 covered three sectors in "emphasis mode" (rural water, health and basic education), two
others in"maintenance mode" (environment and forestry) and the public expenditure management reform
as a core segment. PRSC-2 was expanded to include agriculture, rural transport andjustice. The inclusion
o f these new sectors reflects the fact that the GOBmade significant progress in developing and/or
sharpening the sectoral strategy along with the identification o f a credible agenda o f reforms to increase
public expenditure efficiency. However, progress in these new sectors was not yet sufficient in defining:
(i)a full fledged results-based operational sector program; and (ii)a complete set of measurable
resultjoutcome indicators to monitor progress in achieving objectives.




                                                     8

32.     The proposed PRSC-3 plans further work in sectors added under PRSC-2 -- Agriculture, Justice,
and Rural Transport -- in implementing sector strategies and developing program budgets that will
contribute to the MTEF for 2007-2009. Continuing reforms in public expenditure management and in
Health, Water, and Education will be especially targeted toward improving the efficiency o f service
delivery.    In addition, the proposed operation will reflect Government's new priority on increasing
economic growth and stabilizing fiscal resources available to finance program budgets. Hence PRSC-3
will place added emphasis on economic growth and cross cutting issues designed to make ongoing
reforms more effective. These include Private Sector development, Civil Service reforms, and fiscal
deconcentratioddecentralization. Each o f these reform agendas i s multi-sectoral in nature and can be
especially productive ina multi-sector operation such as the PRSC.

                 4.3     NEWAREASOFEMPHASIS: PSDAND CROSS-CUTTINGISSUES

33.     Given the importance o f accelerating economic growth and diversifying the economy, a
comprehensive private sector development strategy i s expected to provide a major element o f the
reform program to be supported under PRSC-3. In addition to providing new impetus for privatization
and sound regulation, the strategy will also define reforms critical to improving the investment climate.
Private sector development will also be supported by initiatives in the sectors added under PRSC-2.
Reforms inthe agriculture sector will include proposals for development o f private means to better secure
incomes for cotton producers. Reforms in the justice sector, while still in their early stages, should
eventually improve security for contract enforcement and property rights for investors. Reforms in the
transport sector include proposals for the main port. The port and customs are at the center o f a nexus o f
related reforms: private sector development, trade facilitation, revenue efficiency and equity, fiscal
balance, good governance and reducing corruption. Reforming the port and customs systems i s supported
in the sector's program budget and is also concordant with the objectives of other donors and the IMF
who are key supporters o f these reforms.

34.     Given progress inthe sectoral components, the new credit will pursue greater efforts on the cross-
cutting themes o f civil service reform and fiscal decentralization.       Both reforms are designed to
complement progress inexpenditure management. Civil service reforms will help,promoteadministrative
changes that will better accommodate results-oriented management. Proposed reforms will give line
ministries better instruments for responding to performance monitoring reports and changing skill needs.
Fiscal decentralization will aim at improving the poverty-focus o f public expenditures and service
delivery. Initiatives in decentralization will build on progress undertaken at the local level in the urban
and C D D projects.     Using the opportunity generated through donor coordination during the earlier
operations, PRSC-3 will support the Government with a concerted approach among the donors on civil
service reform and work to launch a realistic program that will address the issues raised in PRSC-1 and
the CAS.

35.     Several components o f PRSC-3 will contribute to improving governance and reducing
corruption. The recent Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) identified corruption as one o f the most
important obstacles to increasing private investment.        Consequently, initiatives for private sector
development will include judicial and governance reforms as part o f the strategy. Judicial sector reforms
will focus on improving service delivery o f the court system while providing for training and staffing for
the system. PRSC-3 will also include a corruption component that will support the conclusion and
dissemination o f the ACSP diagnostic survey and propose a multi-sector dialogue with Government and
other stakeholders to develop a broad-based strategy. Finally, the PRSC will continue to promote the
raising o f fiduciary standards, including both expenditure management as well as improving tax system
regulation and transparency. These initiatives should contribute to including governance issues into every
aspect o f government activity.




                                                     9

36.      Another important cross-cutting theme i s capacity building. While capacity building figures
separately in most o f the sectoral agendas described below, it i s worth noting its general importance for
Benin at this stage o f development.        The period 1989 to 1995 was characterized by a freeze on
recruitment and most salary increases. This kept the wage bill below 5 percent o f GDP but also reduced
the number o f government employees by a third, leading progressively to the ageing o f staff and
shortages in certain critical skills, hampering the performance o f the public service.        Meanwhile,
Government has taken on major new administrative procedures in PRSP monitoring, MTEF, sector
program budgets, budget execution; procurement, financial controls, performance evaluation, and
deconcentratioddecentralization. While there are always difficulties in adapting to new systems, some o f
the resistance and delays are due to lack o f information on newprocedures. Thus, while the Government
bringsina new generation o f cadres, a targeted effort incapacity buildingwill help introducenewcomers
to relevant business systems, increase cooperation with new procedures, and replace depleted cadres in
critical areas such as financial control and justice. Local officials, in particular, will need training in
budget management, financial reporting, and local M&E o f service delivery.

SECTORALCOVERAGE

37.      PRSC-2 added three new sectors: Agriculture, Justice, and Rural Transport. These along with
Health, Water, and Education make for a very broad-based operation. Further, these sectors comprise a
commanding share o f total spending, such as to form the major components o f the MTEF for 2007-2009.
The general consensus i s that the PRSC contains a good package o f programs for supporting
implementation o f the Benin PRSP and cannot easily take on any new sectors without scaling back on
current components. Government counterparts, namely CNDLP, may need some capacity reinforcement
inorder to systematically handle eventhe existingrange ofPRSC sectors.

LESSONS    LEARNED

38.      PRSC-3 will be based on the foundations laid in2004/05 and the progress made in implementing
the PRSP. The new operation will also be based on these lessons learned:

     0   Economic growth suffers from the country's vulnerability to shocks, such as fluctuations inworld
         cotton prices and trade restrictions in Nigeria. The Bank program in Benin should include
         structural measures to reduce this economic vulnerability.

     0   Instability in the level o f aggregate public spending works to weaken the effectiveness o f the
         MTEF at the core o f the PRSC. For some ministries, lack o f resources is the chief obstacle
         constraining better outcomes in particular for the launching o f program budgeting which
         coincides unfortunately with the recent episode o f budget cuts.      Macroeconomic reforms to
         improve budget stability are thus essential for all sector programs.

     0   Monitoring and evaluation have been a weak aspect o f program implementation. Government
        needs to do much more to produce relevant information on time and use this information to guide
        program and budget management.

     0   Other donors are key players in several sectors, through both direct investment and budget
         support, and their contributions provide vital inputs and capacity building to the respective
        programs. Thus progress under the PRSC depends in important ways on these complementary
         activities, which also allow us to economize on our own scope o f action.

        The PRSC also benefits from collaboration with Bank investment projects, such as the CDD and
        urban projects, which provide important complements to administrative and budget reforms
         aimed at decentralization and included in the PRSC. In particular, they support key capacity




                                                      10

         building activities at the local level and help to establish the fiscal architecture that channels
         central budget resources to local officials.

     0   The coordination o f donors around a common matrix o f measures supported by the PRSC is an
         important accomplishment and an important means o f efficient management o f reform programs
         and donor relations. This donor harmonizationshould be pursuedinthe new areas o f emphasis o f
         private sector development, civil service reform and fiscal decentralization.

     0   The processing o f PRSC-2 bore the cost o f taking on three new sectors, not all o f which were
         ready. Nevertheless, having absorbed this cost, there i s a high value to maintaining the dynamic
         o f these reforms, even at their early stages, because o f significant complementarities with other
         sector programs, and inthe interest o f easing harmonization with other donors.


        5. OVERALL PROGRESS OF REFORMSINCE PRSC-2

39.      Benin's progress in achieving PRSP objectives has been largely satisfactory over the last 12-18
months. Implementation continues to be strong in public expenditure management and service delivery
while a new focus and coordination have been brought to policies for raising economic growth.
Achievements under the three PRSP pillars are presented inthe sections below.

40.      Inthe election-shortened period since PRSC2 measures were completed, Beninhas continued to
make steady progress on prior actions for PRSC3. The work o f the recent multi-donors mission
established that most o f these measures are completed or on track, although the implementation o f many
measures was delayed due to budget disruptions early in the year.            Delays have also affected the
implementation o f procurement reforms and the development o f the new rural transport strategy. On
procurement, the reform process i s usefully delayed in order to take into account an UEMOA-wide
initiative on harmonization o f procurement regulations. Annex 2 presents a detailed list o f measures and
prior actions and an account o f their implementation. Table 3 lists the PRSC-3 prior actions as presented
inthe PRSC-2Board document, together withthe currently agreedprior actions andtheir implementation
status.

41.      One notable slippage concerns the sale o f SONAPRA assets, which, because it was a CAS
trigger, was made a PRSC prior action recently. After technical work was done, the privatization could
not be completed due to political resistance by the previous Government.             The shift o f the new
Government toward a full enforcement of the regulatory framework along with a demonstrated
commitment to a greater transparency in the sector, led the team to favor giving the new authorities the
time and support to proceed with the new approach for privatizing SONAPRA. Since June 2006,
Government has been meeting regularly with the bidders o f the previous privatization process. These
meetings have produced a protocol that both documents the termination o f the previous process and
outlines the new process.      This proposed protocol is currently being discussed with SONAPRA
employees.

                 5.1     PILLAR I:ACCELERATE         SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC          GROWTH

42.      Macroeconomic stability has been maintainedconsistently over the last several years. As a result
o f external shocks, real economic growth dipped to 3 percent in2004 and 2005 but i s expected to rebound
to 4.5 percent in2006.

5.1.1 UtilitiesandInvestmentClimate

43.      New regulatory texts have been drafted for electricity and telecoms, but the respective regulatory
bodies have not yet been set up. The technical work needed to organize the concession biddingprocess
for SBEE has been completed; however, the actual bidding was delayed until after the elections. On
telecom, Government i s now finalizing the selection o f a firm to advise them on the implementation o f the
new regulatory regime. At the port, customs functions have been computerized, and a new central
clearance window now handles transactions for the various port services and for customs duties. A report
on port clearance times has been completed and an action plan to reduce these delays has been validated.
Government has held a series o f conferences to evaluate recommendations from a variety o f diagnostic
studies on the business climate and has drafted and validated a Letter of Policy for private sector
development.

44.      The government has taken the initiative on land market reform (e.g. pilot programs to convert
living rights into property rights); some key operations in the port have been subcontracted to the private
sector with positive outcomes interms o f service levels to end users; there i s now an active private/public
cooperation in sorting out issues around the certification o f agricultural products (following the self
imposed ban on shrimp exports to the EU); and active discussions are underway with Nigeria to resolve
trade issues. Progress on these should nevertheless be much more rapid while reforms in the other key

45.      Budget preparation and execution. For the 2005 exercise, MAEP submitted a budget based on
five core programs (agricultural productivity and outcomes, agricultural equipments, market access, and
sector management), which was later subject to a cut, as were other sectors. The cut was less severe for
sectors in the PRSC, and agriculture was able to maintain a 2005 budget roughly o f the same order o f
magnitude as for the previous year. However, given budget uncertainties, national budget for investment
was not available during the first half of 2005. This portion o f the budget remained well below MAEP
original budget demand thereafter, leading to low disbursement level to date. Even MAEP's revisited
activity plan for the second half o f 2005 could not significantly be implemented in light o f budget
constraints. Hence (for other reasons as well, see cotton), overall progress under PRSC-2 has remained
below what could be expected from a PRSC priority sector.

46.      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Following the shortcomings highlighted by the 2005 M&E
readiness assessment, MAEP began drafting on a participatory basis, a results-based M&E framework, in
collaboration with the Bank and other donors. The overall responsibility for all sectoral M&E activities
has been allocated to MAEP's Direction de la Programmation et de la Prospective (DPP) who has now
developed a road map for implementation. A key step in implementingthis road map has been the recent
creation o f the new M&E unit at MAEP, and o f an M&E focal point in each of the CERPA (decentralized
structures o f MAEP). The creation o f this M&E unit triggered the launch o f a DPP-led capacity
enhancement project on setting up a results-base M&E system for agriculture, financed through an
InstitutionalDevelopment Fund(IDF) grant.

47.      Agricultural services. Implementation o f the planned activities for 2005 has been slow. Planned
activities included: i)study on agricultural advisory services analysis; ii)personnel audit o f advisory
services; iii)elaboration o f a manual for the contracting o f agricultural advisory services; iv) development
o f a M&E manual for advisory services; v) development o f advisory tools for farm management; vi)
elaboration o f a new national strategy for agricultural advisory services; and vii) recruitment of new
extension agents.    However, due to the budget constraints, progress has been slow. The study on



                                                      12

agricultural advisory services analysis has so far been completed. In this context, MAEP organized a
national validation workshop, with key stakeholders to agriculture, where the preliminary study was
presented and discussed. MAEP i s expected to have a draft for the national agricultural advisory services
strategy ready by November. Furthermore, on the recruitment, M A E P (DICAV) through AIC (cotton) has
added over 320 extension agents to provide advisory services primarily (though not exclusively) to cotton
farming households.

48.      Cotton sub-sector. Under the PRSC-2 cotton sector reforms, one key measure was implemented:
the adoption o f a presidential decree establishing a new regulatory framework for the sub-sector, to be
applied by the 2005-2006 campaign, and which would foster competition and would be accepted by (and
complied with) all sector actors, including government. While this i s a key step inbuildingthe foundation
for a well functioning, better performing cotton supply chain, much depends on its adherence by all
actors, and on enforcement by the Government. Inparticular, the sustainability o f such a framework will
very much depend on the authorities' willingness to apply sanctions to those attempting to operate outside
the regulatory framework.

49.      Progress has been slow with respect to the privatization o f the 10 ginneries (4 lots) o f the
SONAPRA. The privatization process, which was initially supposed to be completed by October 2005,
met with some difficulties, which led the Government, on March 15, 2006, to cancel the auction sale o f
SONAPRA's industrial assets. Another option for state divestment, by agreement with sector
stakeholders, has been selected. Implementation o f the procedure called for under the new option should
be completed by M a y 31, 2007. The Bank i s ready to discuss any solution that would consolidate the
reform and improve Benin's competitiveness in the sector. Moreover, the new government has taken
very seriously the cotton sector situation and has decided to make every effort to increase the production,
to enforce the regulatory framework, and reestablish the confidence amongst the actors. Three new
presidential decrees have recently been issued to reorganize the different professional families involved in
the sector and restore the discipline inthefili8re.

50.      In 2005, AIC conducted two studies for the cotton sector. The first assessed the supply and
marketing arrangements for cotton inputs; the study was completed and its recommendations would be
taken into account for the 2007-08 campaign. The second looked at the opportunities and constraints for
developing a sustainable stabilization fund for cotton. This study was launched with the support o f French
financial support.

51.      Finally, the cottonJiliBre actors and government representatives held a number of'consultations
and meetings with regards to the need for addressing the fragmentation o f the cotton producer
organizations (PO), which threatens to weaken the upstream segments o f the supply chain, as well as the
break out amongst the ginners and input distributors. The consultations led to consensus proposals which
were submitted to MAEP and M I C for final approval by the MinistryCouncil. These proposals laid down
the eligibility and representation criteria for the 9 PO currently existing to be recognized at the national
level, as well as for the different ginners and input distributors associations. The consolidationo f OP into
a more reasonable number must precede the review o f the regulations regarding the Inter-professional
Association o f the cotton sector AIC, and the revision o f CAGIA and CSPR articles o f association in
consultation with all sub-sector shareholders. T o implement this measure the new government has just
issued three new presidential decrees to reorganize the different professional families involved in the
sector and restore the discipline in thefiliere. AIC i s actively working to revise accordingly required
articles to fit this new framework. The revision i s expected to be completed by September 2006.

52.      Theforestry sub-sector. Three years into the PRSC, few results have been obtained in the reform
process o f the forestry sub-sector as a result o f a 67 percent cut in the 2004 budget and the delay o f 2005
investment funds. Most progress has been achieved so far inrevitalizing the forestry administration, with



                                                       13

the recruiting o f 145 agents in the last two years, To date, a total o f 405 forestry agents had been
recruited. On the ONAB privatization, the winning (and sole) bidder has been identified and financial
terms o f the offer have been negotiated. The social plan for retrenched staff has been finalized and
adopted by the Government. Concerning the ratification o f a law on forestry products, a draft has been
prepared and communicated to the Council o f Ministers. Also, to strengthen the capacity o f the M&E
unit inthe forestry administration, the adequate staff has beenrecruited. Finally, the study on whether or
not to lift the ban on teak export has been launched and the draft report i s available. The comments
collection i s underway.

5.1.3    RuralTransport

53.      The Government has continued to pragmatically improve its interventions in the rural transport.
The Strategy Note adopted in December 2004 was used as the reference for the 2006 budget. In the
meantime, the ongoing studies have been completed and led to the adoption o f a new full Rural Transport
Strategy (RTS) by the Council o f Ministers in April 2006. Data available on the 2005 rural roads
rehabilitation program show that the execution has been slow due to delay inprocurement procedures and
problems related to timely availability o f funds. The new authorities have taken actions to accelerate the
implementation o f these pilot programs. It i s expected that these 250 km o f feeder roads would be
completed by end November 2006 along with an effective launching o f the additional rehabilitation
program planned under the 2006 Budget. However, the revision o f the institutional framework for feeder
road management and the preparation o f new regulation have been delayed due to the slippage observed
inthe completion ofthe (RTS) study.

                           5.2      PILLAR11:IMPROVING       SERVICE DELIVERY

5.2.1    Rural Water

54.      The Government has continued to make significant progress inincreasing access to potable water
to the rural population from 35 percent in 2002 to 41 percent in 2005. Since 2001, the sector execution
capacity has more than doubled. For the first time ever, Benin constructed in 2004 more than 1,200 water
points against an average o f 550 over the last twenty years. Water facilities functionality rate has also
improved from 75 percent in 2002 to 85 percent in2005. The execution o f the 2005 program has resulted
in the construction o f 900 new water points providing access to potable water for 225,000 additional
persons.

55.      Progress has been made in implementing other core policy measures and actions. . Concerning
the development o f local publidprivate partnership for water system management insecondary towns, the
Ministry in charge of Water has started, as scheduled, the implementation of an action plan which will
lead to the realization o f at least 10 PPP management contracts in2006. Sector monitoring and evaluation
has improved through better reporting system and successful annual sector reviews which provide all
stakeholders detailed information on physical and financial aspects o f the program. In September 2005,
the Water resource management task force drafted a Water national policy paper, a decree for creating
and organizing the WRM technical committee and an action plan. It i s expected that theses documents
will be approved by the Government before the end o f 2006 and that the implementation o f the WRM
activities will start by 2007.

5.2.2    Health Sector

56.      Beninhas made progress inimproving health indicators over the past years. Geographical access
to health services i s high (86%), and availability o f essential drugs has been maintained at close to 90%




                                                      14

over the past decade due to the good performance o f the CAME'. However, the progress in some areas
has been mixed since 2003. The utilization rate o f basic health services by the population has increased
from 36% in 2003 to 39% in 2004, but has slightly decreased to 37 % in 2005. The proportion o f
attended deliveries has stagnated between 2004 and 2005 with 76 % during the two years. On the
contrary, the immunization coverage (DTCP3 to children at their first birthday) has reached 87% in 2004
and 94% in 2005. The Ministry o f Health has attempted to give some explanation to the downwards
trends, including mythology aspects, but i s still working to better understand and clarify these figures.
The policy dialogue continued in strategic budgeting and planning, and the development and
implementation o f results-oriented MTEF. The Minister has indicatedthat hygiene and sanitation, critical
to reaping the full healthbenefits o f improved water supplies, will be accorded its own sub-program inthe
next program budget. The DRH3has elaborated the action plan concerning the human resource policy
adopted in May 2004; this action plan i s under validation. A comprehensive health service package has
been disseminated countrywide and i s under implementation. The mechanism aimed at promoting the
financial access o f the poor to good health services has been adopted through a joint administrative text
(arrete) signed by the ministers in charge o f Finance and Health and i s under implementation at health
district level as well as CHD level. A report on the implementation o f this pilot program over the past six
months, including recommendations to improve the mechanism, has been prepared by the Ministry o f
Health and validated by representatives o f the health sector stakeholders.

57.       The performance report for 2004 indicates a budget execution rate o f 82.69 per cent, while
available data show that the execution rate o f 2005 program has been 90.5 percent (excluding externally
funded investments). Health service provision and financing remain inequitable as there i s a large gap
between the rich and the poor in terms o f access to quality health services. Poor progress was made in
strengthening the partnership betweenpublic and private sectors.

58.       Implementation o f three reform measures have been delayed for diverse reasons, including the
budget cuts, unavailability o f funds, and the lack o f sustained leadership and strong political commitment
in conducting critical reforms. These are (i) adoption of the legal framework governing contracts in
                                                   the
the health sector; (ii) delay in the implementation o f the Human Resource related reform especially
                         the
the establishment o f an incentive mechanism for personnel serving inremote areas and (iii)     the execution
o f the program o f construction inthe remote areas.

5.2.3     EducationSector

59.       The Government has sustained its efforts in increasing access to education at all levels, with a
priority to the access and retention o f a majority o f the population to basic education. To this end, the
public expenditures on education have increased over time and represented22.5 percent o f Government's
spending in 2005. Gross enrollment rate inprimary education has increased from 94% in 2002/03 to 96%
in 2003/04 while the completion rate has slightly risen from 49% to 50% during the same period.
Preliminary figures available on the 2004/05 school year indicate that the gross access ratio to the first
grade has stagnated around 99 percent while the internal efficiency has greatly improved (the repetition
rate has fallen from 23 percent to 15 percent). As a result, the gross enrollment ratio seems to have fallen
(94 percent) whereas the completion ratio has reached 54 percent, exceeding the set target o f 51 percent.
Progress inreducing gender and geographic disparity as well as in improving learning achievements has
been modest and remains key challenges

60.       Government has continued to implement the action plan adopted in 2003 to improve the
implementation o f educational reforms as well as schooling retention. This includes progress on in-
service training to teachers and principals and on streamlining the curriculum along with the teacher

guides in grades 1 to 4 during the 2004-2005 school year. Textbooks purchased under 2004 budget
(about 500,000) have been successfully distributedto schools by the private sector and the procurement of
additional textbooks under 2005 Budget has led to almost a doubling o f the ratio o f availability o f
textbook per student for the main subjects, which reached 0.73 during the school year 2004/05. Tailored
sensitization activities have been carried out to explain to teachers and students the measures taken to
reducing repetition in the first two grades. Implementation o f core activities to reducing school
discontinuity has been slow due partly to difficulties experienced with the budget execution procedures in
2005. The construction o f twenty (out o f the twenty-five) targeted block o f three classrooms has been
completed, and the implementation o f the pilot-program for multi-grade teaching has been fairly well
implementedduringthe 2005/06 school year.

61.     Implementation o f programs out-sourced to NGOs to promote girl's education in targeted
nineteen sub-districts has improved over time. But, there i s a need to enhance the selection o f the NGOs
as well as the monitoring activities. It was agreed that a preliminary evaluation o f this pilot-program will
be carried out with the view to provide recommendations for strengthening its implementation and
possible expansion in 2006/07.

62.     The recruitment o f 1000 and 76 contractual teachers for primary and secondary education
respectively through a decentralized process has been completed. Effects o f these additional human
resources inthe system accounted for the 2005/2006 school year because the process was only completed
in June 2005. Budgetary allocations for 2004 and 2005 have been transferred to the decentralized and
school levels and served, among others, to pay the salaries o f about 5000 community teachers in the
system, contributing to lower schooling costs to poor families.

63.     Significant progress was made by the Government in putting together the integrated sectoral
strategy and ten-year program, even though the endorsement o f the program by the donor community has
slipped and will take place by September 2006. An integrated sectoral policy framework has been
developed and approved by the Council o f the Ministers in April 2005. However, the officials need to
ensure a greater leadership to developing and implementing a cost-effective and ambitious literacy
program. It has lagged behind expectations due the actual institutional settings (literacy being handledby
the ministryo f tourism and culture)

                                                            AND

5.3.1   Public Expenditure Management Reforms

64.     In 2001 Benin embarked on a number of reforms to improve public expenditure management.
The objectives were to raise the efficiency and transparency o f public spending and to improve the quality
and poverty-focus o f public service delivery.       The reforms included developing a medium term
expenditure framework defining sectoral program budgets with specific monitorable objectives. The
reforms also intended to shift spending authority and responsibility from central to line ministries, and
gradually to decentralized levels o f government while maintaining fiduciary standards.

65.     Benin continues to implement these reforms, developing the latest MTEF for 2006-2008. The
2006 budget law adopted by Parliament i s in line with MTEF ceilings and PRSP priorities. Program
budgets are now produced for 17 sectors, and details from 7 are integrated into the annual budget
submitted to parliament. Performance-based contracts between the Minister o f Finance and the ministers
responsible for designated sub-programs for 2005-2007 have been signed. The 2006 budget has been
prepared in terms o f program authorizations and payment appropriations, which is an encouraging step to
follow-up multi-year contracts. Sectoral performance reports are produced regularly, although the quality
of monitoring indicators needs to be improved over time, and the management tools for responding to



                                                     16

monitoring outcomes need to be established through a variety o f civil service reforms and capacity
building. Government has adopted a performance-based public expenditure management reform plan
based on the 2005 CFAA and ETARE3's performance evaluation. Progress has been made in budget
execution reporting and transparency, and inreducing fiduciary risk, although there are some weaknesses,
as noted below.

66.      Budget execution and accounting SIGFIP, the budget execution software has now been extended
to all ministries.   ASTER, the related accounting software has also been installed and the interface
between the two software programs has been implemented. The budget execution system has been
extended to the Department level with the installation o f SIGFP in all departments. The SIGFIP budget
system has also been adapted to allow comprehensive coverage o f donor-financed expenditure. The
Government i s now trying to ensure that it collects information on external resources in a systematic way
so that the budget system will be more exhaustive. Government i s also undertaking an audit o f the
SIGFIP system to identify any gaps in coverage.

67.      In early 2005, Government adopted a series of decrees and measures to reduce the amount of
spending executed under special procedures (OPs). As o f September 2005, these efforts appear to have
succeeded inreducing the amount o f OPs for budgeted expenditures to CFA 16 billion from a total o f 39
billion in 2004. However, from October 2005 to March 2006 OPs for budgeted as well as unbudgeted
spending have increased significantly in the context o f end o f regime and presidential elections. The OP
procedure poses highrisks o f overrunning budget authorization ceilings and lacks the appropriate control
over the use o f public funds. Moreover, the unbudgeted spending from 2004 to 2006 amount to $70
billion that have a negative impact on the deficit. The new Government has taken very seriously the issue
o f OP and has committed to drastically reduce the use o f exceptional measures, demonstrably with a good
degree of success thus far. InJuly 2006, the Bank conducted an audit o f the OPs to have an independent
assessment o f their impact, which should help to build an agreement with the new Government on an
action plan.

68.      Steady progress has been made on the internal control system. A steering committee has been set
up to direct the reform, and, after consultation with stakeholders, decrees have been drafted both for
creating internal control units within the line ministries and for defining professional norms and
standards. These decrees have been signed by the Minister o f Finance and have now been adopted by the
Cabinet. The General Inspectorate for Finance notes that the operation o f SIGFIP has significantly aided
the progress o f internal control. Nevertheless, the establishment o f systematic internal control i s at risk o f
being fractured among different agencies, and the size and complexity o f the reform requires a great deal
o f technical assistance.

69.      The processing o f external audits has experienced lengthy delays due to lack o f capacity and
resources at the Chamber o f Accounts. The audit for 2001 has been completed and will be submitted by
the Supreme Court to the Parliament by mid2006. The performance report audits for 2002 and 2003 have
been completed, although, by agreement with Government, the national budget audits will need to take
priority over performance reports until the former are brought up to date. The Chamber o f Accounts has
prepared a strategic recruitment plan to expand its human resources in order to recover from these delays,
and the Supreme Court has endorsed this plan.

70.      Public procurement. Since the new procurement law was passed in 2004, the Government has
worked to set up the institutional mechanisms for implementing the law. The National Regulatory
Agency for Procurement (CNRMP) and the National Executing Agency for Public Procurement (DNMP)
have been established and the Permanent Secretary for the CNRMP has been hired, and the agencies are
now functioning. A dispute settlement process has been set up and has begun handling procurement
complaints. A numeric evaluation o f the current system i s underway and should identify the biggest
points o f delay in the procurement process. With the recent introduction o f new procedures, the average


                                                     17

period requiredfor public acquisitions has risen to 113 days, above the target level o f 57 days. Further
training and experience with the new procedures and the full functioning o f new institutions should bring
down the number o f days required.

5.3.2    JusticeandCorruption

71.      The Ministry o f Justice has adopted its implementation plan for the 2006-2008 program..
However, the implementation by the M O J o f the activities to be carried out under the 2005 plan and the
beginning o f the 2006 has been slow. In order to ensure that such activities would be implementedby the
end o f the year 2005, the M O J at mid-year prepared and implemented with partial success, an emergency
plan to mobilize the responsible M O J departments to catch up with the accumulated delays.

72.      Inparticular, delays have accumulated over 2005 with respectto the yearly requirement ofhiring
the requisite number o f newjudges and clerks. This condition was met inearly 2005 and Government was
to hire such same requisite number o fjudges and clerks in early 2006 by organizing the selection exams
for late 2005. Due to, inter alia, a disagreement among ministries regarding the organization o f the
recruitment exams, such exams were delayed to end o f June 2006. In addition, it was identified that the
new judges and clerks that had been hired in early 2005 had not in fact started their initial professional
training until April 2006, due to various procedural and financial obstacles. Such obstacles having now
been identified, a yearly recruitment and training policy should now be attainable.

73.      Progress has been made, however, to define and to monitor the core performance indicators for
the Justice sector, including the monitoring o f the proportion o f cases disposed out o f the cases in stock,
thereby permitting the Ministryto better identify the needs and progresses of the Justice sector.

74.      On corruption, after successfully completing the diagnostic survey at the household level, the
schedule for continuation o f the survey at the firm-level became mired in the election-year calendar and
could not be completed. However, the new Government has strongly endorsed the survey process and
scheduled a launching seminar for the continuation o f the survey and to demonstrate the broad ownership
o f the process by the Government.

5.3.3    Civil Service andDecentralization

75.      Background documentations to prepare the new civil service statute have been prepared by three
working groups, including Unions representatives, set up in 2004. The MFPTRA has hired technical
assistance to prepare the draft statute. It will be crucial for the text to be specific on the career and the
performance based management system, rather than leaving development o f these critical issues to later
decrees.    Regarding the sustainable recruitment strategy, a roadmap has been drafted for producing the
strategy, and the possibility for using and extending the FUR system for tracking personnel and
forecasting recruitment needs, were reviewed by an international consultant and should be budgeted for.
The results o f the evaluation o f the delegation o f personnel management to the three pilot ministries was
assessed, and the globally positive evaluation will be used to draw a roadmap to consolidate and expand
the experience.    The institutional framework for the integration, coordination and monitoring o f the
administrative reforms (CNRA, CCRA) has been implemented, and all cells within line ministries have
now been put inplace.

76.      Remarkable progress has been made in establishing a directory o f job descriptions and
recruitments conditions for highlevel technical positions that will allow to process future recruitments on
a strong technical basis. The use o f this instrument for all new recruitments i s proposed as the PRSC-4
trigger.




                                                       18

    77.      On decentralization, we note that virtually all o f the 77 communes have communal development
    plans as part o f their role in implementing the PRSP. Organizational audits o f the communes are in
    progress and organizational charts are approved for 60 percent o f communes and progressively
    implemented, while training for local officials continues.                   The regulatory framework for the
    decentralization reform has been established with 10 new decrees adopted by the cabinet, and a further
    decree establishing communal development funds has been discussed jointly with donors: Nevertheless,
    decentralization i s a complex reform requiring greater cooperation across. ministries than has been
    achieved so far, especially if fiduciary standard are to be maintained while further decentralizing budget
    resources.      The staff o f the Ministry in charge o f decentralization has prepared a draft overall
    decentralization strategy - including measures for the deconcentrated and decentralized levels, but this
    plan needs to be accompanied by a clear operationalization framework.

             6. THE PROPOSEDPRSC-3 REFORMPROGRAM

                  6.1     PILLAR 1:ACCELERATE            SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH

6.1.1    Infrastructure Services

78.      Backgroundand Key Issues. What emerges from analytical work such as the Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study and the Investment Climate Assessment i s that improvements in infrastructure services
are essential for private sector growth. Infrastructure reforms are largely pursued through other projects
(Bank energy sector and PSD credits, M C C grant), and this agenda i s also included in Benin's PRGF
program with the IMF. Nevertheless, the PRSC supports certain policy and regulatory measures
instrumental to these structural reforms.

79.      Energy: The objective o f the overall Bank strategy i s to mobilize public and private capabilities
and financing to achieve improvements in the technical and financial management o f the energy utility,
and o f the sector at large. A new regulatory code has been drafted, but not yet voted by Parliament, and
thus the attributes o f the regulator for the restructured sector have not been adopted. After many delays,
Government has proposed a new calendar for the following steps: (i)       adopted by end o f October 2006 o f
the government's disengagement strategy from SBEE, which i s being prepared with technical assistance
from the World Bank; (ii)launching o f an international call for bids for a strategic partner before end-
June 2007; and (iii)   selection o f the strategic partner by early 2007.

80.      Telecom: The government's disengagement strategy i s to be adopted by end-October 2006, with
a view to bringing Benin Telecoms to the point o f sale during the first quarter o f 2007, depending on the
extent o f the preparation o f acceptable financial statements. Regulatory texts and authorization to set up a
regulatory body have been established, but Government i s still selecting an international firm to advise
them on how to implement the regulatory framework, including the authority, jurisdiction and
competencies o f the new regulator. The final selection o f the advisor took place in April 2006, and the
staffing o f the regulatory agency should follow soon after.

81,      Port: Through a number o f studies, including the DTIS and dedicated studies o f port operations,
the critical role o f the port in Benin's economy has been established and extensive plans for improving
port operations have been developed and validated. Investment in improved port operations i s the largest
component o f the $300 million M C C grant to Benin. These investments should allow for private
participation inthe management o f the port.

82.      PRSC-3 Focus. The PRSC will maintain its surveillance o f progress in infrastructure reform
while focusing on the adoption o f strategies for private participation in infrastructure and the
implementation o fregulatory codes that enable that participation.

6.1.2    Private Sector-led Growth

83. Background and Key Issues. One o f the main factors restricting poverty reduction in Benin i s the
fact that private investment has remained at the sluggish level o f 11percent o f GDP, and that the limited

Benin i s among the lowest in the world). FDI i s also low - US$50 million a year (less than 2 percent o f
investment translates into low productivity (the I C A study has shown that firm-level productivity in

GDP) on average and bank credit to the private sector o f less than 12 percent of GDP i s among the lowest
in Africa.    This largely explains why GDP per capita growth remains stuck at around 2 percent per
annum, which i s insufficient to significantly reduce poverty.




                                                         21

84.      Hence, it was decided to make private sector investment and growth one o f the two critical new
cross-cutting themes in the PRSC-3 (the other being Public Sector Reform which i s also necessary to
enable private sector led growth). All the other elements o f the PRSC-3 program will also help promote
private sector led growth.- i.e. improving rural access to transport and water will be key to developing the
agro-business industry, improving access to quality health and education services will be important to
improving workers' productivity and strengthening the legal and judicial sector will be fundamental to
improving contract enforcement and investment security.

85.      The first step was to diagnose the key reasons for low private investment and productivity in
Benin. Government undertook this task in 2004 and 2005 with the help o f the donor community and the
World Bank inparticular. We synthesize below the key issues as brought out by these diagnostic studies
- e.g. Investment Climate Assessment, Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, Competitiveness Study,
Sources o f Growth, LandMarket, Doing Business as well as a financial sector review study:

    0    The first key issue i s that doingbusinessin Benin i s a risky proposition. Investors do not feel
         secured because the regulatory frameworks are either inadequate (e.g. land market, government
         certification o f agricultural products for exports, telecom and cotton) and/or uncertain (e.g.
         cotton, electricity and commerce with Nigeria) as well as because the enforcement o f existing
         laws i s at best slow and often subject to undue interferences (corruption was mentioned by 85%
         o f the surveyed formal firms as a key impediment to their growth).

    0    The second key issue is that doing business in Benin is high cost. Financing costs are high
         because o f the highrisk factors mentioned above as well as a number o f financial sector specific
         issues (e.g. deficiencies inthe credit information and asset registry systems). Land costs are high
         because secured and serviced land i s in very short supply. Utility services are either o f poor
         quality and/or highcosts because o f inadequate regulatory frameworks and poor management o f
         utility companies by the government. Poor regulations and governance also result in very high
         administrative costs (Benin ranked 129 out o f the 155 countries surveyed by the cost o f Doing
         Business Team) - this i s particularly the case for the port and customs, taxes, land and business
         registration.
86.      All these issues result from poor regulations and/or management by the government o f a few key
areas which are: the port, customs, trade policies with Nigeria, certification o f agriculture products,
cotton, taxes, land, utilities, financial sector, business registrationand thejudiciary.

87.      Although specific measures on private sector led growth were not formally part o f PRSC-1 and
PRSC-2, the government started making progress on some o f these key issues. The government has taken
the initiative on land market reform (e.g. pilot programs to convert living rights into property rights);
some key operations in the port have been subcontracted to the private sector with positive outcomes in
terms o f service levels to end users; there i s now an active private/public cooperation in sorting out issues
around the certification o f agricultural products (following the imposed ban on shrimp exports to the EU);
and active discussions are underway with Nigeria to resolve trade issues. Progress on these should
nevertheless be much more rapid while reforms in the other key areas are either absent or inadequate
(cotton, customs, taxes, utilities, business registrationand the judiciary).

88.      PRSC-3 Focus. The Government has decided to develop a comprehensive PSD strategy in the
form o f a letter of sectoral policy. As noted above, the strategy will necessarily be multi-sectoral and
involve several ministries including Commerce, Public Works, Transport, Agriculture, Justice and
Finance. The PSD strategy was validated on the 8th o f June 2006 and adopted by the government in
September 2006. The mainstrategic areas are:




                                                        22

89.     Accelerate land market reform: The government should drastically reduce the fee on
registering/transfening land titles (currently 12% o f the property value) so as to encourage land
transactions to be formalized with the critical help/guarantee from notaries. The government should stop
issuing living rights and declare all living rights to be property rights on the land that belong to the State.
The conservation o f land titles has to be digitalized and secured. Detailed surveyed maps have to be
completed followed by a process o f issuing secured titles and enabling the land development by the
private sector - starting with high value areas. Prime government land should be auctioned - starting
with the industrial zones under development. The urban and rural land codes needto be harmonized. The
current system o f simplified property tax (Regime Foncier Urbain) should be further developed and
expanded. More detailed recommendations can be found inthe FIAS land market study o f Benin.

90.      Accelerate judiciary reform: First, it should be noted that land market reforms will help to
alleviate the current burden on the court system by land disputes (70% o f all disputes). As part o f the on-
going ten-year legal and judiciary reform program, the government should explore such initiatives as (a)
recruitment/specialization o f a number of judges on some o f the above mentioned PSD issues; (b)
creation o f specialized chambers in existing courts to deal with these PSD and financial sector issues; (c)
revised arbitration laws and institutions to further facilitate/encourage arbitration; (d) introduction of
transparency and accountability o f court decision (e.g. every decision should be published and argued).
These reforms are discussed inmore detail inthe section on Judiciary reforms below.

91,       Complete port reform and open management of key port activities to private sector to improve
port eficiency: Review zoning laws and infrastructure around the port to facilitate traffic and parking.
Increase the autonomy o f the management structure. Improve docking infrastructure and further dredge
the sea. Complete feasibility study for the new port taking into account increased capacity o f the existing
port following the suggested administrative reforms and targeted investments.

92.      Overhaul customs systems: Make the one stop shop at the port operational. Complete
computerization o f transactions, limit cash payments and discretionary powers, rely on selective and
rigorous inspection procedures, remove blockades on roads and prevent smugglingthrough Togo. More
detailedrecommendations can be found inthe Diagnostic Trade Integration Study.

93.      Undertake comprehensive tax reform: Fiscal policy and administration have been ranked the top
two issues by the formal companies surveyed. More and more taxes are being levied from an increasingly
small number o f formal companies. Moving out o f this vicious circle will require lowering rates and
simplifying tax policies together with reforming the tax administration to increase the tax base. A
technical study to design specific solutions and action plans should be launched immediately.

94.      Reform business registration and licensing: It still takes 8 procedures and 32 days and costs
twice the average annual income to register a business in Benin. The government should reduce these
numbers to the bare minimumwhile lobby among the OHADA to drastically reduce the minimumcapital
requirement. The government should also complete a systematic review o f all its licensing requirements.

95.      Complete reforms of the cotton sector: Privatize SONAPRA's industrial assets. Remove the
administered system o f prices and allocation o f inputs. These reforms are discussed in more detail in the
section on cotton reforms below.

96.      Complete reforms of the utility sector: A new electricity code has to be passed to enable private
investment in the sector and drastic improvement in quality and service levels. New regulations and
enforcement mechanisms are needed in the telecom sector to restructure the public operator, ensure fair
access to its network and prevent unlicensed operators inthe mobile telephone sector.




                                                       23

97.     Develop an action plan to implement the recommendations of the financial sector study: The
main objective o f the recommended actions i s to help increase private sector access to financial services
to improve investment and reduce poverty and include: (i)   improving competition inthe banking sector as
well as access to SME loans; (ii)      improving supervision o f the insurance sector and availability of
insurance products for low-income populations and farmers; (iii)undertaking the restructuring o f the
pension system based on results o f actuarial study; (iv) adopting a national microfinance policy, issuinga
decree for its implementation and improving supervision and sustainability o f the sector. More detailed
recommendations can be found inthe matrix o f the Financial Sector Review Study.

98.     Consolidate the institutions created to support theprivate sector: There are too many institutions
doing too little to help the private sector to become competitive. There are many critical issues which are
industryspecific and which will require an active publidprivate dialogue to resolve. The first critical area
where such cooperation i s needed i s the government certification inagro-business ahead o f new and more
stringent requirements to access the EU market. The second critical area i s the provision o f agricultural
services to farmers in the highpotential crops - this will require in particular more cooperation between
the Ministry o f Agriculture and the Ministry o f Industry. Finally, active investment promotion will be
needed to attract international good practice investors in these new high potential export areas. Such
investors will be essential to help resolve and coordinate the resolution o f policy and infrastructure issues
along these value chains. More detailed recommendations can be found in the Competitiveness and
Sources o f Growth studies.

99.     The PRSC strategy will be to support the development o f Government's Letter of Policy for
private sector development, and thereafter the implementation o f priority components o f the policy, in
conjunction with other projects supported by donors. Thus in the near term, the PSD component of the
PRSC will focus on landmarket reformand institution building,including in support of diversifying
agricultural product lines. Judiciary and cotton sector reforms will be supported by other components o f
the PRSC as well as by a Bank cotton sector project. Customs and tax reform will be taken up jointly
with the macro-economic component o f the PRSC and with the IMF. Port reforms will be supported by
the M C C and the Bank transport sector dialogue. Utility reforms will be pursued by the Bank energy
sector credit, although the PRSC will maintain its surveillance o f progress in utilities and regulatory
reform.

100.    ExpectedResults and/or Outcomes. The key desired outcome from these reforms is to increase
the level o f private investment beyond the current 11 percent o f GDP together with their productivity,
together with a marked increase in foreign direct investments, assuming macro and political stability
continue. Private bank lending should increase with land market and judicial reforms. Exports o f food
processingproducts should also increase.

6.1.3   Agriculture and Forestry

101.    Backgroundand main issues. The agriculture sector in Benin accounts for about 40 percent of
GDP, 90 percent of exports, 15 percent of Government revenue, and 70 percent o f the country's
workforce. However, despite the sector's overwhelming importance from an economic, social and
environmental perspective, its full potential to lead the country's economic growth remains untapped, and
its contribution to poverty reduction uncertain. Indeed, poverty incidence, depth and severity remains
higher in urban that inrural areas, where the majority o f the poor live. To unleash agriculture's potential
to be a driving force behind the country's economic growth, and to reverse trends in rural poverty, the
Ministryof Agriculture, MAEP, recommended that sectoral reforms focus enhancing the overall sector
and public expenditure management on 3 main objectives: enhancing the overall sector and public
expenditure management; improving farmers' access to agricultural services; and accelerating the reform
process for liberalization and privatization inthe cotton sub-sector.



                                                      24

102.    With the entry inthe PRSC, MAEPquickly developed a strong sense o f ownership o f the process
o f budget management by programs.         MAEP activities were initially structured around 64 projects
financed by various sources, presenting huge challenges to sector-wide M&E, and with only lose links to
the national policy. Today, MAEP's activities revolve around five core programs at the center o f the
budget exercise: i)increase in agricultural productivity and output; ii)enhancement o f agricultural
equipment and infrastructure; iii)sustainable management o f natural resources and forests; iv) improved
market access; and v) overall management and administration o f the agricultural sector.

103.    Concerning the cotton sub-sector, there was remarkable resilience in an adverse economic
environment and despite political interference. By the end o f the campaign (2004/2005), the cotton sector
even made progress inthe consolidation o f the reformprocess, bolstered by a bumper harvest o f 425,000
t, an increase o f 27% over the preceding campaign figure. The low euro/dollar parity and a low
international cotton lint price threatened to destabilize the reform process, as government intervention
undermined the price determination process for cotton and inputs agreed among actors under the reforms.
The Government paid a subsidy to farmers o f FCFA43 per kg, or an aggregate o f over 18 billion FCFA.

104.    In the forestry sector, formal timber industry contributes to less than 3 percent of GDP. This
valuable natural capital i s degrading rapidly due to a number o f factors, including unsustainable firewood
and charcoal production practices in the face o f growing demand; uncontrolled bushfires; widespread
encroachment on forests by farmers; over-exploitation o f grazing lands; and perverse incentives and
market distortions in the industry. Progress in implementing the program has been mixed over the past
two years; while the execution o f the expenditure program has suffered from budget cuts, some progress
was noted with regard to the privatization o f the ONAB and the improvement o f the overall institutional
framework.

105.    PRSC-3Focus. The first wave o f sector reforms inagriculture and forestry built on a three year
vision articulated by MAEP, and to be implemented until 2007. This vision i s based on: i)an effective
deconcentration o f MAEP down to the Communes; ii)strengthening o f partnerships among actors in the
field; iii)investments better targeted at contributing to meet PRSP objectives; and iv) a decentralized,
deconcentrated, and transparent management o f the sector.

106.    Inthe short term, the priority for the sector reforms will be to address the unfinishedagenda from
PRSC-2 (see above). Moreover, in continuation o f the efforts undertaken in 2005, PRSC-3 will provide
the opportunity for MAEP showcase their sectoral reforms and better contribute to the strategic
development o f the new PRSP. Specifically, PRSC-3 should allow MAEP to:

    Finalize the privatization o f SONAPRA ginneries and the industrial branches o f ONAB.

    Based on the review o f the 2005-2006 cotton campaign, review and improve where necessary the
    regulatory framework for the cotton supply chain, inparticular the enforcement mechanisms.

    Implement the recommendations from the studies on input marketing and stabilization fund, validated
    byJiliBre s actors and government.

    Carry out recruitment o f field agents for agriculture and forestry, as well as cadres for the M&E unit.

    Adopt a mechanism, in consultation with the Minister o f Finance and Economy, and Treasury, that
    takes into account the need to synchronize investments in agriculture with the seasonality o f the
    sector; in deed, for reforms to translate into results, it i s imperative that budget be made available to
    MAEP for investments to be completed by the start o f the rainy season, i.e. available in the first
    quarter o f the calendar year.



                                                      25

107.     In the area of forestry management, PRSC-3 will continue to focus on strengthening the
institutional capacity and implementing the last audit recommendations on i)participatory management o f
forests and adjacent lands while ensuring a full functionality o f the new organizational chart o f the
DFRN; ii)higher stumpage fees and forestry taxes that reflect the actual value of timber and fuel wood;
iii)aprogressiveimplementationofthestudyonexportofteakwood. Finally,aparticularattentionwill
be given to a smooth transfer o f the production and industrial branches o f ONAB, the wood parastatal, to
the private sector.

108.     Expected Outcomes and Impacts. Implementation o f the reform program is expected, in the
medium and long term, to: (a) increase the income o f producers, particularly the poor; (b) increase access
by the poor and rural population to agricultural consumption products; (c) the established rules for the
cotton sector are respected by all actors and enforced by the State and (d) enhance protection o f the
environment. Duringthe coming years, the Government would define quantitative indicators and buildup
the monitoring and evaluation system. Priority will be given to data collection, and to defining core
performance indicators and baselines.

6.1.4    RuralTransport

 109.    Background and Key Issues. The transport sector is a major employer, contributing directly
about 8 percent o f GDP, while affecting the growth, productivity and competitiveness o f all other sectors.
It also serves to open up untapped productionpotential (rural, inparticular) andreduce poverty by raising
the accessibility o f rural populations to basic economic and social services, and by improving quality,
reliability and safety.

110.     A pilot phase o f a community-based rural transport strategy (RTS) has been tested and will
inform the design o f an updated national RTS. Experience so far indicates that the updated strategy must
address the following issues:

     0   High cost of social intermediation. The costs of community mobilization are high while
         community mobilization and training must be improved.

     0   The cost-sharing arrangement limits accessibility for the poorest. Mobilization of local
         counterpart funding for rural road rehabilitation i s difficult in the poorest areas even if the local
         labor contribution i s taken into account.

     0   Infrastructureis not adjusted to demand. The existing infrastructure strategy only took into
         account four-wheel vehicles. But, to reach the MDGs in terms o f accessibility to rural areas and
         basic and social services, intermediary means o f transport need to be considered. The rural road
         rehabilitation standard must be consistent with the rural transport demand and the optimal means
         o f transport.

     0   Sector management and coordination is weak. Despite the existence o f the National Council
         for Rural Roads that was created to coordinate all rural road programs, some programs continue
         to be planned and executed without NCRR's agreement. Inaddition, the new RTS must take into
         account the decentralization context in Benin as well as the lack o f a monitoring and evaluation
         system.


 111.    PRSC-3 Focus. PRSC-3 will continue to provide support to the Government, in coordination
with main sector donors, in implementing the reforms designed in the newly adopted rural transport
strategy (RTS):




                                                     26

    0    Increasing access of rural communities to basic social services and to production areas.
         PRSC-3 will support implementation o f priority rural roads investment and maintenance program
         building on the 2005 experience in selecting specific rural roads and optimal level of service in
         the poorest and most under-served areas based on clear criteria. The level o f service will be
         consistent with a demand-driven infkastructure service. The 2006 program will be updated once
         the RTS is available;

    0    Improving rural transport sub sector management. Support will be provided: (i) finalize               to
         and implement the new institutional arrangements for managing and financing rural roads in the
         context of decentralization. This new arrangement will: (i)                 replace the former NCRR and its
         regional branches; (ii)to strengthen management capacity o f the central level (Rural Roads
         Directorate- DPR within the Ministry o f Public Works and Transport) and the local communities
         to help them assume their new responsibility in the rural roads network management and works
         coordination. Such support will focus on the elaboration o f guidelines for planning and
         programming;

    0    Assisting the Government to design an action plan for promoting intermediary means for
         rural transportation. PRSC-3 will support the Government to finalize the assessment of
         different rural transportation means and an identification o f intermediary means which could be
         promoted. The support would also help to cany out an action plan for implementing pilot
         operations in selectedrural areas.


112.     Expectedresultsand/or Outcomes.The PRSC will support the Government inimplementing its
Rural Transport Strategy and its priority rural roads investment and maintenance program. This will
include during the three-year program (2006-2008), the improvement o f the general condition o f about
2,600 kmo f rural roads through treatment o f black spots on 1,850 kmand rehabilitation of 750 km, along
with the improvement o f the rural transport sub sector management

6.2.1 RuralAccess to Safe Water

113.     Background and Main Issues.                   Water and sanitation are o f prime importance for the
development o f Benin because o f their role inpreventing disease. Access to improved water supply and
sanitation, accompanied by effective hygiene education, can be effective in improving both health and
productivity, improving the quality o f life and providing increased opportunities for education and
employment, particularly for women and girls.

114.     Benin is on track to reach the MDG for rural water supply, Le. providing 67.5 percent of
the population in 2015.           This means that 6.3 million Beninese living in a rural or semi-urban
environment will gain access to potable water by 2015                  against 2.5 million people in 2004. That new
prospect regarding the MDG's i s the result o f the successful programmatic approach implemented in
partnership with the Bank and other donors build on : (i) sound national strategy for delivering rural
                                                                         a
water and sanitation services; (ii)    a well articulated program budget, recognizedby all stakeholders as the
reference instrument for the strategic and operational planning and monitoring and evaluation o f all sector
activities; (iii)
                highly effective donor coordination, includingjoint annual sector reviews and basket fund
for technical assistance and capacity building and (iv) significant increasing in domestic and external
financing.



 With an average annual growth rate of 3.52 percent (growth rate for the period 1992-2002according to INSAE)the rural
populationwould amount to more than 9.4 million in2015. Information providedby the DH's Cellulede la Banque de Donnkes.


                                                             27

115.     Despite this impressive positivetrend, further development of the ruralwater supply sector
faces some key challenges.These include: (i)     sustain the sector activity growth over the ten years time to
reach the MDG's; (ii)    integrate and support the rural communes and the local private sector to increase
their participation in improving access to water service; (iii)    ensure the sustainability o f the facilities
constructed through efficient cost recovery system; and (iv) start implementing concrete actions in the
area o f water resource management.

116.     PRSC-3.Focus Build on the above positive trend and in close collaboration with other donors,
PRSC-3 will provide support to strengthen the Directorate o f Water program-budget with the objective to:
(i)increase water supply access and equity; (ii)improve sustainability o f the facilities constructed; and
(iii) theimplementationoftheintegratedapproachtowaterresourcesmanagement.
    support

117.     Specifically, it will support news way o f managing and extending piped water supply systems
through both the professionalization o f the management o f the 175 existing rural water supply piped
systems and the implementation of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) in small towns where new water
systems will be constructed in the context o f the "Small Towns Water Initiative" launched by the
Directorate o f Water. That initiative aims at increasing access to potable water for 2 million people living
in 500 small towns (i.e. with a population between 2,000 and 25,000 inhabitants) and to support the
communes in contracting with small-scale private operators the management o f the piped water systems.
Transparent and competitive contracting processes should promote efficient pricing as well as effective
technical and commercial operations. This new approach would be tested in at least 10 localities by the
end o f 2006.

118.     Expected Results and/or Outcomes. Over the course of the PRSCs program period, the
Government expects to accomplishthe following:

    -    At least, access rate to safe water inrural and semi-urban areas has increased from 39 percent in
         2004 to 45 percent in2006 through the construction and rehabilitation o f about 4.000 water points
         between2004 and 2006.

    -     At least 10 small town water systems have been constructed in the framework o f the "Small
         Towns Water Initiative" and are managed through a PPP in2006.

    -    The national framework for the integrated water resource management i s in place by 2006 to
         facilitate the use and the integrated management o f water, land and other related resources in
         order to maximize the social and economic benefits without compromising the sustainability o f
         the critical ecosystems.

6.2.2    ImprovingAccess to Quality Health Services.

 119.    Background and main issues. Benin has made progress in terms of health outcomes even
though the performance o f the sector continues to be mixed. Important progress i s noted in modern
contraceptive use, child and maternal mortalities, the proportion o f attended deliveries, and the
immunization coverage (DTP3) o f children below one year o f age. The country i s doing well with regard
to vaccine independence. In addition, the number o f well-functioning health districts rose from 4 in 2000
to 15 in 2004. A M&E unit has been put inplace within the Directorate o f Planning and Prospective and
MOH has updated the core health statistics to include private sector health center activities. Despite the
recurrent weakness o f capacity, MOH i s one o f the champions with regards to M&E performance. On
decentralization, especially regarding financial management, progress has been made for strengthening
the process o f "cridits diliguis ", as anincreasing share o f the MOHbudgetis decentralized.




                                                     28

120.     Nevertheless, during the joint GoB/Donors sector review held in June 2005, some concerns were
raised including: (i)  the persistent weakness o f capacity within the MOH both at central and decentralized
levels including for procurement issues; (ii)        the persistent weakness o f the M&E mechanism despite the
progress made so far, and unsatisfactory reporting o f donor expenditures on health preventing the
financial management information system to capture donor financing, and (iii)the insufficient
collaboration with and involvement o f the private sector; i.e. progress in the integration o f private
providers inplanning and service delivery i s slow, the private sector remains largely unregulated, thereby
affecting quality o f service, efficient resource use, and contracts to regulate the partnership between the
public and the private sectors are still to be developed.

121.     Inaddition all the reference documents will expire duringthis year (2006) including PSNDSS'
2002-2006, PAG6I12001-2006 and the PRSP 2003-2005. The evaluation o f the PSNDSS 2002-2006 has
been completed in October 2005 and it i s expected that the conclusions will lead to the development o f
the new sector strategy as well as the contribution o f the health sector to the forthcoming PRSP.

122.     PRSC-3 Focus. In close collaboration with other donors, PRSC-3 would strengthen the main
achievements obtained under PRSC-1 and 2. The focus during 2006 would again be on (i)                        human
resources i.e. on the implementation o f incentives ( financial and non financial ), to encourage
deployment o f health personnel to remote and underserved areas; (ii)          improvement o f the management by
implementing the contracting approach i.e. setting contracts between the MOH and hospitals and the
health districts; and the effective implementation o f the mechanism to allow a better financial access of
the poor to quality health services; (iii) effective utilization o f the community relays mainly for the
                                                 the
BCC' activities; (iv) reproductive health and nutrition; (v) hygiene and sanitation in close coordination
with the MMEH', the MEHU' and the municipalities; (vi) partnership between the public and private
sectors which will be strengthened with regard to the development o f the health districts and (vii) priority
programs (Malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS).

 123.    Expected results and/or outcomes. The proposed program under PRSC-3 is expected to
contribute to the overall improvement o f the health outcomes toward the attainment o f the MDGs,
particularly reducing maternal mortality and child mortality These outcomes include: (i)assisted
deliveries will rise from 76 per cent in 2003 to 78 in 2006; (ii)            number o f new visits for utilization o f
health services from 29 percent in 2003 to 39 per cent in 2006; (iii)          percentage o f children with DPT3 at
their first birthday from 80 per cent in 2003 to 108 per cent in 2006 and (iv) public spending on health
increases from 7 per cent o f the total budget in 2003 to 11per cent in2006

6.2.3    ImprovingAccess to Quality Education

 124.    Backgroundand Key Issues. Despite significant progress made inincreasing school enrolment
over the past years, analysis underscores that long term expansion o f the education sector and progress in
improving the quality o f services remain constrained by the following main issues:

    0     The quality and efficiency of the education services is low while disparities remain high.
         Literacy and numeracy achievements remain low, contributing to low schooling demands and
         returns. Repetition and drop-out rates are high, resulting in low retention. While access to first
          grade i s virtually universal, only fifty-four percent o f any age-group completes primary
         education. Closing the gap between geographic areas and between genders remain challenges.

   0    Weaknesses in human resource allocations and management lead to ineffective spending
        and additional pressures in sector financing. Despite recent improvements, teacher-per-school
        allocations remain broadly unbalanced within geographic areas. Student-teacher ratios at the
        district levels varied from 50 to 58 in 2004. Also, the number o f unqualified teachers remains
        high and is concentrated in rural areas, resulting in inequitable learning conditions for rural
        students.

   0    Efficiency and equity of spending have improved but greater accountability and governance
        could bolster outcomes. Diffuse responsibility and lack o f clear accountability lines limit
        efficiency o f spending. Ensuringa timely and adequate availability o f key learning materials at
        the school level remains a challenge.


125.    PRSC-3Focus. PRSC-3 will provide support to the implementation and enhancement o f the on
going core reforms in the education sector focusing on basic education while assiting the Government to
create conditions for a more sustainable and balanced expansion o f the entire sector. The program for
2006-08 will continue to support increased enrollment and completion in basic education. It would also
help to empower communities in school management and to progressively improve accountability and
governance, based on lessons learned and in line with the overall decentralization process.          More
specifically, the focus will continue to be on the following actions:

    0   Increasing access, completion and quality in basic education programs. Continued support
        would be provided to respond to new school demands from the population, and to improve
        retention rates in targeted areas. This will be achieved by increasing effectiveness through the
        implementation o f the two-core action plans adopted in 2003 to improve the implementation o f
        the educational reforms and to improve the retention in schooling. These action plans have
        identified concrete measure to address observed issues in areas such as the curriculum revision,
        teacher training and classroom organization. On the demand side,         targeted programs (school
        meals) have been put in place along with targeted girls' education actions. Inparticular, support
        will be provided to sharpen teacher training and recruitment policy and operational framework
        based on the preliminary results o f the on-going study. Three teacher training centers are
        expected to become operational in 2006 and will enroll about 900 trainees. In collaboration with
        other sector donors (Swiss inparticular), the dialogue will be pursuedwith the new sector leaders
        in2006 so as to possibly lay the ground for the development o fpilot programs to deliver quality
        and cost-effective functional literacy services to poor populations and to women inparticular.

    0   Improving efficiency in delivery and management of basic education services.              Support
        would be provided to help Government reduce schooling costs for households in targeted poor
        areas by giving subsides to pay the salaries o f some 6800 existing community teachers. Efforts to
        improve teacher allocations and deployment will be pursued through the recruitment o f one
        thousand additional contractual teachers in primary education targeting under-allocated
        geographic areas. Inaddition, support will be provided to the deconcentratioddecentralization o f
        personnel management in line with the decision made in 2004 to delegate to the education sector
        ministries the authorities to manage teachers' careers.         The Program will also focus on
        accelerating the empowerment o f community in school management (formalization o f the school
        management committees, implementation o f capacity building activities, fostering information
        and communication activities to increase accountability and governance). The implementation
        and monitoring o f the on-going experience under a BNPP-funded research project on
        decentralization, information and primary education outcomes will be instrumental in this regard.
        Overall, the implementation o f the program-budget should lead to a budget increase o f about 25
        percent o f the Ministry o f Primary and Secondary Education (MEPS) during the 2006-2008
        period.

    0    Assistingimplementationof the strategy towards more balancedand sustainable expansion
         of the entire sector. Support will be provided, in synergy with other donors, to prepare
         implementation o f the newly adopted sector policy framework, with particular attention to the
         planned student flux regulation mechanisms and to strengthening strategic management to ensure
         progress toward PRSP goals through adequate budget allocations and results monitoring.


126.     Expectedresults and/or outcomes. The supported programis expected to help the Government
to improve the sector performance while moving progressively towards the MDGs. This will include; (i)
to increase the primary completion rate from 50 percent in 2003/04 to 57 percent in 2006/07; (ii)          to
reduce the repetition rate from 23 percent in 2003/04 to 14 percent in 2006/07; and (iii)     to decline the
students per teacher ration from 53 in2003/04 to 49 in2006107

6.2.4    EnvironmentalInvestments

127.     Backgroundand mainissues. Environmental policy making and implementationhas started in
Benin only recently. It was not until 1992 that the many Government institutions involved in different
aspects o f environmentalmatters were brought together to form a Department elevated to a cabinet level
institution, the Ministry o f Environment, Housing, and Urban Development (MEHU). The institutional
framework for environmental management was further strengthened in 1995 with the creation o f the
Benin Environmental Agency (ABE), and the adoption o f an overarching environmental framework law
in 1999. The same year, the MEHUwas among the five pilot ministries who embarked on the public
expenditure reformprogram supported by IDA.

128.     The participation o f MEHUinthe public expenditure reformprovided the opportunity to improve
the performance o f its expenditure programs. First, improvement in the strategy and policy framework
was achieved by preparing a National Environmental Management Program (PNGE),, and adopting a
Medium-term Strategic Plan (Plan Stratkgique 2002-2006) in 2001. The preparation o f these strategic
documents mirrored the country's new development challenges and poverty reduction objectives that
emerged from the PRSP preparation process. The Ministry then revisedthe technical briefs o f all its sub-
programs on the basis o f these strategic documents.

129.     Second, the Ministry adopted results-oriented budgeting.      In addition to the preparation and
implementation o f medium-term expenditure programs, the Ministry undertook some daring reforms
aimed to inculcate the culture o f results-oriented public expenditure management, and performance
measurement among its staff and operational units.

130.     The Ministry has put a strong emphasis on the effective functioning o f the monitoring and
evaluation unit (created in all the participating ministries). A M&E system that includes focal points in
sub-programs, supervisors, monitoring reviews (monthly, quarterly, semester) o f annual work plans
(fiscal year deliverables, procurement and disbursement plans), and performance monitoring plans
(include plans for beneficiary assessment).

131.     The Ministry also implemented a number o f performance enhancing administrative and
organizational reforms including: (i)  reducing the number o f technical directorates from five to three, and
(ii)further decentralizingthese directoratesbyaddingmoreregionalunits. Furthermore, theMinistry
adopted a service provision law aimed at contracting out most o f the urban infrastructure investments. A
forum on environmental governance held in 2004 further expanded the contracting framework to cover
other environmental management activities. In December 2005 an urban forum was held and helped
better align the sub-sectoral strategy with the new implementation framework and increasing needs o f the
newly established municipalities. A revised urban development strategy will be completed by the end o f
2006.



                                                     31

 132.    These reforms helped to prioritize the sectoral spending, to increase both the budget execution
 rate (85 percent on average between 2001 and 2004), and to improve the quality o f the services provided
 (as shown in beneficiary assessment surveys). Nonetheless, areas remain where substantial efforts are
 needed in order to maximize the net socio-economic benefits o f environmentalpublic expenditures.

 133.    PRSC-3 Focus.         PRSC-3 will build on the achievements o f the MEHU's budget reform
 programs, while maintaining a strong focus on the environmental and urban strategic investments
 proposed in the PRSP. More specifically, it will continue the financing and implementation o f the
 expenditure programs that were identified in the 2004-2006 medium-term expenditure framework
 (MTEF) o f MEHU. In fact, the macro-fiscal and the treasury difficulties o f 2004 and 2005, and the
 ensuing budget cuts that took place during budget execution delayed the implementation o f priority
 programs that need therefore to be pursued during the 2006 fiscal year. PRSC-3 will support investments
 inthree mainareas ofthe sectoral expenditure program:

     9 Environmentalenforcement andcompliance,
     9 Direct support to highpoverty impactinvestments, and
     >    Results-oriented budgetingthrough capacity building.

.Re-enforced Environmental Management Tools
 134.     Although the Government has established the basic institutional structure (framework law,
 implementation decrees, capacity building in central agencies and in decentralized administration units)
 for environmental management, more work i s needed to develop complementary tools, and to ensure
 compliance with the existing regulations.

 135.     Under PRSC-3, more emphasis will be given to making the public sector, at the major
 infrastructure ministries (ie., public works and transport, industry and commerce, agriculture) comply
 with the same environmental regulations that apply to the private sector.         But, technical capacity
 constraints, as well as budgetary (amount and timing o f appropriations) constraints hamper the efforts in
 this area. Financial and technical accountability mechanisms that would allow the Benin Environmental
 Agency to assist more effectively the line ministries in controlling the adverse environmental and social
 effects o fthe public expenditure programs are beingenvisaged.

 Increased investments in sanitation services in Cotonou and Porto Novo

  136.    Cotonou and Porto-Novo harbor the two-thirds o fthe urban population o f the country and support
 the vibrant service industry that contributes close to 60 percent o f the GDP through the critical role they
 play as regional trade centers (regional importance has increasedmanifold with the persistence o f political
 turmoil in Cote d'Ivoire).    Unsafe environmental conditions, particularly poor sanitation (less than 25
 percent o f the needs for drainage network are covered in both cities), are increasingly hampering the
 productivity o f the urban economy and workforce. Sanitation conditions have improved substantially in
 some parts o f Cotonou and Porto-Novo, but much remains to be done. PRSC-3 will continue these
 priority investments in sanitation inthe two largest cities, and expand them inother cities.

  137.    The Government i s aware o f the huge social, economic and environmental costs associated with
 the lack or poor quality o f environmental services, and their disproportionate impacts on the urban poor
 (cost o f illness, use o f meager household resources for environmental protection, floods, high travel cost
 to work, etc.).     A sanitation master plan of the two cities has been prepared since 1998, and the
 Directorate o f Sanitation and Urban Roads (DAVU) has been implementing priority sanitation activities
 in the last three years.     Since the beginning o f the reforms, on average 70 percent o f the sectoral
 investment budget i s allocated to the urban management sub-program.




                                                      32

Results-oriented public sectoral expenditure reforms

138.    The daring expenditure reforms undertaken by the Ministry o f Environment, Housing, and Urban
Development (MEHU), and the encouraging results o f these reforms are seen by many, (line central
ministries and donors) as the model to follow by other line ministries. It i s o f utmost importance that
these reforms and their results be sustained in order not only to continue to show that result-oriented
budgeting pays and i s feasible, but also yield the long-term benefits o f these reforms. In fact, it i s the
necessity to maintain and safeguard these achievements that constitutes the main motivation for including
the MEHUinthe first PRSC series.

139.    These reforms are however long-term in nature and require sustained and unequivocal
commitment (measured by real resources allocation) to capacity building. At the inception o f the reforms
in 2000, a small capacity building component was added to the overall reform package. The initial
budget allocation allowed the creation o f M&E and procurement cells in MEHU, and the other
participating line ministries.   These cells were staffed with contractual personnel benefiting from a
performance pay schedule. Over the last three years, the resources allocated to these cells have started to
decline, and the payment o f salaries has become problematic.

140.    Expectedresults and outcome. Sectoral ministries (small environmentalcells exist inmost line
ministries) and the Ministry o f Finance and Economy are expected to increase their compliance with the
regulations related to environmental impact assessments. Under the current limited budget environment,
the environmentalAgency will continue to provide assistance to the line ministries that are covered by the
PRSC series. This assistance will cover both the implementation and reporting on the environmental
management measures agreed upon in the program Document. In addition, in the area o f air pollution
control (a) at least 50 percent o f all motor vehicles should comply with emission standards; in the area o f
urban sanitation: (a) 18 km o f urban roads will be rehabilitated; (b) 40 km o f sewerage and drainage
channels are built; and (c) 2 kmo f pavedroads are built.

                           6.3      PILLAR 111:ENSURE      GOODGOVERNANCE

6.3.1 Performance-basedPublicExpenditureManagement

141.    Background and main issues. In 2001, the Government launched a major public expenditure
management reform as a basis for moving towards programmatic lending. The objective o f the reform
remains that o f improving the effectiveness o f public spending in reducing poverty. Reaching that
objective requires an effective coordination among the different entities along the expenditure chain such
that better financial controls and reporting lead to better social service delivery. The reform focuses on
two fundamental changes: (i)   a delegation o f spending authority from the finance ministry to line agencies
and eventually to decentralized levels o f Government within a stronger fiduciary framework; and (ii)       a
move toward performance-based budgeting through well-defined program-budgets formulated within a
medium-term expenditure framework, under which progress would be monitored on the basis o f explicit
quantified indicators.

142.    Based on the 2005 CFAA and other Public Financial Management reviews (including PERs) the
overall fiduciary risk i s substantial. However the PFM reform program and donors' coordination on the
P F M agenda contribute significantly to mitigate risk. Moreover, prior achievements in PFM (accounting
and internal auditing notably) provide momentum for further reforms.

143.     Sectoral ministries now have more responsibility in defining and implementing their priorities.
New program budgets have been developed for four new ministries, and several ministries have
nominated sub-programs to serve as pilot exercises inperformance-based management. The new budget



                                                      33

classificationimproves budget presentation and identification o f expenses related to poverty reduction. In
addition, the treasury can now generate budget execution data according to programs as defined in the
program budgets.

144.    Nevertheless, experience with the MTEF and program budgets so far has revealed several
weaknesses inmaking the system function as intended: These include:

    e   A macroeconomic framework subject to external shocks which contributes to unstable revenue
        forecasts and unstable budget envelopes;

    e   A need for capacity buildinginnewprogrambudget ministries to institutionalizethe new system;

    e   M&Einformation that is producedtoo late for integrationinto the budgetlpolicy cycle
        The need to define the fiscalbudget aspects o f deconcentratioddecentralization plans, including
        the importance o f establishing close proximity o fM&E information for decentralized spending.

145.    Focus of PRSC-3. In accordance with Government's public expenditure management reform
plan, the new elements o f the PRSC program will aim to address these weaknesses. The government's
medium-term agenda includes some PSD and IMF-supported measures to help stabilize the
macroeconomic environment, such as improving the administration and equity o f trade and domestic
taxes and improving the regulatory environment. Inaddition, the public expenditure program will work
to raise the quality o f basic statistics on economic activity and household incomes so as to improve
revenue forecasting as well as basic macro framework buildingand modeling. The program will also aim
to adopt tools for adjusting the MTEF under different macroeconomic circumstances as well as tools
withinsector ministriesto adjust programbudgets under different sectoralbudget envelopes;

146.    To further facilitate monitoring program outcomes, financial control and reporting, the new
operationwill also support measures to:

    e   Produce periodic budget execution reports organized according to the programs in the program
        budgets;

    e   Train sector staff on the program budget monitoring indicators so that they better understand the
        role o f providing M&E and performance monitoring data more promptly;

    e   Increase training for financial controllers and involve them inthe budget preparation process;

        Monitor closely the impact o f recent reforms instituted to reduce spending by exceptional
        procedures;
        Integrate all expenditures under externally financed loans and grants managed by CAA in
         SIGFIP;
        Make the discussion and definition o f relative responsibilities between central and local levels a
        part o f annual sector reviews and an inputto sectoral budget plans;
        Increase the number o f localities that have local budgetldevelopment plans, and ensure that these
        local budgets allocate adequate shares to non-salary spending;
        Ensure that the financial architecture for budget decentralization i s coordinated with local M&E
        o f service delivery and with capacity building supported by the Bank's urban and CDD projects;
        Continue investments in SIGFIP for both central and decentralized budget authorities.




                                                     34

147.     Expected results and outcomes. It i s expected that these measures will help lay the foundation
for results-based management o f PRSP programs and give the civil servants involved a stronger stake in
making the new system work. Financial control and performance audit reports should be producedmore
rapidly, and analysis o f these reports should be feed into the following budget cycle. The 2006 budget
should be in line with 2005-2007 MTEF ceilings and PRSP priorities and the targets set in2005 program-
budgets should be achieved in priority sectors. In 2006 the Government i s expected to better involve
local government, namely prefectures and directeurs dipartementaux, in the budget preparation. More
local governments will develop their own budgets, improve budget allocations and financial reporting,
and receive delegated credits earlier inthe budget year.

6.3.2    BudgetExecutionandAccounting

148.     Background and Key Issues. Spending procedures have been streamlined and computerized (an
integrated computerized expenditure management system, SIGFIP i s in effect since January 2001). The
new budget management system includes: (i)the delegation from the Ministry o f Finance to the line
ministries o f payment order authorization, reporting obligations, and ex-ante financial control; SIGFIP
has been decentralized to pilot ministries which has considerably reduced budget execution delays; and
(ii) integrationofcurrentandinvestmentbudgetsundertheresponsibilityoflineministries. Although
    the
current and investment budgets have been integrated in budget presentation, budget execution i s still
fragmented and budget reporting i s not sufficiently comprehensive, reliable, and timely.                 By
inappropriately removing automated controls of budget allocation in SIGFIP, the control o f budget
ceilings has been reduced. An action plan to reduce payment without prior authorizationand imprest cash
accounts was discussed and agreed with the Government in2004.

 149.    The new accounting software (ASTER) i s now operational and has an interface with SIGFIP
since January 2005. ASTER has allowed consistency between subsidiary accounts and general account
which i s a major progress in the reliability o f financial information compared to 2004. ASTER generates
a trial balance consistent with the TOFE. Donor financed expenditures are captured ex post in SIGFIP by
CAA. In2004, only 40 percent o f these resources were recorded in SIGFIP. This arrangement with CAA
should be considered as transitional, since sectoral ministries should manage all allocated resources
regardless of the source o f funding.

 150.    PRSC-3Focus. After noteworthy efforts to reduce the use of exceptional procedures in2004, in
2005 there has been a considerable increase in the number o f expenditures executed under special
procedures".   This OP procedure has a high risk o f overrunning budget authorization ceilings and
lowering control o f the use o f public funds. A close follow-up o f use o f exceptional procedures will be
maintained in 2006. SIGFIP's automated control o f budget allocation should be reestablished to avoid
spending above the budget's ceilings. Appropriate budget allocation will be needed to regularize prior
payments using exceptional procedures. Donor financed resources (including grants) will be captured in
SIGFIP timely and exhaustively.

 151.    Expected results and outcome. Payments without prior authorization should not represent more
than 12 percent o f total spending in2005. Backlog o f these payments should be budgeted and regularized
before 2006 closing. A minister's order (arrgte' ministe'riel) will be published to regulate the use o f
exceptional procedures. A better cash management system should be put in place including appropriate
software consistent with SIGFIP and suppression o f the prior visa from the Minister o f Finance for
expenses above 10 millions CFA. 2006 budget execution should be more comprehensive by including
domestic and external resources.

6.3.3    FiduciaryFrameworkandPublicProcurement

152.     Backgroundand Key Issues. InJune 2003, the Government established a procurement reform
steering committee comprising representatives from the public and private sectors and civil society. This
committee finalized a detailed three-year action plan for procurement reform to be supported under the
PRSCs. The action plan takes into account the recommendations o f the 1999 CPAR, which were based
on the five pillars o f a soundpublic procurement system.

153.     A new law was adopted by the National Assembly in2004, amending the institutional framework
o f the Procurement Code, and creating and defining the attribute of: (a) the National Regulatory Agency
for Procurement; (b) the National Executing Agency for Public Procurement; and (c) procurement units in
all ministries and eventually inthe regional administrations and local governments. Inaddition, the legal
texts" accompanying the law amending the framework o f the procurement code were adopted by the
Council o f Ministers. The regulatory and executing agencies are now functioning and progress i s being
made inmaking fully functional the ministerial procurement units. Experience thus far indicates the need
for greater emphasis on training and capacity building.

154.     PRSC-3 Focus. Under PRSC-3, the Government will pursue and consolidate implementationo f
the reformprogram initiated in2004. This will include: (a) launch the modernizationof the Procurement
Code and procedures, inline with the recently adopted UEMOA guidelines; (b) develop and implement a
capacity building strategy, and in particular develop training plans for target groups; (c) carry out
technical audits and handle bidders' complaints; (d) adopt measures to reduce corruption in public
procurement, such as strengthening anti-corruption provisions in the Code o f Ethics, defining sanctions,
and implementing measures pertaining to those who commit fraudulent acts; and                                (e) complete a
feasibility study for setting up an integrated management system o f procurement activities while
enhancing public-private partnership.

155.     ExpectedResultsand Outcomes. Implementation o fthe plannedreforms and activities over the
coming years would lead to: (a) improved transparency and effectiveness in procurement and contract
management; and (b) legislation enabling the effective enforcement o f sanctions.

6.3.4    InternalandExternalControls

156.     Background. The internal control system in Benin is based on the French system, wherein a
number o f entities may carry out internal controls. Ex-ante controls were streamlined and decentralized
to line ministries in 2001. The Inspection Gdndrule de Finances (IGF) has been strengthened, with 17
new internal auditors having been appointed and trained in 2000, and two more in 2001-02, while budget
resources for IGF have been increased. However, the internal control function i s poorly coordinated and
has become more fi-agmented with the creation o f new institutions in 2000 at the External Debt
Management Agency, CAA, and the Ministry o f Planning (to monitor projects under the Public
InvestmentProgram).

157.     A steering committee has now been set up to direct the reform, and, after consultation with
stakeholders, decrees have been adopted both for creating internal control units within the line ministries
and for defining professional norms and standards. IGF has become a more professionalized and
recognized internal audit body. IGF i s playing a key role in leading the internal control's reform. In2004
IGF's involvement has improved the control o f exceptional procedures and cash accounts and promoted
accountability. However, sanctions and follow-up o f IGF recommendations remain imperfect, reducing
their potential impact.

"     Decrees relating to: (a) the national regulatory body, CNRMP; (b) establishment of DNMP; and (c) establishment and
     definitionofthe attributionsof the procurement units within the sectoral ministries,publicentities, andmunicipalities.


                                                              36

158.     The General Inspectorate for Finance notes that the operation o f SIGFIP has significantly aided
the progress o f internal control. The recent audit o f the "Ordre de Paiement Tresor" shows that the new
policy o f suppressing OPs has been successful, and the use o f OPs shows a consistent downward trend. In
addition, the Government has recently created "L'Inspection GCnCrale de 1'Etat" to reinforce the internal
control and to improve coordination o f control units. Nevertheless, the establishment o f systematic
internal control i s at risk o f being fractured among different agencies, and the size and complexity o f the
reformrequire a great deal o f technical assistance.

159.     The Chamber o f Accounts continues to produce regular budget executionreports. However, the
processing o f external audits has experienced lengthy delays due to lack o f resources and lack o f
independence inmanaging resources for the Chamber.

PRSC-3 Focus. Under the steering committee, the overall reform of the internal control function will be
pursued. Government has adopted a performance-based public expenditure management reform plan
based on the 2005 CFAA, and will continue to implement that action plan. The Chamber o f Accounts
will redirect its limited resources from performance audit to its primary mission o fjurisdictional control
o f the budget execution. PRSC-3 will focus on increasing the impact o f the Chamber o f Accounts as well
as its autonomy.

160.      Expected Results and Outcomes. The IGF will finalize the internal control reform under the
supervision o f a Steering Committee. The Chamber o f Accounts will be transformed into an autonomous
and professionalized body and gradually catch-up the backlog o f budget execution and municipalities'
audit.

6.3.5     Strengtheningthe Legal andJudicialSector

161.      Background and Key Issues. The GOB has recognized that a strong, effective and efficient
judicial and legal system, with a transparent dispute resolution system, provides a vital contribution to
economic growth. The GOB has, with the Bank's support, prepared a ten-year Integrated Program for the
development and modernization o f Benin's legal andjudiciary systems (named the "Program" hereafter).
The Program has been adopted by the GOB in 2001 and has been acknowledged by the European Union,
French Cooperation and other donors. It focuses on strengthening a number o f areas in the legal and
judiciary system, namely the Ministry o f Justice, Legislation and Human Rights (MOJ), the Courts and
the penitentiary systemand the dissemination and promotion o f human rights.

 162.     The justice system i s performing poorly and its performance can be improved significantly. The
Program will address the most important weaknesses o f the MOJ: the courts, the penitentiary system and
the legal framework. The M O J still has problems executing its budget. The service delivery o f the courts
i s threatened by a dwindling number o f staff and other resources. It will, therefore, be vital to supply the
courts with more magistrates and clerks (who at the same time will have to be trained better), as well as
with necessary equipment. Legislationto improve the status and remuneration o fmagistrates (making the
judiciary more attractive to qualified candidates), has been adopted and implementation has started. Two
groups o f magistrates have been recruited and are undergoing training. Two groups o f clerks have been
recruited, The recruitment o f additional magistrates and clerks i s supposed to take place in October 2006.
As a result, court performance should improve visibly by a much speedier handling o f cases. The lack o f
baseline data makes it difficult to evaluate results o f the Program. Collecting this baseline data has
therefore been a top priority and i s progressing satisfactorily. The new legislation concerning the status
and remuneration o f the magistrates i s a great step forward in improving the judiciary's independence.
However, in the longer term, more reform will be needed to make the judiciary a more independent and
self-governing organization, meeting international standards o f independence and impartiality.




                                                      37

163.      Planned Reforms. The MOJ will prepare an Implementation Plan o f the Program for 2006-08
that would aim to strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency, and accessibility o f the justice system by:
     -    Improving the capacity of MOJ to carry out the reforms by recruiting additional staff and
          providing adequate equipment and in-service training to staff;
     -    Improving service delivery of the courts by rehabilitating existing court buildings and
          constructing new court buildings(such rehabilitations and constructions being financed by the EU
          and the MCC), adopting new regulations applicable to all legal professions, reforming the
          chancellery ("greffe" or court clerk's office) and through better training and equipment for the
          courts, as well as improved initial and in-service training for all legal professions;
     -    Modernizing the penitentiary system by instituting alternative sanctions, improving
          infrastructure o f the prison system and training facilities in prisons, and providing support for
          social integration o f inmates;
     -    M o r e effective legal and human rights protection, particularly o f minorities, women, children,
          and youth, by modernizing the national legal framework, and by building awareness among the
          populationo f their legal and human rights as well as the existence o f the Program.
164.      PRSC-3 Focus. In2006, support will be specifically provided to continue: (a) putting inplace
the prerequisites for reform, including an information system to generate data on the sector's essential
indicators, (b) putting in place a monitoring and evaluation system at MOJ, (c) implementing an in-
service training program (which in particular would cover OHADA legislation) for M O J staff and
magistrates, and (d) providing equipment for M O J and courts. PRSC-3 would also continue to support (a)
the preparation o f modernized regulations applicable to all legal professions, (b) the establishment o f a
Legal and Judiciary Information Center, and (c) the efforts o f NGOs to inform people o f their legal and
human rights.

165.      Expected Results and Outcome. Justice was a new sector in PRSC-2. Baseline and target
values will be derived from information to be obtained as part o f the 2005-2007 Implementation Plan.
The expected results include:

      -   Proper execution o f the programbudget for the MOJ, including improving execution rate o f non-
          salary funds inthe budget from 80 percent in2005 to 85 percent in2006 and 90 percent in2007;
      -   Significant improvement in the yearly disposal rate o f court cases (from more than 40 percent by
          2006 and more than 50 percent by 2007).
166.      The above outcome would be adjusted as needed under subsequent PRSCs as the justice-related
aspects o f the private sector development strategy under the responsibility o f M O J are developed and
implemented.

6.3.6     Deconcentration and Decentralization

 167.     Background and main issues A set o f decentralization laws was adopted in 199912                               . They
create a one-tier local government system throughout the country. The municipalities are given some
autonomy, whilst the role o f de-concentrated government offices at the district (dkpartements) level i s
strengthened.         The local elections which took place in December 2002 launched the actual

'* Law No.  97-028 of January 15, 1999, on the organization of local administration of the Republic o f Benin; Law No. 97-029 o f
January 15, 1999, on the organization o f the municipalities (local governments) inthe Republic of Benin; Law No. 98-005 o f
January 15, 1999, on the organization o f the municipalities with special status; Law No. 98-0006 o f March 9, 1999, on the
electoral system for local governments and municipal councils o f the Republic of Benin; Law No. 98-007 of January 15, 1999 on
the financial system ofthe municipalities inthe Republic of Benin.


                                                                 38

implementation o f the decentralization laws passed by 1999.            The regulatory framework for the
decentralization reform program has been established with 10 new decrees adopted by the cabinet, and
another decree establishing communal development funds has been discussedjointly with donors (as o f
November 2005). Even though municipalities are given important service delivery responsibilities, they
continue to remain accountable to the central government, through the tutelle exerted by the prefet
(including ex-ante budget control).

Responsibilitiestransferredto municipalities:
-  preparation o f local development plans, including master plans, economic and social development
   plans, urbanism, delivery o f buildingpermits and construction monitoring;
-  urban development through planning, building and operation o f public transport infrastructure,
    equipments and services, construction o f hydraulic infrastructure, local telecommunication lines and
   power and infrastructures regulations;
-   water supply and distribution, waste collection and management, drainage system, public health
    safety, cemetery and public areas maintenance;
-   construction, operation and maintenance o f kindergarten and primary schools;
-   construction, operation and maintenance o f public health centers, o f cultural and social promotion
    centers, youth and sports centers, social assistance to the poor within the commune;
-   construction, operation and maintenance o f local markets and slaughterhouses facilities and any
    activity to undertake investment to promote local development, tourism and creation o f industrial
    zones.


 168.   Notwithstanding this legal arsenal, implementation o f the decentralization process and policy has
been slow due to many postponements o f the local elections, the lack o f operational modalities for the
mandated transfers - including financial transfers          - and an unclear implementation institutional
framework. While some progress has been achieved, there are difficulties at the central and
deconcentrated levels. Besides the problem o f lack o f capacity outside the central administration, there
are uncertainties created by the interpretation o f texts and laws on the powers and prerogatives o f the
local public administrations, and a lack o f a clear institutional framework to support implementation. The
core issues are: (i) lack o f an overall organizational framework for implementation and a concrete action
plan, including human resource strengthening activities and budget transfers, (ii)        lack o f cooperation
between key actors (the mayors, the prkfets and the heads o f deconcentrated branch offices), (iii)    lack o f
strategy and agenda inincreasing budget transfers to municipalities and in improving their own revenues;
and (iv) lack o f results-oriented management.

 169.   With the exception o f the three largest municipalities (Cotonou, Parakou and Port0 Novo,
governed by a special statute), most o f the other municipalities and in particular the majority o f small
municipalities in rural areas, have authority over large geographical zones where structural rural poverty
and heavy dependence on agriculture are the main characteristics o f local economies. This puts a
tremendous burden on the already weak capacity o f these municipalities, from a fiscal, human and
technical capacity perspective, especially considering the scope o f the responsibilities transferred to them
by the reform.

 170.   The changes required in the organization o f the public sector are immense, since the transfers o f
responsibilities are very broad in scope and the public administration has functioned for decades in a
centralized manner. To date, the level o f resources transferred has remained low, but this occurs in a
context where concrete modalities o f transfer o f responsibilities are still being designed. InMarch 2004,



                                                       39

a technical ad hoc Committee, chaired by the Ministry o f Plan, was established in order to review, in
collaboration with each Ministry, the competences to be transferred to the Municipalities and to prepare
and facilitate the modalities o f those transfers. To date, the recommendations o f this Committee have not
been translated into a concrete action plan.

171,     Despite these shortcomings inimplementingthe new decentralization framework, there have been
attempts in some sectors to progressively decentralize service delivery. These include budget transfers to
the school level for the purchase o f basic pedagogical inputs andor to recruit teachers locally; increasing
management autonomy o f the health districts; and the empowerment o f communities to manage facilities
inthe social sectors.

172.     Over the past two years, several donors actively provided support to the Government to improve
implementation o f the decentralization process. Two IDA-financed projects (CDD and 2ndDecentralized
City Management) are also providing assistance. Core benchmarks agreed upon with these donors
include: (i)  preparation and adoption by the Government o f a strategic vision and plan to implement the
decentralization and deconcentration process; (ii)the design o f mechanisms for cooperation between
deconcentrated services and Prkfets, on the one hand, and mayors on the other; and (iii)                        the timely
availability o f financial resources to the communes. It i s proposed that the subsequent PRSCs build on
such renewed and well-coordinated efforts and provide support to both the budget and fiscal
decentralization process.

173.     All communes have communal development plans as part o ftheir role inimplementingthe PRSP.
Organizational audits o f the communes are in progress and organizational charts are approved for 60
percent o f communes and progressively implemented, while training for local officials continues. The
regulatory framework for the decentralization reform has been established with 10 new decrees adopted
by the cabinet, and a further decree establishing communal development funds has been discussedjointly
with donors. Nevertheless, major progress remains slow.

174.     Focus of PRSC-3. Decentralization is a new sector in PRSC-3. Studies were carried out to
design: (i)an efficient institutional framework to monitor and implement the reforms, (ii)a fiscal
framework between the central and local governments, (iii)an action plan to decentralize spending
authority from the central government to decentralize offices, and (iv) modalities to improve localities
own revenues.

 175.    Under PRSC-3 it will be critical to continue implementation o f fiscal decentralization to all
administrative levels (central, departmental and localities), including their respective institutional
changes. Also, the PRSC-3 will focus on strengthening capacities (financial and human resources) o f
localities to define and implement policies. The main activities would include: (i)               revision o f the budget
preparation process to better include participation at the regional level and integration o f sectoral policies
by the PrCfet, as well as effective coordination between the national program-budget and local
development plans,13(ii)     improvement o f monitoring and evaluation o f budget execution at the central and
local levels, and (iii)  establishment o f staffing plan to carry out the preparation and implementation o f the
development plans.

 176.     Expected Results and Outcomes. Key results would be: (i)                     adoption o f a realistic and well-
sequenced strategic action plan for decentralization, (ii)improvement in scales for local revenues
(transfers and taxes), (iii)   effective delegation o f recurrent costs to the regional level, including wages o f

6.3.7 PublicAdministrationandCivil Service

177.     Background and main issues. Administrative reforms seek to align the civil service and the
administrative organizationto the public financial management reform by implementing a comprehensive
strategy for results-based public sector management. Achieving this objective requires a comprehensive
approach to enable: (i)development o f an administrative reform strategy; (ii)establishment o f a
framework for performance-based management and accountability o f stakeholders; (iii)     establishment o f
an incentive scheme in tandem with a modem and efficient management control system, which enables
performance-based transparent management; (iv) development o f a skills-based human resources
management system and provision for ongoing career development for civil servants ; (v) definition o f a
user's bill o f rights to quality services, as well as mechanisms for participation in the monitoring,
approval, and evaluation o f public policies (demand management), and (vi) establishment o f an
institutional framework for internal and external communication, and development o f a strategy for this
area.

178.     In this respect, with the support of IDA and other donors, the Government has identified
measures to be implemented in the short term and has developed an action plan, including steps towards
increasing staffing within a sustainable macroeconomic framework and a new civil servant and fixed-term
contract government employees statute.        In particular, the Ministry in charge of Civil Service has
recently: (i)set up an operational coordination mechanism to manage public sector reforms; (ii)
established an ad hoc Committee to review the civil servant and fixed term contract statute and ajoint ad
hoc committee which involves the unions in the process o f revising the civil service regulations, (iii)
delegated personnel management responsibilities to the three ministries in charge o f the education sector.
The latter has been evaluated and actions are planned to consolidate this first experience o f human
resources deconcentration whilst evaluation o f some ministries readiness for further deconcentration will
be carried out.

179.     Focus of PRSC-3. Some progresses have been made by the Government, but substantial
achievements on the reforms remain challenging:

- Implementation of the institutional framework for the integration, coordination and monitoring of
administrative reform.
180.     The Government has adopted a decree14and implement the mechanisms managing the reforms
with: (i)political level (the Council o f Ministers), (ii) technical level (an interministerial committee
          a                                                 a
including the General Secretaries o f the ministries - the CCRA, and ministerial units), and (iii)a
revamped Administrative Reform Committee (Commission Nationale Consultative de la Rdforme
Administrative - CNCRA) able to ensure that the demand side i s taken into account. Sectoral reformcells
were set up in all ministries. Major reform documents are discussed by the CCRA - this i s a prerequisite
for their submission to the Council o f Ministers -, and the next step i s to ensure that the coordination
sectoral commissions are able to discuss key documents prior to their finalization stage to allow for
upstream coordination.

- Preparation of the actionplan.
181.     Based on various studies carried out with the support o f the PHFZD trust fund (stocktaking and
road map for a comprehensive Civil Service, development o f a modem human resource management
system based on merit, preparation o f a Medium-Term recruitment and employment policy, and career

management and professional development policy), an action plan was prepared and adopted by the
CCRA in March 2006.           However, lessons learned from the delegation o f personnel management
authorities to the 3 education ministries were drawn at a later date, and thus are not part o f the current
version o f the action plan, that will needto be updated.

182.     An audit o f the integrated database for civil servants was conducted, and should be followed by
remedial measures. The main weaknesses identified by the audit are the following: i)different updating
processes for HR and payroll, which means the dataset i s not quite unified: problems o f inconsistencies
and delays inprocessing the financial impact o f administrative decisions (agents need to hand cany their
files: time spent outside their job location and sometimes grease money); ii)absence o f deconcentration
o f the database to line ministries (due to poor connection and equipment and complexity o f the system);
iii)controlsareappliedonthebasisofthepaperdocuments, andonlyafterthatistheinformationentered
into the IT system, which does not have built-incontrol. This entails a risk o f inaccurate inputs, be they
done by mistake or intentionally.

183.     It will be very important to integrate all the technical elements concerning performance-based
management in the revised statute.          The separation o f politics and public administration i s also
imperative. The establishment o f a merit system i s faced with strong opposition partly because the HRM
system in Benin i s not transparent and prone to regional and political influences. The fact that civil
servants are allowed to be members o f political parties i s a deterrent to a non-partisan and merit-based
civil service. A statute that would prohibit civil servants from active partisan politics would be an
important step towards a neutral civil service.

184.     PRSC-3 will be critical for the government to launch the implementation o f the action plan. In
close collaboration with UNDP and CIDA, PRSC-3 will support the government in order to: (i)         monitor
the reform and to connect the reform at the central level with the reform at the decentralized level; (ii)
                                                                                                         set
upmechanisms andprocedures to address staffingneeds and skills needs ina sustainable framework; (iii)
move toward the performance-based management.

185.     Expected Results and/or Outcome. Administrativekivil service reform is a new sector in
PRSC-3. The Government i s expected to lay out a clear vision for public sector policy and management,
and adopt and launch the implementation o f key measures to:

     -   simplifyand implement an acceptable performance-based remuneration and promotion system for
         the civil service;
     -   decentralize wage management as part o f the budget delegation to line ministries and regional
         directorates;
     -   delegate management o f personnel to local government (communes), in the line with the transfer
         o f competence scheduled inthe devolution law.
6.3.8    Strengthen the Monitoringand Evaluation of Poverty Reduction

186.     Background and key issues: The Obsewatoire du Changement Social (OCS), under the
direction o f the CNDLP has been charged with collecting data from the line ministries in order to produce
progress reports on the poverty reduction strategy. Thus far the OCS has produced progress reports on
the first and second years o f the PRSP implementation, consolidating much data on social sector
indicators and progress toward the MDGs. However, measurement o f progress on poverty could not be
presented due to lack o f new household data since the PRSP began implementation. The last household
survey dates from 2002. Further,the earlier investigations conducted distinct rural and urban surveys that
made difficult the comparison o f national poverty levels over time. The shortcomings o f the poverty data
were noted inthe original assessment o f the PRSP.



                                                      42

187.     Government has conducted seminars with stakeholders to examine the limits o f the previous
methodology and to develop a new approach. The Government's new statistics master plan involves an
extensive baseline survey for 2006-2007, where results from the first round could be used for the new
PRSP. The next extensive survey would take place five year later, while the intervening years would
include lighter surveys with varying sectoral emphasis designed to update data on living conditions.

188.     Focus of PRSC-3. PRSC3 will support implementation o f the statistics master plan and the
institutional arrangements for monitoring and renewing the poverty reduction strategy. The SP-CNDLP
will soon conduct a final review o f the first PRSP and begin coordinating work to produce the second
PRSP. Inaddition, given that nearly all communes have produced local development plans, the PRSC
will promote the generation and transmission o f information from the local monitoring and evaluation o f
service delivery for poverty reduction.

6.3.9    Transparency,GovernanceandAnti-corruption

189.     Background and main issues: Benin has affempted during recent years to curb the level of
corruption and improve governance. The Government adopted the "anti-corruption agency" model
following the path o f a number o f other African countries. In 1996, the "Cellule de Moralisation de la
Vie Publique" (Office for the improvement o f morality in Public Life) was created and placed under the
Presidency. The Cellule was charged with investigative and prosecution functions. However, the lack o f
independence o f the agency combined with the absence o f a strongjudiciary, rule o f law and o f oversight
bodies that could ensure a minimumlevel o f accountability, have been major impediments and seriously
limitedthe functions o fthe Office.

190.     In2004, inresponse to a request from Government, WBI initiated a diagnostic study on the state

qualitative surveys in three key sectors -- households, public and private sector -- to assist the
o f governance and corruption.        The purpose o f the study was to conduct in-depth quantitative and

Government and citizens to gain a better understanding o f institutional performance and the nature o f
corruption across the country. Because o f the political sensitivity o f the contents o f the survey, the public
and private sector components had to be suspended duringthe electoral period inthe last quarter o f 2005.

191.     The household survey was completed and shows corruption to be a major impediment to
improving life for the common citizen. Preliminary data shows that corruption i s one o f the major
concerns o f the population. Fifty eight percent o f the interviewed households feel that corruption in the
public sector i s the major obstacle for the country's development'' The Survey report i s being prepared
and will be finalized by end October 2006. The report will provide valuable data on how corruption
affects the accessibility and quality o f basic services and the negative effect that it has on household
income. In order to have a more comprehensive diagnosis o f the phenomena, the Government plans to
launch early October a complementary survey which will cover the private and public sectors.

192.     Interms of Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Beninranked 77'
out o f 146 countries in 2004. Corruption seems to have worsened in 2005, with the country falling to Mth
place inthe CPI.   l6

193.    The table below provides the six governance indicators identified by WBI as critical to
monitoring a country's progress. A comparison o f the indicators between 2002 and 2004 shows little
progress in Benin. Voice and accountability improved marginally, as did governance and the control o f
corruption. However, political stability, respect for the rule o f law and regulatory quality further
deteriorated over the period.

194.    PRSC-3 focus. The newly elected government has confirmed the importance o f improving the
quality o f governance. The first priority will be to complete the diagnostic survey as a means to defining
the forward agenda. The diagnostic study will provide cross country baseline data on the state o f
governance and corruption, allowing for monitoring on a regular basis. In addition, the participatory
approach o f the survey will help promote a broad-based dialogue on neededreforms and create long-term,
sustainable partnerships among major stakeholders. The dissemination o f results o f the diagnostic study at
the national level will help inthe construction o f a pro-active national dialogue.

195.    This sequence of activities has provento be successful inother countries inthe region. Inthe case
o f Guinea, diagnostic survey results were disseminated through seven regional workshops with the

participation o f local authorities and representatives from civil society. After dissemination o f the results,
participants identified key entry points and priorities for reform. The Guinea government has now
committed publicly to ensure that the appropriate institutional set up will be in place allowing for
different stakeholders to participate inthe design o f a National Governance and Anti-corruption Strategy
and to monitor its implementation.

196.     In order to help the Benin government sequence reforms that would assist in curbing corrupt
practices and improving the delivery o f services to citizens, the Bank will propose the following
activities:

    0    Conduct the public sector component o f the Survey on Governance and Corruption which will
         provide baseline data on institutional vulnerabilities, the effect o f misgovernance inpublic service
         delivery, and help identify the key issues that should be addressed to improve efficiency o f the
         public sector.


    0    Conduct the private sector component o f the Survey on Governance and Corruption which will
         provide an in-depth analysis of how governance and corruption affect private sector development.
         This information will complement the findings o f the 2005 Investment and Climate Assessment
         and assist the government to identify the most needed reforms. (The 2005 ICA showed that
         corruption negatively affects the level o fprivate sector investment and growth).


    0    Based on the data obtained through the diagnostic study and building on other relevant
         assessments, design a medium term multi-sectoral anti-corruption strategy, focusing on the
         promotion o f transparency and accountability, improving access to information, reinforcing
         participation o f civil society organizations and promoting linkages between private sector and
         other key stakeholders

                             7. THE PROPOSEDCREDIT

                                      7.1 TRIGGERSFOR PRSC-3

197.   As part of the reform program supported by the PRSC, the Government is in the process of
implementing the measures presented in the Policy Matrix (Annex 9). These measures are largely in line
with agreements reached under PRSC-2. The following prior actions for PRSC-3 were selected as core
measures necessary for supporting the entire reform program.

To improveprivatesector development:

   -   develop and adopt a revised strategy for private sector development, based on study
       recommendations on competitiveness, sources o f growth, investment climate, integrated
       framework, and land reform; and prepare a Letter o f Policy.

To improveperformanceinthe agriculturesector:
   -   satisfactorily implement the following the additional cotton sector measures:

       (i)      revise the institutional framework for representation o f professionals in the cotton
                interprofession (AIC, CSPR, CAGIA);

       (ii)     complete a new study on cotton inputs supply and marketing arrangements and ensure an
                effective implementation o f its main recommendations with the 2006/2007 harvesting
                campaign;

       (iii)    complete a study on private-based cotton price stabilization mechanisms with private
                sector involvement intheir management;

To improve rural population access to safe drinking water and better sanitation in rural
andsemi-urbanareas:

                             7.3 COORDINATION WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS

198.     Coordination with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF will continue to
concentrate on macroeconomic issues in Benin, focusing specifically on short and medium-term
macroeconomic stability and incentives. On August 5, 2005 the IMF Board approved a 3-year
Arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Grovyth Facility (PRGF) with low access. The first annual
review started in December 2005 but has yet still to be concluded. IMF staff collaborated closely with
IDA duringnegotiations o f the program, particularly with respect to structural reforms. IMF and IDA
staff also collaborated on the Joint Staff Advisory Note o f Benin's first PRSP Progress Report, reviewed
by both Boards in June 2005. As before, IDA will continue to coordinate activities with the IMF. In
particular, the staff o f both institutions will continue to conduct joint PRSP missions and prepare joint
assessments o f the PRSP. Staff will also conduct joint reviews o f public expenditure management.

                    7.4 COORDINATION WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT                    BANK

199.     The teams o f the World Bank and the African Development Bank have increased the efforts to
put in action in Benin the Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) which was signed between the two
organizations in 2002. This led to a better coordination o f their respective activities in Benin and the



                                                       48

organization o f joint missions in health, education and rural water sectors as well as the sharing o f
documentations.

200.    For 2004-05, the AfDB has prepared a program loan in close coordination with IDA. This
program loan, equivalent to US$33.5 million, together with a grant equivalent to US$1.44 million, was
approved on December 10,2003 to finance the first Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Program (PRSP)
inBenin. This program loanbecame effective on August 9, 2004. The content and conditionalities ofthis
program loan were aligned with the PRSP and coordinated with PRSC triggers. On public procurement
reform, the AfDB and IDA teams have enhanced the coordination o f their technical advice, leading to the
selection o fjoint sets of conditionalities and triggers. The two teams will also continue to work closely on
public expenditure management reform, public procurement reform, internal and external controls, and
capacity building.

201.    For 2006, the AfDB has decided to put in place a second budget-support program loan (PRSSP
11), equivalent to US$21.6 million to support implementation o f the PRSP. The preparation o f this new
program, was approved July 2006, i s being closely coordinated with the IDA team (with respect to PRSC
3-supported program) but also with main donors providing budget-support to Benin (see below).

          7.5 COORDINATION WITH OTHER MULTILATERAL                    AND BILATERALDONORS

202.    Discussions with donors that are preparing budget support operations (AfDB, EU, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland) are leadingto improved alignment o f support to Benin's PRSP/MTEF. The
main objectives o f this coordination are to: (a) support the implementation o f Benin's PRSP through the
Government budget cycle, while moving toward a common assessment framework; (b) reduce transaction
costs; (c) enhance the predictability o f resource flows; and (d) conduct joint reviews at both the macro
and sectoral levels.

203.     Buildingon the impressive results achieved inthese areas in2004, further steps were taken over
the past months to enhance and consolidate the harmonization process. At the sectoral level, joint
Government-donors reviews were carried out in the core sectors o f rural water, health, and education in
May/June 2005, and led to concrete recommendations and agreements aimed at sharpening the existing
strategic framework and increasing the effectiveness o f service delivery in these sectors. Efforts have
been deployed by the Government and the donors to activate thematic working groups established inthe
context o f the PRSP implementation. The pre-appraisal mission o f the PRSC-3 (in September 2005) was
carried out in the context o f the second joint mission o f the main donors that are providing budget, but
was formally extended to include on demand-basis other donors supporting the PRSP implementation
(France, Germany, Belgium, Canada and core UN agencies). The outcomes o f this new experience and
the lessons learned provide a good basis for further improved donor coordination around PRSP-2
preparation and implementation. The mission's results included: (a) the agreement on the revised and
complemented version o f the existing common policy matrix as well as the main performance indicators;
and (b) the formulation by donors o f coordinated comments on the second PTRS progress report as well
as on the proposed time-table for PRSP-2 preparation. The need to accelerate the pace o f harmonization
in lines with the Paris Declaration was also discussed and agreed upon by all stakeholders. It was agreed
that active consultations will be maintained during the coming months under the leadership o f the
Government to advance the agenda o f preparingand setting a global M o U to governing the process.

                                       7.6 ENVIRONMENT         ASPECT

204.     The proposed development policy Credit supports mostly economic governance and sectoral
reforms that are unlikely to have any additional significant environmental effects. The potential
environmental and social effects associated with the proposed PRSC-3 are mainly related to the rural



                                                       49

water, rural transport, and health sectors, and the cotton sector reforms. Specific policies related to these
reform programs to be initiated under the 2006 program are part o f broader programs whose activities
span over the medium-term, and may be also supported by the next series o f PRSCs. Therefore, a two-
fold approach to dealing with the environmental aspects has been adopted; the first will deal with reform
actions that are expected to be initiated and/or completed under this operation, whereas the second
approach will lay the foundation for effectively handling these environmental aspects inthe medium-term
reformprograms.

1.       Sector reformprogramand environmentalaspects

Agriculture, cotton andforestry sector reforms

205.     The agenda in the ESSD sector aims at deepening and/or completing the reforms that were
initiated a couple o f years ago. The PRSC-3 i s focusing on the following areas: (i)    the improvement o f
the    sector's   management      and increased       agricultural  service   delivery    through  effective
decentralizatioddeconcentation and building strong partnerships among actors in the field; (ii)           the
consolidation o f the cotton sub-sector reforms, especially the operationallisation and enforcement o f the
new regulatory framework and the privatization o f the SONAPRA; and (iii)          the implementation o f the
recommendations o f a recent audit o f the forestry institutional framework and program (participatory
management o f forests and adjacent lands, reform o f forestry taxes).

206.     An environmentalmanagement plan (EMP) as part o f the cotton sector reformprogram started in
2002. This EMP includes the environmental audit o f the ginningplants that were eligible for privatization
as well as a pest management plan. Similarly, an environmental and social assessment o f the forestry
program has been prepared in the context o f a recent GEF project.           T h i s assessment proposed an
environmental and social management framework (ESMF) that laid out a plan for mitigating any adverse
biophysical and social effects that mightresult from the implementation o f the proposed activities.

Rural transport sector reform

207.     The Rural Transport sector reforms are at a quiet early stage since this sector was introduced in
the PRSC only in 2005. The program's main objectives are (i) increase access o f rural communities to
                                                                 to
basic social services and to production areas, through the implementation and monitoring o f pilots
targeted programs, and (ii)  to improve the institutional framework and management o f the sub-sector.

208.     Regarding the potential safeguards issues associated with the pilot investment programs, it was
discussed and agreed that these will continue to be handled by building on the framework and processes
which were established under the last IDA-financed Transport Project which closed some years ago. This
includes: (i)an operational directive for environment adopted in 1996 (compensatory measures for
voluntary resettlement, sensitization and awareness raising on HIV and other STDs, restoration o f borrow
pits and quarries, etc) ; (ii) creation o f an environmental unit in 1999 which was in charge o f
                                 the
conducting all the required studies; and (iii)  the creation in 2001 o f an environment cell which takes a
further step in ensuring the integration o f environmental dimensions in the sectoral policies, plans and
projects o f the transport sector.

Rural water sector reform

209.     The reforms in the Rural Water sector mainly aim at increasing water supply access and equity,
improving sustainability o f the existing facilities (including the piloting o f PPPP arrangement in small
towns. The Ministry o f Energy and Water Resources had adopted appropriate measures to deal with the
potential environment and social issues associated with the planned investments. It was agreed that these
measures which include the carrying out o f mandatory full EIA for small dams, a control o f wastewater


                                                      50

and mud around wells, and the compliance with the requirements pertaining to the minimum distance
between wells and latrines, etc.) will continue to be enforced by the existing functional EIA unit o f the
ministry.

Health sector reforms

210.     The reforms in the health sector focus on improving human and financial resource management,
testing alternative management modalities o f the facilities (management contracts), testing mechanisms to
increase accessibility o f poor to health services and promoting the community-relays in the delivery o f
key basic services. In addition, the PRSC 3 gives a particular attention to some priority programs under
the sector's budget (Malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV).

211.     With respect to possible environmental impacts o f the above mentioned priority programs
(treatment and disposal o f medical wastes notably), it was agreed that this will be addressed by usingthe
Environmental Management Plan which was put in place in 2002 for the Multi-Sectoral H N / A I D S
project financed by IDA. This plan includes the training o f health sector personnel for the handling o f
biomedical wastes (including final disposal technologies), awareness raising (production o f relevant
information and brochures) for health sector staff and the wider public.

Privatizationprogram

212.     Inaddition to the SONAPRA (mentioned above) and the mediumterm, the Government plan to
privatize the telecommunication and the energy sectors. IDA i s providing technical support through the
PSD project and the Rural Energy Project. The potential environmental effects o f these privatization
measures will be handled in the Private Sector Development (PSD) Technical Assistance Project, and the
Energy Sector PrivatizationProject.

2.       Recipient's systems for addressingenvironmentalissues

213.     Regulatory and Institutional Framework. Institutions for environmental management have
developed slowly but steadily in Benin since the creation o f the Ministry o f Environment in 1992. The
country adopted an overarching environmental law (loi cadre sur l'environnement) in 1999 that places
environmental impact assessment at the core o f the Government efforts towards achieving the goals o f the
sustainable development. Following the creation o f the Benin Environmental Agency in 1995, the country
benefited from the Bank's support from 1996-2001 in the implementation o f the Environmental
Management Project that focused on the creation o f the basic institutional and technical capacity for
environmental management. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EM) was one o f the key areas o f
emphasis o f the capacity buildingefforts. These capacity buildingefforts consisted o f three main types o f
activities including (i)
                       enacting a framework environmental law with specific requirements for EL4 (and
preparing and adopting implementation decrees for EIA law), (ii)    developing sectoral guidelines for EIA,
and (iii)holding several training workshops for the staff in line ministries, in consulting firms, and a few
NGOs. These training workshops started in 2000 and have had several rounds with differing thematic
focus and complexity. In addition to the training o f staff from the line ministries, the Environmental
Agency helped create EIA cells.

214.     Environmental Policy Implementation. In addition to the NEAP (updated in 2001), the Ministry
o f Environment, Housing, and Urban Development (MEHU) has adopted in 2002 a Medium-Term
Strategic Plan (2002-2006) that highlights the main objectives o f the country inthe area o f environmental
management, housing, and urban development. The Environment Directorate and the Benin
Environmental Agency share the responsibility and objectives o f the Ministry's mandate in area o f
environmental management, and environmental impact assessment. This mandate that focuses on the
control o f the country's major environmental threats evolves around the following activities (a)


                                                    51

strengthening and deepening the regulatory framework, (b) developing environmental compliance and
enforcement tools for environmental impact assessment, (c) protecting coastal resources and controlling
costal erosion, (d) controlling urban transport pollution, and (e) increasing access to urban sanitation and
drainage services. An important step toward the effective integration o f environmental aspects into policy
implementation has been the creation o f small environmental cells within key line ministrieswhere public
provision and investment are usually associated with noticeable environmental impacts. The staff o f
these environmental cells has been trained in the screening o f investments for their environmental effects,
and inthe control and monitoring o f the implementation o f environmentalmitigation measures.

                       7.7 PRSP/PRSCMONITORING EVALUATION        AND                       SYSTEM

215.     The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the PRSC will continue to be based on the
M&E system developed earlier for the PRSP. Although it needs strengthening, progress has been made
by the Government with donor support to build the capacity o f organizations tasked with the
responsibility o f collecting, analyzing and disseminating data and other information. Detailed results o f
the 2002 census provide useful information for improving poverty diagnosis and strengthening poverty
analysis while a new household survey i s about to be launched inthe context o f the PRSP I1preparation.
At the sector levels, monitoring and evaluation units established in line ministfies have begun to play
progressively their role. However, the preparation work underscored that, while the evaluation culture i s
increasing along with the PRSP implementation, the disparity in level and depth o f existing capacity
remains high. The map o f M&E readiness o f technical ministries has only slightly changed, with
promising capacity building activities that are being implemented in the agriculture and transport sector
with the support o f IDA (PHRD-Grant) and EU, respectively. Broadly, three ministrieshnstitutions,
namely Health, Environment and OCS (the central agency for monitoring PRSP indicators), meet the
criteria o freadiness and have a highcapacity to carry out M&E work. Education and Transport ministries
have medium capacity. A particular attention i s being given under the program to the other ministries
with low capacity.

216.     The functioning and effectiveness o f the existing coordination and monitoring institutional
arrangement have progressively increased over time since the Government in liaison with the donors had
taken necessary texts to further clarify roles and responsibilities o f the main structures involved. In
particular, the collaboration between the two main technical arms o f the system, i.e. the Permanent
Secretariat o f the National Committee for Development and the Fight Against Poverty (SP-CNDLP)
located in the Ministry o f Finance and Economy and the Observatory o f Social Conditions (OCS) under
the Ministry o f Planning, became more smooth and effective. A three-year activity program has been
developed by OCS to address the main M&E and capacity needs and i s being supported under a well
coordinated donors' effort. This includes the execution o f a sizeable household survey whose results (first
set o fresults plannedfor June-July 2007) will help improve substantially poverty diagnosis and analysis

217.     Pilot Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys would be implemented to improve the PRSC results
framework and track the performance and poverty impact o f the Government's health and education
policies. This would complement the annual audit o f HIPC expenditures (mostly budget transfers to
health centers and local schools) to all budget resources allocated to health centers and local school^.'^
Also, progress on the PRSC would be the object o f specific outreach and dissemination efforts to the
media and the general public, aimed at raising awareness o f the country's main governance challenges,
and encouraging the use o f participatory monitoring mechanisms to generate pressure for better service
delivery.


"   The Government has prepared a comprehensive audit and impact assessment o f HIPC expenditures in 2000 and 2001. It
    shows that money spent on HIPC-supportedprogramsis: (a) properlymanaged accordingto specifiedrules and procedures;
    (b) received by the intended recipients; and (c) effectively used to benefit the targeted population and for the intended
    objectives.


                                                             52

                                       7.8 REVIEWINSTRUMENTS

218.     Joint PRSP Reviews, and Joint Budget and Appraisal Missions. To ensure timely feedback
into the policy making and budget processes, efforts have been made by the Government and the donors
to coordinate various review process around the PSRP implementation, leading to a successful
coordination o f the review o f the second Annual Progress Report with the budget preparation timetable,
and with preparation o f donors' budget support operations. The review took place in September 2005
along with the second annual joint mission of donors in Cotonou. Similar efforts are being deployed
around the preparation o f the PRSP-2.

219.     Sector Reviews. The Government has agreed that reviews o f the PRSP, PRSC, and other budget
support operations will be based on the sectoral performance indicators and targets set out in sector
program budgets. Joint Government/donor reviews o f PRSC sector programs (rural water, health, and
education) were carried out in May/June 2005 and during the pre-appraisal mission. The results o f these
sector reviews fed into the preparation o f the first Annual Progress Report, and into the 2005 budget that
has been sent to the Parliament.

                                     7.9 CREDIT ADMINISTRATION

Alignment with PRSP and Budget Cycle

220.     As with the preceding operations, PRSC-3 is aligned with the government budget for 2006, even
though its disbursement would not take place early 2006, to take into consideration the change in
leadership following the presidential election in March 2006. It will support the implementation o f core
reform programs defined by the Government for 2006 as a transition between the current PRSP (ending
officially in December 2005) and the new one under preparation. The PRSP-2 i s expected to be
completed by February 2007 and will provide a revised three-year strategic framework covering the
period o f 2007-2009.

In-Country Coordinationwith Donors

221.     As mentioned above, the preparation o f PRSC-3 has been characterized by increasing
collaboration among the Bank and other donors that are providing budget support as well as other main
donors supporting the PRSP implementation. These include the African Development Bank, the European
Union, Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, France, Germany, Belgium, Canada and core UNspecialized
agencies. The second joint mission took place in Cotonou during September 2005. Through the PRSP
donor coordination, sector and thematic technical groups have been set up, with different donors taking
the lead in sector program and policy dialogue. For example, Denmark i s taking the lead inrural water,
the European Union inhealth, and USAID ineducation.

Disbursementand Auditing

222.     Disbursement and Implementation Arrangement. It i s proposed that the credit o f US$30 million
equivalent be disbursed immediately upon effectiveness. The untied budget support will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation o f the development program and not tied to any specific purchase and
no procurement requirements will be needed. Once the credit becomes effective, the proceeds will be
deposited by IDA into a Government account at the Central Bank which forms part o f the country's
foreign exchange reserves; and as a due diligence measure, IDA will obtain confirmation from the
government that the amount o f the credit has been accounted for in the country's budget management
system. No dedicated account i s required. The administration o f this financing will be the responsibility
o f the Ministry o f Development, Economics and Finance.



                                                      53

                                         7.10     BENEFITSAND RISKS

223.       Benefits. The reform program supported by PRSC-3 is expected to contribute to the PRSP's
ultimate goals, with a marked impact on the following areas: (i)improved investment climate and
business environment; and (ii)     improved responsiveness to performance reports and to monitoring data on
basic service delivery (health, education, water and sanitation services). As a multisectoral instrument,
PRSC-3 will also enable the promotion o f administrative reforms requiring cross-sectoral coordination,
such as civil service reform and decentralization. These reforms should, in turn, enable the public
expenditure management reforms to be more effective. As a programmatic instrument, PRSC-3 will
promote coordination among donors while maximizing the impact o f the donors' aid on poverty
reduction.

224.       Risks and Mitigation.The main risk is the economy's vulnerability to changes in international
cotton prices and/or in cotton production. Given the importance o f the cotton sector for GOB'Seconomy, a
significant drop ininternationalcotton prices or a disruption o f production would affect growth and living
standards o f the population, and would worsen the poor conditions o f those residing in rural areas. In
order to protect the cotton farmers from the decline ininternational prices, the Government i s resolved to
continue with the reform in the sector, to complete the privatization o f SONAPRA and, in collaboration
with stakeholders, to set out an enforceable mechanism for the distribution o f inputs. A study on private-
based stabilization o f cotton incomes has been completed in M a y 2006. Progress in diversifying the
overall economy will be critical to mitigating this risk inthe long run.

Other risksincludethe following:

225.       Vulnerability to Economic and PoliticalDevelopments in Nigeria. This warrants both a big
opportunity and a serious risk for development and poverty reduction in Benin. This risk was identified
under PRSC-1 and has materialized in 2004. Nigeria has imposed new restrictions on Benin's re-exports.
This includes a list of44 products. To benefit frompositive developments inNigeria, Benin should aim to
become a more efficient trade platform by: (i)          ensuring that its customs system operates fairly and
efficiently; (ii)  leading ECOWAS to adopt more liberal and open trading policies; and (iii)        ensuring that
i t s infrastructure services are delivered at the lowest cost (especially port and transport operations).

226.       Slippages in Program Implementation. The March 2006 presidential election and preceding
campaign have slowed down the program implementation even though these actually resulted in more
favorable political conditions and institutional dynamics. Another risk o f delay may arise as the new
administration takes office. This risk i s controlled under the CAS triggers since it could have important
setback effects on the GOB'Sability to sustain a stable macroeconomic environment.

227.       Weak Institutional Capacity. There is some improvement in the area o f public expenditure
management, but the institutional capacity remains an important risk since it could slow down the pace o f
improvements inpublic service delivery as well as implementation o f core reforms. The expansion o f the
scope o f the program also tends to put more pressure on the already weak institutional capacity. Although
the increased ownership by the Government and other local stakeholders would foster on the creation o f
national capacity inthe long-run, various approaches will be implementedto respond to capacity building
needs along with the program implementation. These include: (i)the outsourcing o f services when
appropriate, through an active partnership with private providers; and (ii)      the implementation o f tailored
capacity buildingactivities funded under the nationalbudget andor financed by donors.

Competitiveness Study, Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, the FIAS Land Market study, Financial
Sector Review, Governance and Anti-Corruption Survey, the Rural Transport Strategy Study, as well as
the series o f reports underpinning Civil Service reform and decentralization. Other studies include the
recent Public Expenditure Review covering the Water, Health, and Education sectors, and the Country
Health Status Report.

229.    Growth and Competitiveness Study: The study researches product lines with practical
possibilities for development as exports, with recommendations on measures needed to realize this export
potential. The report was discussed with Government inJune 2005.

230.    Investment Climate Assessment: This study identifies the major impediments to private sector
development and its results will be used to develop a realistic growth strategy led by the private sector.
The preliminary report was discussed with Government inOctober 2005.

231.    Diagnostic Trade Integration Study: The DTIS report develops an integrated strategy to
enhance Benin's integration into regional and global markets and presents a matrix o f actions for
improving trade competitiveness. The preliminary report was discussed with Government and other
donors and stakeholders ina workshop inOctober 2005.

232.    FIAS LandMarket Study: The study examines ways to improve the access o fthe private sector
to industrial, commercial, and residential property.        The preliminary report was discussed with
Government inOctober 2005.

233.    FinancialSector Review: The report provides a diagnosis o f the financial system inBeninand
identifies issues that need to be addressed by Government and policy makers for the financial system to
become a better growth engine.

234.    Governance and Anti-Corruption Survey: The diagnostic survey results aim to provide the
analytical underpinnings for the policy and institutional reforms on governance. Also, their results should
be used to update the Strategic Anti-corruption Plan. Household section o f the survey i s completed but
the remainder o f the survey i s pending.

235.    Rural Transport Strategy Study: The results o f this study will help design the National Rural
Transport Strategy and a multiyear investment program.

236.    Stock-taking and Road map for a Comprehensive Civil Service Reform: The study aims at
providing the GOBwith a strategic vision consistent with the financial and administrative reforms in
process to allow the MFPTRA to strengthen its reform strategy and design a comprehensive and
operational reformplan, which can also be supported by PRSC-3. The study was: transmitted to the GOB
on July 29,2005 and validatedby the Government.

237.    Medium-termRecruitmentand Employment Policy: The objective o f the study is to lay the
groundwork for putting in place effective tools and modalities for planning and managing human
resources needs. These will make it possible to strike a balance between improving public service and
buildingcapacity on the one handand controlling the wage bill on the other. The study was transmitted to
the GOBon June 15,2005 and validated by the Government.

238.    Career Management and ProfessionalDevelopment Policy: The objective o f this study is to
propose to the GOBthe principles and modalities for introducing a new system for managing civil service
jobs, as well as the careers and the skills of civil servants. This reform has to be consistent with the
objectives o f a public service that meets sectoral needs in a cost effective manner. The study was
transmitted to the GOBon August 25,2005 and validated by the Government.

Agriculture
Presently the existing monitoring and evaluation system i s rather weak and fragmented. The basic
data are not completed; their analyses are punctual and weakly disseminated among the
stakeholders. The definition and structure o f existing tools remain fragile and hardly applicable to
some extents.
The Objective i s to assist the Government progressively build up along with the program
implementation a sound and functional sectoral monitoring and evaluation system so as to be able
to measure sector performance with respect to the main set o f objectives, notably:
    -   to increase income of producers and inparticular the poorer;
    -   to reduce malnutrition and to increase access o f the population to agricultural products
        for consumption;
    -   to improve the agriculturalproduct exportations; and
    -   to protect the environment.
Inthis respect, the Ministryof Agriculture inliaisonwith its partners (agricultural professional
organizations, private sector, local and national representatives o f elected bodies) should prepare
and execute a work programthat aims at:
    -   providing basic information on the status andor situation o f each key elements o f the
        sectoral program;
    -   finalizing the performance indicators to measure progress;
    -   enhancing the existing capacity (qualified personnel, training provision, equipments);
    -   institutionalizing and to include in the budget partnerships or outsourcing o f tasks to
        qualified institutions.
If the Ministry of Agriculture has the final responsibility for the annual production of required
reports and indicators, it does not mean that it should actually execute all the tasks involved. The
greatest part o f this work i s or could be actually carried out by others (Statistical Institute,
Research Institute, Chamber o f Commerce, etc.). Appropriate outsourcing strategies along with
required supervision and accountability should be set up and implemented.
The objective is that a full-fledged sectoral monitoring framework along with key indicators be in
place by PRSC-4. To that end, the following sequence o f actions i s being considered:
    -   PRSC-3: (a) Setting up the system o f statistics and information to feed the technical and
        financial monitoring and evaluation systems; (b) Definition o f performance indicators for
        the sector; (c) Definition o f methodology and criteria for analyzing - the poverty- focus of
        the agricultural investmentprograms; (d) Definition and setting up the pilot monitoring
        and evaluation o f the sector; (e) Selection and signing contract with partners o f data
        collection and processing. At the end o f PRSC-3, the complete device i s in place with
        human resources, key tools and the means o f operations, including the creation o f core
        competencies within MAEP.
    -   PRSC-4: (a) Data collection and first analyses; (b) finalization and production o f the
        baselines; (c) definition o f the program-budget for PRSC-4 based on these analyses.




                                                 78

    -   PRSC-5: (a) Performance evaluation o f the PRSC-3 implementation against the set
        objectives for the sector, (b) planning o f the program-budget to be supported under
        PRSC-5 based on the results o f the latter evaluation.

To that effect, MAEP has put in place an M&E unit and staffed it with a Chef de Cellule, and
appointed an M&E focal point in each o f the CeRPA (decentralized MAEP representation).
MAEPhas programmed to recruit an additional 3 staff for the Unit.The unit,located at MAEP's
DPP (Direction de la Programmation et de la Prospective), i s responsible with the
implementation o f the IDFproject on the development of a results-basedM&E system for MAEP
and the rural sector. This system will be linked to the PRSP M&E.
Rural Road
The Ministry in charge o f the Public Works and Transportation (MTPT) has started collecting
only a few technical data on Rural Roads. These data are o f very poor quality and do not help in
the assessment o f the rural road implementation program impact, a measure o f satisfaction and
accessibility to rural and production areas or to community services. In addition, performance
indicators on global transportation are not provided well enough as to establish the base line
values. Inorder to fill the gap o f information and to develop sound strategy in providing data to
monitor the MDGs, the MTPT i s planning to carry out some studies and surveys which include:
    -    A Study to help identify and formulate performance indicators and to establish also their
         base line values. This study i s financed by the EUand will not cover all the data needed
         to assess the accessibility to rural and production areas and to community services;
    -    In coordination with the ministries in charge o f health, education and agriculture and
         with local communities, the MTPT will conduct a survey to identify and locate the
         situation o f the basic community services (health and education centers etc.) and the
         production areas in term o f distance to any road in fair condition. Such surveys would
         help establish sound benchmarks for developing a real strategy for meeting the objective
         o f accessibility and sound framework for the monitoring o f the rural transport program.
         These surveys will also integrate the result from the survey undertaken by the Ministry
         o f Health in 2001 and 2004.
The MTPT has planned gettingconclusiono f the EU.This would provide the Ministrywith
sound and well formulated performance indicators and their base line values. However, settingup
a monitoring framework for the rural transport would need little more than three (3) years
because o f the delay inconductingthe surveys described above.

Justice
The Ministry o f Justice, Legislation and Human Rights ("MOJ") has started to produce baseline
data. Establishinga sound information and management system o f legal andjudiciary data within
the MOJ is a key part o f the 2006-2008 Implementation Plan o f the Government's ten-year
Integrated Program for the Development and Modernization o f Benin's Legal and Judiciary
Systems. A study regarding baseline values for the performance indicators was satisfactorily
performed in 2005. Establishinga fully satisfactory information and management system o f legal
andjudiciary data will take three years.

    Benin-AssessmentLetter for the AfricanDevelopmentBank andWorld Bank
                                            July 21,2006

This note provides a preliminary assessment o f Benin's macroeconomic conditions and outlook,
based on information available through June 2006. Board consideration o f the first review o f the
PRGF arrangement has been delayed because o f slow progress in structural reforms and
presidential elections early in2006. It i s now expected to take place inthe fourth quarter o f 2006.

Macroeconomicperformanceandprogress in structuralreforms

Following a decade of high growth and low inflation, Benin's economic performance has
weakened in recent years against a backdrop of limited progress in addressing core
vulnerabilities. In 2005, real GDP growth remained at about 3 percent, barely above the
population growth rate, as weak investment demand persisted. Average inflation increasedto 5.4
percent, above the 3 percent WAEMU convergence criterion, fueled by strong food demand
from crisis-afflicted Niger and high international oil prices. Reflecting the unfavorable price
developments, the real effective exchange rate appreciated further and, by end- 2005, Benin had
lost an estimated 60 percent o f the competitiveness gains from the 1994 devaluation o f the CFA
franc. The terms o f trade deteriorated by over 15 percent in 2005 due to falling cotton export
prices and rising oil import prices.

In spite of weaker-than-projected revenues, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2005. The
shortfall in domestic taxes was more than offset by expenditure cuts and the narrowly defined
primary budget balance was close to zero. The overall fiscal deficit (payment order basis,
excluding grants) declined to 3.1 percent o f GDP, over 2 percentage points below the program
target. It was financed mostly through external assistance from the World Bank, the European
Union, and the African Development Bank. At 0.8 percent o f GDP, net bank credit to government
was broadly consistent with the level allowed under the authorities' PRGF- supported program.

Progress on structuralreformhasbeenlimited.The installation o f software for the centralized
clearing and invoicing management center o f the Port o f Cotonou has been completed, making
possible the start o f operations at the port's one-window shop for customs and other
administrative transactions. However, the bulk o f the structural reform agenda has yet to be
implemented. Still pending are, notably, the privatization o f commercial activities in the cotton,
telecommunications, and electricity sectors, and the preparation o f a program to develop and
expand the activities o f the Port o f Cotonou and to secure private sector involvement in the
management o f the facility.




 Defined as total revenue minus total expenditure excluding interest payments, foreign financed
capital expenditure and net lending.

Overallperformanceunder the PRGF-supportedprogramhasso far beenmixed. All
quantitative benchmarks for end-December 2005, with the exception o f total fiscal
revenue, were met. Most informal quantitative benchmarks for end-March 2006 were also
met, although continued underperformance o f revenues meant that the first quarter net
domestic financing target was missed by a small amount. Moreover, completion o f the
first review had been held up before the March presidential elections due to lack o f
progress on structural reforms.

The external debt burdenhasbeenreduced substantially by debt reliefgranted under the
enhancedHIPC Initiativeandthe MDRI.Total MDRIrelief from the African Development
Fund(AfDF),the InternationalDevelopmentAssociation (IDA), and the Fundis estimated at
US$1,045 million, bringingthe public debt down to about 10 percent o f GDP.

Renewedcommitmentto policyreforms

Recent staff findings suggest that economic conditions are improving in 2006. Real GDP
growth i s expected to rebound to 4.5 percent, benefiting from a recovery in cotton production
and continued strengthening o f the trade and transportation sectors due to ongoing reductions o f
trade restrictions with Nigeria and enhanced efforts to improve the competitiveness o f the Port
o f Cotonou. Twelve-month inflation i s projectedto decline to 3 percent by end-year.

In the fiscal area, the new government has taken steps to ensure the achievement of the
main programobjectives.Measures are being implemented to shore up tax administration and
stabilize revenue at 16.5 percent o f GDP. The authorities have enhanced budgetary control by
banning the use o f ad hoc Treasury Payment Orders, through which extra budgetary outlays have
been affected in the past, and instituting a formal Treasury Committee to monitor revenue and
expenditure on a weekly basis. These measures are already resulting in stronger revenue
collection, and the narrowly defined primary budget deficit i s projected to be limited to the
programmed 0.4 percent o f GDP (0.9 percent o f GDP including MDRI-funded outlays).

Onthe structuralfront, the authorities have stated their commitment to resume the reform
of the telecommunication and cotton sectors, and plan to accelerate the implementationof
the energy sector restructuringprogram.With World Bank assistance, the updated strategy for
each o f these sectors and the time line for implementation are under preparation and are expected
to be adopted by the government by October 2006.

Relationswith the Fund

A three-year PRGF arrangement, in an amount o f SDR 6.19 million (10 percent o f quota), was
approved by the Fund Executive Board on August 5, 2005. Initiated in December 2005,
discussions on the first review were interrupted by the presidential elections. Discussions
resumed in May-June 2006 and a staff mission i s planned for August with a view to completing
the discussions and presenting the review for Board consideration in the fourth quarter o f 2006.
Board discussion o f the 2004 Article N consultation and an ex post assessment took place on
October 6, 2004.

INTRODUCTION

1. This letter o f development policy describes the reform program supported by the thirdPoverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-3), which aims at supporting the implementation o f Benin's
poverty reduction strategy as set forth in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) adopted
by the Government inDecember 2002. It sets out the main economic and financial policies for
the 2006-2008 period and the approaches to the development o f the second generation PRSP.

2. This letter, which continues the process that began with the letter o f M a y 12, 2005, describes
the actions that the Government intends to take in the medium term to implement its poverty
reduction strategy, focusing on measures that will increase the effectiveness and impact o f public
expenditure, thereby helping to improve public services, particularly for the poorest. The updated
matrix o f policies and measures supported by the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC),
completed in collaboration with the IDA team and the other development partners, notably the
European Union, Denmark, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, i s attached as an annex to this
letter. The matrix reflects the contents o f this letter indetail.

3. The matrix o f policies and measures reflects the effort to define priorities based on both the
budgetary constraints identified inthe 2006-2008 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and the
institutional limitations that have an impact on the administration's absorptive capacity.
Execution o f the actions and achievement o f the outcomes highlighted in bold in the matrix are
deemed essential to the success o f this reform program.          These actions and outcomes thus
constitute prior requirements for PRSC-3.

1.       Background andrecent developments

4. An assessment o f over a decade o f structural adjustment in Benin supported by the Bretton
Woods institutions and the international financial community has revealed that poverty levels
have not fallen significantly, despite considerable progress made in the restoring the major
macroeconomic equilibria and economic growth.

5. In this context, the Government o f Benin developed and adopted an overall poverty reduction
strategy in December 2002. It aims at ensuring that economic growth will result in a tangible
improvement in household living conditions and a significant reduction in poverty. The poverty
reduction strategy was developed based on structural reform programs and sectoral strategies that
were conceptualized and implemented during the 1990s. These strategies and programs were
improved while preparing PRSP in order better to take poverty reduction objectives into account,
particularly inthe social sectors. Preparation o f the PRSP coincided with that o f a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), which reflects reform programs and sectoral policies in
budgetary terms.     The MTEF includes medium-term sectoral program budgets that set out the
expenditure required to implement sectoral programs and policies that have clearly identified and
specific objectives.    The PRSP and the associated MTEF demonstrate the Government's
commitment to reducingpoverty inBenininthe medium and long terms.

6. As indicated in the PRSP, the Government would like all o f its partners gradually to adopt the
budgetary assistance approach to development, assistance which, by definition, i s non-targeted.
In order to obtain this support, the Government intends to improve the effectiveness o f essential
public services as well as their capacity to reduce poverty. These two objectives o f improving
basic public services and shifting to non-targeted budgetary assistance require significant
strengthening o f the administration's management capacity at both the central and local levels, as




                                                   87

well as greater accountability o f program managers in terms o f actual performance, transparency,
and financial management.

7. To this end, the Government has requested and obtained a poverty reduction support credit
(PRSC) to support its reform program and contribute to financing its poverty reduction strategy.

2.       The 2006-2008 reformprogram

8. The PRSP i s structured around four main strategic axes:
     0   Strengthening the medium-term macroeconomic framework;
     0   Developing human capital and managing the environment;
     0   Strengthening governance and institutionalcapacity;
     0   Promoting sustainable employment and strengthening the capacity o f the poor to
         participate inthe decision-making and productionprocesses.

9. The 2006-2008 reform program i s organized around these same strategic axes. In addition to
measures aimed at strengthening the macroeconomic framework, achieving poverty reduction
objectives, particularly those linked to social indicators, will require a considerable effort to
introduce performance-based management and improve program efficiency.               Moreover, the
National Assembly has passed the 2006 draft budget law in conformity with the 2006-2008
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and PRSP priorities. These include detailed program
budgets for supplying water to rural areas, health, basic education, the environment and urban
sanitation, forest management, and transport. Similarly, the Government adopted the Cadre des
Reformes de la Gestion BudgCtaire AxCe sur les RCsultats (CaR-GBAR) [Performance-Based
Budgetary Management Reform Framework]. The Government intends to present supplementary
estimates to the National Assembly for fiscal 2006. This will allow the new configuration o f
ministries and resources obtained from the Multilateral Debt ReliefInitiative (MDRI) to be taken
into account. This initiative enables Benin to save resources that will be divided among the
priority sectors (education, health, agriculture, andjustice).

10. The first year o f the program (PRSC-1) focused on improving: (i)    access to drinkingwater in
rural areas; (ii) national health system performance; (iii) quality o f basic education; and
                                                              the
(iv) environmental and forestry management. From a cross-cutting perspective, emphasis was
placed on: (i)    reforming public spending and strengthening the fiduciary framework;
(ii) continuing the fight against corruption; and (iii)strengthening the monitoring and evaluation
o f the poverty reduction strategy.

11. On the basis o fboth an assessment o f progress made inestablishing a suitable framework for
performance budgets and a pertinent sectoral strategy, the second and third years o f the PRSC
(PRSC-2 and PRSC-3) also cover the abovementioned areas, in addition to justice, agriculture,
rural transport, the civil service, administrative reform, and decentralization and deconcentration
reforms. In order to remove obstacles to private sector development and improve the business
climate, the PRSC will support private sector development during its third year o f
implementation.      There will also be an action plan for rolling short- and medium-term
administrative and civil service reforms that are harmonized with the public finance reform.




                                                  88

        2.1.       Axis I of the PRSP: Accelerating sustainablegrowth

12. The program's macroeconomic objective was to achieve more rapid growth, which i s needed
for significant poverty reduction through growth in national and foreign private investment.
Economic growth should therefore attain an average annual rate o f 7 percent.

13. However, this objective was revised to take into account the effects o f the slowdown in
economic activity experienced during the first two years o f PRSC implementation, characterized
by: (i)Nigeria's intensification o f trade barriers to Benin's re-export trade, by increasing the
number o f prohibited items from 21 to 44; (ii) persistent underperformance by the Cotonou port;
(iii)fallincottonproductioncausedbypoorlyorganizedmarketing,production,andinputs;and
     a
(iv) the rise o f the euro against the US. dollar, which has been detrimental to the economy and
particularly to industrial activity.

14. In this context, provisional growth rate estimates for 2005 are 2.9 percent as compared to
3.1 percent in2004, whereas the PRSP sets a target o f 6.8 percent to 7 percent. Economic growth
rates o f 4.5 percent and 5.1 percent are projected for 2006 and 2007, respectively.           The
Government's main objective i s to encourage private initiative as a base for economic growth,
particularly in the areas o f ago-industry, the hotel and tourism industry, new information and
communications technologies, and transport. The basic aim i s to improve the business climate by
lowering transaction costs and strengthening the legal and judicial framework in order to secure
private investments, provide a proper framework for public-private dialogue, and provide a more
dynamic framework for the monitoring and coordination o f interventions favoring the private
sector.

15. To support this poverty-reducing growth strategy, and given the timeframes needed to get
results from a policy encouraging private sector development, the Government initially
anticipates increasing public investment from 5.8 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 7.4 percent o f GDP
in2006-2007, while private investment, which was approximately 12.5 percent of GDP in2005,
would increase to 13.7 percent in 2006-2007. In this manner the total investment ratio would
increase by 2.8 percentage points to 21.1 percent o f GDP for 2006-2007.

16. Despite the expected growth rates, inflation will be maintained at less than 3 percent,
consistent with the WAEMU convergence pact. The external current account deficit will remain
relatively highbecause o f increased import volumes arising from the anticipated faster growth.

17.   The Government believes that accelerating growth and reducing poverty will require
increased public expenditure on basic economic infrastructure and the social sectors. Total state
expenditure would therefore be 21.8 percent of GDP on average for the 2006-2007 period, as
compared to 20.3 percent in 2000-2004. This increase in public expenditure, particularly in the
education, health, and water supply sectors, would be partially covered by an increase in total
government revenue, projectedto be 17.2 percent o f GDP in2006-2007, particularly owing to the
implementation o f measures to improve the efficiency o f tax collection and identify alternative
revenue sources. The overall deficit will be contained at 5.5 percent o f GDP in2006.

18. Considering these revenue and expenditure projections as well as the resources expected
from external debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, the residual financing gaps for 2006 and 2007
are expected to be CFAF 50.1 billion and CFAF 49.6 billion, respectively. The 2006 gap will be
entirely covered by budgetary support from the International Development Association
(CFAF 19.3 billion), the European Union (CFAF 14.3 billion), the African Development Fund



                                                 89

(CFAF 11.5 billion), and other development partners (CFAF 5.5 billion) which signed a protocol
on ajoint coordinating framework between Benin and IDA.

19. Achieving a sustainable increase in economic growth assumes private sector development in
Benin as reflected in increased private investment and improved competitiveness in the sector.
Implementing the PRSC for the first two years has facilitated the introduction o f measures to:
(i)strengthen public sectodprivate sector dialogue; (ii)     improve the business climate; and
(iii)
    strengthen the public-private partnership for infrastructure development.

20. During 2006, the Government will implement the private sector development strategy with
particular emphasis on key actions taken in respect o f land tenure, taxation, the industrial free
zone, and new agricultural subsectors.      Inthis context the Government has worked with the
private sector to adopt an overall private sector strategy. This strategy i s organized around seven
priority axes selected to revitalize the private sector, namely: (i) improving the statutory, legal,
and regulatory environment; (ii)    improving the functioning o f factor markets; (iii)   improving
trade facilitation; (iv) developing emerging subsectors and tourism; (v) developing infrastructure
services; (vi) strengthening the private sector support mechanism; and (vii) reinvigorating the
reform coordination and monitoring framework for the private sector.

21. Measures to reduce state involvement are critical to the execution o f the Benin Poverty
Reduction Strategy. Having experienced difficulties with carrying them out, the Government i s
convinced that public-private sector partnerships must be strengthened to facilitate transparent
implementation o f the measures. The Government would also like the assistance o f development
partners to implement them in four priority sectors: telecommunications, energy, water supply,
and port management. The objective i s to create conditions that will allow operators and private
investors to participate in the development o f the above-mentioned priority sectors in a variety o f
ways (such as privatization, concessions, and leasing).

22. The Government intends to continue divesting its interests, paying particular attention to:
(i)improving the legal and institutional framework; (ii)   adopting the sectoral electricity policy;
and (iii)adopting the regulatory framework and establishing the regulatory body for the water and
electricity sectors.

23.   Inaddition, the Government will take suitable measures to: (i) and implement a
                                                                             adopt
leasing timetable for the SociCtC BCninoise de 1'ElectricitC et de 1'Eau (SBEE) [BeninElectricity
and Water Company]; (ii)     with World Bank support, form a council to develop an appropriate
regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector; (iii)      arrange the privatization o f the
SocietC Benin TClCcoms S.A.         [Benin Telecommunications Company); and (iv) finalize the
establishment of a regulatorybody for telecommunications.

24. The cotton industrywill continue to play a major role in accelerating growth because cotton
exports constitute on average approximately 80 percent o f exports (not including re-exports). In
this regard, sector reform will be pursued with a particular focus on state divestment o f
SONAPRA's industrial activities.

                              Management of the agricultural sector

25. The priorities established inthe various strategy documents for the rural sector are consistent
with those o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy. They therefore constitute a good framework for
agricultural sector development.     The Government is aware that the technical and financial
support granted to sector institutions for implementing these strategies has been insufficient. The


                                                 90

budgets planned for the next three years will therefore support operationalization o f these
strategies.   To improve the overall management o f the sector, institutional reform has been
initiated by the Government to truly empower the agricultural sector to play its role as an engine
o f growth. Accordingly, with the objective o f better targeting public investment to galvanize
private initiatives and respond to PRSP objectives, a specific program budget has also been
developed with assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization's New Partnership for
Africa's Development (FAONEPAD) to support the national fisheries, livestock, and rural
engineering offices inpreparing three priority private investment programs in a participatory and
decentralized manner.

26. Faced with managing more than 60 existing projects, the Ministry o f Agriculture, Livestock,
and Fisheries (MAEP) has been organized into six main functional areas to support the
implementation o f the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The MAEP's program budget
first targets the consolidation and streamlining of the sector's management instruments at the
central and deconcentrated levels. To do this, it was decided to focus on consolidating and
streamlining agricultural sector instruments at both the central and regional levels.          This
specifically allowed for the finalization o f programs and budgets for the Direction des Ressources
Financieres (DRF) [Directorate of Financial Resources], the Direction des Ressources Humaines
(DRH) [Directorate o fHumanResources], the Directionde la Programmationet de la Prospective
(DPP) [Directorate o f Programming and Planning] with its new monitoring and evaluation unit
and the strengthening o f its agricultural statistics unit; and the transformation o f the Centres
d'Action RCgionaux de Dtveloppement Rural (CARDERS) [Regional Action Centers for Rural
Development] into Centres RCgionaux de Promotion Agricole (CeRPAs) [Regional Agricultural
Promotion Centers] with community level units (CECPAs).

27.    Management o f the agricultural sector will be led by four closely linked partners: the
Government, represented by the MAEP, the private sector, local, regional and national elected
officials, and professional agricultural organizations (OPAs). Because OPAs have been a weak
link with inadequate support inrecent years, specific actions have been planned in the program
budget o f the Ministry o f Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries to help them achieve better
representation and management.

28. Therefore, reorganizing the overall management o f the agricultural sector will allow the
Government to: (i)   establish a national structure for agriculture in a participatory manner; and
(ii) finalize a support program to develop new subsectors such as cashew nut, shea nut, fisheries
(shrimp), pineapple, and oilpalminconjunction with the private sector.

                                          Cottonsubsector

29. The Government's main objective i s to restore and sustainably integrate industries within a
private management context. For this reason, the state implemented a vast reform program for
the subsector beginning in the 1990s. This reform consisted o f ending state involvement in the
harvesting and primary marketing o f seed cotton, as well as input management and ginning, and
replacing it by producer organizations and private operators.       Implementing this reform has
allowed for the establishment o f professional and technical structures, including : (i)         the
CoopCrative d' Approvisionnement et Gestion des Intrants Agricoles (CAGIA) [Cooperative for
Procurement and Management o f Agricultural Inputs], which has the objective o f organizing and
managing calls for bids for the procurement and distribution o f good quality, minimum cost
inputs for the benefit o f producer groups; (ii) Association Interprofessionnelle du Coton
                                                    the
 (AIC) [Interprofressional Cotton Association], a grouping o f professional families from the cotton
industry (producers, ginners, and distributors of agricultural inputs); (iii) Centrale de
                                                                                   the


                                                  91

Securisation des Paiements et du Recouvrement (CSPR) [Unit for the Guarantee of Payments and
Collections], charged with controlling physical and financial flows during the ginning process;
and (iv) the Chambre d'Arbitrage et de Conciliation (CAC) [Conciliation and Arbitration
Chamber], which ensures the internal resolution o f legal disputes that may arise when contracts
are signed in connection with cotton industryactivities and relatedmatters.

30.   The Government has, moreover: (i)put a mechanism in place for the importation and
distribution o f inputs for the 2005/2006 crop season that will be binding on all stakeholders;
(ii)adopted a single seed cotton marketing arrangement, since the 2004/2005 crop season, using
existing structures, such as cotton ginners, farmers, distributors, and the state; (iii)
                                                                                      adopted a new
regulatory framework to govern industry operations; (iv) instituted a new regulatory framework
for the industry that will foster competition. Despite the existence o f a regulatory framework
governing the operations of the industry, including its professional and related structures, there
have been problems in families inthe profession, such as: (i)   the sudden proliferation o f a variety
o f organizations o f producers, cotton ginners, and distributors o f agricultural inputs; and (ii)the
absence o f internal provisions for sanctioning stakeholders that do not comply with established
regulations. These problems have resulted in producers becoming demotivated and there has
been a drastic reduction in the production o f seed cotton in relation to the capacity o f the cotton
ginneries inplace.

31. In light o f the vulnerability o f the industryto various external shocks and the effect o f these
on the national economy, a suitable approach must be developed for resolving all the problems
associated with agricultural promotion in a sustainable and effective manner so as to pave the
way for the emergence in the medium and long terms o f other subsectors regarded as promising
in terms of development and growth. To this end, a policy paper and a five-year development
plan have been drawn up to enable the Societe Nationale de la Promotion Agricole
(SONAPRA) [National Agricultural Promotion Company] to refocus in future on the role o f
agricultural promotion for which it was designed. Inthe absence o f appropriate mechanisms for
addressing risks, the efforts o f stakeholders will be for nought. In order to prevent producers
becoming disaffected with the agricultural industry as a result o f fluctuations in their incomes
from one crop season to the next, the state has taken steps to support the implementation o f
agricultural income support mechanisms with private sector involvement intheir management.

32. Consistent with its undertaking to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the
Government intends to end its commercial activity in the cotton industry by privatizing the
industrial arm o f SONAPRA. The privatization process, which was initially supposed to be
completed by October 2005, met with some difficulties, which led the Government, on March 15,
2006, to cancel the auction sale o f SONAPRA's industrial assets. Another option for state
divestment by agreement with the persons seeking to rescue the industry has been selected.
Under that option, the Government intends to hold all industrial units under one company to be
created, the value o f which will be equal to the total value o f the lots comprising SONAPRA's
entire industrial assets. The shareholders o f this new company will be the former companies to
which SONAPRA's industrial assets had been transferred, the state, the staff o f SONAPRA,
small farmer organizations, and the public. Implementation o f the procedure called for under this
option should be completedby May 31, 2007 at the latest.

                                            Ruraltransport

33.   The objective in this sector i s to improve transport in rural areas, thereby increasing
communities' access to basic social services, markets, and production areas.            The note de
strattgie de transport rural (NSTR) [Rural Transport Strategy Note] adopted on March 22, 2006


                                                  92

has laid the groundwork for the rural transport program. The sector has a multiyear investment
and maintenance program for rural roads and an institutional framework for implementing this
strategy.  In 2006, the Government plans to give priority to: (i)updating the institutional
framework for managing rural roads, and preparing and adopting the new regulations; and (ii)
rural road building in the communes o f Boukoumbe, OuakC, Tchaourou, Malanville, Adjohoun,
Allada, and HouCyogbC in 2006. These communes have been chosen because they are the most
underserved interms o f having accessibility to health centers, schools, and markets.

        2.2.     Axis II of the PRSP: Improving the delivery of basic services and promoting
the sustainable management of natural resources

34. A sustainable increase in growth and a reduction inpoverty cannot be achieved without the
development o f human capital and the sustainable management o f natural resources. Among the
main causes o f poverty identified in Benin, the most important are difficulties in obtaining
drinkingwater, primary health care, and basic education and literacy, and these areas will be the
priority for the next three years. Improving the supply, use and quality of these services, and
specifically combating HIV/AIDS and malaria, are priority objectives under this component o f
the strategy.

                       Improvingaccessto drinkingwater inruralareas

35. Implementation o f the strategy to recondition and develop the water and sanitation sector in
rural areas under the Projets d'Assistance au DCveloppement du secteur de l'alimentation en Eau
potable et de 1'Assainissement en milieu rural (PADEAR) [Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Projects] inthe last decade has resulted in substantial progress beingmade inthis area. However,
obstacles to development o f the sector remain.       These include: (i)  the doubthl viability o f
services provided; (ii) the lack of national capacity inthe area o f financial and human resources;
(iii) need for enhanced monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.
     the                                                                      The Government has
consequently approved the recommendations o f its partners in the sector at the annual joint
review meeting for developing the 2006-2008 Program Budget for the Directorate-General o f
Water Resources.

36. The Government i s optimistic about meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in
the water sector. Between 2002 and 2004, the sector doubled its capacity to provide water supply
points. Thanks to the sector's performance in 2004, the threshold o f 1,200 water supply point
equivalents was exceeded for the first time. Improved planning and budget execution, as well as
significant support from several donors, has led to proactive efforts to improve and refine the
performance o f the sector. Training sessions are planned with a view to improving staff capacity
to better adapt to budget execution procedures.

37. To achieve a more efficient management o f the sector, the 2006-2008 program budget
highlights: (i) addition o f new, and the rehabilitation o f old, water supply points; (ii)
               the                                                                               the
renewal o f the stock o f humanpowered pumps; and (iii)   logistical support for the deconcentration
o f the departmental services o f the Ministry of Mines, Energy, and Water. The Government has
adopted an action plan, including a program o f activities as well as a detailed timetable, to
professionalize supervision o f the piped water system and develop the local public-private
partnership (PPP) for management o f water supply systems.              That action plan will be
implemented in at least ten secondary cities to be selected in 2006. The aim i s to strengthen the
capacities o f stakeholders who share in the expenses o f the sector to become proficient in the
budget execution process and improve performance inthe sector.




                                                 93

38. In that context, the goal o f the sector program i s to increase the rate o f access to drinking
water supply-from       39 percent in 2004 to 43 percent in 2006 and 45 percent in 2007-by
constructing approximately 2,950 new water supply points and rehabilitating 630 old water
supply points over the period (2005-2007). At least 85 percent o f water supply points will be
operational and 1,250 water supply points will be added in2006.

                                                Health

39. On the whole, sector programs have improved inquality and have drawn inspiration from the
PRSP, the MDGs, and health sector development policies and strategies for the period 2002-
2006. Efforts have been made, in particular, to reduce infant and maternal mortality and to
combat the main diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Numerous initiatives
have been undertaken to protect the poorest in terms o f their access to quality health care.
Nevertheless, in light o f the country's ambition to achieve the MDGs, persistent high maternal
and neonatal mortality rates are major concerns.         The Government also intends to take the
necessary steps to ensure that there i s respect for professional ethics and integrity inthe sector.

40.   The Government will have to address the main challenges, namely: (i)             identifying and
implementing interventions on behalf o f the poorest; (ii)    improving the quantity and quality of
human resources, and deploying them better throughout the country, as well as addressing the
issue o f staff motivation; (iii)
                               maintaining continuity o f expertise in the sector, particularly in the
operation o f the Comites de gestion de la sous-prefecture (COGES) [local health management
committees]; (iv) fighting major diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, as well as
malnutrition, particularly in children age 5 and under; (v) implementing the national strategy for
reducing maternal and neonatal mortality; and (vi) ensuring good quality health care and the
proper use o fhealth services.

41. The aims in 2006 are to: (i)    renovate, equip, and staff twenty (20) district health centers in
poor, underserved areas; (ii)    develop a large cadre o f employees able to strengthen the
participatory public-private partnership; (iii)implement a program to pilot incentive arrangements
in five depressed health districts; (iv) conduct an evaluation o f the relais communautaires (social
mobilization teams) and use the conclusions to extend this experiment to 34 health centers; and
(v) evaluate the performance o f financial mechanisms aimed at facilitating access to health care
for the poor inten health districts.
Basic education

42. The population's access to education, and to basic education in particular, has noticeably
improved. Nevertheless, improvement in the quality o f education and reduction o f disparities
continue to be significant challenges that will have to be faced in future.          The Government
undertakes to continue the policies introduced in 2004 to improve accessibility, learning, and the
quality o f basic education, and to strengthen the efficiency and management o f basic education
services.   To this end, the Government will pursue the following key objectives in 2006:
(i)increasing the primary school completion rate o f girls fi-om 39 percent in 2004 to 40 percent;
(ii)reducing the average grade repetition rate at the primary level fiom 20 percent in 2001/2002
to 15 percent; (iii) ensuring the textbook availability ratio for mathematics and reading i s one
book per pupil; and (iv) reducing the incidence o f breaks in the educational cycle owing to the
unavailability o f all primary grades in a given school from 10.5 percent in 2001/2002 to
5.5 percent.

43. For the Government to achieve these objectives it will build on the progress made through
2005, especially by: (i)implementing the two action plans adopted in 2003 to enhance the


                                                   94

execution o f the teaching reform and improve the retention o f pupils in schools, including
preparing an implementation report on the reduction o f grade repetition in the Complexe
polytechnique industriel (CPI); (ii) recruiting 1,000 new contractual teachers to teach in primary
schools; (iii) implementing the deployment plan for teachers; and (iv) completing an appraisal o f
the experiment with resource transfers and preparing an action plan for its future expansion in
line with the decentralization process as well as the community development strategy (DCC). In
2006, the Government will carry out the initial training o f at least 800 teachers and prepare an
action plan to improve the program. It will continue to implement the plan to redeploy teachers
inpublic schools.

44. At the strategic level, the measures will include: (i)     strengthening and implementing the
school enrollment program for girls, targeting the 19 communes that have low enrollment ratios
for girls (below 60 percent), and focusing on the protection o f girls, with extensive involvement
on the part o f NGOs and other associations; (ii) stepping up implementation o f the action plans on
teaching reform, including the definition and gradual implementation o f the new strategy to make
initial training available to primary school teachers; (iii)strengthening the capacity to implement
action plans by increasing the level o f internal efficiency and retention in the system, by paying
attention to the phenomena o f grade repetition and breaks inthe educational cycle; (iv) continuing
with the program o f decentralized recruitment o f additional teachers (approximately 1,000 in
2004-2005-2006) and the redeployment o f existing staff; and (v) continuing to subsidize
communities so that the wages o f community teachers working inthe systemcan be funded under
the program.

45.   In February 2005, the Government adopted the education policy paper, which includes
literacy and gender issues. It intends to implement the coordination framework and the execution
procedures o f the ten-year sector development program; specify the mechanisms for
operationalizing and regulating the flow o f students; carry out an institutional audit o f the
ministries responsible for education; and draft a plan o f action to support program execution.

                                 Environmentandurbansanitation

46. Significant progress has been made in implementing the Programme National de Gestion de
1'Environnement (PNGE) [National Environmental Management Program] introduced in 2002.
The progress made confirms the key role of this program in implementing the medium-term
strategic plan (2002-2006) o f the Ministry o f Environment and the Protection o f Nature and
reflects the political will o f the Government.    Investments in the sector are in line with the
objectives o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs)as regards both their anti-poverty orientation and their efforts to achieve
sustainable development. The current programming o f PNGE investment has three main axes:
(i3 environmental management tools; (ii) environmental management; and (iii)activities
                                            urban
relating to the implementation o f international conventions on the environment.

47.   Much progress has also been made in activities supporting urban management.               The
implementation o f all programs i s in keeping with the contents (resources, activities and
targets) o f the performance contracts signedbetween program managers and their supervisors. In
this context, the allocation of 2006 budgetary resources is based on the performance o f each
program or subprogram under the 2005 performance contract.               In addition, in 2006 the
Government will develop the Programme National d'Appui a la GestionUrbaine [National Urban
Management Support Program].

                           Management of forests and riparian habitat

48.   Sustainable management o f the classified forests and riparian habitat i s an important
component o f the poverty reduction strategy. Over the long-term, responsible stewardship o f
natural resources will help reverse the degradation o f the national forest resources on which rural
populations depend for their subsistence. The approach adopted to this end i s to implement
mechanisms aimed at increasing the accountability o f grassroots communities and promoting
alternative income-generating activities to prevent an indiscriminate exploitation o f forest
resources. The Programme de Gestion des Forets et des Terroirs Riverains (PGFTR) [Program
for Management o f Forests and Riparian Habitat] aims at the sustainable management o f 22 forest
massifs and has three components: (i)          institutional support and capacity building; (ii)    a
participatory management approach to forest and riparian habitat; and (iii)           the sustainable
management o f timber and environmental impacts.

49. Finally, beginning in March 2006 this program has been implementing the following action
plan: (i)impose a taxation system that i s favorable to fuelwood and charcoal from managed
forests; (ii)complete the withdrawal o f the public sector from activities at the industrial arm o f
the   Office National du Bois (ONAB) [National Timber                   Bureau];   and (iii)continue
implementation o f the forest management plans.              The program will extend community
management o f forest resources to five (5) classified forests and two (2) riparian habitats,
improve forest production and exploitation techniques, and promote alternative income-
generating activities (in all, twelve (12) classified forests will be protected in2006).

         2.3.    Axis 111 of      the PRSP: Improving and strengthening governance and
institutional capacity

                                              Legal sector

50. One o f the key axes o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy i s to improve the operation o f and
access to the legal and judicial system. Thus, the Programme IntCgrC pour le Renforcement des
Systkmes Juridiques et Judiciaire [Integrated Program for strengthening the legal and judicial
system] was approved by donors and then officially adopted by the Government in2001, and sets
forth the Government's strategy for reforming the legal andjudicial system.

5 1. The first plan for operationalizing this Integrated Program was developed in 2004 for the
2005/2007 period. The 2006-2008 program budget o f the Ministere de la Justice, ChargC des
Relations avec les Institutions, Porte Parole du Gouvernement (MJCRI-PPG) [Ministryo f Justice
incharge ofinstitutionalrelationships, Government Spokesperson] reflects the content ofthe plan
for operationalizing the 2006/2008 Integrated Program. The National Monitoring Committee
approved the program and i s responsible for steering it.

52. For 2006, the Government intends to take all actions contemplated inthe program, and, more
specifically, has undertaken to: recruit 40 magistrates and integrate them into the junior
magistrates training program; recruit 30 extra clerks o f the court; effectively enforce six
directives regarding the compensation o f magistrates; implement the recommendations fi-om the
MJCRI-PPG institutional audit; implement a functional legal and judicial management
information system; and arrange for the continuing professional training o f magistrates, clerks o f
the court, court officers, and staff o f the MJCRI-PPG.

                                            Budget reform

53. To bring about genuine improvement in efficiency in a transparent management framework,
the Government o f Benin is committed to continued implementation o f its budget reforms aimed
at: (i)introducing performance-based budget management through clearly defined and coherent
program budgets consistent with the medium-term expenditure framework; (ii)           delegating public
expenditure management, currently the sole responsibility o f the Ministry o f Development,
Economy, and Finance, to the sectoral ministries and ultimately the deconcentrated
administrations, while working toward establishing a reinforced fiduciary framework (sound
budgetary management); and (iii)    streamlining and computerizing the expenditure circuit.

54. Since the beginning o f the budget reform process, significant progress has been made inthe
areas o f program development, budget preparation and execution, and the production o f
performance reports, owing to key institutional reforms and capacity building efforts. With a
view to restoring financial orthodoxy, the Ministry o f Development, Economy, and Finance has
taken steps to: (i) reduce the use o f the exceptional procedures during the execution o f public
expenditure; (ii)  speed up the regularization o f advances to the regies (state agencies and
administrations); (iii) avoid incurring further arrears under public procurement contracts;
(iv) ensure the authenticity o f liabilities; (v) bring the reporting o f the Central Administration's
accounts up to date; (vi) conduct audits o f the Public Treasury and the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement, [National Amortization Fund] (vii) conduct site inventories o f the ministries;
and (viii) audit the public enterprises.

55.     The Government intends to continue public expenditure reform by, inter alia:
(i)implementing an action plan based on the independent evaluation o f expenditures yet to be
regularized and how they should be posted to the accounts; (ii)             establishing units to help
regularize and include in the national budget any expenditures incurred without prior payment
authorization each month; (iii)      continuing efforts to reconcile accounts with the regies;
(iv) granting advances to government agency officials in circumstances allowed under the
regulations and only after documentation and formal payment authorization o f the earlier
advance; (v) finding a way, in collaboration with regulatory bodies, to audit the former state
agencies and administrations and settle accounts; (vi) updatingthe inventory o f lawful obligations
and incorporating them into DMFAS (the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System) in
order to ensure the exhaustiveness o f budget execution data; (vii) strengthening the commitment
control system for the Ministry o f Public Works or ministries likely to incur arrears; and
(viii) strengthening the capacity o f the Public Treasury (quality o f human and material resources,
working conditions) and implementing specific measures to enable the Public Treasury to
centralize resources without compromising project implementation.

                                 Performance-basedmanagement

56.    The Government will also implement program budgets, performance monitoring, and
program reporting and evaluation in order to achieve the objective o f gradually establishing
performance-based management within public administration. To implement these management
practices in the ministries, the Government: (i)     adopted a Letter o f Development Policy for this
reform (performance-based budget management) in 2005; (ii) up the operations plan for its
                                                                   drew
implementation; and (iii)    launched the implementation o f performance-based management
through several subprograms. Accordingly, in 2005, five ministries (MDEF, MMEE, MEPS,
MS, and MEPN) implemented performance-based management in some subprograms. In 2006,
the number o f ministries implementing performance-based management will be increased to
eleven (1l), including six new ministries (MIC, MTA, MJCRI-PPG, MAEP,MTFP, and MRAI).


                                                   97

57. To this end, the Government has declared its political will to carry out this reform and to
support the efforts o f technical teams pursuant to a commitment protocol entered into by the
Minister o f Finance in 2005 with each sectoral minister for his or her respective subprogram for
the period 2005-2007.      Under this protocol, the Minister o f Finance will facilitate the
commitment o f expenditure against fungible appropriations for current and capital spending
through the management entity responsible for the subprogram. The same procedure will be
followed in 2006. The continuation o f the programs selected and the approval o f their next
budgets will depend on the results obtained.

58.   In this context, bearing in mind the difficulties faced by ministries in implementing a
performance monitoring system, long-term multisectoral technical assistance andor more
narrowly focused technical assistance at the request o f some sectoral ministries will be necessary.
To this end, the Technical Support Team for Budgetary Reform (ETARE3) has been strengthened.

                                   Public procurementreform

59. Inorder to improve the fiduciary framework, the Government's various public procurement
reforms have resulted in the establishment o f a new institutional framework, primarily with a
view to: (i)   improving the transparency and efficiency o f procurement; (ii)         modernizing
procurement procedures; and (iii)  introducing an independent control system to reduce corruption
in government contracting. In 2006, the Government intends to prepare a new draft Public
Procurement Code reflecting the recent WAEMU (West African Economic and Monetary Union)
directives on public procurement and the delegation o f public services, and then submit it to the
National Assembly. Inaddition, the Government will adopt a national capacity buildingstrategy
for procurement and will carry out a plan o f key activities including: (i)        a study on the
implementation o f an integrated public procurement management system; (ii) preparation o f
                                                                                 the
standardbiddingdocuments; and (iii)    the conduct o fpublic procurement audits.

60. Inaddition, the Government will endeavor to: (i)   improve the financial, material, and human
resources o f the Commission Nationale de Regulation des Marches Publics (CNRMP) [National
Procurement Regulatory Commission] so that it can function efficiently; (ii)         implement the
activities o f the public procurement reform action plan; (iii)    prepare the multiyear activity
program for establishing effective and efficient public procurement control mechanisms; and
(iv) conduct a diagnostic analysis of operationalizing public procurement services.

61.     The budgetary reform currently underway, and especially the implementation o f
performance-based management, calls for a transformation o f the internal control function within
public administration. In such a context, the organization and methods o f the internal control
function should be tailored toward supporting the Government's programs while helping
minimize the risks o f poor management. This reform, under the leadership o f the Inspector-
General o f Finance, i s moving forward as planned. It entails the formulation o f a comprehensive
internal control reform plan and the definition o f professional internal control standards and
norms. A decree on the organization o f internal control structures i s to be approved by the
Government inAugust 2006.




                                                98

                                  Strengtheningexternalauditing

62. The Government intends to strengthen external auditing by having the Chamber o f Accounts
conduct performance audits on the execution of program budgets, based on the performance
reports prepared by the ministries participating inthe PRSC.

63. In July 2006, the Government finalized and submitted to the National Assembly the draft
budget accounting law for fiscal 2001. The operating accounts for 2002, 2003, and 2004 have
been forwarded to the Chamber o f Accounts for review and to permit the preparation o f the draft
budget accounting laws for those years and the submission to the National Assembly. Inaddition,
the Chamber o f Accounts will conduct audits o f eight (8) municipalities.

64. To this end, special resources will be lined up to enable the Chamber o f Accounts to
strengthen its capacities in the area o f conducting performance audits, update its auditing
methods, and consolidate the gains it has made.            This will enhance its autonomy and
independence, thereby ensuring its effectiveness.

                        Administrativereformand public sector reform

65. The introduction o f performance-based management warrants the institution o f more flexible
administrative structures and a human resource management policy in public administration, in
particular the development o f performance-based compensation and the decentralization o f
responsibility for hiring and personnel management.              However, this requires suitable
performance-based administrative reform, clarification o f the legal framework and o f the duties
and responsibilities o f civil servants, set against the backdrop o f a competent, integrated,
performing, politically neutral, and objectively impartial civil service, aimed at providing the
public with quality services.

66. With regard to human resource management reform, the primary concern i s matching skills
to positions, as well as sustainable employment status for competent civil servants committed to
program management and evaluation. Program managers should be in a position to define the
resources they need to address clearly established objectives; this will facilitate trade-offs
between objectives and the resources to be brought to bear for their programs to succeed.

67. The Government i s convinced that the priority and crux o f reform i s an overhaul o f the staff
regulations applicable to government employees to make them compatible with the requirements
o f performance-based management. With this in mind, it intends to develop a communication
plan aimed at securing the buy-ino f all the partners, especially the social partners, regarding this
new performance-based management approach. Ifthis overhaul succeeds, it will allow for (i)       the
definition o f a wage policy which provides incentives by recognizing merit and performance, as
well as a new public employee career management and compensation system, and (ii)the
introduction o f a suitable hiringpolicy.

68.   Thus, after establishing the unified payroll file which makes it possible to determine
specifically which civil servants are on the paid roster, better manage public employees, and limit
the introduction into the system o f fraudulent appointments or promotions, the Government by
decree in 2004 delegated the management o f staff-related administrative actions to the ministries
responsible for education and established a technical team made up o f the secretaries-general o f
the ministries for purposes o f integrating and coordinatingadministrative reforms.




                                                  99

69. Overall, in order to manage human resources in a manner consistent with performance-based
public finance management, the Government intends to establish and implement a rolling
program o f medium- and long-term reforms compatible with the public finance reform. To this
end, the 2006-2008 reform action plan, featuring a strategy for staffing growth within a
sustainable framework as well as the preparation and adoption o f new staff regulations for the
civil service which introduce some aspects o f performance-based management, has been adopted
by the two ministriesresponsible for administrative reform.

                              Decentralization and deconcentration

70. The Government intends to continue the decentralization process which began following the
communal and municipal elections in December 2002 and January 2003.                The Government
undertakes to adopt the report o f the Joint State/Commune Committee established by Decree No.
06/MCOOD/MISD/MFE/DC/SGM/SA o f January 27, 2005 and to apply its recommendations.
This report sets out the action plan indicating the measures and their implementation timetable.
The Government also intends to adopt the commune financing mechanism to facilitate the
transfers concerned. The laws and regulations on the budgetary and accounting framework o f
subnational governments have been adopted, and the Government will continue to strengthen the
capacities o f subnational governments in the area o f budget management so that the transfer o f
appropriationmanagement does not adversely affect the quality o f public finance management.

71.   In 2005, to improve the efficiency o f communal and departmental administration, the
government drafted the Strategy Paper on the Implementation o f Territorial Administrative
Reform based on the two axes o f decentralization and deconcentration.                An integrated
organizational framework for deconcentration reform was created and a collaboration mechanism
was established between prefects and deconcentrated agencies on the one hand, and between the
latter and local mayors on the other hand. In 2006, the Government intends to: (i) and   prepare
adopt a framework document on deconcentration; (ii)      operationalize the integrated organizational
framework for carrying out the deconcentration reform; (iii)        operationalize the collaboration
mechanism between prefects and deconcentrated agencies on the one hand, and between them
and the local mayors on the other hand; (iv)provide the financial resources approved for the
communes in the General Budget o f the State in a timely manner; and (v) determine local
taxation.

                                      Fight against corruption

72. In the context o f improving governance and strengthening the rule o f law, the Government
has adopted a strategic plan for combating corruption comprising the following five priority axes:
(i)enhancing the dynamism o f the control system by enacting an anticorruption law;
(ii)promoting administrative and institutional reforms; (iii) strengthening the capacity for action
o f civil society and the private sector; (iv) creating an environment hostile to corruption;
(v) strengthening accountability and the fight against impunity. The Observatory for the Fight
against Corruption was established in 2004.            Moreover, the Government expressed its
commitment to continuing the process o f conducting surveys on governance and corruption, for
which the first module focusing on households has already been completed. These surveys will
make it possible to establish a baseline for monitoring progress with implementation o f the Anti-
corruption Strategy. The Government also undertook to organize public discussions on the
surveys, in particular through their public launching by the MDEF and the dissemination o f the
results at the national level. Specific structures have been established to monitor it, inparticular a
survey monitoring committee comprising, among others, members o f the Observatory for the
Fight against Corruption (OLC) as well as civil society and private sector representatives. In


                                                  100

addition, in June 2006 the Government established the Inspection Gtntrale d'Etat [General
Inspectorate o f the State] which has assumed, with broadened powers, the functions o f the former
Cellule de moralisation de la vie publique [Unit for raising moral standards inpublic life].

3.       Outlook for preparationofthe secondgenerationPRSP

73.   The second generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) for Benin i s to be
prepared in 2006. Taking into account the lessons learned from implementation o f the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) 2003-2005, the new PRSP i s aimed at meeting economic,
financial, and environmental challenges, in particular the acceleration of growth, through the
diversification o f production and support for the private sector. It also seeks to ensure the
effective reduction o f poverty at the grassroots level and the mainstreaming o f environmental
concerns inthe development sectors.

74. To prepare the second PRSP, the Government has embarked on a participatory approach. It
has set out a schedule o f activities and established Report Thematic Groups (GTRs). A four-pass
Modular Survey on Household Living Conditions (EMICOV) has been started, and the first pass
will be completed in November 2006. The results from this first pass will make it possible to
determine the new poverty profile. The tasks o f these groups cover all development sectors, and
all levels o f society are involved. Both their participation and taking their development concerns
into account in the new PRSP are ensured. The GTRs' reports will make it possible to prepare
the new PRSP, which will be validated by all population groups and the development partners
prior to its adoptionby the Government inFebruary 2007.

4.       Coordination, implementation monitoring, and impact mechanisms of the program
supported bythe PRSC (Poverty ReductionSupport Credit)

                           Coordinationof the PRSC-supportedprogram

75, As inthe framework o f PRSC-1 and PRSC-2, overall program implementation will be under
the supervision of the Minister o f Development, Economy, and Finance through the Ministerial
Committee.       This committee comprises the relevant ministers according to sectors of
concentration o f the PRSC and those whose departments are involved in poverty reduction.
Secretariat services are provided by the Permanent Secretariat o f the National Commission for
Development and the Fight against Poverty (SP/CNDLP).

                  Implementationmonitoring of the PRSC-supportedprogram

76. The Permanent Secretariat o f the National Commission for Development and the Fight
against Poverty (SP-CNDLP) and the Observatory o f Social Change (OCS) support the general
monitoring o f the program in the framework o f implementation monitoring o f the Poverty
Reduction Strategy, backed by the indispensable monitoring activities o f the technical ministries.
In practice, monitoring and evaluation capacities are very limited. Where they exist or are
operational, they are limited to oversight over budget execution, sectoral activities, and physical
outputs, rather than final results and impacts, and insufficient emphasis i s placed on economic
performance in terms o f the efficiency and effectiveness o f expenditure programs. To strengthen
the monitoring/evaluation capacities o f the sectoral ministries, the Government will take the
following measures: (i)     equip monitoring/evaluation units with full-time professional human
resources; (ii) establish performance measurement frameworks; and (iii)      implement the capacity
buildingprogram for performance monitoring andprogramevaluation.



                                                  101

77. Finally, the PRSC will be monitored through performance reports on the program budgets o f
the sectoral ministries. The Bank will also conduct joint reviews along with other development
partners. There will be constant dialogue among the signatories to the Program.

  Monitoringof the social impact andimpact on poverty of the PRSC-supportedprogram

78. In the course o f preparing the PRSP and introducing the system for its monitoring and
evaluation, the Government and its development partners recognized the need to develop a
program whereby a sufficiently detailed Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) can be
conducted. The Permanent Secretariat of the National Commission for Development and the
Fight against Poverty, in collaboration with the Observatory of Social Change, identified the
areas that need a PSIA using the participatory approach. Inthis context, a pilot study was done
on the monitoring of the impact of local participation on the education sector in two departments
(Atacora and Donga). This study will be extended to the health and water supply sectors in 2006.
A study on the perception o fpoverty inBenin was conducted in2005, and another onpoverty and
land tenure problems i s currently inprogress.

                 Possiblefuture development of the PRSC-supportedprogram

79. Satisfactory implementation o f the third year of this program in terms o f the objectives set
regarding the management o f public expenditure and the sectors of concentration of PRSC-3 will
be one aspect triggering a possible fourth phase in which the scope o f the program could be
broadened to other sectors.

80. In agreement with IDA, the Government maintains that the decision to broaden the scope o f
the PRSC-supported program to other sectors will be based on the progress made in the
preparation o f these sectors, especially the implementation o f the measures and actions planned
and selected when PRSC-3 i s evaluated.




                                                102

81, The Government believes that these policies and measures constitute an important step in
attaining the medium-term objectives of the PRSP. It also requests World Bank assistance in the
form of financial support for its poverty reduction strategy.

supporteront desormais la mise en euwe du Cadre de D6penses -3 Moyen Terne. Le
budget programme du MAEP vise en premer Iru la consolidationet la rationalisation
des instruments de gstion du secteur au niveau central et dkoncentre. Pour ce
faire, il a &e retenu de se focaliser sur la consdidation et la rationalisation des
instruments du sedeur agricole tant au niveau central que rdgional. Cela a permis
trbs pr6cishent de finaliser les programmes et les budgets de la Direction des
Ressources Financieres(DW), de la Direction des Resources Humaines(DRH), de la

de la Socidtc? Nationale de la Promotlon Agricole (SONAPRA) afin qu'elle pue
d&ormais le rdle de promotion agricole qui lui est d&o/u. Ainsi, en I'absence de
