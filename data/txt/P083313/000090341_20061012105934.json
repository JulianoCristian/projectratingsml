Reduction Strategy, launched in\n            December 2002. PRSC series are an integral part of the\n            Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). PRSC-1 aimed\n            to: (i) help create the basis for private-sector-led\n            economic growth by supporting the Government's\n            macroeconomic program; (ii) support the Government of\n            Benin's public expenditure management reform program;\n            and (iii) support the reform of the public resources\n            management in key sectors, including Health, Education and\n            Water, focusing on the delivery of basic services tailored\n            to the needs of the poor. PRSC2 expanded the coverage to\n            three new sectors (Agriculture, Rural Transportation and\n            Justice), while supporting continued implementation of the\n            Environment and Urban Sanitation and the Forest Management\n            programs as well as re-launching reforms in civil service\n            and decentralization. As a follow-up to PRSC-2, PRSC-3 will\n            maintain a core focus on economic growth and governance,\n            supporting service delivery through improved public\n            expenditure management, financial decentralization, and\n            expanding results-oriented budgeting to new sectors."}, "docdt": "2006-10-02T00:00:00Z"}
