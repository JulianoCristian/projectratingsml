                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's medium to long-term global environmental goals are to reduce the risk of ship-based environmental contamination (such as oil spills from
                         groundings and illegal discharges of ballast and bilge waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill emergencies in the
                         region. The project has three specific global environmental objectives. The first is to ascertain the economic, technical, and institutional feasibility of
                         introducing modern aids to navigation systems in the region, such as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships through sensitive areas and to
                         encourage monitoring of the movements and activities of fishing and other vessels operating within countries' territorial waters. The second objective is to
                         support widening the existing regional agreement (June 5, 1998) on port state control and implementation of its provisions. The third objective, focusing on
                         Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania, is to reduce risks of environmental damage to beaches, fishing grounds, and other domestic resources from
                         spills of oil and chemicals. This will be achieved by supporting efforts of Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to become part of a regional oil spill
                         response plan, by completing the identification and mapping of environmentally sensitive areas along coasts and sea lanes, and support regional collaboration
                         with the west Indian Ocean island states.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to be satisfactory. Development objectives of the Grant are being met in accordance with the project objectives. Disbursements are increasing and
                         are slightly above the revised trajectory reflecting contracts under implementation with M/s SHOM, BRLi/OTRA and IHWC which are well advanced (over 80% execution). A Mid Term
                         Review (MTR) was carried out in November 2010 which reviewed in detail the implementation and sustainability arrangements. An extension of Closing Date by 18 months until Dec.
                         2012 was agreed, increased emphasis is being made on sustainable arrangements that will last beyond Project period as well as improving dissemination of results to all participating
                         countries. While much progress is being made in 5 of the participating States, the MTR raised its concern regarding the sustainability of the Project in two coastal countries including
                         Kenya and Tanzania. Project staff have carried meetings with the 2 focal points in these countries and efforts are being stepped up to find ways to increase the commitment in the 2
                         countries. A reallocation of Grant proceeds was agreed to increase the rate of disbursements; the request is being processed by GoSA to forward to the Bank for consideration. A
                         grant was received from the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop two important earth observation products for the Mozambique Channel in support of Project activities
                         including: (i) oil spill detection in real time, and (ii) coral reef monitoring. Working meetings on the earth observation products between ESA, contractors CLS and IRD, and Project
                         Staff and Focal Points took place in April (Washington, DC) and May (Video conference connecting Mauritius, Reunion, South Africa, Netherlands and France).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The MTR emphasized that much progress is being made in 5 of the participating States, but there is room to improve the commitment to the Project in Kenya and Tanzania. Efforts
                         are underway to clarify and verify the roles of the National Focal Points in these two countries, and also to review and confirm responsibilities regarding implementation of Project
                         components. Meetings and contacts in each country are taking place to follow-up on the program. The marine and hydrographic surveys along the Mozambique Channel for the
                         establishment of the Marine Highway was completed. Survey data was transferred to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and has already been included in small and large-
                         scale electronic nautical charts of the Project Area in December 2010. A "Surveyed Corridor" data system is prepared based on the charts. Now all participating states will need to
                         submit a formal application to the IMO to convert the "Surveyed Corridor" data into a "Routing System". Hydrographic consultants IHWC have carried out surveys of Aids to
                         Navigation and an inspection of possible AIS sites in Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles and Tanzania; detailed reports have been received and are being
                         processed for onward transmission to each country. Major training events on hydrographic and port state control training in French and English took place in November in Kenya and
                         South Africa. Environmental consulting services (components B,C and D) with M/s BRLi/OTRA are well underway. Working groups in all countries are setup to manage at the national
                         level all training activities for National Oil/Chemical Spill Contingency (NOSC) Plans, preparation of Environmentally Sensitive AreaMaps (ESA), and policies for the use of
