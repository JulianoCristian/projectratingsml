Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
The closing date for the Africa - GEF-Western Indian Ocean Marine Highway 
Development and Coastal and Marine Contamination Prevention Project, TF090304
,
P078643 will be extended
 
from June 30, 2011 until December 31, 2012.   
2. 
The project implementation and achievement of development objectives are 
currently rated as Satisfactory.  This was confirmed following the recent mid-term review 
which endorsed the proposed extension of the closing date.  Both implementation 
agencies (i.e., SAMSA and IOC) are performing satisfactorily.  The project’s audit 
reports for both implementation agencies have been submitted and are satisfactory.  
Financial management is being carried out in accordance with the Grant Agreement.  The 
project objectives are achievable, and a proposed reallocation of grant proceeds among 
the existing disbursement categories is being finalized by the recipient to send later for 
consideration by the Bank.  The survey of the marine route along the Mozambique 
Channel has been recently completed and the data has been transmitted to the U.K. 
Hydrographic Service to start the preparation of the electronic navigation charts of the 
surveyed corridor.  Also, the project is advancing with the revision of the country specific 
and regional oil spill contingency plans, preparation of environmental sensitive area 
maps, development of an ecosystems valuation methodology and establishment of a 
Regional Coordination Center for spill contingencies.  Recently the project was awarded 
a
US$100,000 grant from the European Space Agency to carry out sophisticated satellite 
imagery of the project area to complement project efforts in detecting oil spills and 
monitoring the surveyed corridor and the marine route. 
3. 
The proposed extension of the closing date is necessary to allow the necessary 
implementation period to fully deploy the marine highway and achieve all development 
objectives.  Delays at startup (which resulted from the coordination efforts required to 
bring on board eight countries and several international agencies) have now been 
overcome.  A satisfactory implementation plan has been adopted as part of the mid-term 
review completed recently.  The recipient’s request for extension has been endorsed by 
all participating countries in a Project Steering Committee involving representatives from 
Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, and 
Tanzania. 
4. 
This will be the first extension of the project.
