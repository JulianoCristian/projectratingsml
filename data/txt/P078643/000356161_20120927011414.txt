7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project's medium to long-term global environmental goals are to reduce the risk of ship-based
environmental contamination (such as oil spills from groundings and illegal discharges of ballast and bilge
waters) and to strengthen the capacity of countries to respond to oil or chemical spill emergencies in the
region. The project has three specific global environmental objectives. The first is to ascertain the
economic, technical, and institutional feasibility of introducing modern aids to navigation systems in the
region, such as an electronically supported marine highway, to guide ships through sensitive areas and to
encourage monitoring of the movements and activities of fishing and other vessels operating within
countries' territorial waters. The second objective is to support widening the existing regional agreement
(June 5, 1998) on port state control and implementation of its provisions. The third objective, focusing on
Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania, is to reduce risks of environmental damage to beaches,
fishing grounds, and other domestic resources from spills of oil and chemicals. This will be achieved by
supporting efforts of Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania to become part of a regional oil
spill response plan, by completing the identification and mapping of environmentally sensitive areas along
coasts and sea lanes, and support regional collaboration with the west Indian Ocean island states.

2.      Project implementation and achievement of development objectives are currently
rated as Satisfactory. The Project closing date was extended to December 31, 2012 after
the mid-term review (November 2010). Both implementation agencies South African
Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) and Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) are
performing satisfactorily. The project’s audit reports for both implementation agencies
for 2011 have been submitted; SAMSA’s audit report is satisfactory, and IOC’s audit
report is acceptable but some comments were forwarded requesting IOC to work with the
auditor’s to revise the report and ensure full compliance with our requirements. The
Project objectives are achievable. The survey of the marine route along the Mozambique
Channel was completed, and the data is now available in Electronic Nautical Charts
                                            1
prepared by the U.K. Hydrographic Service. The project has revised the country specific
and regional oil spill contingency plans, prepared environmental sensitive area maps, is
developing an ecosystems valuation methodology and is advancing with the
establishment of a Regional Coordination Center for spill contingencies. The Project also
implemented a US$100,000 grant from the European Space Agency to carry out earth
observation to detect oil spills in real time and monitor the health of selected coral reefs
along the surveyed corridor and the marine route.

3.     In a letter dated June 17, 2011, the Ministry of Water and Environment of South
Africa requested a reallocation of grant proceeds in accordance with the agreements
reached during the Mid Term review.

4.       The proposed reallocation from the unallocated category to category 2(b) finances
additional goods included in the Project Description which include oil spill combating
equipment kits by IOC. The reallocation does not result in a change to the project
activities nor require a modification to the project description in the Grant Agreement and
as such is considered to be minor in nature.
