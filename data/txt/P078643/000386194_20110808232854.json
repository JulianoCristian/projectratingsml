Project\n            implementation and achievement of development objectives are\n            currently rated as satisfactory.  The project closing date\n            was extended to December 31, 2011 after the mid-term review\n            (November 2010).  Both implementation agencies South African\n            Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) and Indian Ocean\n            Commission (IOC) are performing satisfactorily.  The\n            project's audit reports for both implementation\n            agencies for 2010 have been submitted; SAMSA's audit\n            report is satisfactory, and IOC's audit report is\n            acceptable but some comments were forwarded requesting IOC\n            to work with the auditor's to revise the report and\n            ensure full compliance with our requirements.  The project\n            objectives are achievable. The reallocation is necessary to\n            reflect: (i) the longer project period considering the\n            extension of the closing date to Dec. 31, 2012, already\n            approved (ii) actual costs of the various works, goods and\n            consulting services under the project, and (iii) larger than\n            anticipated in-kind contributions from the various\n            participating states and organizations."}, "docdt": "2011-07-20T00:00:00Z"}
