Lessons\n            reinforce that strong political will is necessary to\n            accomplish the degree of reform and improved efficiency\n            brought about in this project. Progress in projects with\n            major reform agendas can be expected to encounter\n            roadblocks, which require continuous follow-up and support\n            from donors and the government agencies involved. The\n            project had the full support of the Government at the\n            highest levels, and, managers were also strongly committed\n            to the project objective. On the Government side, support\n            for railway reform remained a priority, although it took\n            more time to carry out reforms that required Government\n            decisions. Moreover, a strong business base and demand for\n            services is important: road transport was not competitive in\n            the transport of phosphate between the mines and the ports,\n            (phosphate traffic accounts for 50 percent of the total\n            revenues), thus, the adjustment of phosphate tariffs,\n            including an escalation clause, which had been a condition\n            of the Bank's loan, eased the railway's financial\n            situation in the early project stages, and enabled\n            management to focus on restructuring. Yet, it is also\n            reiterated that for this type of project, major information\n            technology (IT) spending should be postponed until after\n            much of the restructuring and reform has been achieved,\n            particularly for large management information and control\n            systems, in order to ensure that it is appropriate for the\n            new management setting, and that the equipment will be\n            properly utilized."}, "docdt": "2005-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
