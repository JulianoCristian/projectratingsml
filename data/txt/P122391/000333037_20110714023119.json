and Housing Development Program is to\n            support the State Government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) to\n            strengthen its policies for planning and managing\n            territorial growth in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan\n            Region, promoting the provision of affordable housing, and\n            creating integrated social development programs targeted at\n            the urban poor. The State of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) is the\n            third largest in Brazil. The Metropolitan Region of Rio de\n            Janeiro (RMRJ), with a population of 12 million, is the\n            nation's second largest metropolitan area. As the\n            historical capital and a major tourism destination, the RMRJ\n            has special significance for Brazil. The region's\n            economy and urban growth have suffered considerably since\n            the 1970s as a result of the relocation of the capital to\n            Brasilia, as well as industrial restructuring, and social\n            problems. Rio's share of the country's population\n            and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined between 1970 and\n            2001. However, growth has recovered significantly in recent\n            years, and the RMRJ has entered into a new era of\n            development, supported by new industrial poles and the\n            opportunities provided by being the host city of mega-events\n            such as the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and the 2014 World Cup."}, "docdt": "2011-02-15T15:45:00Z"}
