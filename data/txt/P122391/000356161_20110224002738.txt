                   for planning and managing territorial growth in the Rio de
                   Janeiro Metropolitan Region (Região Metropolitana de Rio de
                   Janeiro, RMRJ), promoting the provision of affordable
Program
                   housing, and creating integrated social development programs
Development
                   targeted at the urban poor. The proposed operation is fully
Objective(s) and
                   consistent with and closely linked to the objectives of the
Contribution to
                   Brazil CPS, 2008-2011. In particular, through its prior actions,
CPS
                   the DPL will strengthen local governance at the metropolitan
                   level; boost competitiveness by supporting mechanisms that
                   facilitate infrastructure development; improve environmental
                   sustainability by protecting natural resources and assets; and
                   increase equity by reaching out to the most vulnerable.
                   The operation faces several types of risks, including (a)
                   economic and fiscal risks related to prudent management of
                   the GORJ's debt position and revenue uncertainty associated
                   with oil revenues; (b) political and institutional (possible delay

              RIO DE JANEIRO METROPOLITAN URBAN AND HOUSING
                         DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN


                                        I.     INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document presents a proposed two-tranche Development
Policy Loan (DPL) in the amount of US$485 million1 for the state of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. The operation supports the state government's strategy and policies to strengthen
efforts to plan and manage territorial growth in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region
(RMRJ), promote the provision of affordable housing, and provide targeted and
integrated social assistance programs to the urban poor. The DPL will support a
comprehensive set of policy reforms to improve the management of metropolitan urban
space, in line with the continuation of Rio de Janeiro's Program of Accelerated Growth
(PAC), and other urban, housing, and social programs.

2.      The State of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) is the third largest in Brazil. The RMRJ,
with a population of 12 million, is the nation's second largest metropolitan area. As
the historical capital and a major tourism destination, the RMRJ has special significance
for Brazil. The region's economy and urban growth have suffered considerably since the
1970s as a result of the relocation of the capital to Brasilia, as well as industrial
restructuring, and social problems. Rio's share of the country's population and GDP
declined between 1970 and 2001. However, growth has recovered significantly in recent
years, and the RMRJ has entered into a new era of development, supported by new
industrial poles (petrochemicals, metallurgical, port, logistics, and creative industries)
and the opportunities provided by being the host city of mega-events such as the 2016
Summer Olympic Games and the 2014 World Cup.

3.     Proactive urban and housing development strategies and policies are
urgently needed to ensure the reemergence of a competitive and green metropolitan
region that is environmentally sustainable and offers a high quality of life as well as
equitable access to opportunities and services. This is in contrast to earlier boom
periods (1960s and 1970s), which were accompanied by significant increases in informal
settlements (favelas) and the deterioration of old industrial neighborhoods. Of particular
concern is that future growth will be taking place in a fragile natural environment that is
highly vulnerable to natural disasters such as flooding and landslides. The government of
Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) has recognized the severity of the challenge and is addressing
them proactively.

4.      The proposed operation is the second DPL for the state of Rio de Janeiro,
following the successful implementation of a DPL (P117244) approved in December
2009. Both operations are closely linked to the proposed Technical Assistance Loan
(TAL), which is now under preparation and would enable the continued provision of
technical support to the state in the policy areas included in the DPL. The proposed
operation and associated Bank support meet the criteria for engagement with sub-national
governments as agreed under the World Bank Group's Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2008-2011 (Report No. 42677-BR) discussed by the Executive Directors on May
1, 2008, and the Progress Report (Report No. 53356-BR) discussed by the Executive
Directors on April 20, 2010. As specified in the CPS, the level of Bank lending must be
consistent with the credit ceilings specified in each state's Program of Fiscal Adjustment
(PAF) and must be approved by the National Treasury Secretariat (STN).

                              II.     COUNTRY AND STATE CONTEXT

A. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN BRAZIL

5.      The Brazilian economy rebounded quickly and strongly from the global
crisis and growth prospects are positive. The crisis first hit Brazil's financial markets
and then spilled over into the real economy. Between September and December of 2008,
the São Paulo Stock Market Index (Ibovespa) fell by 32 percent, sovereign spreads
increased significantly, and the Brazilian real (BRL) depreciated by 35 percent. The
financial turmoil curtailed external credit availability and created and a liquidity squeeze.
As a consequence, in the last quarter of 2008 and the first of 2009, Brazilian GDP
contracted significantly driven by a large drop in investment and declining commodity
prices. Economic activity picked up beginning in the second quarter of 2009 and GDP is
expected to grow at a rate of more than 7.5 percent in 2010. The fast pace of economic
recovery and buoyant domestic demand prompted the central bank to reverse its
monetary policies and increase the policy interest rate (SELIC) from 8.75 to 11.25
percent between April 2010 and January 2011. The strong economic recovery was
spurred by a number of countercyclical fiscal measures put into effect in 2010. However,
the fiscal policy turned pro-cyclical as the year progressed and the economy began to
overheat.

6.      The foundation for the economy's resilience to the recent crisis was the
macroeconomic stability of the past decade. This also helped set the stage for growth
and poverty reduction. Policies such as the fiscal responsibility law, the inflation
targeting regime, and a floating exchange rate helped create the favorable
macroeconomic conditions that resulted in significant reductions in debt and inflation
during the past decade.2 This has also led to lower interest rates and a deepening of credit
markets, and has made it possible for Brazil to reach investment grade in 2008.3 The
policy framework has also been instrumental in attracting foreign investments that have

  Inflation (as measured by the IPCA) dropped from an annual rate of 12.5 percent in 2002 to 4.3 percent in
2009, while net debt fell from 60.4 percent of GDP in December 2002 to 43.4 percent in December 2009.
3
  The SELIC fell from 19 percent in January 2000 to 10.75 percent in December 2010. Credit currently
stands at 47 percent of GDP.

                                                   -2-
helped finance the widening current account deficit. Strong economic growth has also
made it possible for the Brazilian government to undertake initiatives to reduce poverty
and expand equality.4 As a result, more than 10 million new jobs have been created in the
formal labor market since 2003 and real wages have increased.

    According to IPEA-the Brazilian Institute for Applied Economic Research

                                                     -3-
7.      The rebound in economic activity in 2009 was led by high-paced growth in
private consumption. Household consumption, which was fueled by tax breaks and
aggressive lending from public banks in 2009, continued to play a major role in 2010.
Investment, which declined precipitously between the third quarter of 2008 and the first
quarter of 2009, has made an impressive recovery. Government consumption as a share
of GDP remains strong, rising by 3.3 percent. Although the trade balance remains in
positive territory, the growth in imports outpaced that of exports in 2009 and 2010 due to
lack of global demand and the appreciating exchange rate. While this helps to increase
the capital stock, it has a negative impact on GDP growth. Exports are expected to
continue to grow in the next few years, led by growth in commodity exports.

8.      Following rapid growth for most of 2009, industrial production and capacity
utilization stabilized in 2010 close to their pre-crisis levels. Although consumer and
businesses confidence have remained high, the stabilization of industrial production in
the past six months reflects some cooling of the economy, which can be expected after
the strong rebound. However, employment indicators continue to improve.
Unemployment hit a record low of 6.2 percent in September 2010, and wages and new
jobs have increased.

B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

9.      The economic outlook for the medium term is for reasonably high growth (in
the range of 4 to 4.5 percent) led by strong domestic aggregate demand, particularly
private consumption. Also contributing to increased demand are record low
unemployment, rising wages, high consumer and business confidence, and (despite a
recent slowdown) private sector investment.

10.    This positive outlook is marred by fiscal, external, and monetary policy
challenges that the newly elected government will have to address. The main
challenge is finding the right mix of fiscal and monetary policies to support continued
growth without spurring inflation or having a negative impact on international
competitiveness. A tighter fiscal policy helps lower inflationary pressures by creating the
conditions for lowering interest rates and public sector debt. The impact of fiscal policy
on public sector savings and the investment gap also has repercussion on the current
account balance. There are growing concerns that the appreciation of the real will lead to
declines in the competitiveness of Brazilian exports.

11.     Longer term challenges revolve around reducing supply-side bottlenecks and
improving the business climate. A crucial issue in this regard is the lack of long-term
credit markets and relatively high interest rates, which thwart the ability of businesses to
increase production to meet domestic demand. It also restricts the country's ability to
increase medium-term infrastructure investments. Government efforts to increase the
supply of long-term financing are already underway, but more remains to be done.




                                           -4-
Fiscal Policy

12.     The main short-term challenge is to carry out needed fiscal policy
adjustments. Fiscal policy was appropriately countercyclical in 2009, but it turned pro-
cyclical in 2010 due to rigidities in current expenditures (affecting over 80 percent of the
budget); difficulties in reversing some measures implemented in 2009; and the fact that
2010 was an election year. Treasury funding of directed lending through Brazil's
National Development Bank (BNDES) reached R$100 billion in 2009 compared to R$29
billion in 2008, allowing BNDES to increase its disbursements by almost 50 percent in
2009. Despite the recovery in economic activity and credit markets, Treasury funding of
BNDES stood at R$80 billion in 2010, well above pre-crisis levels. At around 2 percent,
the primary fiscal balance is lower than had been targeted for 2009 and 2010, although
accounting rules involving public enterprises have allowed the government to add 1
percentage point of GDP to the primary surplus. While the level of the primary surplus
does not raise concerns about medium-term sustainability, it does point to the need for a
fiscal adjustment process to meet fiscal targets. Expenditure restraints and efficiency
gains are necessary to increase investment and decrease the gross public debt to GDP
ratio.5 Table 2 shows that the primary surplus is expected to reach the 3 percent range in
2011-2013 and that gross debt is expected to decrease to around 55 percent of GDP by
2013. However, this will require a careful balancing of investment and social spending
needs with the tighter fiscal policy needed to reduce external financing and create the
conditions for lower interest rates. Lack of consistency among fiscal, credit, and
monetary policies could become a medium-term risk to the economy.

Monetary and Financial Policy

13.      Monetary policy will focus on keeping inflation under control by tightening
interest rates. The central bank responded to the global financial crisis by cutting interest
rates to stimulate consumption and investment. Resulting inflationary pressures led to a
tightening of monetary policy and a reversal of most cuts in reserve requirements and
other steps taken to support capital adequacy during the crisis. Inflation, as measured by
the consumer price index (IPCA), dropped from 6 to 4.2 percent between January and
October of 2009. Since then, it has fluctuated with strong domestic growth, higher
producer and food prices, central bank tightening, and changes in public spending. As a
result, it is expected that it will close the year at 5.8 percent, overshooting the central
bank's target of 4.5 percent. Forecasts for both the IGP-M (General Index of Market
Prices) and the IGP-DI (General Price Index - Domestic Availability) are that they will
reach 11 percent in 2010, reflecting the impact of commodity price increases on
producers.

14.     Credit availability fell considerably following the crisis, but public banks
(largely the BNDES) played a critical role in bridging the gap, contributing to a 20
percent expansion in credit in 2010. Improvements in employment and labor income
fueled consumer credit; however, delinquency rates increased by 23 percent in the last 12


5
  BNDES funding does not affect net debt but is reflected in gross debt, which is based on gross liabilities;
that is, public sector liquid and other assets are not netted out. The analysis and table present the gross debt.

                                                      -5-
months. The central bank intervened in early December to slow the pace of credit growth
by increasing reserve requirements from 8 to 12 percent for current accounts, and from
15 to 20 percent for time deposits. At the same time, capital requirements were raised for
loans to individual with tenors exceeding 24 months. The government has also adopted
rules to stimulate longer-term private investment and announced a series of measures that
could alter taxes and bank reserve requirements, and expand asset-backed securities,
thereby lessening the role of the BNDES in providing corporate loans.

15.    The financial crisis had an immediate impact on domestic markets, but
financial indicators recovered quickly. When financial turmoil hit global markets, the
Bovespa stocks index plunged, sovereign spreads widened, and the real depreciated.
However, since the beginning of 2009, the stock market index has risen by two-thirds,
sovereign spreads have returned to pre-crisis levels, and the real has appreciated. The
decrease in the sovereign risk measure was the result of relatively healthy sovereign
balance sheets, stable financial systems, strong domestic demand, and capital inflows. To
contain the appreciation of the real, the Treasury has increased dollar purchases well
ahead of debt.

External Sector

16.    The current account deficit is expected to widen in the medium term. As
economic activity recovers, investment is outpacing domestic savings and external
savings are needed to finance the gap.6 This is reflected in a shift in the current account
from a surplus equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 to a deficit of 2.5
percent in the second quarter of 2010. The deficit is expected to reach the 3 to 4 percent
of GDP range by 2013. Other factors contributing to worsening trade and services
balances include international travel out of Brazil and increasing profit remittances.

17.     Capital account flows are likely to continue to exceed the widening current
account deficit. Inflows have remained high reaching $27.6 billion in the third quarter of
2010. Despite significant outflows, net foreign direct and portfolio investment have
remained positive. High capital inflows have contributed to the appreciation of the real,
with negative implications for competitiveness. In the medium term, capital inflows are
likely to remain strong given high international liquidity and high interest rate
differentials between Brazil and the rest of the world, as well as sound macroeconomic
conditions and attractive investment opportunities. The government has responded
recently by increasing taxes on financial transactions of foreign fixed income investments
(IOF, Impostos sobre Operacoes Financeiras). A lull in the real's appreciation followed,
and the central bank increased its foreign exchange spot market purchases.

18.    The government's overall macroeconomic framework is deemed sustainable
in the medium term and adequate for the purposes of a DPL. Brazil's fiscal
framework provided the government with the flexibility to successfully respond to the
global financial crisis with an array of fiscal, monetary, and external measures to
stimulate domestic demand. Public sector debt is expected to decline in the future, despite

    Savings, which account for 15.5 percent of GDP, are 2.1 percentage points below investment.

difficulties in maintaining fiscal balance in the face of large investment needs and
pressures from current expenditure growth. Moreover, flexible exchange rates and
relatively large foreign reserves should be sufficient to protect Brazil from any potential
external crisis should an abrupt change in market sentiment reverse the trend in capital

C. RECENT SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE OF RIO DE
   JANEIRO

Economic Growth

19.     The state of Rio de Janeiro has the second largest GDP and the third largest
population in the nation. Rio de Janeiro's economy is second only to São Paulo's, and
roughly equivalent in size to that of Portugal or Venezuela. In 2008, the state's gross
domestic product (GDP) was $176 billion, or about 11 percent of national GDP. A deep
economic restructuring took place following the relocation of Brazil's capital from Rio to
Brasilia. As a result, economic conditions, which had been characterized by strong

                                                             -7-
growth, began to deteriorate and changed radically at the beginning of the 1980s. In
addition, to a widespread decline in investment, a distorted price structure wreaked havoc
with business expectations and manufacturing activity. The impact on Rio's population
was significant. The share of people living in favelas rose from 9.8 percent in 1970 to
12.4 percent in 1991. Currently, an estimated 1.7 million people in the city of Rio de
Janeiro (28 percent of the population) live in informal and precarious settlements.7 Social
problems such as crime and violence also worsened.

20.     Since 2003, rapid industrial growth (in particular petroleum and steel) has
spurred renewed economic activity in the state. The discovery of oil fields in Bacia de
Campos has been a boon for Rio. It now holds Brazil's largest oil reserves (90 percent of
total) and accounts for 84 percent (as of 2006) of the country's oil production (up from 5
percent in 1978). This has revitalized industries that rely heavily on petroleum and had a
positive impact throughout the economy. The construction of a state-of-the-art port in
Itaguaí has prompted significant investments in steel and metallurgy, shipbuilding, and
logistics.8

21.     The structural transformation of the metropolitan economy is increasing
pressures for first-class infrastructure and amenities. The Metropolitan Region of Rio
de Janeiro is the country's second largest metropolitan area and includes 19
municipalities.9 The municipality of Rio de Janeiro dominates the region and is home to
53 percent of the area's 11.7 million people. Renewed economic growth has led to the
creation of two main growth zones. The petrochemical, metallurgical, maritime and
shipping (port), and logistics clusters are anchored around the port of Itaguai and its
surrounding industrial district to the west, and the Itaborai industrial complex to the east.
The other growth pole includes tourism, the creative and cultural industries, and
information technology (software). This pole is clustered in the South Zone, Barra de
Tijuca, Jacarepaguá, and Governor's Island.

22.     The state economy remained buoyant in 2010, with indicators of economic
activity rising above their pre-crisis levels. Capacity utilization reached a record high
83.7 percent in July 2010, up from 79.8 percent a year earlier. Industrial production
increased by 10.7 percent in the first half of 2010 compared to a year earlier. Indices of
employment and hours worked also peaked in July 2010, while the retail sales index
increased at annual rate of 14.7 percent, and the trade balance is improving.

23.   The staging of mega-events presents an unprecedented opportunity for the
RMRJ. Rio will be a flagship venue for the 2014 World Cup and it will also host the
Olympic Games in 2016. Additionally, it will host the World Military Games in 2011, the

  Data from Federação das Indústrias do Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN) shows that over R$28 billion in private
investments have been committed, including steel and metallurgy (R$18 billion), petrochemicals (R$6.8
billion), and shipbuilding (R$2.5 billion), (source Anuário Estatístico 2009).

Rio + 20 in 2012, and the FIFA Confederation Football Cup in 2013. These events
provide an opportunity to revitalize the metropolitan region and undertake lasting
structural changes. The challenge will consist in designing a comprehensive investment
strategy that maximizes local benefits. The capital investment projects that are being
undertaken for the Olympics are integral to Rio's development strategy (such as, for
example, construction of the Bus Rapid Transit-BRT- lanes), and are not expected to
have a negative impact on the state's budget because they are already contemplated in the
plan. The Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games will provide 31 percent of the
financing, while 45 percent will come from private sources, and the federal government
will provide 8 percent. In addition, the investments are guaranteed by the federal
government rather than the private sector, thus mitigating the risk that any additional
costs would fall on the state or municipality.

24.     New growth prospects for the state economy were boosted by the discovery of
offshore oil reserves in the Pre-Salt. Projections reveal that once the area is developed
it could produce 2 million barrels per day until 2020, equivalent to 3 to 5 percent of GDP.
The Pre-Salt will play an important role in the economy, bolstering energy independence
and exports. The impact on the state of Rio de Janeiro will be significant. Baseline
projections show that oil production could reach 20 percent of the state's GDP by 2020.
Yet, there is some uncertainty about the extent to which these benefits will accrue to the
state, given that new oil revenue-sharing rules could significantly reduce the share
allocated to Rio de Janeiro.

Recent Fiscal Developments

25.    After three debt bail-outs from the federal government between 1989 and
2001, the establishment of a strict fiscal responsibility framework helped Rio bring
expenditures under control and increase tax collections. As a result, the budget
improved from a deficit of R$1.2 billion in 2002 to a surplus of R$2.2 billion in 2008.
However, a sharp decline in oil revenues resulting from the financial crisis contributed to
a 2.4 percent nominal decline in total revenues in 2009, despite a strong increase in tax
revenues of 8.6 percent. The small increase in current expenditures (2.1 percent), together
with a 152 percent increase in capital transfers, permitted an increase in public
investments of 56 percent compared to 2009. As a result, Rio has maintained its Standard
and Poors Investment Grade Rating since March 2010 and its fiscal outlook is positive.

26.     Tax collections improved in 2010, rising by 18.4 percent. Revenues from taxes
on goods and services (ICMS) rose by 19.2 percent in the first semester of 2010
compared to a year earlier. This was the result of increased efficiency in collections and
the strength of the economic recovery as well as the concomitant recovery of the oil and
gas sector. High oil prices have contributed to an increase in royalties from oil and gas
receipts of 85 percent during the first semester compared to a year earlier. Federal
government transfers reached R$107 million (an increase of about 5 percent) as a result
of increased revenue collections at the federal level. Disbursement of the R$873 million
Fiscal Sustainability, Human Development and Competitiveness DPL was also a
contributing factor.


                                           -9-
27.     State expenditures have increased and debt indicators recovered since 2009.
Payroll and recurrent expenditures increased by 14.7 percent and 13.5 percent
respectively in July-August of 2010. As of August 2010, state investments had recovered
(R$2.5 billion), almost reaching the level of the previous year. The conservative fiscal
policies of the past and high revenue growth rates made it possible to increase
expenditures without cutting investments or compromising the fiscal balance. The
primary balance has also shown a remarkable 46.8 percent increase in the same period.
Indebtedness indicators are once again declining: the net consolidated debt (NCD)/net
current revenue (NCR) ratio was at 141.69 percent by the end of August 2010, well
below its 162.91 percent level of December 2009. The total debt to net real revenue ratio
reached 2.10 in August of 2010.

Macro Outlook and Risk Analysis10

28.     The state's fiscal framework is considered adequate for the purposes of the
proposed DPL. According to baseline projections, the state's fiscal accounts will
continue to be sustainable in the medium term, and primary fiscal balances will remain
positive. On average, revenue growth is expected to exceed expenditure growth, leading
to a widening primary surplus. On the revenue side, the principal drivers for growth are
taxes and current federal transfers. Capital transfers are falling in real terms while other
current revenues grow gradually. Current expenditures are rising as a result of real
increases in employee compensation and sub-national transfers to the municipalities and
the National Fund for Housing of Social Interest (FUNDEB). The resulting fiscal
balances (i.e. the primary fiscal, the overall, and the gross operating balance) are
expected to record surpluses for the projected period, allowing the fiscal space necessary
for state investments.

29.     The state's forecasted public debt trajectory is considered to be sustainable
in the medium term. Based on the scheduled amortizations and interest payments, real
net consolidated debt is projected to rise slightly until 2013, after which it is expected to
fall rapidly until 2020, in line with escalating amortization. As a share of net current
revenue, net debt is expected to start declining in 2012, reaching 100 percent by 2020
from 152 percent in 2009, and well below the 200 percent limit set by the federal
government under the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). See Annex 4, Tables A4.5, A4.6,
and A4.7, for information on compliance with the FRL indicators, baseline fiscal and
debt projection for 2010 to 2020, and the assumptions for the projections, respectively.

30.    Fiscal arrangements between the state and federal and municipal
governments are deemed appropriate for the purposes of this DPL, and net
transfers are expected to remain stable in the medium term. Transfers accounted for
an average of 10 percent of total revenues during 2006-09. A third of these revenues
comes from the federal government (through tax transfers); another third comes from
FUNDEB11; and the final third represents capital transfers through convênios.12 Transfers

averaged 23 percent of total expenditures between 2006 and 2009. The state transfers a
share of its tax receipts (from ICMS and IPVA) as well as a portion of oil royalties. It
also contributes to FUNDEB. Two thirds of state transfers went to the municipalities and
the remainder to FUNDEB. Rio's net transfers are negative. In other words, transfers to
the municipality and FUNDEB exceed current and capital transfers from the federal
government and from FUNDEB. In the medium term, current transfers from the federal
government are expected to increase. The same is true of transfers to the municipality,
which will respond to the steep increase in projected revenues (primarily from the
ICMS). Capital transfers are projected to fall in real terms and royalties (which accounted
for 11.5 percent of current revenues in 2009) are projected to account for an almost
constant share of current revenues in 2020. The risk analysis contemplates various
royalties scenarios (see Table 3 as well as Table A4.9 in Annex 4).

     Box 1. Fiscal Federalism and Control of Sub-National Fiscal Performance
 The fiscal policies of Brazilian states have always been an important element in national macroeconomic
 management. Until the late 1990s, the states' expansionary fiscal policies and lack of effective controls over
 their indebtedness resulted in frequent sub-national debt crises. The federal government had to assume and
 reschedule these debts on three occasions (1989, 1993, and 1997). The largest operation occurred in 1997 (Law
 9496) when the federal government restructured R$200 billion (equivalent to 12 percent of national GDP) in
 state debts for 30 years. This refinanced debt carries a real interest rate of 6 percent (the nominal value of the
 debt rises with inflation). The refinancing agreement caps debt service at 13 percent of the states' net current
 revenues. Any debt service above the cap is recapitalized and added to the existing debt. If there are residual
 debt balances at the end of the contract period (2028), the state must pay it off within 10 years.



12
   Convênios are cofinancing agreements with the federal government. These grew almost fourfold and
finance increased public infrastructure investmenst under the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC).
Transfers from convênios are expected to continue to grow because the second phase of the program (PAC-
2) includes additional public investment projects to be undertaken in 2011-14.

                                                                   - 11 -
 A condition of the 1997 rescue package was that the states comply with medium-term fiscal adjustment and
 structural reform programs. The states must implement three-year rolling fiscal adjustment programs (PAFs) that
 set annual targets on indebtedness, primary balances, spending on personnel, tax revenues, and public
 investment. These targets are structured to guarantee that indebtedness declines gradually. In addition, the PAFs
 include public sector modernization initiatives such as privatization.
 The Fiscal Responsibility Law (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal, LRF), which was approved in 2000,
 institutionalized fiscal discipline at all levels of government, incorporating hard budget constraints into a single
 unifying framework. It explicitly prohibits debt refinancing operations between different levels of government,
 thereby addressing the moral hazard problem caused by sequential bailouts. Complementary Senate resolutions
 also prohibit borrowing if: (a) the net consolidated debt exceeds twice net current revenue (Receita Liquida
 Corrente, RLC),13 (b) new credit operations exceed 16 percent of RLC, and (c) debt service exceeds 11.5
 percent of RLC. Borrowing is also prohibited if it violates the debt reduction schedules established by the debt
 renegotiation contracts. Finally, the emission of sub-national government bonds is prohibited through 2016;
 however, states whose net debt is less than net current revenue can issue bonds after 2011 (although the federal
 government may review the decision to issue bonds). This system of controls has had a significant impact, which
 is reflected in state and municipal surpluses that have continued through four federal administrations and the
 adoption of appropriate expenditure programs by sub-national governments. In addition to controlling
 indebtedness, FRL requirements improve transparency, and strengthen budgetary practices and the application of
 the so-called golden rule.
 Transparency: Municipalities and states are required to report annual fiscal outcomes and compliance with the
 LRF to the Ministry of Finance. If there are budget overruns, or other provisions of the program are breached,
 they must provide statements of the steps that will be taken to rectify such problems. The legislative branch of
 each level of government is responsible for monitoring that the fiscal targets and ceilings are met.
 Budget Institutions: The LRF introduces more stringent requirements on fiscal targets in the preparation of the
 Budget Guidelines Law (Lei de Dotações Orcamentárias, LDO), strengthening its role in budget preparation and
 fiscal management in general. The LRF also calls for a detailed assessment of the government's contingent
 liabilities and strengthens the link between the Annual Budget Law (Lei de Orçamento Annual, LOA) and the
 LDO. A complementary Fiscal Crime Law applies to all levels of the public administration; public officials not
 complying with the LRF may be prosecuted.
 Golden Rule: To prevent the financing of current spending by borrowing, the amount of new loans contracted is
 limited to the amount of the capital expense. In practice, this means that any loans that are entered into can only
 be destined to expenses related to investments.

31.     The risk analysis (see Annex 4) shows that projected fiscal and debt trends
are sustainable regardless of assumptions made with respect to adverse
macroeconomic shocks. Under pessimistic assumptions, the scenarios show a rise in
both nominal revenues and expenditures; however, in real terms both fall. Lower growth
rates have a large negative impact on current revenues, which fall by more than current
expenditures. Higher increases in the workforce are reflected in higher employee
compensation expenses, and the deteriorating exchange rate leads to increases in interest
rates. Despite these adverse effects, both the primary and overall balances remain positive
throughout the period, and there is fiscal room for investments. The total net consolidated



13
   Net real revenue (RLR) is defined as total revenues less credit operations, asset sales, capital transfers,
transfers to municipalities, FUNDEB contributions, and the social security contributions of civil servants
that opt out of the state system. RLR is smaller than the RLC used in the PAF. Also, the debt contracts
cover only the central state governments while the LRF includes the consolidated state public sector. In the
same vein, the debt renegotiation contracts use gross debt for state indebtedness while the LRF uses the net
consolidated debt.

                                                   - 12 -
debt rises steeply, reaching 168 percent of net current revenue in 2012, and then falls
steeply to 141 percent in 2020.

32.     There is much uncertainty surrounding royalty revenues. These risks stem
from three issues: (a) potential fluctuations in oil and gas prices in tandem with changes
in global prices; (b) the volume of existing and extractable oil and gas; and (c) the impact
on revenues from royalties resulting from the revenue-sharing rule applied to total oil and
gas revenues. The risk analysis (Annex 4, Figures A4.7 and A4.8) show that the fiscal
accounts are sustainable under the scenarios considered, with investment adjusted to
mirror the loss in revenues.

33.     Fiscal and debt trends for the government of Rio de Janeiro remain
sustainable in projections that include shocks from increased expenditures for the
upcoming World Cup and Olympic Games. The state government will incur
expenditures related to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics of R$200 million (for
the reconstruction of the Maracanã stadium) and R$472 million (for added security),
respectively. An additional R$3.2 billion in transportation investments will also be
required for the Olympics. The risks analysis (Annex 4) shows that additional capital
investments to meet these needs can be undertaken. In addition, the state budget (or fiscal
space) is such that other investments are not likely to be affected or crowded out.

Urban Development

34.     Rio's territory is spatially constrained and environmentally fragile. Urban
growth requires area-wide, integrated planning and coordination for housing
development, transport, environmental protection, and disaster risk management.
With faster population growth in the outer municipalities, urban settlements have
expanded into marginal land, creating a vulnerable situation that is exacerbated by the
low capacity of municipal governments to plan for and supply basic services. The
peculiar topography of the region and shortage of affordable housing have led to the rapid
growth of informal settlements, many of which are located in environmentally fragile
hillsides that are susceptible to serious flooding and landslides. This situation is worsened
by the lack of affordable and fast transport linkages to the city center.

35.      The lack of effective area-wide institutions to plan and oversee urban
development is a critical problem in the region. The legal framework for a regional
institution was set up by State Law #87 (1997), which created and legally organized the
Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region. In addition, the legislation ascribes to the RMRJ
responsibility for economic and social development planning, basic sanitation, urban
transport, gas distribution, water resources, pollution control and environmental
protection, cartography and planning information, and housing and land use regulation.
The state government is the RMRJ's executive agency, and representatives of all 19
municipalities, together with representatives of the state government, the state legislative
branch, civil society, and community organizations make up a deliberative committee. 14
However, the committee has not yet begun functioning. As a result, there is a lack of


14
     Decisions made by this committee are enacted if the state governor does not object to them.

                                                     - 13 -
coordination between the state and municipalities over metropolitan planning,
development, services, and economic decisions.

Box 2. Coordination between the State and the Municipalities

 Brazil's 1988 Constitution accorded the same status to states and municipalities, as a means of providing
 municipalities with primary responsibilities for matters of municipal importance, and states with the
 remaining ones. However, these functional responsibilities are defined in general terms, and often overlap.
 Additionally, municipalities are responsible for developing urban master plans, as well as some public
 transportation plans, and have recently acquired increasing responsibility for infrastructure investments
 that will affect the economic and social growth of communities. Not only are municipalities the main
 service providers in Brazil, but they also account for more than half of public investment, and for 82
 percent of social expenditures on housing and urban infrastructure.

 One of the main challenges facing the decentralization scheme is coordination and joint planning among
 federal, state, and municipal governments. Although most official roles and responsibilities of the
 different government levels are outlined in the Constitution, actual administration is heavily influenced by
 politics. In addition, differences in government structure and function, and the complexity of working
 with Rio's 19 municipalities create additional challenges.

 Improving the institutional capacity of municipalities is also a priority. The increased responsibility
 assigned to municipalities by the Constitution has raised questions of financial accountability and fiscal
 management capacity. Government programs include efforts to improve the financial outlook and
 responsibilities of municipalities by working to increase the quality of municipal financial management,
 with an emphasis on tax collection and revenue generation, financial planning, investment decisions, and
 participatory budgeting. Federal, regional, and state programs that address these issues are well regarded
 and important. Better coordination and information sharing among these programs would improve their
 effectiveness.
 Source: World Bank, 2003.

36.     One challenge for regional coordination is integrating transport tariffs.
About half of the RMRJ's 20 million daily trips are on public transport modes (bus,
suburban rail, the Metro, etc.) and are being operated by different agencies, including the
state government, municipalities, and private operators. The lack of coordination and
integration of ticket prices makes it difficult for passengers to take full advantage of the
services, and has a relatively greater impact on the poor.

37.     The large infrastructure investments foreseen for the Olympics Games will
have a significant impact on metropolitan growth, enhancing and redistributing
accessibility. Investments have been carefully planned to maximize the benefits to the
city and give priority to public transportation. Plans include improvements to the
suburban rail system, extending one Metro line, and building four rapid transit bus
corridors. The current plan will considerably increase access in areas such as Deodoro
and Barra da Tijuca, providing better linkages to the Central and South Zones. In turn,
reductions in commuting time to the major job centers in the South Zone and downtown
will reduce one of the main constraints to the supply of housing and provide opportunities
for housing development.

38.     The proposed new metropolitan beltway/expressway (Arco Metropolitano)
will facilitate the movement of cargo to and from the port of Itaguai by connecting it

                                                  - 14 -
to the national highway to Belo Horizonte. The project will be largely financed through
the federal government's PAC program. Construction of the beltway will open up new
areas in the periphery to urban growth. While the project will increase mobility, the
challenge is to manage metropolitan growth to prevent sprawl and maintain connections
to the urban core. It is likely that the beltway will also increase growth along highway
corridors, creating a need for proactive planning and growth forecasting to protect the
environment and maintain a high quality of life for local residents.

39.     Because of the region's unique and fragile environment and the degree to
which it is intertwined with urban settlements, environmental regulations become a
crucial element of urban development policy. The region encompasses three very
different geographical areas: isolated coastal massifs, lowlands, and mountains.
Approximately one fourth of the area still contains natural vegetation, including forests,
mangroves, salt marshes and beaches that are essential to maintaining environmental
balance. The confluence of natural characteristics (high rainfall, high mountains
relatively close to the coastline, and the presence of lowlands subject to tidal influence)
with dense and precarious urbanization creates a fragile environment characterized by
environmental degradation, inadequate urban occupation, and pollution. In addition, it
exposes residents to risks such as floods and landslides, which could be exacerbated by
climate change. Urban occupation patterns in lowlands, floodplains, and river banks
create serious environmental harm, and make the maintenance and cleaning of rivers and
canals more difficult and expensive. These settlements demand large investments in
drainage and flood protection.

40.     Disasters have negative impacts on the population as well as on the state
economy. In the last four years, disasters displaced more than 100,000 families in the
state, and had a direct impact on the housing deficit. Disaster risks have yet to be clearly
identified and mapped in many areas of the RMRJ. Environmental degradation, irregular
urban occupation, and disaster risk affect poor residents most heavily.

41.      The environmental regulatory agency is the State Institute of Environment
(INEA).15 The agency's mission is to protect, conserve, and restore the environment
and to promote sustainable development. INEA implements state policies, programs,
services, and regulations, and works under the umbrella of the State Secretariat of
Environment (Secretaria do Estado do Ambiente). It operates as a decentralized
institution with nine entities (superintendents) based on hydrographic regions. This
institutional design combines environmental management with water resources
management, allowing for the improved provision of services, and the establishment of
better monitoring and accountability mechanisms, as well as the active participation of
civil society. INEA's capacity for conducting independent and professional regulation is
critical to achieving its objectives. Thus, it is important to ensure that the agency has
sufficient staff and reliable resources. Another challenge for INEA is the ability to



15
  INEA was created in 2007 by merging three other state agencies: Fundação Estadual de Engenharia e
Meio Ambiente (Feema), Superintendência Estadual de Rios e Lagoas (Serla) and Instituto Estadual de
Florestas (IEF).

                                              - 15 -
delegate responsibility for issuing environmental licenses to the municipalities in cases
where impacts are only local, while ensuring the quality of the decentralized process.

42.      SIEDEC (Sistema Estadual de Defesa Civil, the state civil defense system) is
an advanced disaster response system. However, while coordination between state
agencies and their counterparts at the municipal level is good, the ability of each
municipality to respond to a disaster differs. Today, only the municipality of Rio de
Janeiro has the capacity to respond to disasters, while nearly all other municipalities rely
on the financial and operational support of the state. The state is moving toward a more
proactive approach in the area of disaster risk management,16 establishing an inter-
institutional working group formed by state organizations.

Housing

43.     New housing construction is needed to fill the housing gap in the Rio de
Janeiro Metropolitan Area. Approximately 48,000 new housing units are needed
annually to accommodate the increase in population in the region. In addition, nearly
38,000 housing units are needed to resolve the existing housing deficit over a 10 year
period. Table 4 shows the region's total housing deficit in 2007, which was equivalent to
79 percent of the total housing deficit for the state (which, in turn, accounts for 7.6
percent of the nation's total housing deficit).17 Families earning up to 3 minimum wages
account for 91 percent of the housing deficit in the region (see Table 5).

44.     Government action is required to deal with the inadequacy of the existing
housing stock.18 The government needs to make in-situ housing improvements (land
tenure regularization, infrastructure upgrading in underserved or unserved areas) rather
than build new housing. However, this is complicated by methodological shortcomings in
the calculation of the proportion of the housing stock that is inadequate.19 As a result, the
housing stock in need of land tenure regularization, which was 86,713 units in 2007, is
widely viewed as an underestimate.




16
   The difference between disaster management and disaster risk management is that disaster management
focuses on the response to an event, while disaster risk management focuses on activities to prevent or
minimize the negative effects of an event, in addition to preparedness and post-disaster response.
17
   The housing deficit includes the following categories of housing: (a) precarious housing (i.e. units with
walls built of non-permanent materials); (b) co-habitation (i.e. more than one household in the same
housing unit); (c) excessive housing burden (i.e. a rent-to-income ratio exceeding 30 percent, applicable to
families earning up to 3 minimum wages); and (d) overcrowding in rental units (i.e. more than 3 persons
per room).
18
   According to the Ministry of Cities and the FJP, inadequate housing is defined as: (a) housing with land
tenure problems; (b) overcrowding in owned units (i.e. more than 3 persons per room); (c) inadequate
roofing (not built out of permanent materials); (d) absence of private sanitary facilities; and (e) inadequate
infrastructure (i.e. housing that does not have, at minimum, one of the following: electricity supply, piped
water supply, sewerage through piped system or septic tank, and/or solid waste collection).
19
   The problems include: (a) double-counting under the different sub-categories, which prevents the
calculation of a total figure; (b) double-counting with the housing deficit; and (c) undercounting of the
stock with land tenure issues because the data is based on self-reporting.

 45.    The share of families living in informal settlements is high and growing.
 According to the Instituto Perreira Passos (IPP), there were an estimated 1,172,000
 people living in favelas in the Rio de Janeiro municipality in 2010. It was further
 estimated that another 528,000 persons live in informal or illegal subdivisions. This
 means that 28 percent of the municipality's residents currently living in homes with an
 inadequate or insecure land tenure situation.

 46.     The GORJ has made significant efforts to improve housing. While the federal
 government transferred R$1.6 billion to the state between 2008 and 2010 for slum
 upgrading projects, the government of Rio de Janeiro increased its counterpart
 contribution from the expected 20 to 27 percent, for a total R$3 billion intervention
 whose activities include improvements in the water supply, the urbanization of 5 slums,
 establishment of a sewage system, and housing construction for low-income residents of
 15 municipalities. The program is expected to benefit 2 million inhabitants.

 47.   The formal market barely fulfills 65 percent of total annual housing demand.
 While annual housing demand reaches 48,000 units, the formal market is only able to

                                                  - 17 -
supply around 30,000 units. In addition, only 48 percent of the homes built by the formal
sector20 are offered for less than R$130,000. Enactment of the Minha Casa Minha Vida
(MCMV) program has had a positive impact on the supply of formal housing units for
families with limited incomes. Research suggests that prior to the launch of the program,
95 percent of housing starts by formal private developers were for units costing more
than R$200,000.

48.     The MCMV Program is having a significant impact in the RMRJ. According
to the State Company for Housing and Public Works (Companhia Estadual de Habitacao
e Obras, CEHAB), the MCMV target for the state of Rio de Janeiro is 74,675 units.
Caixa Econômica Federal (the program implementing agency) has a target of 67,633
units for the state, corresponding to 20 percent of the housing backlog in the year 2000.
Figures from Caixa show that up to March 2010, the agency had reached 94 percent of
the state's target. The poorest families, those earning between 0 and 3 minimum wages,
account for 58 percent of approved units and 46 percent of those under consideration. An
additional 23,314 units had been approved by April 30, 2010. The municipality of Rio
leads the way in attracting MCMV subsidies. An efficient fast tracking approval
process for MCMV licenses means that some approval times for the municipality were
reduced from months, or even years, to just weeks.

49.    More needs to be done to complement the MCMV (especially for 0-3 MW
families). While MCMV is the dominant housing subsidy program in Rio, there are three
smaller programs that serve the state as well as the municipalities. They are Pró-Moradia
(which is part of the PAC); the Programa de Arrendamento Residencial, PAR; and the
Fundo Nacional de Habitação de Interesse Social, FNHIS. In addition, the municipality
of Rio runs two housing programs: Favela-Bairro and Programa Novas Alternativas.
Favela-Bairro, now in its third phase, focuses on upgrading infrastructure and improving
housing conditions in favelas. The Programa Novas Alternativas focuses on renovation
and new construction in infill areas in downtown Rio, and on promoting economic and

  The formal housing sector refers mostly to members of Rio's real estate developers association, Real
Estate Management Association (ADEMI, Associção de Dirigentes de Empresa do Mercado Imobiliário).

social development. The municipality of Rio de Janeiro just launched the Morar Carioca
Program to upgrade 582 informal settlements and benefit 320,000 households.

50. It is estimated that R$3.45 billion per year are required to address the state's
housing needs. This figure, which includes annual demand as well as reducing the
accumulated housing deficit, was derived from programs currently being implemented.21
Extension of the MCMV program for a second phase means that eligible federal
subsidies would partially offset the state's annual funding needs for as long as Phase II is
being implemented. Despite continued federal support, this clearly represents a large
burden on the state's budget. New, lower cost alternatives (including the availability of
rental units) to enable limited income households to gain access to adequate housing
solutions are required. Other issues that need to be address to lower costs are land
assembly, access to credit, and capacity constraints in the construction industry.

Social Development

51.      In contrast to the declining nationwide trend, poverty in the city of Rio de
Janeiro has increased slightly. Poverty declined in Brazil from 28.8 in 1996 to 16
percent in 2008, while it increased in Rio from 9.6 to 10.2 percent. The social gap
between those living in favelas and in the asfalto22 is slowly closing, but Rio de Janeiro
remains a divided city. The average income of people living in the largest favela
complexes (representing five of the 32 sub-districts of the city) was 49 percent lower than
the average for persons with similar employment, education, gender, and race
characteristics in the remaining sub-districts. On average, favela residents had 6.6 years
of schooling in 2008, compared to 9.9 years in the rest of the city. But nothing epitomizes
the notion of a divided city as the fact that criminal organizations have replaced the
state in the regulation of social, economic, and political life in favelas.

52.     The social divide and opportunities gap remain more pronounced among the
young, resulting in marked differences in the transition to adulthood. Data on Rio's
youth from 2006-2008 show that poor youths living in favelas lack the educational
opportunities of their counterparts. There are three favela residents between the ages of
20 to 24 who have not completed primary school for every one such person in other areas
of Rio. There are stark differences in secondary school completion rates between city
youth, favela youth, and favela youth who are poor. The divide is most acute at higher
levels of education. The chances that a young favela resident will gain access to higher
education are 1 in 10. Larger percentages of poor youth residing in favelas are neither
working nor going to school compared to their counterparts who also live in favelas but
are not poor, as well as the total youth population. As a whole, youths who are residents

   The experience of the MCMV program has shown that a unit subsidy of about R$50,000 is needed to
provide private sector incentives for the construction of owner-occupied housing that meets all the
regulatory requirements for families earning up to 3 minimum wages. For households earning above 3 and
up to 10 minimum wages, private sector participation under the MCMV program requires an average
subsidy of about R$5,000 (with a maximum of R$23,000 upfront subsidy for households earning between 3
and 4 minimum wages). For urban upgrading projects, the FNHIS and Pro-Moradia programs allow a
maximum per unit cost of R$11,000.
22
   Asfalto refers to those neighborhoods that have paved roads, basic infrastructure and services.

                                               - 19 -
of favelas experience a shorter childhood and adolescence, taking on greater
responsibilities at early ages than their city counterparts.23

53.     Many children and youth living in favelas experience environmental, social,
and family conditions that hinder their development and successful integration into
society. They have a greater propensity to engage in risky behavior, including school
absenteeism, risky sexual behavior, delinquency, violence, and substance use and
abuse. The consequences of these behaviors are extremely costly to young people and
their communities in terms of their ability to make a successful transition to adulthood.
They include such negative outcomes as school dropout, unemployment, adolescent
pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, addiction, incarceration, violence, homicide,
and social exclusion.

54.     Since 1985, increasing numbers of Rio de Janeiro's approximately 1000
favelas have fallen under the control of local drug gangs. This has affected the
livelihoods, access to services, and social capital of the residents, as well as outsiders'
perceptions of them, diminishing their opportunities for social and spatial mobility
(Perlman, 2010). While the gangs provide occasional favors to individual residents to
garner their support, they have replaced the freely elected leadership of the residents
associations and maintain dictatorial control through the arbitrary use of excessive force.

55.      The results have been devastating for favela residents. A longitudinal study of
life in the favelas over the last forty years shows that many residents feel more
marginalized than ever, with the greatest change being the explosion of drug and arms
trade and the high incidence of fatal violence (Perlman, 2010). Almost one in five people
report that a member of their family has been a victim of homicide. The youth homicide
rate in favelas is estimated at seven times that of the rest of the city.

56.     While, in general, crime and violence have been declining at the state and
municipal levels, it is still among the highest in the country, and largely
concentrated in or around favelas. Rio went from being the most violent state in the
country in 1997 to being the fourth most violent in 2007.24 During the same period, the
city of Rio went from being the third state capital with the worst homicide rate in the
country (65.8 per 100,000) to 14th place in the ranking, with a rate of 35.7 (below the
national average of 36.6 per 100,000). A study by the Institute for Applied Economic
Research (IPEA) showed that homicides tend to be concentrated in or around favelas, and
that 60 percent of favelas are located in hot­spot homicide areas.

57.    While youth violence has dropped substantially in the city of Rio, it still
represents a major challenge, particularly in favelas. The homicide rate among young
people (15 to 24 years old) went from 138.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1997 to 85.6 in
2007. Although this represented a significant improvement, it is still higher than the
average of 83.2 homicides per 100,000 for the country's state capitals. Young males


23
  They tend to work more, leave the parental home earlier, marry earlier, and have children earlier.
24
  The homicide rate was 58.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1997 and it fell to a still extremely high rate of 40
homicides per 100,000 habitants in 2007 (Waiselfisz, 2010).

                                                   - 20 -
continue to account for the majority of victims and perpetrators of homicides. Young
people living in favelas are disproportionately victimized by organized and everyday
crime and violence, and by police responses to the violence; in addition, they are the
prime targets of criminal gangs.

58.     In an attempt to regain control of the favelas, in December of 2008 the
military police of the state of Rio de Janeiro embarked on a new program, the
Unidades de Polícia Pacificadora (UPP), or Pacification Police Units. The aim of the
UPP is to take back favelas that have been under the control of drug gangs and largely
excluded from police protection, confiscate weapons caches, establish a sense of safety
and order, and improve the historically antagonistic relationship between favela residents
and the military police through a permanent, visible, professional, hearts-and-minds
style police presence. The program involves a full-time (24 hour/day) well-trained peace-
keeping police force within the communities and the total disarmament of the traffickers.
The program has political support from federal, state, and municipal governments as well
as strong backing from the public. UPPs are currently operating in ten favelas and the
government plans to increase it to 47 by 2014.

59.     Initial reports on the effects of UPPs have been very positive and, despite
some skepticism, the general atmosphere is one of hope. A recent survey of favela
residents found that 86 percent of those interviewed in favelas with UPPs believed that
safety had greatly improved, and 72 percent felt that outsiders had greater respect for
them after the UPPs were put into place. Seventy-two percent of respondents living in
favelas without UPPs considered it a positive initiative, and 70 percent stated that they
would support UPPs in their community (IBPS 2010). In general, residents report feeling
a great sense of relief, and are enjoying reclaiming their public spaces and the liberty to
come and go as they please at any time of day or night. In addition, residents of areas
neighboring favelas are also benefiting. A study by the Housing Union SECOVI (O
Globo, 3/12/2010) found that the rental value of houses located near UPP favelas in the
South Zone had increased by 149 percent, while their sale value had increased by 59
percent. Impacts on school attendance are also evident. According to a series of articles
and surveys carried out by the daily newspaper O Dia (Vitória contra o tempo perdido,
07/24/2010), attendance in 10 public schools located in pacified communities has
increased.25

           III.     THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY
                                  PROCESSES

The Government Program

60.    The government of the state of Rio de Janeiro has launched a comprehensive
reform program to improve its effectiveness and efficiency in the provision of public
services, shifting from a model of bureaucratic routines to a results-oriented focus. To


25
  In the City of God favela (one of the most violent communities), school attendance increased by 90
percent after the introduction of the UPP. In another community, the main performance indicator that
measures the quality of basic education in Brazil, the Ideb, almost doubled when compared to 2007 data.

                                                - 21 -
this end, in 2007 the government launched an unprecedented strategic plan to set goals
and objectives (Plano Estratégico do Governo do Rio de Janeiro, 2007-2010). The plan
focuses on a set of nine priority areas: (a) the development of human capital; (b) the
expansion of preventive health actions and the modernization of the health system; (c)
economic development, attraction of investments, and technological innovation; (d)
renewal and strengthening of the public administration system; (e) social development,
productive inclusion, and citizenship; (f) the restoration of public safety; (g)
environmental sustainability; (h) the expansion and improvement of urban infrastructure
and transportation logistics; and (i) the promotion of culture and integration through
sports.

61.     The State of Rio has a clear and coherent medium-term development
strategy for the metropolitan region. The focus will be on reducing the concentration
of large investments and generating jobs, improving the integrated urban transport
system, improving environmental and water resources management, establishing
integrated social outreach and crime and violence prevention policies, and social housing
development. The strategic plan for 2011-15 is currently being finalized. The overall
direction established by the government prior to the October elections will continue, and
some key reform areas, including those supported by the proposed operation, will be
deepened. There is a strong consensus within the state government about the importance
of these core areas. While most state programs and investments in urban infrastructure
and housing receive federal support through the PAC program, the implementation of this
strategy reinforces the need to improve policy and institutional coordination within the
state administration, to leverage complementary investments and improve efficiency in
the short to medium term. This DPL will support government priorities in five of nine
areas included in the current plan, as justified in the attached Development Policy Letter
(see Annex 1). In 2011, the state government will also prepare a new 2012-2015 multi-
year plan (PPA), which will incorporate the medium-term strategy into the budget. The
GORJ will benefit from support from the TAL to build its long-term strategy.

62.     A monitoring system has been designed to support and guarantee the
adequate implementation of the plan. Different entities are responsible for monitoring
each particular type of project: structural projects are monitored by the Governor's Office
(Casa Civil); priority projects are tracked by the Planning and Management Secretariat
(Secretaria de Planejamento e Gestão ­ SEPLAG); and projects supporting large scale
operations are monitored by the State Secretariat for Economic Development, Energy,
Industry, and Services (Secretaria de Estado de Desenvolvimento Econômico, Energia,
Indústria e Serviços ­ SEDEIS). Additionally, project results must be systematically
validated.

63.    In order to ensure that the society as a whole supports the program and that
stakeholders remain actively involved, the plan also requires that citizens have
access to information, including information about the plan and the execution of the
strategic projects, allocated resources, beneficiaries, and results. To this end,
SEPLAG publishes an annual report on the outcome of the actions that were
implemented. This report is part of a set of State Accountability documents that must


                                          - 22 -
be submitted to the state's independent audit agency.26 Five annual reports have already
been published and are available at the Planning and Management Secretariat's website.

64.     The Special Committee for Urban Legacy (Comitê Especial de Legado
Urbano, CELU) constructed an Urban and Environmental Legacy Plan in March
2008 to coordinate development efforts for the city. The Plan, which falls under the
Olympic Games initiative, outlines the strengths and challenges of the current
transportation system, and establishes priorities for investments geared toward projects
that would allow the transportation system to support large fluctuations in ridership,
provide improved north-south and east-west mobility across the state, and connect more
isolated regions to the city center. The Plan goes beyond projects directly related to the
Olympic Games and includes structural actions and investment projects in several of the
policy areas supported by this DPL.

Public Consultations

65.      Rio de Janeiro's development priorities, including the policies supported by
this DPL, are embodied in the multi-year plan (PPA)27 and reflect not only rigorous
technical analyses, but also a participatory decision-making process established in
the state's constitution. The PPA, Annual Budget Law, and related government
initiatives are regularly and extensively discussed at the State Assembly, which has the
authority to revise and approve the government's proposals. The PPA is the subject of an
annual review by the State Assembly, at which time the government reports on the
previous year's performance in meeting the objectives of the Plan.
66.    Additionally, dialogue and actions promoted by the government of Rio de
Janeiro to support the policies proposed by the DPL include:



26
   This is a requirement of the Complementary Law No. 101, Fiscal Responsibility Law (Lei Complementar
nº 101 - Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal ­ LRF) of 04/05/2000.
27
   Each president, governor or mayor must present a PPA, or Plano Plurianual (multi-year plan), on the
first year of his/her mandate, establishing not only key priorities and strategies for the government`s long-
term projects, but also the related budget plan. The PPA was established by a federal law and is more
detailed and budget oriented than the strategic plan.

                                                   - 23 -
   a. Organization of Forum on Social UPP: Bi-monthly public meetings are held in
   the affected community. Their objective is to discuss each community's demands and
   priorities, as well as monitor planned actions. The forums are a unique opportunity to
   engage community leaders, the police, partner agencies, neighborhood associations,
   and local and state government authorities. They provide the first opportunity for
   citizens to participate in discussions about needed improvements in their quality of
   life and have been well received. By continuing to provide these opportunities for
   dialogue, the government is helping reestablish the links among citizens, community
   residents, neighborhoods, and the government, that will help build a sustainable,
   peaceful, and participatory environment.
   b. Creation of the State Fund for Housing of Social Interest and its Management
   Council (State Law 4.962/2006). This fund is a legal instrument that promotes civil
   society participation in the planning of state housing policy as well as monitoring its
   implementation. The management council is comprised of twelve members, including
   five representatives of state agencies, one from the municipality, and six from civil
   society. Council members meet every three months. They have deliberative power
   and can convene public hearings to debate issues of social interest. All municipalities
   that receive state funds are required to establish similar councils.

67.    UPP Social is characterized by a strong outreach strategy. UPP Social's
communication strategy is broad and involves targeted electronic and print media (radio
and print as well as social networking sites and blogs); and periodic open forums in target
communities. The forums at the community level are well-attended by a broad group of
residents as well as representatives of participating government institutions,
nongovernment associations, and formal and informal citizen groups. Youth engagement
and participation continues to be a challenge, and UPP Social is currently examining the
development of specialized outreach and communications efforts for this subpopulation.

68.     A poverty and social impact analysis was conducted during the DPL
preparation phase, as were consultations with key stakeholders. This consultative
process included meetings with: (a) representatives of residents of informal settlements
that were relocated away from areas at risk of disaster; (b) youth groups; (c) community
associations; (d) nongovernment organizations; (e) social movements; (f) labor unions;
(g) religious organizations with a long-standing record of working in informal and
precarious settlements; (h) scholars with research focusing on urban and metropolitan
development in Rio de Janeiro; and (i) police officers who work at recently pacified
favelas (UPP Santa Marta). These consultations addressed the main anticipated impacts
and risks that could affect housing and urban development. Their inputs were analyzed
and taken into account in the design of the policies supported by this operation.

69.     These key stakeholders agreed that social and economic inequality is the
main issue in RJMR and is reflected in a spatial distribution of inequality that is
reinforced by the lack of state investments in public services and infrastructure in
most settlements. They agreed that the re-taking of informal settlements previously
controlled by drug dealers and militias is essential for improving the living conditions of
poor residents, recovering their citizenship rights, and improving their participation in
civil society. They also pointed out that police activities must be complemented with
                                          - 24 -
other social interventions, including policies to improve lower-income housing, upgrade
informal settlements, and carry out in situ resettlements when poor families need to be
moved. Participants stressed four main issues as being of critical importance and a source
of concern: (a) the lack of metropolitan coordination and planning in the RJMR; (b)
previous policies that removed residents of informal settlements from central and highly
valued neighborhoods in the city to peripheral areas deprived of minimal public
infrastructure and services and distant from job centers; (c) the methods and procedures
that have been adopted recently to remove families from at-risk areas; and, (d) mass
transportation based on fossil fuels.

       IV.     WORLD BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

A. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LINK TO CPS

70.     Brazil and the World Bank Group have a long-standing partnership. The
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Brazil,28 recognizes significant achievements in
tackling development challenges using innovative approaches, and contributing to
shaping the global policy agenda. The CPS also responds to the demand for more flexible
and efficient products that are better suited to the country's evolving needs, while
maintaining a focus on key long-range development issues.
71.     The aim of this operation is to strengthen the partnership with the state of
Rio de Janeiro by addressing complex and challenging development issues that have
significant long-term implications. While the Bank's experience working with megacities
can be brought to bear, the experiences to be gained from these operations will be
valuable for other metropolitan regions in Brazil and throughout Latin America.
72.    The proposed operation responds to the needs of the state government of Rio
de Janeiro by helping it plan and manage territorial development, promote affordable
housing, and provide targeted and integrated social assistance programs to the urban
poor.

73.     The proposed operation is consistent with and closely linked to the objectives
of the Brazil CPS, 2008-11. It is one of a number of sub-national DPLs, SWAPs and
SILs that support the CPS pillars. In particular, through its prior actions, the DPL will
strengthen local governance at the metropolitan level, boost competitiveness, improve
environmental sustainability, and increase equity.
B. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

74.     IBRD support to the state of Rio de Janeiro has been limited to investment
projects in rural development and transport. The Second Rio de Janeiro Mass Transit
Project (approved in July 2009) supports improvements in rail transport services and in
the transport management and policy framework. The project provided technical



28
  CPS 2008-2011 (Report No. 42677-BR) discussed by the Executive Directors on May 1, 2008, and the
Progress Report (Report No. 53356-BR) discussed by the Executive Directors on April 20, 2010

                                              - 25 -
assistance in some of the areas supported by this operation. A Technical Assistance Loan
in support to the proposed operation is also under preparation.

75. Bank activities in Rio de Janeiro have shifted towards providing consolidated
support through large operations. The proposed operation follows the successful
implementation of the first DPL (the Fiscal Sustainability, Human Development, and
Competitiveness DPL), which was approved by the Board in December 2009 and
disbursed in May 2010. The first DPL was designed to assist the GORJ in sustaining its
efforts to improve fiscal management, competitiveness, and social service delivery in the
context of a temporary fall in revenues associated with the global recession. That loan
supports measures that: (a) strengthen fiscal consolidation by reducing long-term fiscal
risk, improving the efficiency of tax administration, and strengthening budget procedures
and financial management; (b) improve the quality and efficiency of the business
registration process; (c) improve the quality and efficiency of the basic education system;
and (d) increase access to health services and improve their efficiency, especially for
urgent and emergency health care in disadvantaged areas and for low-income
populations. The proposed operation is likely to be followed by a third DPL to address
issues related to poverty reduction and economic policy in FY2012.

76. Policy support under the operation complements other Bank support to the
state. Urban transport and climate change issues are not emphasized because they will be
addressed more in depth in forthcoming projects.

77.     Bank support to the state has been closely coordinated with that to the
municipality of Rio de Janeiro. The Consolidation for Efficiency and Growth DPL,
approved in June 2010, adopts a consistent and complementary approach to that of the
first Rio State DPL. Its aim is to align the levels of government (federal, state, and
municipal), while enhancing fiscal consolidation at the municipal level. This was the first
Bank DPL to a municipality.29

78. The Bank's program in RJ reflects a shift in approach to engagement with the
states, consolidating Bank partnership programs to strategic priorities utilizing a
wide range of instruments. Examples of this shift include fiscal adjustment and debt
restructuring DPLs (Rio Grande do Sul Rio Grande Do Sul Fiscal Sustainability Project,
P106767 and Alagoas Fiscal And Public Management Reform, P103770), and Sector
Wide Approach (SWAP) operations (Minas Gerais, P106765, Ceará, P106765,
Pernambuco, P106208, and Federal District, P107843).

79.     The proposed operation takes into account experiences from other Bank
operations in the urban development and housing sector. Bank support for Brazil's
efforts to reform the housing sector started over a decade ago and has continued
successfully. It includes the DPL for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector
Reform (P078716), which was completed successfully; the Housing Sector TAL


29
   The operation supports cities, which are at the core of public services provision, and are therefore
essential to promoting growth, reducing poverty, and ensuring that all citizens receive services of equal
quality.

                                                 - 26 -
(P050761), which closed in December 2010; the ongoing non-lending TA to housing
sector reforms accompanying the implementation of the MCMV program; and support to
policy formulation on low-income housing, urban upgrading, and urban development in
sub-national units such as São Paulo municipality and the state of Bahia.30 Bank support
for housing covers the institutional framework, housing subsidies and finance, land
regularization, and urban upgrading. All of these areas of ongoing support are important
for the proposed operation.

80.     The Bank is engaged in urban development efforts in 10 municipalities
through two series of municipal APLs. It also provided support to the states of
Pernambuco, Bahia, and Ceará through SILs. These operations support the four
strategic pillars of the urban strategy (competitiveness, livability, good finance, and city
as partners), and enable the Bank to gain on-the-ground experience in planning and
implementing investments and policy reforms in major urban centers in Brazil.

81.     The inclusion of disaster risk management in this operation takes into
account experience from the large portfolio of disaster response, vulnerability
reduction, and risk financing projects in Latin America and the Caribbean. Bank
support for disaster risk management has gone considerably beyond emergency response,
evolving into a broad set of instruments that complements Sector Investment Lending and
emergency operations. Lessons learned from these operations (such as methods planning
and institutional setups) have been incorporated into the proposed program.

C. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

82.      The proposed operation builds on extensive policy discussions and analysis in
the urban, housing, and social development sectors in Brazil. A 2006 Bank report
provides a comprehensive diagnosis as well as strategic recommendations on urban
development.31 It highlights four strategic priorities for policy development in Brazil:
competitiveness, finance (creditworthy cities), land markets and service delivery, and
institutional development (cities as partners). The report provides important insights
(particularly on land markets and regulation) for the current operation. More recent Bank
analytical work in urban development has focused on specific areas, such as City Growth
and Competitiveness (P101424) and TA on Green City Development (P118238).

83.     With more than 10 years of experience in providing analytical support on
housing policy reform and development, the Bank has a deep understanding of this
complex sector. This includes support for the development of the National Housing
Policy, the National Housing Plan, and a series of housing sector missions in the context
of the Housing Program DPL and the Housing TAL. The latter provide technical analysis
and recommendations on key issues of subsidy policies, housing finance, institutional
arrangements, and land management reform. In addition, the Bank has just completed the
first phase of technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance on housing finance aspects
related to the MCMV program, and the second phase of TA is underway. The Bank is

     The latter is being carried out with the Cities Alliance.

                                                    - 27 -
also providing support in the areas of housing subsidies and housing sector monitoring
and evaluation.

84.      The Bank has conducted several studies on crime and violence and on the
social dimensions of urban upgrading in Brazil. The most directly relevant to this
DPL/TAL is a new Economic Sector Work titled Bringing the State Back into the
Favelas of Rio de Janeiro. This study looks at the transformations taking place in the
living conditions of the favelas after the implementation of the UPP Program. Another
study, currently being completed, focuses on understanding the factors behind the drop in
violence in São Paulo and Belo Horizonte, and details certain factors such as schooling
and social cohesion. These studies add to those on youth at risk (P085164) and on crime
and violence (P094556), which provided an overview of trends and good practices in
Brazil. Finally, analyses of experiences and impacts of urban upgrading in São Paulo and
Salvador are also very useful references for the social development pillar of the proposed
DPL. For example, one output of these studies was the establishment of a geo-referenced
information system on informal settlements in São Paulo municipality (HABISP), which
is currently being reviewed by the GORJ for adaptation and replication. Another useful
initiative is a global project on upgrading informal settlements, led by the SDV anchor,
which focuses on the political economy constraints to upgrading. This project is helping
finance technical assistance to improve the social work component of slum upgrading in
the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region, and is coordinating dialogues on strengthening
the guidelines for social work in urban upgrading projects financed under PAC.

85.    Finally, based on the initial mission and research results, the Bank prepared
a draft policy paper in June 2010 on housing and urban development in RMRJ,
providing an updated diagnosis and policy recommendations. Many of the
recommendations have been adopted by the government and incorporated into the
operation.

D. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

86.     Since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not work directly with
state governments there has been no direct collaboration with the IMF on this
specific operation. However, the Bank and Fund teams work very closely on the overall
Brazil program. This is consistent with the Joint Management Action Plan (JMAP),32
which, in order to improve coordination at the country level, called for Bank and Fund
staff to consult at least annually in the preparation of their work programs.33 Brazil
country teams from the Bank and the Fund have also been meeting regularly. The
primary objective of these consultations is to inform the other institution of ongoing
projects and studies. The secondary objective is to share views about the direction and

  See IMF-World Bank, 2007.
33
  A February 2008 memorandum from the IMF Fist Deputy Managing Directory Lipsky and World Bank
Managing Director Wheeler addressed to IMF Heads of Area Departments and Bank Regional Vice
Presidents indicated that, beginning in April 2008, all Bank country teams and Fund missions preparing
CAS progress reports or Article IV consultations (whichever came first) should hold annual discussions to
pool analytic and diagnostic work, discuss macro-critical sectoral and other issues, and strategize over how
best to sequence needed analytic work.

                                                  - 28 -
effectiveness of the government's macroeconomic policies, and to coordinate and
influence each other's sectoral and macroeconomic priorities.

87.     The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is also active in the urban and
transport sectors in Rio de Janeiro. The government of Rio de Janeiro plans to borrow
$110 million from the IDB for the Tourism Development Program (Programa de
Desenvolvimento do Turismo ­ PRODETUR). PRODETUR has become an important
source of financing for investments related to the World Cup and Olympic Games. Three
important technical assistance operations in the sector are Structuring of the Corridor
BRT T5, Structuring BRT Corridor Metropolitan Express, and the Preparation Studies for
the High-Speed Train Line Rio de Janeiro - Sao Paulo ( BR-T1087). The Urban Renewal
of Rio de Janeiro's Historic Center (BR-T1037) project provided technical assistance to
strengthen the municipality's capacity for developing strategic plans for urban renewal.
The objective of the Rio de Janeiro Urban Improvement Program - III (BR-L1175)
investment loan is to improve living conditions in Rio's informal settlements through
infrastructure investments and the provision of social services.

88.     The IDB also provided social and environmental sector support to the
GORJ. The technical cooperation project Assistance Post Floods & Landslides - Rio de
Janeiro (BR-T1174), which was approved in April 2010, provides material assistance and
services to victims of floods and mudslides, and includes measures to reduce their
vulnerability to future impacts. Another operation (Community Participation for the
Prevention of Violence in the Favelas of Rio, BR-T1131, approved in December 2009),
will increase the quality and impact of other urban interventions. The technical
cooperation operation BR-T1174 (Employment Opportunities for Disadvantaged Youth
from Rio de Janeiro, approved in August 2009) helped improve the socioeconomic
situation of at-risk youth in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro through the consolidation
of job training and placement models. Finally, the Sustainable Development Plan for the
Sepetiba Bay technical cooperation project focuses on developing an investment program
for the recuperation and preservation of environmental conditions in the bay.

E. LESSONS LEARNED

89.    The proposed Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Urban and Housing Development
Policy Loan builds on and benefits from the Bank's long collaboration with the
government of the state of Rio de Janeiro, and state and municipal government
agencies. In particular, the policy content and priorities reflect relevant findings of the
Bank's extensive body of analytical work in Brazil, and the broader literature on urban
and metropolitan development. The design of the operation incorporates specific lessons
learned from the implementation of previous Bank-supported lending and non-lending
operations in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean. Chief among
these are the Fiscal Sustainability, Human Development and Competitiveness DPL
(P117244), the Housing DPL (P078716), and the Rio de Janeiro Municipality DPL
(P111665). Also informing the design of this operation were the lessons learned about
urban and social sector development issues through the implementation of a range of
investment operations.


                                          - 29 -
90.     Five main lessons result from the Bank's experience:

   i.   Lesson 1: The policy content and prior actions of an operation should reflect the
        borrower's program and priorities developed through a policy-making process
        that involves broad public consultation. This is essential to the borrower's
        ownership of the program and stakeholder support for it. The strongest evidence
        of the GORJ's commitment to the policies supported by the DPL is the sustained
        progress that has been made in implementing them. The Bank has added value to
        the program through its extensive collaborative lending and non-lending
        engagement with the government on housing, urban, and social issues.

 ii.    Lesson 2: The importance of maintaining a close dialogue with the state during
        the preparation of the proposed operation. The project team has worked in close
        partnership with the state government to define the measures that will be
        supported by the DPL, and to put in place arrangements to assist in their
        implementation over the medium term. The latter refers mostly to the
        Metropolitan and Urban Technical Assistance project, including strengthening the
        coordination of state and municipal policies and evaluating their impact. The
        Technical Assistance Loan that will follow the DPL will provide the framework
        for ongoing collaboration and engagement with the borrower through analytical
        and advisory services that are necessary to add value to the program.

 iii.   Lesson 3: Maintain continuity of support for the sector reform agenda. The
        design of a DPL with an accompanying technical assistance loan is conceptually
        strong because it facilitates the continuity of support for the sector reform agenda.
        As highlighted in the Brazil Housing DPL ICR, careful sequencing to ensure that
        the TAL is concurrent with the DPL is crucial. This design will also support the
        achievement of medium- and long-term goals and reforms, and improve the
        ability to measure outcomes.

 iv.    Lesson 4: The importance of coordination with the federal government. The
        experience of other DPLs demonstrates the importance of acting in a coordinated
        fashion with respect to different levels of administration.

  v.    Lesson 5: Prior actions should be limited to a few key policy and institutional
        reforms. Without such a focus, implementation by the borrower and supervision
        by the Bank risk losing sight of the operation's priorities. This operation has 8
        prior actions in its first tranche that are divided into three policy priority areas:
        metropolitan/urban, housing, and the social sector. The government and the Bank
        have agreed that these actions are essential.

91.    Many of the above lessons also reflect the conclusions and recommendations
that emerged from the August 2009 Development Policy Lending Retrospective. The
main conclusions are summarized in Box 3.

Box 3. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

 Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
 · Does the program design (PRSP process with participation/consultation, electoral platform, and
 parliamentary involvement) show evidence of ownership?
 · Does the country's track record indicate ownership and commitment to the program?
 · Has the Bank given sufficient policy space and does it understand the political economy of
 reform?
 · Is there analytical evidence to help with the process of policy formulation and is analytic work
 disclosed early enough and fed strategically into the government's policy-making processes?

 Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
 accountability framework
 · Is there an agreed accountability framework (e.g., policy matrix) for measuring progress under
 the program?
 · Is the accountability framework harmonized across the donor community? Is aid coordinated? If
 not, why not?

 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
 circumstances
 · Are modalities and timing of aid meeting country needs?
 · Is there evidence that policies reflect the government's expressed policy intentions? Do we have
 evidence that any sensitive policy reforms (privatization, trade liberalization, price and subsidy
 reform, user fees) are not only owned, but also reflect the country's circumstances and priorities?
 Are sensitive policy reforms backed by analytic work and have different policy options been
 evaluated?

 Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 · Are prior actions and conditions chosen from an agreed accountability framework and focused on
 critical actions for achieving the objectives of the program (e.g. activities to implement rather than
 action plans)?
 · Is there sufficient discipline in the use of benchmarks (<~20) and triggers (<~10) in the matrix
 that summarizes the Bank's operation?

 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
 based financial support
 · Is there a regular cycle of performance review under the program that is in line with the country's
 domestic accountability and M&E cycle, and conducive to predictable financial support? Is
 support aligned with the budget cycle where countries so request it and if not, why not? Are Bank
 support volumes announced in time to be incorporated into the budget?
 · Do reviews promote results focus?
         V.      THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR THE RIO DE JANEIRO
                 METROPOLITAN URBAN AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
                                  POLICY LOAN

A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

92.     The objective of the proposed operation is to support the state government of
Rio de Janeiro to strengthen its policies for planning and managing territorial
growth in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region, promoting the provision of
affordable housing, and providing targeted and integrated social development
programs to the urban poor. The proposed operation is a two-tranche development
policy loan. The first tranche ($290 million) will be disbursed once the loan goes into
effect, while the second tranche ($195 million) is contingent upon the government's

                                                  - 31 -
completion of additional policy actions, which will be set forth in the loan agreement
(including a set of objectives that are expected to be met by the end of 2011). The
selection of the three policy areas (urban development, housing, and social development)
for this operation reflects government priorities and their importance to long-term
sustainable growth in the RMRJ (see Table 8 and Annex 2).

93.    Disbursement of the first tranche would signal recognition of the GORJ's
continued strong fiscal discipline and reform-minded policies to strengthen urban,
housing, and social development. The disbursement will support a comprehensive set of
reforms to improve the management of metropolitan urban spaces, in line with Rio de
Janeiro's Program of Accelerated Growth (PAC) and other urban and social programs.
Disbursement of the second tranche would signal that the sector reform is being
continued and consolidated and that substantive results have been achieved.

94.     While the prior actions and tranche II release conditions are critical
indicators for loan disbursement, the policy actions supported by the Bank go
beyond them. The operation and the proposed TAL (currently under preliminary
preparation) support a much broader set of government policy actions in the three main
policy areas. Following good practice principles on conditionality (see Box 3), the policy
matrix uses a limited number of prior actions and release conditions, chosen because of
their importance to achieving results. These actions are part of a comprehensive reform
plan with a solid track record of implementation.

B. KEY POLICY AREAS

Policy Area 1: Strengthen Planning and Management of Livable and Sustainable
Urban Growth in the Metropolitan Region
95.     Government Policy Objectives: The government's objective is to ensure that
future urban growth will meet the spatial requirements of economic and structural
changes, provide a high quality of life in the RMRJ, as well as protect the region's
sensitive natural environment and mitigate disaster risks. Specifically, the priority areas
where actions are needed to achieve the objectives include metropolitan management,
urban environment, and disaster risk management.

1. A. Metropolitan Management

Challenges:

96.     The challenges of establishing an effective governance mechanism at the
metropolitan level are substantial. This difficulty exists across Brazil's metropolitan
regions. Brazil's metropolitan governance structure started to evolve during the 1970s
from a highly standardized metropolitan management imposed by the federal
government, to more flexible models determined by each state, combining compulsory
and voluntary forms of association between governments. The states, through qualified
state law (lei complementar), can create and organize metropolitan regions made up of
contiguous municipalities to establish the coordinated organization, planning, and
execution of public functions of common (shared) interest, such as water supply and
urban transportation.

97.    Although many states have created metropolitan regions similar to Rio de
Janeiro's (State's Complementary Law #87 of 1997), few function effectively. Most
lack coordination between the state and the municipalities over metropolitan planning
and development, service delivery, and decision-making to support economic
development.

98.      The challenges for metropolitan management in the RJMR are three-fold.
First, coordination among the agencies that deal with urban development in the region is
vital.34 Also, there is a need to strengthen the partnerships between the state and the
municipalities, and facilitate coordination and collaboration among the municipalities that
make up the RJMR. Finally, the overall institutional framework for coordination and
collaboration at the metropolitan level, including Law #87/1997, needs to be reviewed,
debated, and revised.

99.     Transport is a particularly important area for metropolitan-wide
coordination and integration because responsibilities for this service are shared by the
state and the municipalities, and a smooth linkage across jurisdictions in the areas of
infrastructure and services is paramount to service quality. One example of the challenge
of integrating the RMRJ is the need to institute a fare system for the entire metropolitan
region to facilitate public transportation use and lower costs. Residents have a range of
public transportation choices that are run by different entities, including suburban rail, the
metro, and bus and ferry service. Integrating tariffs between the different modes of
transportation would allow for more convenient and cheaper services and promote the use
of public transit. The challenge for making this happen is to ensure that the system's
many players agree on a common system and financial arrangements. In addition to the
coordination of tariffs, planning also needs to be improved. In this regard, what is needed
are region-wide technical studies integrating transportation and land use elements, while
also engaging in a process that involves the active participation of the various municipal
and state agencies. Other important urban transport issues (such as expanding public

  This involves the Secretaries of Infrastructure, Housing, Transport, Environment, Social Assistance,
Planning and Finance, as well as a number of public state entities.

                                                  - 34 -
transportation and linking it with land use planning) are being tackled by the upcoming
operations.

Government Program Supported by the Operation:

100. The operation supports a set of measures to address the challenges of
metropolitan management, including:

   Establish state level leadership on metropolitan planning and management
   issues by creating the Directive Committee for Metropolitan Strategy (headed by the
   Vice Governor of the state) and a Multi-sectoral Technical Working Committee
   (TWC), as required in Decree 42832 of January 2011 to strengthen the metropolitan
   region's governance structure. The multi-sectoral TWC includes staff from the
   Secretariats of Works, Housing, Social Assistance, Transport, Environment, Planning
   and Finance. The mandates of the Directive Committee and the TWC include: (a)
   coordinating all spatial development activities among various state institutions; (b)
   overseeing the development of the various spatial plans (including the Transport
   Master Plan, the Social Housing Plan, the Sanitation Master Plan, and the Arco
   Corridor Transport Plan) to develop a Metropolitan Area Master Plan; (c) engaging in
   policy dialogues and establishing partnerships with the municipalities about
   metropolitan planning, management, and investment issues; (d) undertaking the
   review of the State Complementary Law #87/1997, in consultation with the
   municipalities and other stakeholders, and drafting a reform proposal for institutional
   arrangements for metropolitan management, including revisions to the Law; and (e)
   overseeing and monitoring the implementation of metropolitan-wide investment
   programs, such as the Arco Expressway and other PAC programs. Establishment of
   the Directive Committee and the TWC with the above mandates is a prior action of
   the proposed DPL.

   Design a medium-term metropolitan strategy and program to be included in the
   state's 2012-2015 development plan. Through consultations with the public and
   other stakeholders, and in collaboration with the municipalities, the state government
   will propose the inclusion of a metropolitan development and strengthening program
   in the medium-term plan and multi-year budget and investment plans. For the first
   time, the state's PPA for 2012-15 will include geographically bound programs,
   targets, and budget for the RMRJ. This will significantly enhance the state's ability
   and incentives to plan, implement, and monitor the progress of an integrated
   metropolitan program. The inclusion of this medium-term programs for the RMRJ in
   the state's 2012-2015 multi-year budget plan will be a Tranche II release condition.

   Strengthen existing sector-specific metropolitan institutions and investment
   coordination. Under the oversight of the Directive Committee, the state government
   will strengthen the capacity of the Metropolitan Urban Transport Agency (AMTU­
   RJ) to plan and coordinate transport development in the RMRJ. To this end, the
   government will include relevant state secretariats or agencies (such as planning,
   works, environment, and housing) in its Advisory Board, and strengthen AMTU-RJ's
   capacity by hiring technical staff with expertise in planning, transportation

                                         - 35 -
     engineering, the environment, and social issues. AMTU-RJ will be directly
     responsible for coordinating the establishment of the metropolitan urban transport
     development plan (PDTU).35 The GORJ will also work closely with the municipality
     of Rio de Janeiro to develop and implement urban development plans to complement
     plans to upgrade Avenida Brasil, a key thoroughfare, into a BRT corridor.

     Enhance public transport governance and services through improved quality
     and affordability by integrating tariffs for intercity transportation. State Law
     5628 mandated the implementation of the bilhete único (one ticket) for inter-
     municipal public transportation on buses, the metro, suburban rail, and ferries.36
     Riders can buy a single ticket that can be used on several modes to complete a trip
     within a certain period of time. This ticket costs less than the sum of the individual
     tickets that would have to be purchased otherwise, thereby significantly benefiting
     low-income riders who, research shows, take the longest trips with the most transfers.
     It is likely that the bilhete único will also lead to a considerable increase in demand
     for rail systems. The state has established a transportation fund to provide subsidies.37
     Municipal service may be subsidized from the fund only when it is coordinated with
     the intermodal system. Implementation of the "One Ticket" system is a Prior Action
     for the DPL.

1.B. Protection of the Urban Environment
Challenges:

101. The State Environmental Agency, INEA, plays a strategic role in the state's
development agenda. It must meet the challenge of coordinating environmental
policy and meeting social demands, as well as ensuring flexibility in services, control
mechanisms, monitoring, and participation. For this to happen, INEA needs to
strengthen its professional staffing, and ensure its financial independence with a
dedicated source of funding.

102. A key challenge for INEA is to establish an appropriate mechanism to
protect the state's sensitive environmental assets. The most important body of water in
the RMRJ is the Guandu River Basin, which provides 80 percent of the region's water
supply. Urban expansion in the RMRJ overlaps with the river basin and contributes
significantly to the river's pollution.

103. A rigorous and timely licensing process is essential for promoting sustainable
development. The effective decentralization of licensing is an essential step to
achieve this. State Decree 42.159/2009 mandates that most economic activities (even
those with minimal or insignificant impacts) be subject to environmental licensing. This
procedure yields positive environmental impacts because it guarantees that all economic
activities fall under the control of environmental authorities. However, this may add



35
   AMTU-RJ is now in the process of hiring a consultancy to assist in this effort.
36
   The R$4.40 bilhete único was approved in December 2009 and implemented in February 2010.
37
   The fund is administered by the Department of Transportation.

                                               - 36 -
further cost and time hurdles to the process of starting new small businesses, and may
burden the environmental agency with a large number of applications for relatively small
activities. Licensing decentralization looks to avoid such potential issues by delegating
small/low impact licensing to municipal authorities.
Government Program Supported by the Operation:

104. The operation supports a set of measures to address the challenges of
metropolitan management, including:

     Strengthening the capacity and independence of the environmental regulatory
     agency (INEA). After the creation of INEA, the state government acted quickly to
     strengthen its professional capacity. A key measure was the successful recruitment of
     about 200 additional environmental professionals through a competitive recruitment
     (concurso) process. The state also increased the budget for environmental employees
     by 55 percent between 2007 and 2010. In addition, legislation was enacted to ensure
     that INEA has dedicated funding through the clear earmarking of pollution charges to
     its budget.38 Prior to the reform, the agency's budget, excluding payroll, was in the
     range of R$74 million (2008). The 2010 operational budget estimate is R$176
     million, and is expected to reach R$200 million in 2011. The enactment of legislation
     regarding INEA funding and the strengthening of its capacity is a Prior Action for the
     DPL.

     The GORJ enacted legislation to adequately finance the implementation of water
     management activities by (a) establishing user fees, (b) allocating them to finance
     the activities of the watershed committees, and (c) allowing the committees to
     undertake water resources protection activities. State Law 4.247/03, amended by
     State Decree 41.974/2009, allows INEA to charge user fees to the State Sanitation
     Company and the water rights holder (CEDAE) for the water that they use.
     Additionally, State Law 5639/2010 authorized INEA to transfer those funds to the
     state watershed committees through nonprofit entities called delegatárias.39
     Enactment of the legislation to allow the transfer of funds to the delegatárias, as well
     as permit INEA to sign management agreements with these nonprofits, in turn, made
     possible effective improvements in water resources management. The state watershed
     committees can use the funds for various activities, including reclamation. INEA has
     already signed six management agreements. The decree instituting a fee for water
     rights and transferring those funds to watershed management organization is a Prior
     Action for this DPL.

     The aim of the policy to decentralize environmental licensing is to strengthen the
     state's environmental management system by helping the municipalities develop


38
  State Law 5438 (April 17, 2009) and State Law 5629 (December 29, 2009).
39
   Delegatarias are institutions created to carry out watershed management interventions using the water
fees as their source of funding. However, the watershed committees lack executive powers and legal
personhood (and thus cannot open bank accounts, hire staff or enter into contracts). As a result, it was
necessary to create an entity with executive capabilities to collect the water fees and carry out activities.

                                                   - 37 -
     the structure and capacity to perform the licensing and supervision of
     environmental activities with local low/small impact. Licensing decentralization
     (which is regulated by State Decree 42440/2010, and INEA Resolution 12/2010) is
     restricted to specific cases whose impacts are classified as local or negligible. Rio de
     Janeiro's licensing system classifies economic activities into six classes according to
     their potential impacts from small (Class 1) to large (Class 6). Each municipality's
     licensing power varies with its institutional capacity, but they can generally issue
     licenses for Class 1 projects. An agreement between the state government and the
     municipalities sets out the activities that each municipality has technical capacity to
     license. The state issued two decrees that establish the requirements for municipalities
     to issue environmental license for activities with local impacts.40

     Implementation of the decentralization process has already begun. INEA is providing
     support to the municipalities so that they can develop their own licensing systems. It
     is also helping train local technical staff and develop municipal regulations, as well as
     assisting municipalities with improvements in governance. INEA has completed the
     training and assessment of 8 municipalities in the RMRJ and signed agreements with
     40 municipalities. INEA is currently in the process of establishing an effective control
     system to guarantee that the same standards and criteria are applied throughout the
     state and ensure that the municipalities are following the proper regulations and
     guidelines. It is expected that a state decree will be issued in the next year to define
     the control procedures and criteria for decentralized licensing.

1.C. Disaster Risk Management

105. Context and Policy Area Description: The state government recognizes the
importance of improving the model of disaster risk management. The consequences of
the lack of planning, preparedness and risk reduction measures are apparent during the
rainy season when flooding occurs. Following a risk analysis, the government launched
the Morar Seguro initiative, which takes the first steps toward developing a more
integrated Disaster Risk Management (DRM) approach.

106. The institutional framework of disaster risk management is clearer for
response than it is for prevention and mitigation. At the federal level, the Ministry of
National Integration (Ministério da Integração Nacional) is in charge of response
through the National Policy of Civil Defense (Política Nacional de Defesa Civil), while
the Ministry of Cities (Ministério das Cidades) is in charge of both response and
mitigation via risk mitigation and reduction projects. In Rio de Janeiro, the state's civil
defense supports municipal entities when they become overwhelmed by the needs of


40
  Decree 42.050 (September 25, 2009) and Decree 42,440 (April 30, 2010) establish that the municipalities
must: (a) have on staff, employees with the technical knowledge to issue and supervise environmental
permits; (b) have an operating Municipal Environmental Council to consider environmental management
matters (the Council must include representatives of civil society organizations); (c) have enacted
legislation regulating municipal environmental licensing and establishing administrative penalties for
noncompliance; (d) have a municipal Master Plan and Urban Development Guidelines (Lei de Diretrizes
Urbanas); and (e) have set up a Municipal Environmental Fund.

                                                 - 38 -
responding to an emergency. There is no coordinating agency for risk reduction and
prevention at the state level, and efforts in this regard are diluted into five state
secretaries, which carry out independent DRM functions.41 These piecemeal efforts need
an institutional framework for improvement and continuity. The municipality of Rio de
Janeiro has established GeoRio and Rio Aguas to provide technical assistance to other
municipalities through an agreement with the state. GeoRio champions DRM at the
municipal level in the city of Rio de Janeiro and has mapped the entire municipality.
Other municipalities have not gotten this far and some have no experience in DRM.

Challenge:

107. The state is moving toward a more proactive approach to reducing risks, but
despite some advances, it needs to increase its focus on prevention and mitigation. Rio
still lacks laws, programs, and plans for a more systematic approach to disaster risk
reduction. Most often, state Secretaries fail to incorporate risk variables into their policies
and activities in a systematic manner. The state needs better integration between the
different institutions that carry out DRM activities. It also needs to set up monitoring and
alert systems to create awareness of risks for the municipalities and adequately protect
those most vulnerable. In addition, the state needs to work closely with the municipalities
to mitigate risks and respond better to disasters. Its strategy should be one of technical
and financial support for the municipalities (which are the ones charged with regulating
land use and occupation under Brazil's laws).

Government Program Supported by the Operation:

108.    The operation supports a set of measures to address the challenges of disaster
        risk management, including:

     Establishment of a disaster risk program with an incentive system and funding
     source for municipal actions on disaster risk. In April 2010, the state created
     Morar Seguro,42 which includes (a) a housing program that gives priority to people
     living in risk areas, (b) a social rental program for families affected by disaster, and
     (c) assistance and incentives for municipalities to establish the boundaries of risk
     areas. Morar Seguro is a R$1 billion program coordinated by the Vice-Governor that
     establishes a partnership among the municipalities and an inter-institutional group
     that includes the Governor's Office, State Secretariats of Public Works, Health and
     Civil Defense, Social Assistance and Human Rights, Housing, and Environment. The
     municipalities that choose to participate in this program have to identify and classify



41
   The Secretary of Works (Secretaria de Obras) is in charge of implementing risk reduction and mitigation
projects. The Department of Mineral Resources (Departamento de Recursos Minerais) is in charge of
mapping for landslides. The State Secretariat for Social Action (Secretaria de Estado de Ação Social)
provides resettlement and social services support after a disaster has taken place. The State Housing
Company of the State (Companhia Estadual de Habitação do Estado) is in charge of housing after a
disaster. The State Environmental Institute (Instituto Estadual do Ambiente) is in charge of mapping and
monitoring flood zones.
42
   Through State Decree 42406 of April 13, 2010.

                                                 - 39 -
     risk areas within their jurisdiction.43 Establishment of the Morar Seguro disaster risk
     program through State Decree 42406 is a Prior Action for the operation.

     Identification of hydrological and geological risks at the state level and
     improvements to the information system. The Center for Analysis and Prevention
     of Geological Disasters (Núcleo de Prevenção e Análise de Desastres Geológicos)
     and the Center for the Management of Geological Risks of Rio de Janeiro State
     (Centro de Gestão de Riscos Geológicos) began their operations in May 2010 through
     the DMR-RJ. The aim of the initiative is to strengthen technical expertise in geology
     and geotechnical engineering, and provide guidance for the coordinated management
     of state actions regarding geo-hazards in order to focus the efforts of different
     stakeholders on reducing the mortality rate and material damages caused by
     landslides. Some of the initiative's key tasks include: (a) creating a geological
     landslide susceptibility map of the state covering at least 75 percent of the
     municipalities and identifying exposure to landslide risk in 10 prioritized areas; (b)
     preparing reports, opinions, and technical explanations about the mapped risk areas;
     (c) updating the landslides section of the Contingency Plan for Emergency Situations
     and allocating the resources necessary to implement the contingency plan; (d)
     installing networks of rain meters to strengthen monitoring ability; (e) providing
     advice to the municipalities on ways to gain access to federal and state funding
     sources for the containment works; (f) promoting popular awareness of origins,
     causes, and effects of the uncontrolled occupation of land by those living in at-risk
     areas; (g) coordinating the actions of different actors involved in the field of
     geological hazard in Rio de Janeiro (Civil Defense, Secretariat of Environment,
     Secretariat for Public Works, universities, Geological Survey of Brazil, and research
     centers); (h) preparing and monitoring the implementation of the State Plan of Action
     for Analysis, Prevention and Intervention in Risk Areas, taking into account
     initiatives undertaken by others actors; and (i) preparing Plans of Action for
     Emergency Response-Related Landslides and Mudslides and monitoring their
     implementation.

     The DMR-RJ (the only state institution technically capable of validating landslide
     risks) is planning to map the state at three levels of risk (high, medium, and low) to
     identify the areas that require more detailed analysis by the corresponding
     municipality. Currently, the only maps that have been finalized are those for Rio de
     Janeiro and Niteroi. These municipalities were chosen because of their high
     population and frequency of landslides.44 Each municipal map will measure the level
     of risk and exposure for the homes and buildings located in areas of high risk. A
     single methodology will be chosen to map the municipalities in order to calibrate the
     variables. Further data collection and analysis are needed to create more precise


43
   The Department of Mineral Resources of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Departamento de Recursos
Minerais do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, DMR-RJ) will provide the technical assistance to the municipalities
to identify risk areas.
44
    The thirteen municipalities to be mapped, include: Belfort Roxo, Mesquita, S. Golcalo, Itaguai,
Paracambi, Queimados, N. Iguacu, Nilopoois, S. J. De Miriti, Japeri, Duque de Caixias, Maje, and Itaborai.
The municipalities not included are Ceropedica, Juapemirim, Tangua, and Marica.

                                                 - 40 -
     maps. It is necessary to clearly identify the types of data necessary before collection
     begins because the same data could later be used by other institutions, for example,
     for urban agriculture.

     Implementation of a more effective early warning system and contingency plans.
     The state has already implemented the flooding alarm system in the Iguaçu and
     Sarapuí rivers. The flood alert system was created in 2008 under the Program for
     Flood Prevention and Environmental Control (Programa de Prevenção e Controle
     Ambiental de Inundações) approved in the Multiannual Plan (PPA 2008-2011). The
     system issues low, medium, and high flood risk alerts and is directly linked to the
     Civil Defense system. It covers approximately 3 million people in the areas of
     Baixada Fluminense and Nova Friburgo. The expansion into the Angra-Parati, basin
     of the Macaé River and the northeast of the state will increase coverage to
     approximately 5 million people. The system sends notifications every 15 minutes to
     the central processing unit and has the capacity to send out text message notifications
     when risk is high. Sensors will be placed in and around higher risk rivers that will be
     identified during the mapping for risk areas. The central unit sends daily reports to
     Civil Defense and the municipalities, and shares information with other state hydro-
     meteorological institutions.45 The system is online and open for consultation.

     Establishment of clear policies for reconstruction that include disaster risk
     components. After the intense rains in the first quarter of 2010, which led to
     devastating landslides in Rio de Janeiro, the state government realized that there is a
     need for clear ex-ante reconstruction policies following the events. The government is
     preparing a comprehensive reconstruction policy that will include damage
     assessments and the collection of data from affected persons to clearly establish who
     will receive benefits. Key activities will include: (a) a proposal for a state
     reconstruction policy; (b) mechanisms to identify and cadastre those affected; (c) the
     identification of potential short- and long-term shelters; and (d) mechanisms for post-
     disaster housing.

     Development of a state disaster risk management policy with a clear outline of
     the responsibilities of the different state agencies. The government will design a
     DRM plan to integrate current state disaster management activities and clearly
     articulate the following areas: (a) risk identification and monitoring; (b) risk reduction
     activities, both structural and non-structural measures; (c) institutional strengthening;
     (d) financial protection against risks; and (e) disaster response and reconstruction.
     Along with these five areas, the state will also develop a plan that will include: (a)
     studies to identify geological and hydro-meteorological hazards; (b) early warning
     systems and community early warning systems; (c) structural mitigation measures,
     such as hill stabilization and gabions; (d) upgrading of building norms and
     incorporation of risk variables in territorial planning; (e) development of sectoral

FURNAS, and Aeronautics.

   for state and municipal decision-makers; (g) integration of information systems for
   effective disaster management and response; (h) a study of financial mechanisms for
   risk transfer (insurance, CAT bonds) and risk retention (emergency funds, CAT
   DDOs, debt management); and (i) contingency and reconstruction plans at the state
   and municipal levels.

Policy Area 2: Promote the Provision of Affordable Housing with Reasonable Access
and Quality
109. Objective: The GORJ's objective in housing development is to promote the
supply of affordable housing with reasonable access and quality to meet growing new
demand in the RMRJ, while at the same time significantly reducing the existing housing
deficit. In particular, the government's aim is to help the poorest (families earning up to 2
minimum wages per month) to gain access to housing solutions.

110. Challenge: Some of the key supply constraints in the region's formal housing
market include:

       Land (location/price trade-off): The experience of the MCMV program in the
       state has shown that access to affordable, well-serviced, and adequately located
       land is the main constraint on the supply of low-income housing. The cost of land
       normally represents 5 to 15 percent of the total cost of housing. Developers
       believe that the maximum unit price imposed under the MCMV program on units
       for families making between 0 and 3 minimum wages (that is, R$52,000 for a
       house or R$48,000 for an apartment) limits their ability to undertake
       economically viable developments unless the state or municipality donates the
       land or they site the development in a remote location (say, in the West Zone)
       where land is cheaper. However, remote location can affect the marketability of
       the units since potential low-income residents require (affordable) access to jobs.

       The burden of land development and building regulations: Developers
       complain that the land set-aside requirements for infrastructure and services are
       onerous and increase the cost of land per unit. Acquiring development permits has
       significant transaction costs. This has been mitigated by a recent decree issued by
       the Rio de Janeiro municipality that imposes a maximum processing time of 20
       business days to issue the required permits for projects being built under the
       MCMV program. Finally, multiple building rules (including maximum building
       heights, land coverage ratios, and floor-area ratios) also reduces the ability to
       maximize land use.

       The land tenure regularization program requires major scaling up. ITERJ
       (which is affiliated with the Secretariat of Housing) is the state government entity
       responsible for land tenure regularization, which includes the preparation of a
       socioeconomic cadastre of favela households, topographic surveys, and
       administration and issuance of the documents conferring land tenure security.
       Unfortunately, ITERJ has long been understaffed and under-financed, which
       limits its ability to do its job. Consequently, ITERJ can only work on the basis of
                                           - 42 -
   demand, whether from communities interested in applying for a collective adverse
   possession and regularization process or from projects (such as PAC) that are a
   state priority.

   The supply of accessible land for housing development. The availability of
   accessible land is critical for housing development, especially for low-income
   housing that is dependent on government subsidies. As a result of the recent
   enactment of a state law that facilitates government donations of land for low-
   income housing, some public lands have potentially become available. However,
   there is no comprehensive inventory of state-owned land, making planning for
   such use difficult. Also lacking are land asset management plans that establish
   who makes the decisions about donating public land and how those decisions are
   made. Another source of land for housing development is vacant industrial lots
   located in the central city (especially in the North Zone). This vacant private land,
   which is having a detrimental impact on adjacent neighborhoods, could be used
   for low-income housing and other commercial and residential uses. However,
   active public sector involvement will be needed to address the market failures that
   have led to this situation in the first place, and help identify owners, facilitate their
   sale or appropriation, and develop the necessary area plans.

   Infrastructure requirements: In addition to the infrastructure and service land
   set-asides and associated payments, developers also point to other particularly
   onerous mandates, including the transportation and transit related improvements
   that are required by Sete Rios, and the water/sanitation trunk infrastructure
   constraint that means that the state water company is unable to support new
   developments in under-serviced areas or has to reject them.

   Regulatory barriers to rental housing supply: According to ADEMI, the
   supply of rental property in the formal housing market is very low. This is an
   important segment, especially for low-income households who may be unable to
   afford to own their own home or who are in transition to more stable income
   patterns (and thus improved housing affordability). It is likely that laws and
   regulations may present obstacles to the development of rental housing. Issues
   such as the ability to evict tenants who are in arrears, the ease with which rents
   can be adjusted to reflect changing market conditions and the lack of
   standardization of contracts present particular problems. The state plans to further
   investigate the issue.

   Often, restricted financing and subsidies end up compensating for market
   inefficiencies: Existing inefficiencies in the areas of land development and
   building regulations imply that, all else being equal, more subsidies are needed to
   build an affordable housing unit. In addition, budgetary and other earmarked
   resources for low-income housing have traditionally been limited. Also, the lack
   of interest (as well as constraints preventing private lenders from entering the
   low-income housing finance market) has meant that Caixa is the only lender
   operating in this segment. In the context of the significant scaling up of federal
   government support for one million units under the MCMV program, and now

                                        - 43 -
       with the announced launch of the second phase of MCMV with two million units,
       Caixa will inevitably be faced with some capacity constraints to process and
       handle a significant increase in developer interest in low-income housing supply
       and low-income households' demand for financing.
The Overall Government Strategy for Housing:
111. The state government's low-income housing strategy is to adopt a segmented
market approach that offers differentiated measures according to income group as a
means to provide the necessary support for households with limited income to gain
access to adequate housing. There are primarily four brackets in the housing market, as
detailed below (see Figure 2):

a) The poorest and vulnerable groups who mostly could not afford to own a home without
major subsidies: This group is assumed to encompass those earning up to 2 minimum
wages. Due to limited and unstable earnings, households in this group would normally
live in substandard housing (room rental in corticos tenements, overcrowding or co-
habitation in favelas, illegal occupancy in high-risk areas, etc.). At current income and
vulnerability levels, most households in this group could not afford to own a house. Any
subsidies for households in this group to own a ready-made unit, such as under the
MCMV program, would be prohibitively expensive and are not guaranteed to produce the
desired outcomes. For example, households might be enticed to sell their units during
periods of hardship or because transportation costs to get to their place of work are too
high due to undesirable locations. The range of alternatives that can be offered to this
group include:
     Rental solutions: social rental payments for units in the informal market (a variant
        of the aluguel social implemented in São Paulo), and social housing managed,
        operated, and maintained by NGOs and/or private entities;
     Ownership solutions that provide the opportunity to build incrementally,
        including the provision of sites-and-services (serviced land), core housing
        (serviced land with the first phase of the house already built), as well as
        microfinance programs to finance incremental construction and/or home
        improvements;
     Integrated favela upgrading combined with a housing improvement/consolidation
        loan program that includes technical assistance, and social development programs
        to reduce vulnerability, generate income, and reduce crime and violence; and
     Priority interventions for at-risk populations (resettlement to new housing units
        ideally located within or near the settlement).

b) Limited income groups, which are assumed to encompass those earning from 2 up to 5
or 6 minimum wages. Households in this group would normally live in reasonable
housing solutions in favelas or in lots acquired in irregular settlements. To own a ready-
made unit (new construction or previously-owned unit), households in this group would
need subsidies to bridge the gap between the cost of the unit and what they can contribute
as a down-payment (including what they can borrow through housing finance loans under
FGTS and, for those with relatively higher incomes, under SBPE). Housing solutions for
this group could include:

                                                  - 45 -
       subsidies and incentives to attract formal developers to cater to this income group
       (as they are doing under the MCMV program). In particular, the state could also
       provide up-front subsidies for the acquisition of existing housing units that would
       complement MCMV subsidies for new unit construction;
       Rental solutions (rental vouchers for households who choose to live in rental
       units); and
       Integrated upgrading of favelas to ensure adequate infrastructure and services, and
       regularization of irregular settlements.

c) Low-middle and middle-income groups, which are assumed to encompass those
earning from 5-6 up to 8 or 10 minimum wages. Households in this group would be able
to afford a ready-made unit (new construction or existing unit) if the supply constraints
that increase production costs are eased or removed. Such households can afford to take a
loan from SBPE and are also served by FGTS. Perhaps, limited subsidies may be
warranted for a small sub-segment, although such subsidies could be linked to other
policy objectives (energy efficiency, etc.). The housing options for this group include:
     Ownership solutions in the private market with possibility of limited subsidies;
     Streamlining regulations (planning, development and building regulations) that
        increase housing unit cost (low density, limited heights, large lot size, high
        infrastructure standards, etc);
     Additionally, the government can support housing developments in well-located
        areas in underdeveloped or undeveloped areas such as old industrial sites,
        decommissioned public sites, deteriorated public buildings, etc; and
     Infrastructure improvements.

d) Upper-middle and upper-income groups, which are assumed to encompass those
earning above 8 to 10 minimum wages. Such households could afford units from the
private market without state support. However, continued efforts to streamline
regulations improve infrastructure and better coordinate land use planning, infrastructure
investments, and housing/land market actions would greatly improve the functioning of
the land and housing markets for the benefit of all groups.

       Government Program Supported by the Operation:

112. The operation supports a set of measures to address the challenges facing the
housing sector, including:

   Implementing effective private sector participation in low-income housing,
   providing land infrastructure as necessary and coordinating the demand
   cadastre. The state's role shifted as it mobilized to implement the MCMV program in
   RMRJ. The state is piloting a new enabler model to low-income housing production
   wherein it donates land and supports infrastructure improvements as needed, while
   the municipality provides infrastructure, and the developer builds the housing with
   federal government subsidies.

   To date, the state government has (a) signed a broad agreement (Termo de Adesão)
   with Caixa to undertake a major effort to promote the MCMV program in Rio de

                                          - 46 -
   Janeiro; (b) enacted a specific law and entered into a contract with Caixa enabling the
   donation of the area denominated Barros Filho for about 1,260 families; and (c)
   initiated the donation of 5 areas for a total of approximately 8,000 housing units (Frei
   Caneca, Cidade de Deus, Urucânia, Costa Barros, and Antares). The donation of these
   state lands makes it possible for private developers to build low-income housing and
   receive a federal government subsidy under the MCMV. In addition to its role as
   facilitator in the provision of land, the state is playing an active role promoting the
   expansion of existing infrastructure networks, especially water and sanitation, by
   organizing meetings between CEDAE and private sector developers.

   These actions represent the core of a new model of housing supply where the state
   acts as facilitator, bringing together local needs, federal government funding, private
   sector developments, and providing infrastructure. The aim is to strengthen housing
   institutions and consolidate national housing programs. If the process of identifying
   and donating vacant land for low-income housing continues, this model can address
   the state's housing backlog as well as new annual demand, with an expected average
   production of 70,000 units per year. It can also become a starting point for the State
   Housing Plan.

   Collaborating with municipalities in the RMRJ to meet housing demand for
   households in the 0-3 MW income range. The government is coordinating with the
   municipalities to establish regulatory measures and development incentives for
   building affordable housing on vacant land, as municipalities are responsible for land
   use planning and regulation. The incentives include density bonuses, the application
   of the ZEIS (social interest housing zone) or AUIS (areas of housing or urban special
   interest) approach to relax development regulations, urban operations, and so forth.
   The state's intervention in this regard would be by way of financial incentives, such
   as the provision of matching grants to qualifying developments that include a
   specified proportion of affordable housing, and/or by offsetting the financing of
   trunk/secondary infrastructure. The GORJ signed a cooperation agreement with the
   municipality of Niterói to structure a housing program for families at the 0 ­ 3 MW
   income bracket, victims of the recent landslides in Morro do Bumba, and other areas
   in the municipality. This agreement represents a joint effort by the state, the
   municipality, and the federal government to establish housing alternatives for people
   living in high risk areas. The aim is to benefit 5,000 families. The state will make a
   financial contribution of R$80 million, while the municipality will contribute R$4
   million, and the federal government will provide subsidies through the MCMV
   program. The main role for the state is to transfer enough resources to guarantee
   adequate infrastructure for the new houses and facilitate the channeling of housing
   subsidies. The municipality will facilitate land availability and planning, provide
   complementary financing to cover the costs of the operation, and work with the
   families that will be transferred to the new housing areas. The signing and
   implementation of a collaboration agreement with at least one municipality for 0-3
   MW family housing will be a Prior Action.

   Enhance the framework and capacity for land tenure regularization. The state
   enacted Complementary Law 131-2009, which allows the government to donate state

                                          - 47 -
       land in order to provide titles to low-income families occupying state land. It also
       approved Law 5440 in 2009 and its implementation rules (regulamentação),
       exempting these donations from tax (Imposto sobre Transmissão Causa Mortis e por
       Doação de Quaisquer Bens e Direitos). These laws significantly improved the formal
       tenure status of regularized land. ITERJ has implemented the pilot projects and
       successfully provided technical assistance to the municipalities to strengthen their
       capacity for land tenure regularization. The first pilot scheme is being carried out in
       Cantagalo where the administrative process for regularization through donation and
       titling to the final beneficiaries (resident families) has already taken place. This
       administrative process serves as a model for future regularizations undertaken under
       this legislation, and clearly attributes to ITERJ the power to approve this type of
       donation for social housing purposes, without any further legal instrument. It will
       benefit approximately 6,000 people (1,500 plots) living in Cantagalo who, in
       addition, will be exempted from paying transfer taxes. Needed improvements in
       ITERJ´s overall capacity have already started. The agency's budget has been increase
       from R$0.5 million in 2009 to R$4 million in 2010 (R$0.7 million had already been
       spent by May 2010).46 The enhanced framework and capacity for land tenure
       regularization is a Prior Action for the DPL.

       Scale up land titling for dwellers in informal settlements. To scale up land tenure
       regularization, the GORJ increased the resources of ITERJ, which has reformed its
       procedures and ways of doing business. This has included recruiting third-party
       service providers for the cadastre and topography processes, scaling up of its work
       supervision capacity, reforming its workflow management process, and simplifying
       the administrative procedures required to confer a title. ITERJ averaged 1,500 titles
       per year between 2007 and 2009. With the additional resources and new procedures,
       it could process an average of 10,000 titles per year in 2012 and 20,000 in 2013. The
       target is to achieve an operational capacity that would permit ITERJ to issue 40,000
       titles annually and process the existing backlog of 600,000 titles in 15 years. To this
       end, ITERJ is planning to issue a competitive recruitment announcement in 2011 in
       order to increase its technical staff by at least 20 percent by 2012. A feasibility study
       will be carried in 2011 to identify human resources needs to double ITERJ´s
       operational capacity, as well as the amount by which its budget should be increased.
       Enhanced ITERJ capacity for regularization is a Trance II release condition.

       Improve the governance mechanisms of the State Housing Fund as dedicated
       funding for low-income housing. To ensure funding for low-income housing, the
       GORJ will transform the housing fund from an accounting to a fiduciary fund, in
       accordance with federal law. The government will provide multi-year budgetary
       transfers and possibly some related earmarked resources. The fund will also have the
       ability to carry over unused resources from one year to the next, an important
       measure to ensure that adequate financing is available to support low-income
       housing. The Management Council of the State Housing Fund was established in
       2009 and its internal rules were approved (following the requirements of State Laws

     5293/08 and 4962/06, which respectively created the State Council of Cities and the
     State Social Housing Fund ­ FEHIS).47

     The responsibilities of the Management Council are to: (a) debate and approve the
     State Housing Policy and Plan, including strategies, goals and priorities; (b) monitor
     and evaluate the implementation of state housing policy; (c) establish budgetary
     allocations for FEHIS, approving annual and medium-term investment plans; (d) set
     parameters and criteria for the allocation of funds (subsidies and loans) according to
     housing needs and the income profile of the population; and (e) establish rules and
     procedures for the implementation agents. The enhancement of governance
     mechanisms in the low-income housing sector by approving new operating rules for
     the State Housing Fund is a Tranche II Release condition for the operation.

     Enabling efficient access to land and infrastructure services: Because of the
     critical role that access to land plays for low-income housing, the state government
     will play a proactive role in: (a) identifying state land that could be
     released/reassigned for housing use; (b) acquiring private or unused land through a
     negotiated voluntary purchase or the use of the government's right of preemption or
     eminent domain; and (c) approaching the federal government to release federal land
     that could also be used for building low-income housing. The strategy is to facilitate
     the acquisition of land and build the appropriate infrastructure to attract private sector
     developers to the low-income housing market. The GORJ plans to find an efficient
     methodology to map and identify vacant land suitable for large scale low-income
     housing developments that takes into account the need for appropriate infrastructure,
     transportation, employment, and economic opportunities, and also addresses existing
     housing needs through sustainable projects. The long-term consolidation of the
     national subsidies program under MCMV is creating a bottleneck because of the
     limitations to easily available urban land and the program's capacity to expand under
     sustainable conditions. Therefore, it is important to maximize the use of available
     land and establish housing priorities. The GORJ plans to set up a pilot program to
     identify vacant areas in the surroundings of the west transport corridor Campo
     Grande­Deodoro and carry out housing feasibility studies. The pilot program will
     also establish a formal methodology to spell out the roles of the various institutions
     with responsibility for urban matters, including ITERJ, CEHAB, SEOBRAS,
     Transport, CEDAE, and other stakeholders, such as private sector developers,
     nongovernment organizations, and municipalities. Once the system of responsibilities
     and operational flow is established it can begin to consolidate a process of ongoing
     identification of available land to meet housing needs, and it can address the
     economic constraints faced by private developers stemming from the subsidy caps.

     Strengthening the management of common areas in existing housing complexes


47
  The Management Council has 12 members, including 4 state government representatives (SEOBRAS,
CEHAB, ITERJ AND SEASDH); 3 representatives of social movements related to housing; and 1
representative each from the municipalities (Municipalities Association ­ AEMERJ), private sector
associations, NGOs, workers/employees association. The 12th member is a representative of the State
Secretary of Housing, who acts as the Council's president.

                                              - 49 -
     and creating conditions for sustainable housing projects in the future. The GORJ
     still manages a significant stock of social housing units, but lacks a system to transfer
     ownership of the property as well as the management of common areas
     (condominium). This situation creates a significant burden for the state, which must
     take care of the buildings and common spaces, as well as maintain the settlements
     themselves so that they do not become deteriorated. The GORJ plans to test a new
     model of self-management of social housing complexes in Complexo de Batan, which
     has 15,000 residents. The community will receive support from state government
     staff to carry out an assessment of the physical and social conditions in the settlement
     and develop a sustainable self-management model for the buildings. This project may
     include social development activities to improve conditions in the community so that
     residents can assume ownership of the existing assets.

Policy Area 3: Support for the Implementation of a Targeted, Comprehensive Social
Development Program for the Urban Poor

113. Objective: A core objective of the GORJ's social development policy is to
improve the quality of life in favelas to ensure that residents enjoy similar opportunities
for development and access to public services as those living in the rest of the state.

114.    Challenges: some of the key challenges to achieve this are:

     Ability of the state to reassert its presence in the favelas. Crime and violence in the
     favelas pose some of the most significant barriers to development and social
     integration. The current presence of the UPPs in ten favelas48 is an important step to
     reassert the state's control over these territories through the visible presence of this
     new division of the military police. The ability to expand and maintain the peace
     process is a pre-condition of social and economic development in the favelas. The
     government plans to extend the UPP to 47 favelas by the end of 2014.

     Overcome the lack of integration and coordination between social policies and
     programs managed by different agencies at different levels of government, as
     well as with NGOs and private sector interventions. A first mapping of state and
     municipal programs being offered in favelas identified 197 programs, many of which
     operate in a fragmented manner, with substantial overlaps and few synergies, limiting
     their development impacts. The types of interventions offered by NGOs and the
     private sector compound this lack of rationality in service provision. There were more
     than 40 NGOs operating in some favelas (Santa Marta), and their number increased
     after the pacification process. In contrast, there are no civil society organizations
     providing services in other favelas (Batam). A similar situation occurs with private
     sector assistance, which features prominently in favelas, especially since the UPPs
     started operating. In order to maximize development impacts, the state government
     must provide some rationality to all of this assistance.

        Address social service and delivery gaps for specific population groups. This
        includes the development of specialized, intensive interventions for youth involved in
        serious crime and violence, and serious ex-offenders (including adults). It also
        involves the development of provider and community strategies to target, recruit,
        retain, and transition these persons to achieve positive outcomes. While this is a
        relatively new area of intervention with little impact assessment, there are incipient
        and promising practices and programmatic principles that can serve as examples.
        Many of these interventions require intersectoral action mechanisms, quick and
        timely responses, and consolidated and inclusive services. The latter is a particular
        challenge given the often fragmented, piecemeal, and poorly coordinated program
        efforts currently in place.

        Establish strong planning and monitoring and evaluation systems. The improved
        coordination and integration of social policies requires robust monitoring and
        evaluation systems that provide actionable, timely, and reliable information to inform
        planning, assess performance, and modify interventions accordingly. Currently, most
        social and infrastructure programs lack a basic logical framework, performance
        indicators, and a culture and mechanisms for using evaluation to assess and improve
        program performance.

Government Program Supported by this Operation

   115. The DPL will support the launch of UPP Social, an innovative and multi-
   dimensional approach to integrate favelas with the rest of the city by rolling out a
   comprehensive menu of social support programs following pacification
   interventions by the military police. The UPP Social operates with complete
   independence from the UPP Program, having as a main objective to facilitate the
   territorial coordination and monitoring of programs from government, private sector, and
   civil society that can support projects contributing to integrate these slum areas with the
   rest of the city. The two broad strategic areas of interventions and goals are:
        To contribute to the short-term consolidation of the peace process, through: (a)
            the creation and strengthening of channels for civic engagement and collective
            action (including local facilitators, forums, citizen oversight mechanisms, etc.);
            (b) the introduction of the rule of law in private and public life49; (c) putting an
            end to youth violence50; and (d) creating local amenities.51



   49
      This involves providing access to legal services and conflict resolution mechanisms (such as community
   mediation and casas de justica); the regularization of land tenure and formal provision of energy, water,
   cable, and other services; and the development of social norms and interventions to promote citizen
   engagement, co-existence, and civility.
   50
      This requires programs to reintegrate juvenile offenders into the community and provide access to
   second chance programs, as well as creating job opportunities. It also involves the development of social,
   cultural, and civic programs to address and prevent the many underlying risk factors for youth violence,
   such as child abuse and domestic violence.
   51
      This involves the construction of public recreational and leisure spaces, improving circulation within the
   favela and access into and out of it by building new roads, and the development cultural, tourist and other
   programs.

                                                      - 51 -
       The establishment of a medium- and long-term agenda for fostering social
       development through programs that promote: (a) poverty reduction (e.g., cash
       transfer programs); (b) human development (e.g., improvements in access to
       health and education services, including early childhood development); (c)
       productive inclusion (e.g., vocational training); (d) quality of life (e.g., support for
       local cultural, recreation, and sport services); (e) diversity and rights (e.g., access
       to services that guarantee rights to vulnerable groups because of gender, race,
       sexual orientation, etc.); and (f) infrastructure development (urban, transport and
       economic infrastructure, and environmental services).

116. Community participation is an essential aspect of UPP Social's efforts to
recreate social capital and trust in government services. The main activities are: (a)
regular (bi-monthly) community meetings open to all community leaders and residents;
(b) state response to community priority needs raised in these meetings, with thematic
working groups that include residents and government representatives; and (c) the daily
and continuous presence of the social teams in the favelas. A more systematic
participatory local planning process is being developed to address other structural
problems and the sustained engagement of the communities. The key challenge will be
overcoming the initial fears that UPP (and, consequently, UPP Social) will not have a
permanent presence and that, once the drug lords return, those who participated in and
supported state activities will be in increased danger of retaliation.

117. UPP Social was hosted under the SEASDH (Secretaria de Assistencia Social e
Direitos Humanos) until December 2010 and its management was transferred at the
Municipal level at beginning of January 2011. The initial institutional arrangements
included a two tier structure. The first tier dealt with a central management unit with
focal points from key state and municipal government Secretariats, and partners from
private sector and civil society organizations. The second tier involved the establishment
of local management units in each favela to facilitate the coordination of social demands
and needs with the supply of programs by government agencies and local partners. The
program has been launched in three favelas (Borel, Providencia, and Cidade de Deus) and
will gradually expand to cover all the favelas that have gone through the pacification
process (Decree 42.727 of November 2010 and SEADSH Resolution 299 of December 2010).
During the process of refining the vision and methodology of UPP Social in order to put
it into operation, it was decided to transfer its competencies at the municipal level, to
better respond to the demand generated through the program, given that such demand is
mostly related to provision of services and infrastructure offered at municipal level. The
management structure for coordinating program implementation to attain the desired
results is currently being defined in detail. A UPP Social strategy paper and 5-year action
plan will be developed with inputs from the experiences and lessons learned in the pilot
communities. These guidance documents will define key objectives and priority areas,
outline processes and protocols, and identify short- and medium-term actions and priority
initiatives as well as coordination and planning mechanisms for the major activities.
Launch of the state UPP Social Program by rolling out pilot programs is a Prior Action
for this DPL.



                                            - 52 -
118. The DPL will support the restructuring of SEASDH to enable it to play a
catalytic role within the portfolio of social development program it oversees. A core
area in need of improvement is SEASDH's capacity for monitoring and evaluation,
which has been extremely limited. SEASDH has created a new Knowledge Management,
Monitoring and Evaluation Program whose main role is to foster an evidence-based and
results-oriented approach to policy-making. For that purpose, the Secretariat is
developing tools and systems that can provide a regular process of diagnosis, planning,
monitoring, and evaluation of the broad array of programs it directly or indirectly
oversees. It is also developing a management information system that will allow it to
engage in policy dialogues with other government agencies that manage social programs.
Also reviewed for potential adaptation are regional best practices of low-cost data-driven
management systems (designed to monitor and improve the performance of services in
real-time) that track targeted government performance indicators to identify
underperformance and press for improvements. The TAL will have strong emphasis on
M&E and it will include an M&E system designed and implemented at community level,
in order to measure impact of programs and occurrence of violent events.

119. SEASDH has begun to apply this new approach in the PROTEJO program
(Programa de Proteção de Jovens em Territorio Vulnerável), a federal program
managed by state governments. PROTEJO is the most important program under the
umbrella of the Programa Nacional de Segurança Pública com Cidadania
(PRONASCI)52 that directly targets youth between the ages of 15 and 29 who are at risk
for violence, and in conflict with the law, in communities jointly identified with the
Ministry of Justice. The aim of the program is to provide at-risk youth with life skills as
well as educational, cultural, and recreational opportunities and knowledge to improve
their self-esteem and opportunities, and prevent their participation in activities that lead
to crime and violence, while preparing them to enter the workforce. It consists of
approximately 800 hours of classes/training and provides participating youth a monthly
stipend of R$100 during a period of 10 to 12 months.53 PROTEJO is linked to another
PRONASCI program, called Women of Peace (Mães da Paz) that trains female
community leaders in conflict mediation, ethics, human rights, and citizenship to prepare
them to identify and approach youth at risk and refer them to social programs.

120. After a review of PROTEJO's implementation performance in the state, new
operating rules are being developed to improve its programmatic offerings and
evidence-based focus. SEASDH introduced changes in the selection of the target
population to increase the chances that those most at risk of engaging in violence (young

   PRONASCI is a federal program created by the Ministry of Justice in 2007 with the main objective of
fighting crime and violence through preventive actions. The program consists of 94 interventions to
coordinate the activities of the different levels of government with those of different sectors of society. It
includes the coordination of security policies and social activities, emphasizing prevention and seeking to
address the causes of violence. PRONASCI targets young people between the ages of 15 and 24 who are at
risk of engaging in criminal activities, as well as prisoners, and ex-offenders.
53
   Program beneficiaries receive a job, and training in life skills, computer, conflict resolution, and civic
and human rights. They are provided access to sports and cultural activities, must perform community
service, and have access to community mental health services.

disaffected males) and youth in conflict with the law were selected. In addition, it
introduced greater transparency into the process. It also designed a randomized impact
evaluation to assess the effect that the program was having on the core social and
emotional capabilities of at-risk youth, and to explore its potential synergies with other
programs. A review of programmatic content, practice principles and capacity, and
identification of critical gaps is being carried out to strengthen programming. The sub-
secretariat of Human Rights of SEASDH has been working to strengthen and refine the
community mobilization methodologies employed by PROTEJO.

121. SEASDH has begun a strategic planning process to refine its overall
direction, goals, and objectives and develop an action plan. An internal review
process to identify the main operative bottlenecks and challenges, particularly in the
attainment of social integration objectives is now underway. Currently, SEASDH
functions include: (a) the formulation, coordination and implementation of public policies
related to social assistance, food security, income transfers, and the promotion of human
rights and citizenship; (b) planning, organizing, and oversight of the state system of
social assistance; (c) managing state funds for social welfare and human rights actions;
(d) the allocation of funds to municipalities for its share of the funding assistance for
birth and funerals; (e) providing technical and financial support services, programs and
projects to combat poverty at the regional or local level; (f) provide encouragement and
support to technical and financial associations in the provision of municipal social
services and human rights; and (g) provide assistance services through a regional network
of services when resources are lacking at the municipal level to carry out this assistance.
The strategic planning process and outputs are expected to lead to the necessary changes
in the organizational structure of SEASDH. The restructuring and operationalization of
SEADSH are a second Tranche release condition for this operation.

                      VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
122. Overall, the specific policy reforms supported by this loan are expected to
have significant and positive poverty alleviation and social development impacts in
Rio de Janeiro. During the project preparation phase, the Bank undertook an analysis to
explore the disaggregated poverty and social impacts on different stakeholder groups.54
These policies and reforms address key issues and needs related to historical social and
spatial segregation in the RJMR. They include violence, crime, and the long absence of
state institutions in most informal settlements; as well as the precariousness of the
metropolitan transportation system, the lack of affordable housing alternatives for lower
income families, and the issue of land tenure regularization. The reforms also address the
poor coordination and fragmentation of metropolitan planning and disaster risk
management. The policies are expected to bring major benefits to the poor population
living in informal and precarious settlements, substandard housing, and at-risk and/or
distant areas.



54
  It is based on primary and secondary sources: social and economic analyses utilizing demographic and
census data, ethnographic studies, meetings, and interviews with key stakeholders.

                                                - 54 -
123. Poverty and social inequality are high in the RMRJ and present huge inter-
regional differences, even though the gap between families living in informal
settlements and the rest of the area has declined in the last decade. The poverty rate
reached 10.2 percent in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 2008 and 13.7 percent in the
metropolitan region as a whole.55 In peripheral areas it rose to over 30 percent, and in the
informal settlements it ranges from 16 percent to 24 percent. Nearly 45 percent of the
city's poor live in informal settlements. The metropolitan Gini Index remained stable
during the past decade, dropping slightly from 0.578 to 0.576. Figure 3 depicts the socio-
spatial hierarchy and segregation that characterizes the RJMR.
124. The metropolitan region has expanded in the last decade. There has also
been a decline in the number of middle class families in central and suburban zones.
In addition to the expansion of the metropolitan area toward peripheral zones, urban
expansion in this unique and fragile natural environment also occurred vertically within
the favelas. The absence of a formal housing market and state policies for low-income
housing has led poor families to locate in underserviced areas. These solutions have
increased social exclusion and promoted favelization in most peripheral areas. Informal
and precarious settlements have emerged as the only affordable housing option for about
1.7 million people in the city of Rio de Janeiro (28 percent of the population).

125. Living and housing conditions deteriorated in the metropolitan area,
primarily in informal settlements. Only 77 percent of the housing stock is currently
considered adequate. The housing deficit equals 378,797 units or 9.5 percent of
metropolitan households. Furthermore, 13 percent of the housing stock has inadequate
infrastructure, 4 percent is overcrowded, and 2 percent has land tenure issues. The
housing deficit and inadequate housing are concentrated in areas where the majority of
residents are poor. Only 62 percent of the units that are home to families earning up to 3

minimum wages are considered adequate. This group accounts for 90 percent of the
housing deficit in the RMRJ.56
126. Poor families living in peripheral areas are more affected by rising
transportation costs, which hamper their ability to secure formal sector jobs (which
are generally located in central metropolitan areas). Inter-city mobility and daily
commuting within the metropolitan area have become major constraints on the daily lives
and budgets of low-income families (46 percent of the poor residents of peripheral
municipalities travel daily to the capital). The share of transportation in family budgets
reached 17.3 percent in 2009, and is second only to food (17.9 percent).57
127. Urban and housing upgrade and disaster management policies. The policies and
reforms supported by the proposed operation can ease many of the constraints faced by
lower-income families in the RMRJ. The operation is expected to bring positive social
and economic gains to poor people and the most vulnerable groups by promoting policies
that improve infrastructure and services in informal settlements, regularize land tenure,
and resettle at-risk families. During public consultations, some stakeholders raised the
concern that proposed affordable low-income housing policies might be a revival of
previous failed state housing policies. Those earlier policies (in the 1970s and 1980s)
transferred the poor from highly valued land, better serviced neighborhoods and central
zones to remotely located and underserviced peripheral areas. Some also stated that
housing and land regularization policies may be viewed as depriving them of their urban
freedom.58 These concerns will be addressed by establishing better communication
channels and thorough information campaigns that will emphasize the option of in situ
low-income housing relocation. This is important because it allows residents to keep their
social networks and community identity intact. It also allows them to continue to benefit
from the so-called economy of reciprocity.59 In addition, grievance procedures will be
established for relocated families. The operation also supports policies that directly
address these concerns, including: (a) revamping the State Social Interest Housing Fund
and strengthening the management committee with the inclusion of representatives from
housing related social movements, NGOs, and unions; (b) establishing and implementing
a system to identify vacant and underutilized areas for housing in accessible locations
(including Central Zone); and (c) systematizing and enhancing recent state experiences




56
   Those earning up to two minimum wages account for 67 percent of the housing deficit and the situation
is worse for the poorest families. The lower 10 percent of families in the income scale account for nearly 30
percent of the region's housing deficit and earn an average of 1.1 minimum wages per month. The housing
deficit for this group is 27 percent, and 24 percent have inadequate infrastructure. Ministério das
Cidades/Fundação João Pinheiro, 2009.

58
   Urban freedom refers to the lack of rules and regulations that allows residents of informal settlements
to, for example: expand the size of their dwellings or intensify soil use, provide shelter for relatives or rent
out rooms (and gain a new source of income) without adhering to zoning, occupancy or land use
regulations. This is one of the four main factors that residents of informal settlements take into account
when choosing where to live (Abramo and Pulici, 2009).
59
   Economy of reciprocity refers to strong social ties through which families can obtain services free of
charge for which they would otherwise have had to pay.

                                                    - 56 -
and the institutional capacity to deal with resettlement issues.60 So-called white
expropriation61 is also a risk; however, it is considered worth taking because the bulk of
the residents will see huge improvements in their living conditions, and would become
asset-holders.
128. Informal settlements in at-risk areas. The state has taken seriously the issue of
resettlement of families living in risk areas, and has adopted the following measures to
address stakeholders concerns62: (a) a systematic and participatory method for risk
identification and assessment of the families to be resettled, through strong technical
institutions with a solid grounding in geological risk mapping and analyses; (b)
establishment of mechanisms for appeals and/or the redress of grievances during
implementation; (c) socially responsible and sensitive resettlement processes favoring
relocation in situ or in nearby areas in accordance with the state government's Decree
41148/2008 on resettlement. This decree lists as its main guidelines the participation of
affected people in all stages of the resettlement process and the provision of resettlement
options. It also introduces strong communication mechanisms and consultation processes
that are in accordance with most of the provisions of the Bank's resettlement policies.
These processes and mechanisms have been introduced in state practices, notably for the
large scale PAC program, which involves the resettlement of a significant number of
families in newly built units or purchased houses within the same community. The
learning-by-doing manner in which these have been introduced needs to be
strengthened. A technical assistance proposed in parallel with this operation is expected
to address this need.
129. Transportation and metropolitan integration policies. The policies supported by
this operation address the key challenges of integrating area-wide transport and tariffs,
and providing fast and affordable transport linkages for low-income families in peripheral
areas. The operation will support the metropolitan one ticket policy introduced in
February 2010 (bilhete unico), which offers a direct subsidy to inter-city and intermodal
riders and reduces their transport costs.63 The main concerns raised during the public
consultations over bilhete unico were: (a) that the Metropolitan Urban Transportation


60
   Most stakeholders have also valued the methods and practices of the MCMV program in Manguinhos,
Rocinha and Alemão where the State offers families the options of in situ resettlement in new houses, cash
compensation and assisted purchase of existing housing units within the community. The technical
assistance component of this operation will support the systematization and improvement of these new
processes to deal with resettlement issues.

   White expropriation refers to the possibility that as a result of urban upgrading the poorest residents
may be unable to remain in improved areas because of their inability to pay new taxes and housing costs.
They may be pushed further into peripheral areas, reinforcing their social exclusion and segregation.
62
   They pointed out that areas classified as at-risk where investments for landslide containment have been
undertaken were not affected by the March 2010 rainfalls. They believe that costs to provide infrastructure
and services in new peripheral settlements might be higher than costs to provide these in situ
infrastructures, and that the removal of poor families from areas considered to be at risk is driven by other
interests. They have also strongly criticized the lack of accessible information, communication, and
channels for the redress of grievances for people removed from at-risk areas by the state and the city. In
short, time and again, they have pointed to the poor institutional capacity to promote resettlement.

   Before the inception of the one ticket policy, each inter-city rider spent an average of 22.4 percent of
his/her day commuting. This time equals 86 minutes per day and has an average cost of R$10.00 (Néri,
2010).

Agency (AMTU) has a limited ability to plan and regulate the metropolitan transport
system; (b) that the two hour limit to complete trips is not enough for some lower-
income riders who are traveling from peripheral areas; and (c) that a mass transportation
system based on fossil fuels is a poor choice. This operation addresses some of these
issues by strengthening the capacity of AMTU to plan and coordinate transport
development in the RJMR, and by addressing the institutional challenge to coordinate
tariffs among the different modes of transportation run by different entities. The
subsidized fare represents savings of up to 50 percent in total travel costs, reduces travel
time on daily trips as well as reliance on informal and unsafe options, increases access to
formal job opportunities, and encourages the use of public transport modes.
130. Targeted and Integrated Social Development Program for the Urban Poor. Since
1985, increasing numbers of precarious, poor, and informal settlements have fallen under
the rule of drug lords and militiamen, with devastating effects for the residents. Crime
and violence are focused in these settlements and surrounding areas, and victimize young
people the most. This has come about as a result of the prolonged absence of state
institutions from these settlements. The policies and reforms supported by this DPL are
based on the state's ability to reassert its presence through social interventions following
the UPP pacification process launched in 2008. While the feedback from residents has
been mostly positive, concerns remain about the migration of crime and violence to other
neighborhoods; the high costs of scaling up UPP interventions to the entire metropolitan
region; and fear that UPP interventions may not endure and that drug traffickers and
militiamen might return and retaliate against residents. There are also concerns that the
UPP program could impose a state of surveillance over the residents' daily life rather
truly improve citizenship rights, freedom, and opportunities, or provide the public
services needed to reduce segregation and exclusion. Concerns have also been voiced
about the risk that, as a result of the program, legitimate local leaders could be replaced
by outsiders. The UPP Social and PROTEJO social development strategies address many
of these concerns by coordinating government and nongovernment programs to promote
social and youth development; providing the services needed to re-integrate pacified
informal settlements into the city; promoting the participation of residents in establishing
priorities, planning interventions, making decisions, and monitoring outcomes; and
engaging with community leaders and representatives. The programs are also important
for gender development, as women are often the primary victims of violence. It is also
important to distinguish between the UPP Social and the UPP program itself. While the
operation supports the UPP Social program, it is not involved in the peacekeeping and
policing activities that are being undertaken by UPP.

B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

131. It is expected that the policies and reforms supported by this operation will
have net positive environmental impacts. Strengthening metropolitan governance and
formulating a coherent housing strategy should significantly increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of the regional and integrated urban management programs. The main
environmental problems identified in the RJMR are related to the unplanned occupation
of environmentally sensitive areas. Improvements in governance and social sector
coordination should generate positive regional effects, improving the enforcement of land
use regulations and facilitating the implementation of sanitation systems. Strengthening

                                           - 58 -
the institutional capacity of environmental agencies is key to guaranteeing the
effectiveness of policies, as well as environmental quality improvements and the
protection of natural resources.

132. The DPL includes specific measures to strengthen environmental
management. Those measures include assisting the GORJ in strengthening the
institutional capacity of environmental agencies, supporting institutional reforms, and
supporting new legal provisions that guarantee that environmental agencies are
adequately funded to carry out their operations. These measures ensure the effectiveness
of the metropolitan governance policies adopted. The creation of a new and better-
equipped environmental agency also yields numerous benefits, including improving
licensing efficiency and effectiveness. The Water Resources Policy amendments
supported by the DPL allow INEA to collect fees for water rights and transfer these funds
to the state watershed committees. The effective operation of the watershed committees
will improve water resources management significantly, making possible the
implementation of the required measures to protect the Guandu Basin. These measures
will strengthen the overall environment regulation regime in the state.

133. Other policy areas supported by the operation can also contribute to the
protection of the region's environment. The Disaster Risk Program is expected to
benefit the population living in risk areas and prevent new settlements in sensitive and
risky sites. It is expected that the public transportation plan will yield positive direct
effects, especially on air quality. Mobile sources account for approximately 77 percent of
total pollutants emitted in the RJMR, and some air basins in the region have unfavorable
pollutant dispersion conditions. Public transport improvements, and the adoption of lower
emissions transport systems are necessary to improve the region's air quality. The Social
Housing Plan and associated measures to promote the development on underutilized land
may reduce the pressure on sensitive areas, such as lowlands and mountain slopes, and
limit sprawl.

134. Due to their nature, the proposed policies could have adverse environmental
effects. They require well-defined provisions to internalize environmental and social
considerations during implementation. The government's housing and land
management programs could be feared interfere with numerous sensitive sites and
preservation areas in the Rio metropolitan region. However, the state has a well-
developed environmental policy framework and the necessary environmental institutional
capacity to minimize negative impacts, and mitigate the housing and land titling
implementation impacts.
135. Activities that may result in negative environmental impacts are being
adequately addressed and regulated under the state's environmental policy
framework. Eventual interventions supported by the housing and land titling programs
(policy areas 2A and 2B) have to be licensed by the environmental agencies. Licensing is
regulated by numerous federal and state laws, notably CONAMA Resolutions 01/1986
and 237/1997, at the federal level, and the Rio de Janeiro State Decree 42159/2009. State
regulations make it clear that all construction, public urbanization, public or private urban



                                           - 59 -
developments, geotechnical services, and earth moving, among other activities, are
subject to environmental licensing.

136. Additionally, occupation and land titling of environmentally sensitive areas,
especially steep slopes and river banks, are regulated by specific legal instruments:
CONAMA Resolution 369/2006, at the federal level, and State Decree 42.356/2010. The
CONAMA Resolution is the main reference on this topic and has a specific section on
sustainable occupation in sensitive urban areas. While it allows titling and ex-post
licensing of low-income residential areas located in permanent protection areas, it
establishes numerous eligibility conditions for environmental agencies and municipalities
authorizing and conducting titling programs. Urban infrastructure improvements, risk
assessment, appropriate public health conditions, and a comprehensive consultation
process are among the pre-conditions established by the CONAMA Resolution.
137. The institutional capacity of the state to carry out environmental
management has improved significantly, and the state has the necessary institutional
capabilities to supervise the environmental aspects of the housing and land titling
programs. INEA's Water and Territory Management Division (DIGAT) evaluates all
license requests submitted to INEA to ensure that the proposed projects are in compliance
with environmental zoning. If approved by DIGAT, the project undergoes a detailed
assessment by the Environmental Licensing Division (DILAM). INEA also conducts
inspections to evaluate project compliance with the terms of the license. Rio's
environmental legal and regulatory framework requires that the proposed housing and
land titling program be developed in accordance with appropriate environmental
management practices, minimizing negative impacts, mitigating implementation impacts,
and producing the best results for society as a whole.




                                         - 60 -
C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

138. The Secretary of Public Works (SEOBRAS), with support from the
Secretary of Finance (SEFAZ), and the Secretary of Social Assistance and Human
Rights (SEASDH), will be responsible for the overall implementation of the
proposed operation, for reporting on progress, and for coordinating actions.
SEOBRAS will be responsible for coordinating activities with the other sectoral
departments (environment, housing, social assistance, transport, and civil defense). In this
regard, two tasks are essential: (a) providing evidence justifying the first and second
tranches; and (b) overseeing and reporting on progress toward completion of the second-
tranche conditions, including tracking individual conditions, facilitating the timely
completion of the studies and activities required for meeting these conditions, and
consolidated reporting on outcome indicators.

139. The Bank has vetted the prior conditions for the first tranche. The GORJ has
provided satisfactory evidence that the conditions have been met. SEOBRAS coordinated
the assembly and presentation to the Bank of the information in timely manner.

140. Similarly, SEOBRAS will be responsible for marshalling the information
necessary to demonstrate that the State has satisfactorily met the second-tranche
conditions and covenants. In the event that one or more conditions are not met or are
only partly met, SEOBRAS will take the lead in identifying and explaining the reasons
for this and determining what, if anything, can be done to mitigate the resulting risks.

141. A Project Implementation Committee made up of officials from the agencies
directly involved in the DPL-supported reform agenda will monitor implementation,
including all essential technical assistance activities. In addition to monitoring and
management systems, this project will support a number of evaluation activities that will
generate data to inform city policies and thereby strengthen a culture of evidence-based
policy-making. Several activities present opportunities for significant learning, both for
the state and for other local governments in Brazil. The major initiatives for evaluation
activities are taking place within the social development sector.

D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management (PFM)

142. The government's public sector management reforms are anchored in its
strategic plan for 2007-2010. The reforms are aimed at improving the effectiveness and
efficiency with which public services are delivered. The plan aims to modernize and
streamline public administration; enhance its instruments of management, administration,
and control; and strengthen its human resource capacity. The government's program also
seeks to strengthen its core systems and management tools for improved performance and
efficiency. The World Bank has supported these initiatives through a Technical
Assistance Loan that also provides support for strengthening public sector management
in the health and education sectors. The first DPL for Fiscal Sustainability, Human
Development and Competitiveness also supported key elements of the reform program.


                                           - 61 -
143. Several analytical studies underpin the Bank's knowledge of the fiduciary
environment in Rio de Janeiro. A review of the performance of the federal financial
management and related information systems, as well as investment management
efficiency was completed in 2009 and was based on PEFA methodology. In addition, the
fiscal sustainability DPL contains a review of the fiscal management environment at the
time that it was prepared. Also, the IDB completed a review of the fiscal management
environment in April 2009. The Bank and the government have discussed the possibility
of undertaking a sub-national PEFA review for the state of Rio de Janeiro and have
agreed to commence planning the exercise. Such a review would yield a number of
benefits for the state, including an instrument to monitor the progress and impact of PFM
reforms, as well as the development of a baseline against which to measure these over
time.

144. A robust legal framework serves as the basis for Brazil's public financial
management environment. This framework provides for a clear definition of the
responsibilities of federal and sub-national entities. In addition, institutional arrangements
for the management of public finances are clearly established: SEPLAG is responsible for
planning and budget preparation, and SEFAZ is responsible for managing the treasury,
and accounting and reporting processes. In addition, the Tribunal de Contas do Estado de
Rio de Janeiro (TCE) is charged with responsibility for external scrutiny, and the
legislature plays an external oversight role. The legal framework provides for a strong
PFM mandate at the sub-national level. The existence of federal laws and regulations for
specific PFM areas helps to promote uniform requirements in PFM practices across sub-
national entities.

145. The budget classification system is governed by federal rules that are
consistent with international standards. These rules also lay down specific
requirements relating to the inclusion of comprehensive information in the budget
documents. The budget preparation process is orderly, and is designed in such a way as to
promote participation by all key stakeholders and sector agencies, including housing. The
process is guided by well-defined budget preparation procedures and a calendar that
establishes the proper sequencing of activities to allow sufficient time for them to be
undertaken. The state has consistently met deadlines for the preparation of key budget
documents and for submitting them to the legislature for consideration and approval.
These documents include the Plano Pluriannual de Ação (PPA), the Lei de Diretrizes
Orçamentárias (LDO), and the Lei Orçamentária Annual (LOA). The PPA provides a
reasonable foundation for a multiyear perspective in fiscal planning on which further
linkages to the annual budgeting process can be built. It covers a period of four years, but
opportunities exist to include information that would strengthen links to individual sector
strategies. Such information would include an appropriate reflection of the recurrent cost
implications of investments. In addition, the information system does not provide
information that is adequate to monitor the extent to which budget execution facilitates
the implementation of sector strategies. The government is committed to improving the
medium-term outlook in its planning and budgeting process. With the support of the
World Bank, it is currently exploring the possibility of introducing the elements of a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework that are still missing from the PPA framework.


                                            - 62 -
146. The state's performance in accounting for and recording transactions is
fairly strong because accounting rules and regulations are generally respected.
Brazil has embarked on a program to adopt international accounting standards that would
lead to the full adoption of accrual accounting, making the state's financial statements
more transparent and more valuable for performance management purposes. Although
tentative steps have already been taken, capacity constraints for applying the relevant
accounting principles remain a challenge. Examples of other challenges have also been
noted in TCE reports, including those that have to do with the valuation of assets and
liabilities. The state's information system, SIAFEM, is also adequate for most purposes,
but various reviews have underlined the fact that it is based on architecture that has not
been updated for some time. The SIAFEM enables the identification of all resources
transferred from the treasury to the service delivery units, and also provides information
on the transfer of goods procured and distributed centrally. However, some front-line
units use separate systems to manage these resources. Since these are not effectively
integrated, there is a lack of efficiency in gathering information on the resources they
receive, as well as for the effective monitoring of the use of those resources by central
agencies. In addition, some of these systems do not facilitate the automatic generation of
in-year budget reports, which have to be done manually, raising the risk of data
inaccuracies in the classification and recording of data.

147. The financial programming process is currently working well. SEFAZ is
responsible for formulating cash flow forecasts, as well as updating them and
monitoring their implementation. To increase the predictability of budget execution
and improve the relationship between planned activities and the availability of financing,
the government embarked on a series of reforms to strengthen annual financial
programming processes. It also introduced measures to require that suppliers be paid in a
timely manner. These reforms have yielded a number of benefits and substantially
reduced the average number of days that suppliers must wait for payment for the goods or
services provided to the government. Improvements in the predictability of financing
have allowed service delivery agencies to enhance the effectiveness with which services
are planned and delivered. The use of a single treasury account model of cash
management and a clear allocation of responsibility for managing it facilitate the
performance of bank reconciliations on a regular basis and in a timely manner.

148. The state's PFM system features strong internal rules and controls on
commitments. However, a number of weaknesses still limit the effectiveness of the
internal audit agency, the Auditoria Geral do Estado (AGE). This agency currently
reports to SEFAZ and is responsible for providing management assurance about the
functioning of the internal control system. Although still limited, it also plays a role in
assessing value for money aspects of budget execution by government agencies. The state
intends to reform the institutional structure of the AGE in order to enhance its
independence. As a result, the AGE will report directly to the state governor. In addition,
the government is undertaking a major recruitment and training exercise to ensure that
the office is equipped with sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its mandate.
SIAFEM also plays a key role in ensuring the implementation of the internal controls
through existing procedures for the budget execution process. However, given this role,


                                          - 63 -
the system's weaknesses, and the use of ancillary systems by some service delivery units
may introduce some element of risk and further weaken the internal control system.

149. There is a high level of transparency with respect to financial information in
Brazil. This is made possible through the use of the internet and other public media
channels to disseminate information on plans and budgets, as well as regular financial
reports and annual financial statements. The state has consistently been able to prepare
timely high quality financial statements. Key contributing factors include the clarity with
which the law describes obligations in relation to the preparation of these financial
statements, and the diligence with which they are applied. The financial systems also
make it possible to collect, maintain and generate the financial data necessary for this
task. Some exceptions are identified in the TCE report, but in the recent past, they have
not been such as to compromise the overall consistency and usefulness of the financial
reports. The government is committed to ensuring that the quantity, quality, and format of
this information are such that they enable a broad participation in budget preparation and
monitoring of the execution processes.

150. The mandate to audit the financial statements of the state is vested by the
Constitution in the TCE, which is largely able to carry out audits of a reasonable
scope. In the recent past, the TCE has been able to submit reports to the legislature
(which is responsible for reviewing and approving the accounts) in a timely manner.
Recommended actions are usually implemented, as is evidenced in the TCE's reports.
Legislative scrutiny of the budget and of the financial statements follows clear rules and
procedures. However, there is a need for a more structured follow up of audit
recommendations by the TCE, and for a more timely review of the reports by the state
legislature in order to complete the accountability cycle. In addition, there appear to be
some divergences between the audit approach undertaken by the TCE and International
Auditing Standards, which should be more clearly identified during a PEFA review.

151. In sum, Rio de Janeiro has an adequate PFM environment to support the
proposed operation. In addition, the government has shown a satisfactory level of
commitment to further improving the PFM environment by developing the strategic plan,
as well as its subsequent actions to support the implementation of reforms.

Foreign Exchange Control Environment

152. The Bank undertook a review of the financial statements of Brazil's central
bank for 2006 to 2009 and concluded that the control environment governing the
central bank's operations within which the loan's foreign exchange would flow
remains adequate. This review updated a similar ones carried out by the IMF in 2004
and 2006, which concluded that the central bank does not present widespread
vulnerabilities that could compromise the safeguarding of Fund resources. The World
Bank's assessment included explanatory notes to the financial statements and a report of
the independent audit carried out by an international firm of auditors. The latter contained
an unqualified opinion on the financial statements for all years. The explanatory notes, an
integral part of the financial statements, provide an extensive explanation of the central
bank's risk management policies, including those related to financial instruments held to

                                           - 64 -
   manage international reserves. The conclusion was that the central bank uses internal
   control systems, which are considered adequate for its activities.

   E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

   153. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
   development policy loans. Upon approval of the Loan, the proceeds of the first tranche
   will be deposited by the Bank in an account at the Central Bank of Brazil at the request of
   the borrower. The proceeds of the second tranche will be deposited after all the
   conditions of the second tranche release are met. For each tranche, the central bank will
   immediately credit the disbursed amounts to the Single Treasury Account managed by
   the state. The government will then provide a confirmation to the Bank that (a) the loan
   proceeds were received into an account of the Central Bank of Brazil that is part of the
   country's foreign exchange reserves, and (b) an equivalent amount has been transferred
   to the state's Single Treasury Account. If the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible
   purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the
   government to refund the amount. Due to the conclusions related to the adequacy of the
   government's public financial management environment, no additional fiduciary
   arrangements will be put in place for the operation. However, the Bank will reserve the
   option of requesting an audit of the disbursement of the proceeds of the loan.

   F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

   154. The proposed operation is considered to have moderate risks. Table 9
   summarizes the main risks and the proposed mitigation measures.

                                                    The risk of negative impact is deemed to be low.

Cabinet Office Nº 55     /2011                        Rio de Janeiro, January 26, 2011

Mr. ROBERT B. ZOELLICK

President

The World Bank

Washington, DC



Ref. DEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER



Dear Sir,

I am herewith forwarding the Metropolitan Housing and Urban Sustainable Development
Program (PROHDUMS) for the state of Rio de Janeiro. The objective of this program is
to strengthen recent advancements in the provision of public services, especially in the
areas of urban development, social interest housing, and integrated social assistance.

The increasing demand for government actions in an economy the size of that of the state
of Rio de Janeiro is not always supplied solely by tax revenue proceeds, collections or
transfers. A recent revision of the Fiscal Adjustment Program undertaken by the
Secretary of the Treasury (STN) has provided Rio de Janeiro with an improved fiscal
space for entering into contracts for internal and external credit operations to address
priority government projects, including this Program.

The state of Rio de Janeiro believes that financial assistance from the World Bank in the
form of a Policy Development Loan (DPL) is necessary to guarantee the continuity of
structural reforms, and their positive impacts on society and the economy.

 State of Rio de Janeiro: recent developments, challenges, and perspectives

The State of Rio de Janeiro has the third largest population and the second highest GDP
in Brazil. The rate of urbanization in the state is around 98 percent and its population is
highly concentrated in the metropolitan region of the Rio de Janeiro municipality (75
percent).

The Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro (RMRJ) was instituted by Complementary
Law n°20 on July 1st 1974 after the fusion of the old states of Rio de Janeiro and
Guanabara. With a population of 11,812,482 residents (IBGE/2008) in a state with a total
population of 16,010,429, it is the second largest metropolitan city in Brazil, the third
largest in South America, and the 23rd largest in the world (2008). The municipalities of
Belford Roxo, Duque de Caxias, Guapimirim, Itaguaí, Itaboraí, Japeri, Magé, Mesquita,
                                          - 74 -
Nilópolis, Niterói, Nova Iguaçu, Paracambi, Queimados, Rio de Janeiro, São Gonçalo,
São João de Meriti, Seropédica and Tanguá make up the RMRJ, which occupies a land
area of 5,645 km2 with a GDP of R$172,563,073,000.00 (2005).

 The Region will be affected by major events in the coming years. The Municipality of
Rio de Janeiro will be one of the main cities hosting the 2014 Soccer World Cup and will
also host the Olympic Games in 2016. In addition, it will also host the Military World
Games in 2011, the Rio+20 Conference in 2012, and the FIFA Soccer Confederations
Cup in 2013.

Moreover, the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro is strengthening its role as a vital
economic center in Brazil. This is evident in the current expansion of its role as a major
industrial and export/logistics center (petrochemicals, commodity exports, metals), as
well as the revitalization of the service sector, the oil and gas sector, and the tourism
industry.

Currently, the State of Rio de Janeiro is experiencing a period of major investments,
which amount to nearly R$100 billion. The political situation is also favorable as the
federal, state, and municipal governments (including the Rio de Janeiro City Hall) are in
alignment. This allows the integration of these investments with the interests and needs of
Fluminese society.

In the past three years, there were a series of investments in Rio de Janeiro (primarily in
the steel, petrochemical, and naval sectors), whose impacts are being evaluated. The
construction of the Metropolitan Arc/Ring Road connected the investments in Itaborai
Petrochemical (COMPERJ, Steel Center, and the Itaguai Port). This will greatly alter the
configuration of the region as new centers of activity emerge, and accessibility and
mobility structures are reconfigured.

However, various social and economic challenges remain. Income inequality is high in
comparison to similar states. As a result, reductions in the poverty rate have been slower
than in the rest of the country during the past decade. The size of the informal economy,
which accounts for nearly 44 percent of existing jobs in the state is also a challenge.

In the Capital, the favela population has grown at a rate three times faster than the city's
overall population growth. In addition, the state has the fourth highest rate of homicides
in the country which are also higher in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region. The Rio
state government has been working toward a cycle of new investments that translate into
economic development; since investments are a necessary condition for economic
development but not sufficient by themselves. Thus, it is essential to implement public
policies that foster social inclusion, inequality reduction and urban planning to improve
the quality of life of Fluminese society.

The key challenge is to guarantee that development not only meets the spatial
requirements for the economic transformation of the region, but also provides a better
quality of life, protects the environment, reduces the risk of environmental disasters, and
offers inclusive growth, meeting the housing needs and economic opportunities of the
poorest section of the populations. This is the principal objective of the DPL.

                          Policies to be supported by the DPL

The objective of Rio's state government is to strengthen strategic programs, ensuring the
continuity and expansion of actions in priority areas; namely, urban sustainable
development and housing with a focus on improving housing for low income families,
disaster risk management, efficient public transport, and integrated social assistance.

To attain these objectives, the state requests assistance from the World Bank in three key
areas: (i) urban development; (ii) housing; and (iii) social development.

        (i)    Urban Development

In order to confront challenges in this area, the Rio de Janeiro state government has
adopted policies aimed at strengthening the planning and management of urban growth in
the metropolitan region through the following actions (to be implemented by Secretariats
under the coordination of the State Secretariat of Works):

       Strengthen state leadership in managing metropolitan issues through the
       establishment of a Directive Committee for Metropolitan Strategy under the
       coordination of the Vice-Governor of the State and a Technical Working
       Committee. (Decree to be edited by negotiations)

       Create the Bilhete Único (Single Ticket) to improve the convenience and
       affordability of public transportation in the Metropolitan Region by integrating
       tariffs for intercity transport. (Law 5328 of December 2009)

       Strengthen the capacity to protect environmental assets by expanding the State
       Environmental Institute's (INEA) capacity and providing it with its own funding
       sources. (Law 5629 of December 2009 and Law 5439 of April 2009)

       Improve the effectiveness of watershed management and promote decentralization
       by: (i) instituting a fee for all water rights holders and (ii) transferring those funds
       to watershed management organizations. (Decree 42974 of 2009 and Law State
       5639 of 2010)

       Issue State Decree 42406 of April 2010 (Morar Seguro Program) that established
       a state program of prevention and structured actions to address disaster and risk
       situations with incentives for municipal participations. This initiative created: (i) a
       housing program that gives priority to populations in risk areas, (ii) a social rent
       program for families affected by disasters, and (iii) assistance and incentives for
       municipalities to delineate risk areas.

                   Urban Development ­ Conditions for Disbursement

       The Directive Committee for Metropolitan Strategy strengthens key metropolitan
       governance mechanisms by issuing an integrated program for RMRJ, as reflected
       in the State's Multiyear Plan 2012-2015;

       The state and the municipalities strengthen the legal framework and procedural
       system for effective decentralization of environmental licensing for the activities
       with local impacts, by instituting a quality control system for licenses issued;

       The state implements and puts into operation an effective monitoring and real
       time alarm system for flooding in the Iguaçu and Sarapuí basins, and the area east
       of Guanabara Bay.

       (ii)    Housing

In the housing area, the strategy of the Rio state government to reduce the housing deficit
in the poorest areas will promote the provision of housing to the low-income population,
preferably to families with incomes of 0 to 3 Minimum Wages. The actions detailed
below (which will be under the coordination of the State Secretary for Housing, will
ensure that this housing will be provided at affordable prices, and with access to
infrastructure and services:

       The state provides incentives for effective private sector participation in the
       construction of low-income housing, as well as land and infrastructure (as
       needed), and coordinates the demand cadastre;

       The state strengthens low-income housing management and policy by creating the
       Management Council for the State Housing and Social Interest Fund (FEHIS);

       The state and at least one municipality sign a cooperation agreement through
       regulatory measures and incentive, in order to meet the housing demand in the
       income range of 0 to 3 Minimum Salaries for families living in vulnerable areas;

       The state strengthens its structure for land titling programs through the: (i)
       implementation of pilot projects under Complementary Law 131 of 2009,
       allowing the donation of state lands, with the objective to regulate the occupancy
       of low-income families in irregular settlements and, (ii) approval and regulation
       of Law 5440 of 2009 for the exemption of ITD associate with the donation of
       state property to low-income families.

       The state provides technical assistance to municipalities to strengthen the capacity
       for land titling under the Joint Resolution nº 01 of 2009 - SEH / ITERJ.


                                          - 77 -
                        Housing - Conditions for Disbursement

       The state formulates a new policy for FEHIS that establishes guidelines and
       priority strategies for the low-income housing sector;

       The state strengthens the condominium management and housing program by
       implementing a sustainable self-management model;

       The state structures a system to identify vacant and/or underutilized areas for
       public housing use;

       The state strengthens the Rio de Janeiro State Land Institute (ITERJ) allocating
       resource and expanding programs to double its capacity in the area of Land
       Regularization Programs.

       (iii)   Social Development

In recent decades, social indicators of education, health, poverty and inequality in the Rio
de Janeiro Metropolitan Region have been improving. Unfortunately, these
improvements have taken place at a lower rate than expected, and lagging behind the
advances made by some other Brazilian states. To proactively confront this trend, the Rio
de Janeiro state government has promoted the provision of social support to the low-
income urban population in an objective and integrated way, based on the following
actions under the coordination of the State Secretary of Social Assistance and Human
Rights:

       A state Resolution launched the program called UPP Social to carry out three
       pilot programs to institutionalize the territorial integration of social interventions
       in favelas.

       The state established new operational rules for PROTEJO (a protection program
       for at-risk youth), in order to improve the goals and transparency of the selection
       process, and provide resources for violence and crime prevention programs for
       vulnerable youth.

                  Social Development- Conditions for Disbursement

       The state restructures and operationalizes the Secretary of Social Assistance and
       Human Rights (transition from a silos structure to a horizontal sectors
       organization encouraging coordination and operational integration as well as
       introduce a monitoring and evaluation unit).

       Establishment of a structured and standardized protocol (procedure) for
       monitoring and evaluating social actions.


                                           - 78 -
                            Request for financial support

The Rio de Janeiro state government believes that the set of policies described above
form a coherent and sustainable attempt to support economic and social development in
the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region, and is deeply committed to the continuation and
expansion of the Development Program and the specific policies supported by the DPL.

By means of this letter, the Rio de Janeiro state government is requesting financial
assistance from the World Bank in the amount of US$ 485,000,000.00 (four hundred
eighty-five million dollars), in the form of two disbursements under the Development
Policy Loan (DPL), intended to support measures already taken under the program as
well as those needed to solidify them.

   ANNEX 4: MACRO ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY IN
                   THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO

   Recent Evolution of Fiscal and Debt Indicators for the State of Rio de Janeiro

   1.     The fiscal situation of the state of Rio de Janeiro had been improving in the
   years preceding the global financial crisis. In particular, fiscal balances improved
   substantially from primary deficits in 1995-2002, to surpluses thereafter, in what marked
   a period of strong fiscal adjustment measures. Further improvements took place after
   2006, which saw low primary and overall deficits become high surpluses in 2007 and
   2008. This positive trend was reversed in 2009, when the size of the surpluses narrowed
   substantially.

   2.      The state's revenues benefited from a favorable global economic
   environment between 2006 and 2008. Total revenues increased by close to 19 percent
   in real terms. Social contributions more than doubled. The boom in commodity prices
   allowed for increased royalties from the oil sector. Tax revenues rose, boosted by
   significant improvements in tax collection efforts (see Table A4.1).

   3.      Total current expenditures grew at a real rate of 10 percent between 2006
   and 2008, significantly lower than the 19 percent growth for total revenues. In fact,
   revenues grew faster than expenditures even when including 2009, the year of the crisis,
   which brought average growth to 17 percent for revenues and 13 percent for expenditures
   in 2006-09. Expenditures on goods and services were capped to control the growth of
   current expenditures. Employee compensation grew significantly in 2007, leveling off
   thereafter. Expenditures on pensions remained stable, while transfers grew steadily over
   the period, both to FUNDEB and the municipalities.

   4.      Net transfers remained largely unchanged in real terms between 2007 and
   2009. Transfers accounted for an average of 10 percent of total revenues during 2006-09,
   with growing transfers from FUNDEB and convênios (see Table A4.2). Federal
   government transfer revenues, including FPE, IPI (industrial production), and Lei Kandir
   (exports), jointly accounted for almost one third of revenues from transfers. Another third
   was accounted for by transfers from FUNDEB, which increased by over 140 percent
   between 2006 and 2009 in real terms. Capital transfers grew almost fourfold as a result of
   the convênios, which marked the increase in public infrastructure investments that were
   part of Brazil's Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) launched in 2007. Transfers from
   convênios are expected to continue to grow, as the second phase of the program (PAC-2)
   outlines further large public investment projects over 2011-14. Transfers expenditures
   averaged 23 percent of total expenditures over the same period. Two thirds went to
   municipalities and the remainder to FUNDEB. Rio's net transfers are negative, as
   transfers to the municipality and FUNDEB exceed current and capital transfers from the
   federal government and from FUNDEB.

   5.      The state's net consolidated debt has been falling in proportion to its
   revenues, and is comfortably within the limit set by the Fiscal Responsibility Law.
   Due to growing fiscal revenues and consistent fiscal adjustments, the net consolidated
   debt-to-revenue ratio fell from over 200 percent in 2003 to 163 percent by 2009. Since
   2005, the state is in compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), which sets the
   ceiling for the ratio of net consolidated debt to net current revenue at 200 percent (see
   Table A4.4 and Figure A4.1).

   6.      Debt service has been growing modestly, driven by higher amortization
   rather than interest payments. Debt service payments are capped at 11.5 percent of net

Fiscal and Debt Projections for 2010-2020

7.       The projected fiscal and debt paths for the state of Rio de Janeiro are
deemed sustainable in the medium term. The baseline scenario projections indicate a
sustainable path, with positive primary fiscal balances. Net consolidated debt is projected
to fall from 152 percent of net current revenue in 2009 to under 100 percent by 2020. The
debt trend is determined by current revenue and expenditure dynamics, whose difference
is the gross operating balance (GOP). After deducting amortization from the GOP, any
remaining fiscal resources are assumed to be used for investment. Rio's fiscal balances
(the primary fiscal balance, the overall balance, and the gross operating balance) are all
expected to record surpluses for the projected period, allowing for fiscal space for state
investments.

8.      In particular, average revenue growth exceeds expenditure growth, leading
to a widening primary surplus. On the revenue side, the principal drivers for the steep
increase are taxes (primarily from ICMS, which is heavily dependent on economic
growth) and current transfers from the federal government (from convênios and
FUNDEB). Capital transfers are falling in real terms while other current revenues grow
gradually. Royalties, which accounted for 11.5 percent of current revenues in 2009,
account for an almost constant share of current revenues in 2020. This takes as a baseline
the (conservative) scenario in which Rio's share in total federal royalties revenues
(aliquota) stays unchanged from its 2009 level (business as usual), and oil and gas
production does not take into account additional recently discovered Pre-Salt reserves.
An alternative scenario in which Pre-Salt reserves are tapped and, at the same time, the
state's share of revenues drops is modeled in the risk analysis (see Table A4.5). On the
expenditure side, current expenditures are rising as a result of steep real increases in
employee compensation as well as sub-national transfers to municipalities and to
FUNDEB. On the other hand, current expenditures are declining as a share of net current
revenue.

9.      In the baseline scenario, the debt dynamics is sustainable and complies with
the Fiscal Responsibility Law. Based on data for scheduled amortizations and interest
payments, net consolidated debt is projected to rise slightly in real terms until 2013, after
which it is expected to fall rapidly until 2020, in line with amortization. As a share of net
current revenue, net debt is expected to start declining as soon as 2012, falling below 100
percent by 2020 from 152 percent in 2009. Debt service payments are expected to
increase as a result of principal amortization, while interest payments fall. Nonetheless,
both net consolidated debt and debt service are declining as a percent of net current
revenue, and stay within the Fiscal Responsibility Law limit set by the federal
government.

   10.     Data for the baseline year, 2009, were taken from SEFAZ and were
   reclassified according to Government Finance Statistics (GFS) classification.
   According to the GFS classification methodology, net current revenues includes capital
   transfers revenues (as reported by the Brazilian statistics), which are otherwise excluded
   in the central bank's definition of current revenues. This accounting difference brings the
   net consolidated debt-to-revenues ratio down to 152 percent in 2009. The baseline fiscal
   and debt projection results for 2010 to 2020 are presented in Table A4.6. The
   assumptions used for the projections are found in Table A4.7.

Risk Analysis

11.     The risk analysis assesses the impact of uncertainty surrounding
fundamental variables for Rio's fiscal outlook. The main risks that could lead to a
deterioration in the state's fiscal balances are related to (i) fluctuations in macroeconomic
variables, (ii) uncertainty surrounding Pre-Sal oil and gas revenues, and (iii) expenditures
related to large capital investment in public private partnerships (PPPs), such as the 2014
World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. The objective of the analysis is to establish
whether any given shock would have a negative impact on revenues or increase
expenditures and compromise fiscal and debt sustainability.

      (i)     Fluctuations in Macroeconomic Variables
12.     The analysis examines the impact of fluctuations in key macroeconomic
variables (the exchange rate, IPCA and IGP inflation, real GDP growth, and
personnel growth) on projected fiscal and debt aggregates. Pessimistic scenarios were
modeled for each of the variables, the combined outcome of which produces the joint
shock analyzed, painting a highly pessimistic view of the macroeconomic environment.
Both stochastic and simultaneous joint shocks were simulated. The deterministic shock
entails a specified set change from the baseline to the alternative scenario; the stochastic
component entails Monte Carlo simulations of 1,000 iterations to each of the specified
variables (on the exchange rate, IPCA and IGP inflation, and real GDP growth), with
shocks produced randomly from a multivariate normal distribution (with mean zero and
variance-covariance matrix calculated for the period 1999-2009). See Figure A4.5.

13.     The assumptions used for baseline and deterministic alternative scenarios
are found in Table A4.8 and are explained as follows. The baseline assumptions for
the macroeconomic variables are based upon forecasts by the Central Bank of Brazil
(BCB) and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). In particular, estimates for the
exchange rate, IPCA and IGP inflation, and real GDP growth were taken from the BCB
Focus Report (as of October 29, 2010) for 2010 and 2011, and from the EIU for 2012-15,
and were assumed to remain at their 2015 levels for 2016-20. The alternative scenario
assumptions were the baseline level less (or plus) 0.5 times the variable's standard
deviation over 2000-09 for the respective lower (or higher) scenarios for the GDP growth
and inflation variables. The alternative exchange rate assumed an additional 20 percent
depreciation rate each year. Estimates for personnel growth and the additional growth
variable were provided by SEFAZ, and the alternative was taken to be 1 percent higher
and lower, respectively.

14.     The projected fiscal and debt trajectories are deemed sustainable in the
scenario of joint adverse macroeconomic shocks. While this pessimistic scenario
causes a rise in both revenues and expenditures in nominal terms (due to the inflation
component), in real terms both fall. Lower growth rates have large negative impacts on
current revenues, which fall by more than current expenditures. The higher personnel
growth rate is reflected in higher employee compensation expenses, and interest
payments rise due to the deteriorating exchange rate. Nonetheless, despite these adverse
effects, both the primary and overall balances remain positive throughout the period, and
there is fiscal room for positive state investments. The total net consolidated debt first

                                           - 93 -
   rises steeply reaching 168 percent of net current revenue in 2012, after which it falls to
   141 percent in 2020.

     (ii)    Uncertain Royalty Revenues

15.      This analysis models the risks associated with uncertain royalty revenues for
the state. Royalty revenues represented 16 percent of Rio's net current revenues in 2009.
Yet, a large uncertainty surrounds the future of this revenue source for three reasons:
firstly, the potential impact of fluctuations in global prices on the prices of oil and gas;
secondly, the volume of existing and extractable oil and gas; and lastly, the sharing rule
applied to total oil and gas revenues.

16.     As for the prices of oil and gas, two types of shocks are relevant:
international price fluctuations (in US$) and exchange rate fluctuations (R$/US$).
The combined effect on the local currency value of oil and gas is estimated using
projected prices (in US$) produced by the World Bank's Development Research Group
(DECDG), and imposing the alternative depreciation rate with a shock (including an
additional 20 percent annual depreciation rate as well as joint macroeconomic shock) as
per Table A4.8. Also see Table A4.9.

17.     Uncertainty surrounds the volumes of oil and gas production that will be
extracted. It is relevant to distinguish two significantly different possibilities: namely,
with and without the additional Pre-Salt reserves recently discovered off Brazil's coast.
Ambiguity lies in the quantity of natural resources available and whether they will be
extracted successfully. The baseline models a worst case scenario to allow for the
possibility that none of the Pre-Salt oil and gas reserves are extracted. The oil production
is taken as Petrobras' Business Plan figures without the adjustment made for Pre-Salt oil.
The gas production is modeled assuming gas remains at a constant share of oil production
computed as the average share over the period 2002-10. The alternative scenarios
regarding the extent of the Pre-Salt oil reserves entail: a high case, based on Petrobras'
Business Plan for 2010-14; a low case, taken from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA); and a medium case, taken as the simple arithmetic average of the
two. Gas production is modeled slightly differently. As the Pre-Salt gas volumes are not
explicitly disaggregated from the expected total in Petrobras' Business Plan, the medium
Pre-Salt scenario is modeled as it is found in their figures. Deterministic shocks equal
plus/minus 10 percent from the high/low case scenarios (see Table A4.9).

18.     The change in the sharing rule has a large impact on total net current
revenue in all cases. Figure A4.8 illustrates the effect of each of the combinations of
production and sharing rule scenarios on net current revenue under the case of baseline
depreciation of the exchange rate. Despite the reduced royalties, large increases in tax
revenues and current transfers, still allow for a steep increase in revenues over the
projected period.

19.     The projected figures indicate sustainable fiscal and debt trajectories over
2010-20, assuming a sharp fall in royalty revenues to Rio. In this pessimistic scenario,
royalty revenues fall to R$3.1 billion (or 5 percent of NCR) by 2020, compared to R$11.6
billion (or 12 percent of NCR) in the baseline. This generates a drop in net current
revenue, which in turn increases the ratio of current expenditures to revenues. The share
of investment falls accordingly, yet fiscal space for investment remains positive. The
trajectory for the ratio of net consolidated debt remains negatively sloped, falling to a
median value of 110 percent by 2020 (see Figure A4.8).

20.     This section models the fiscal and debt sustainability risks posed by large
increased expenditures for the state of Rio related to hosting the World Cup and
Olympics games. Expenditures for the World Cup are estimated at R$200 million for the
reconstruction of the Maracanã stadium. For the Olympics, while subject to revision, the
state government is currently responsible for R$472 million in security investments, and
a total of R$3.2 billion in transportation investments (of which R$806 million will be
undertaken jointly with the private sector, and R$1.1 billion jointly with the federal
government). These increased expenditures can potentially pose risks to the

21.     The state government's expenditures related to the 2014 World Cup are
estimated at R$200 million. It is currently estimated that total investment expenditure
will reach approximately R$17 billion, of which R$11.4 billion will target urban mobility
and the remaining R$5.7 billion will be used for renovating stadiums. The values and
projects have been outlined in the Matrix of Responsibilities (Matriz de
Responsabilidade) in an agreement between the Ministry of Sport, and Rio's state and
municipal governments (and made public online through the Portal da Transparência).
Estimated costs for the city of Rio de Janeiro alone (financed by all three levels of
government) are of the order of R$3.2 billion. Of this amount, R$1 billion will be federal
government investments, R$420 million will be the responsibility of the municipal
government, and R$200 million will be invested by the state government for the
reconstruction of the Maracanã stadium.

   However, at this stage, the total amount and burden of these costs are less clearly defined.
   Rio de Janeiro's Candidate Dossier is currently being reviewed by the International
   Olympic Committee (IOC) and the federal, state, and municipal governments. This could
   imply a redefinition of responsibilities, timeline, financing, and so forth. Over R$12
   billion in investments have already been estimated, and expenditures for the different
   sectors have been broadly assigned: accommodation by the private sector; sport
   areas/installations mostly by the federal and municipal governments; security by the

                                                  - 100 -
   federal and state governments; technology by the federal and municipal governments;
   and transportation by a combination of all three levels of government. Thus far,
   expenditures under the responsibility of the state government entail the totality of security
   expenses and roughly under half of transport expenses (including projects of joint
   responsibility with the federal government and private sector). See Tables A4.12 and
   A4.13.

   23.      Two scenarios are analyzed to take into account projected one-off large-scale
   investments associated with the World Cup and Olympic Games: the first, assuming
   currently budgeted expenses; and the second, assuming a 40 percent increase in
   these expenditures.64 The investments were calculated by assuming that the total
   budgeted expenses are uniformly distributed in constant R$ terms, from 2011 up to the
   year that each athletic event takes place. Note that this assumes that they are one-time
   expenses with no continuity in the succeeding years. Olympics-related security expenses
   are classified as current employee compensation within current expenditures, while the
   World Cup stadium reconstruction and Olympics-related transport expenses are classified
   as capital investments. The analysis shows that capital investments related to the athletic
   events, both budgeted and pessimistic, average 12 percent of the fiscal space in the first
   scenario, and 17 percent in the second scenario. As fiscal space is increasing over time
   from 2012 onwards, in line with rising current revenues compared to current expenditures
   plus amortization, the share of capital investments is decreasing. Fiscal space excluding
   capital expenditure related to the athletic games increases over the projected period 2010-
   20, falling in real terms only in 2011 (see Tables A4.14 and A4.15).

   24.    To understand how increases in capital investments would affect Rio's fiscal
   balances it is important to understand how the debt sustainability model works.
   Investment in the model is a residual, which takes the value of 5 percent of royalty




   64
     This is in line with an estimated difference between actual and budgeted expenses for major athletic
   events

                                                                       - 102 -
revenues65 plus any additional fiscal space for investment after subtracting amortization
from the gross operating balance (the difference between current revenues and current
expenditures). In other words, the model assumes that debt is amortized on schedule
(according to SEFAZ data) and that capital investment will be determined by the residual
fiscal space. Thus, capital investments will, in turn, shape the overall and primary
balances and net financing needs (given by debt service minus the primary balance). Any
positive net financing needs will convert into real-denominated extra limit debt stock.

25.     The fiscal and debt trajectories for the state government are considered to be
sustainable in both scenarios modeling expenditures for the World Cup and
Olympic Games. Under the baseline projection, large fiscal room is available for
additional capital investments, namely the reconstruction of the Maracanã stadium and
transport infrastructure. Moreover, because the fiscal space for other investments not
related to the games remains positive and increasing over the projected period (after
dipping in 2011), they will likely not be squeezed. Financing is assumed to be achieved
internally, through the surplus budget and fiscal space. Thus, net consolidated debt and
debt service payments are not affected, and continue to follow the baseline trajectory.
The increased security expenses are classified as personnel expenditures, which rise both
nominally and as a share of NCR, still remaining within the FRL limit. As a result,
current expenditures rise slightly in 2011-16 as a share of NCR, but maintain its
downward-sloping path.

      (iv)   Impact of the World Bank Operation
26.     The overall impact of the proposed operation on Rio's fiscal position is
limited; it remains sustainable and complies with the limits of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law. The loan will affect the fiscal aggregates by increasing net current
revenues and fiscal balances in 2011 and 2012. Net debt will be affected through an
increase in the stock of debt denominated in foreign currency, and through a change in
the cash flow profile. Interest repayments will increase in the near term. Net current
revenue, the level of investment, and fiscal balances will change as shown in Table
A4.16.

27.  The operation will affect Rio state government's finances in the following
way:

       Net current revenues. The IBRD loan disbursement will be counted as an
extraordinary capital transfer to the state government, thereby increasing net current
revenues in 2011 and 2012.



65
   The minimum level of investment is guaranteed by the allocation of 5 percent of oil revenues to the
Fundo Estadual de Conservação Ambiental (FECAM), the state's environment conservation fund. The
fiscal space left for further investment is defined, on the one hand, by the surplus of the gross operating
balance net of total amortization and, on the other hand, by the capital transfers negotiated every year with
the federal government to finance specific investment projects. In the analysis, no assumptions have been
made on prospective projects with União. As such, all investment expenditure will only be within the fiscal
space left by the gross operating balance.

                                                  - 103 -
   Investment. By increasing revenues, it will also be increasing the fiscal space for
   investments in 2011 and 2012, allowing investment as a share of NCR to increase.

   Primary balances. The operation will increase the primary balance, although the
   increase in capital transfers will partly be absorbed by a less-than-proportional
   increase in investment.

   Gross operating balance. The operation will increase the gross operating balance
   in 2011 and 2012, allowing for more space for investment.

   Debt service and debt dynamics. The operation will increase the debt service
   profile, yet still remaining below the FRL limits. The stock of debt will increase,
   but this will not compromise the debt sustainability of the State of Rio de Janeiro,
   and the net consolidated debt-to-NCR ratio will remain within FRL requirements.
