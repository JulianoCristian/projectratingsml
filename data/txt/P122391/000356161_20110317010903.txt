satisfaction with respect to the innovative integrated development approach adopted by the Bank
in this loan. Directors further expressed their support for the adequate risk assessment and
mitigation measures. Specifically, Executive Directors supported the poverty focus of the
project, the provision of affordable housing, as well as the targeted and integrated social
assistance programs to the urban poor.
