                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to support the state government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) to strengthen its policies for planning and managing territorial
                         growth in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region (Regiao Metropolitana de Rio de Janeiro, RMRJ), promoting the provision of affordable housing, and creating
                         integrated social development programs targeted at the urban poor. The proposed operation is fully consistent with and closely linked to the objectives of the Brazil
                         CPS, 2008-2011. In particular, through its prior actions, the DPL will strengthen local governance at the metropolitan level; boost competitiveness by supporting
                         mechanisms that facilitate infrastructure development; improve environmental sustainability by protecting natural resources and assets; andincrease equity by reaching
                         out to the most vulnerable.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The team performed a final supervision mission from November 26-30 before the project's closing on December 31, 2012. The mission reviewed all aspects of policy actions, results
                         and indicators for each area of the project with the client and held team discussions on the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Over the last couple of
                         months of 2012, the loan's project's implementation has showed some progress in all three areas of the development policy loan (DPL): planning and management of urban growth,
                         affordable housing and integrated social programs. Of the project's 18 indicators, seven have been met, and five more show good progress in line to meet final targets, by the
                         project's close and six will not be met by the project's close. While the first policy area of planning and management of urban growth has shown substantial results and had achieved
                         the majority of its indicators, the second and third areas have consistently been the cause of concern in meeting the project's development objectives. The mission did not prepare an
                         Aide Memoire but agreed on a calendar of steps to prepare the ICR. Such agenda was included in a ppt which is attached to this ISR.
