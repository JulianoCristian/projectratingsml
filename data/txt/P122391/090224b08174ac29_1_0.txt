                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed operation is to support the state government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) to strengthen its policies for planning and managing territorial
                         growth in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region (Regiao Metropolitana de Rio de Janeiro, RMRJ), promoting the provision of affordable housing, and creating
                         integrated social development programs targeted at the urban poor. The proposed operation is fully consistent with and closely linked to the objectives of the Brazil
                         CPS, 2008-2011. In particular, through its prior actions, the DPL will strengthen local governance at the metropolitan level; boost competitiveness by supporting
                         mechanisms that facilitate infrastructure development; improve environmental sustainability by protecting natural resources and assets; and increase equity by
                         reaching out to the most vulnerable.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Over the past several months, the loan's project's implementation has progressed steadily in all three areas of the development policy loan (DPL): planning and management of urban
                         growth, affordable housing and integrated social programs. Of the project's 18 indicators, five have been met and five more show good progress in line to meet final targets by the
                         project's close. Notable advancements include (i) the State Environmental Institute (INEA) surpassing its goal to increase its direct annual investment budget by more than 2.5 times
                         the target amount; (ii) INEA mapping 78.9 percent of the metropolitan region's municipalities for landslide susceptibility, surpassing the target of 75 percent; and (iii) the Territorios da
                         Paz social program serving 17 favela territories, an increase from 5 since the previous ISR.

                         For some indicators, updated data since the previous ISR was not available; others have yet to reach their targets. Areas offering the most concerns are affordable housing and
                         integrated social programs.
