current\n            global crisis, to bring their fiscal stance to a sound and\n            sustainable track and protect the development objectives set\n            in Ghana's Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            (GPRS II) for the period 2006-2009. The GPRS II emphasizes\n            the centrality of private-led growth to reduce poverty,\n            along with human development and governance efforts to\n            promote equity. While EGPRC will translate primarily into\n            funding for the GPRS II implementation, particular attention\n            is given to: (i) restoring budgetary discipline; and (ii)\n            tackling long-standing public sector and energy issues. The\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO) is part of a program of\n            support to Ghana during FY09 that currently implies a 27\n            percent front-loading of International Development\n            Association (IDA) assistance. This operation will be\n            complemented by a sector (natural resources) development\n            policy operation (US$l0 million), and two investment\n            projects in transport (US$225 million) and rural water\n            (US$15 million). Other operations being prepared for FY10\n            include an International Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development (IBRD) enclave for the gas sector, a sector\n            development policy operation (agriculture), support for the\n            development of safety nets, a project in support of the\n            water and sanitation sectors, and a joint initiative with\n            partners to support public sector reforms and capacity development."}, "docdt": "2009-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
