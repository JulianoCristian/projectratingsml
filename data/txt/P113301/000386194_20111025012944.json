for Ghana were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; borrower performance was satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: improving harmonized frameworks.\n            Importance of announcement or credibility effects.\n            Announcement of the approval of an operation like EGPRC did\n            help in stabilizing exchange rate. It helped through (i) the\n            replenishment of foreign reserves and (ii) that the Bank and\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) macro monitoring and\n            support to structural reform will help addressing some of\n            the causes of the rapid depreciation. Need for realistic\n            time framework and sequencing. While determining the prior\n            actions to be achieved, there is a need on the part of the\n            Bank and the Government to be realistic about the time\n            framework and the sequencing within which the deliverables\n            can be achieved. Trade-off between responsiveness to crisis\n            and quality at entry. The quality at entry is likely to\n            suffer in a situation such as the once faced by the Bank\n            during the preparation of the EGPRC, when it had to respond\n            to the macroeconomic crisis on an emergency basis.\n            Importance of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), think\n            tanks, trade unions and other organized structures. As the\n            Government by itself is unlikely to create an external\n            accountability mechanism, the Bank can play a major role for\n            creating and strengthening it by involving CSOs, think\n            tanks, trade unions and other organized structures."}, "docdt": "2011-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
