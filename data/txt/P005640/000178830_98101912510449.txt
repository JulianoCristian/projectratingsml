I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Socio-Economic Background
1.01     A highly regulated economy with an inward looking investment
policy in the 1960s gave way to new policy orientations in the 1970s empha-
sizing export promotion and an easing of controls to allow more private
initiative in the economy. Overall, new policy directions have been
successful and with the additional impact of favorable harvests and
commodity prices, real GDP increased at an annual average rate of 8.0X
during 1969-79, almost twice as fast as during the 1960s. As a result ot
rapid economic growth, Tunisia has made impressive social gains in recent
years especially in education, health and family planning. The current
Plan (1977-81) calls for average real GDP growth of 7.3% p.a. and actual
achievement is likely to be about 7.0%. The main objectives of the Plan
are: (i) full employment of the additional labor force; (ii) self-
sufficiency in major foodstuffs; (iii) increases in standard of living; and
(iv) social stability through incomes policies and wage and price harmoni-
zation. Underlying these objectives is a continued strong commitment to
the expansion of social services and improvement in the distribution of
income. The preliminary version of the 1982-86 Plan continues to reflect
the emphasis on reducing unemployment by qualitative improvement of train-
ing and job creation (para. 1.04).
1.02     The population of Tunisia (estimated at 6.4 million in 1980) is
currently increasing at an average of 2.4% p.a. during the current Plan
period. Birth rates have been declining since the mid-1960s under the
impact of effective family planning programs, abolition of polygamy, a rise
in the legal marriage age and policies aimed at increasing female partici-
pation in education and economic development. Consequently, the proportion
of the population under 15 years declined between 1965 and 1980 from 46% ot
total population to an estimated 41% in 1980 and this trend is expected to
continue, reducing the pressure on the expansion of educational facili-
ties. Urban migration continues and the urban population accounted for 47%
of the total in 1975 compared with 26% in 1950. Currently, the urban popu-
lation is growing at 4.2% p.a. compared with an annual rural growth rate of
0.9%. The direction of migration has been towards the northeast region,
centered on the major cities of Tunis and Bizerte and away from the other
four regions. Population distribution also retlects differences in soil,
water and climatic conditions with population density becoming sparse in
the inland areas of the central and southern regions.
1.03     Net emigration of Tunisians overseas for employment reached 32,000
in 1971 and it has been estimated that Tunisians working abroad in 1971-72
were equivalent to about 13% of the labor force. Emigration declined
rapidly after 1973 as economic conditions worsened in Western Europe and
became negative in the mid-1970s. So, by 1975, only an estimated 2% of the
labor force were working abroad. Emigration strengthened in 1977-78 due to
a brief surge of demand for migrant workers in Libya but net migration
declined to zero in 1979. Nevertheless, workers' remittances have con-
tinued to increase and were estimated at US$240 million in 1979.  In the



-2-
1960s and early 1970s, overseas migration had an important impact on popu-
lation growth, reducing the annual rate from 2.7% to 2.3%.  It also served
to reduce unemployment although at the same time depriving Tunisia of
scarce skilled manpower, particularly craftsmen.
1.04     The most serious problem facing the Tunisian economy is the high
level of unemployment. The overall unemployment and underemployment rate
is currently estimated at between 20 and 25%.  The economy also suffers                       *
from significant underemployment, especially in agriculture which employs
around 35% of the work force. The inability of the economy to generate
sufficient employment opportunities led to social unrest in recent years
culminating in serious labor disturbances in early 1978. Thus employment
generation to reduce uremployment and absorb the increasing annual addi-
tions to the work force has become the major priority in Tunisia's develop-
ment strategy. The guidelines for development of the 1982-86 Plan reflect
a strategy of job creation through increased investment in the manufactur-
ing industries (mechanical, electrical, chemical and textiles). A signifi-
cant expansion of the tourism sub-sector is under consideration with
consequent job creation. In agriculture, extension of irrigation and
afforestation and other conservation schemes plus an overall emphasis on
integrated rural development would seek to reduce underemployment. In
addition, a major effort will be made to improve the relevance of education
and training to employment needs and to expand vocational and technical
training to provide for the country's skilled manpower needs.
Education Issues and Policies
1.05     The formal education system in Tunisia is well developed quantita-
tively with estimated gross enrollment levels of 100% in primary (6-11
years), 30% in secondary general and technical (12-18 years) and 6% in
higher education. The access of girls to education compares favorably with
other countries in the region, with girls accounting for 41% of total
primary and 36% of total secondary enrollments. The teaching service was
fully nationalized at the primary level by 1970 and rapid progress has been
made in replacing expatriate teachers at the secondary level. In 1970, 60%
of secondary teachers were Tunisian, but this proportion had reached 95% by
1979.
1.06     In spite of this progress, however, two major qualitative issues
have emerged in the school system in the form of low internal efficiency
and lack of relevance of courses to employment needs. Beyond the formal
system, the needs of school leavers and adult workers for expanded training
opportunities to increase their productivity and employability are also an
important issue. It is towards these problems that the education and
training objectives of the 1977-81 Plan are directed. The Plan also
reflects a general feeling that education in Tunisia does not yet ade-
quately prepare children for a future role in active economic life and as
responsible citizens imbued with Tunisian cultural values.



- 3 -
1.07     Low internal efficiency is reflected in high dropout and repeater
rates, particularly at the primary level where they reach nearly 10%o and
26%, respectively in grade 5.  The government is concerned that out of
1,000 pupils entering grade 1 (on recent trends), only 371 will pass into
secondary and vocational schools, 65 will obtain the baccalaureat, 62 a
diploma of technical or vocational training and 32 a degree or other higher
diploma. Leavers from the system through secondary amount to over 100,000
per year (80% at the primary level) and educational policy aims to:
(a) retain a higher proportion of students in the system; and (b) provide a
better preparation for working life for those who leave the system.
1.08     At the primary level, efforts focus on making education more
relevant to socio-economic conditions and on improving the school environ-
ment to encourage children to remain longer in school. Class sizes and
pupil/teacher ratios are being gradually reduced (from 41:1 in 1976 to 39:1
in 1980) and 1,700 new classrooms are planned to ease overcrowding. The
quality of teacher training is being improved through the introduction of a
full year of practice teaching and special training in teaching practical
courses. Greater emphasis will be placed on the development of basic
skills in numeracy and literacy to serve as an improved foundation for
later training for employment. The introduction of practical work in the
fifth and sixth grades is adding useful prevocational training to general
education and its extension to the seventh and eighth grades is aimed
specifically at those who would be forced otherwise to leave after the
sixth grade. A pilot project in 325 primary schools together with asso-
ciated teacher training is being financed under the third Bank education
project, Loan 1155-TUN (para. 1.23). The additional two years will be
vocationally oriented, the final year being spent largely in on-the-job
training in local enterprises. In addition, the rate of admission from
primary to secondary schools is expected to increase from 26% of grade 6
enrollments in 1976 to 30% by 1981. Furthermore, to assist in reducing
dropout and repeater rates at the secondary level, greater attention will
be given to aptitude, motivation and attainment as criteria for entry to
secondary education rather than age, which has been the chief determinant
in the past.
1.09     In recognition of the need to make secondary and higher education
more relevant to the needs of the economy, steps were taken during the
previous Plan to divert enrollments from the first level general secondary
education to lower secondary vocational courses (Annex 1, Chart 1) accom-
panied by expanded opportunities for promotion from this level to upper
secondary technical courses. By 1981, it is expected that 37% of new
entrants to lower secondary will enroll in the vocational program, compared
with 27% in 1974, while 13% of lower secondary graduates will enter the
upper secondary technical program in 1981, as compared with 6% in 1976.
Also by 1981, it is expected that 73% of enrollments in the upper secondary
cycle will be in science/math and technical courses, compared with 66% in
1976 and 48% in 1972. Within the universities, the shift towards science
and technology will continue with estimated enrollments in these fields
reaching 55% of the total in 1981, compared with 50% in 1976. With the



-4-
achievement of this balance in the universities between technical and non-
technical courses and annual enrollment growth of around 5%, the government
considers that the post-independence goal of achieving self-sufficiency in
the supply of high-level manpower will have been largely reached. Atten-
tion is now being directed towards the development of graduate programs and
a research capacity in fields (such as solar energy and fisheries) which
are directly related to development needs.
1.10     However, the government is aware that while the shift of emphasis
from general to technical education is fundamental to the process of
growth and modernization, the problem of educated unemployment is the
inevitable consequence if courses are not relevant to the needs of the
labor market. This problem confronts the Ministry of Education's voca-
tional and technical secondary schools due to lack of contact between the
schools and employers. However, to ensure that improved coordination with
employers and better information on the labor market do influence changes
in curricula, a directorate of programs has been established in the
Ministry of Education to undertake continuous review of curricula.
Further, greater emphasis is being placed on on-the-job training and in the
case of vocational training centers, coordination between institutions and
employers will be strengthened through greater emphasis on the work of the
national and regional cormissions on training and employment, through
closer contact with employers federations, and by establishing advisory
councils for training institutions (para. 2.04). Employment problems are
also the focus of a study of the relationships between the education/
training system and the labor market, financed under the third Bank educa-
tion project.
1.11     To complement the policy of making education more practical and
employment-oriented is the need to ensure that the education system
produces citizens attuned to the culture of Tunisia and aware of the
particular social and cultural values of the Tunisian state. The promotion
of Arabic as the language of instruction is seen as a focal point in
developing the national character. Arabization has already progressed as
far as the upper secondary cycle in history and philosophy and the produc-
tion of textbooks in Arabic in other subjects is being given priority.
However, arabization of technical and scientific subjects may be rctarded
by the difficulties of translation. Appropriate emphasis is also being
placed on Tunisian history and literature and the development of local
music and theater will be encouraged in the schools. Problems of popula-
tion growth, hygiene and nutrition will also be emphasized in support of
efforts to produce well-informed citizens.
Training Policy and the Role of the Office *
1.12     Training policy, in general, focusses on the need to provide
training opportunities for school leavers, train unemployed adults and to
raise the productivity and opportunity for advancement of workers already
in employment through upgrading of their skills. The current Plan (1977-
81) calls for the creation of 234,000 non-agricultural jobs, of which
*   See Glossary.



- 5 -
about 160,000 would need specialized training. To cope with the expanding
needs of employment and training, it is intended to: (a) broaden the range
of specializations available; and (b) consolidate the training system into
a pyramidal structure ranging from semi-skilled workers at the base to
engineers at the apex through the development of courses to allow upgrading
of able workers to higher skill levels. Concurrently, qualitative improve-
ment will be sought through the updating of training programs to ensure
*         greater relevance to employment needs.  Training will also be developed
within the regional development programs to teach skills relevant to local
needs for self-employed workers.
1.13     The Office has been given the central role in the policy of
expanding training opportunities and proposes to enlarge its activities in
apprenticeship, and the training, upgrading and certification of special-
ized workers, craftsmen and technicians. At the same time, particular
attention will be paid to regional employment needs and the need to develop
the training infrastructure in areas which are less well-endowed with
training institutions. The Office also has the responsibility tor overall
coordination of vocational training in Tunisia and intends to pursue this
objective through increasing its internal capacity for coordination and
through improved operation of the national and regional employment
commissions.
1.14     Under the current Plan, vocational training centers are to be
expanded from 45 to 53, with 57 new sections to be added to existing
centers. At the same time, a program for the renewal of equipment in
existing centers is being undertaken. Regular replacement of equipment
stock is now planned over a ten-year period. Special emphasis will be
placed on providing opportunities for unskilled workers to undertake train-
ing in skills which are closely related to regional and sectoral needs.
Priority sectors have been designated, namely, manufacturing, construction
and road transport. Regional priority will focus on areas currently less
well-served by training institutions. Skill training will be expanded by
about 800 places p.a. during the Plan period. This expansion will be the
shared responsibility of regional authorities and the Office with the
latter responsible for teachers, programs and equipment for workshops
provided by regional authorities.
1.15     Apprentice training requires substantial improvement.  At present
apprenticeship suffers from a severe lack of training counselors and poor
coordination. Currently there are more than 17,000 apprentices under con-
tract. However, only about 2% of these are controlled by the Office in the
three existing apprenticeship centers and the ratio of counselors to
apprentices is an inadequate 1:200. These unsatisfactory conditions have
led to an annual dropout rate of 25%, with 30% of apprentices finishing
their courses still classified as unskilled workers. It is common for
employers to regard apprentices merely as cheap labor. The five-year Plan
calls for an increase in enrollments to 30,000 with the number of centers
rising to 20. The counselor/apprentice ratio is planned to improve to
1:100. However, the Office considers this is too ambitious a plan in view
of the severity of the current situation and that a more modest approach is

required. It is proposed to establish one new apprenticeship center and
upgrade the three existing ones to provide four properly equipped and
staffed centers. These are to be used as a test-bench for new ideas for
training and coordination with industry, before embarking on a more
ambitious expansion plan in the longer term.
1.16     The aim is to ensure that training centers meet local needs for
skilled manpower at several levels and offer fully integrated training
support to local employers. Thus, regional centers offering training for
semi-skilled and craft workers also have courses for supervisors and tech-
nicians.  While directly meeting regional needs for particular skills
across a range of skill levels, the programs allow workers to upgrade their
skills.  Plans call for the establishment of 25 new sections for training
supervisors and technicians in 11 centers.
Manpower Requirements for Skilled Workers
1.17     The development of the Tunisian economy depends to a great extent
on the availability of technically trained manpower to serve the expansion
of the leading industrial sectors especially manufacturing, construction
and transportation. The demand for technically trained manpower in Tunisia
ranges across the whole spectrum of skills but the demand for skilled
workers and independent craftsmen is the most important. It is these
workers that form the broad base of the skill pyramid, supporting the fore-
men, technicians, and engineers who manage and control the productive
process.
1.18     Although lack of reliable basic data makes projections of future
needs for skilled workers difficult, annual estimated requirements for
skilled workers with formal vocational training are about 49,000, including
3,000 supervisors, through 1990. The structure of demand for particular
skills reflects the leading growth sectors in the Tunisian economy and the
emphasis is clearly on the metal and building trades, electricians,
mechanics and secretarial workers. In response to this demand, the voca-
tional training system produced 36,800 trained workers in 1978. The Office
plays a major role in supplying vocationally trained manpower and produced
15,700 or 43% of total output in 1978. The proposed project institutions
would make a significant contribution to increasing the training capacity
of the Office by providing 3,600 new places, producing annual outputs of
5,400.

1.19     The table above points up the severe deficiency in the training of
supervisors. Traditionally, most supervisors are drawn from the ranks of
skilled craftsmen and operators. They are generally those who have shown
superior performance on the job and have the personal qualities and man-
agerial skills to warrant advancement to a supervisory role. The Office
now seeks to provide formal courses to promising candidates which would
refine their knowledge of their particular craft and also emphasize the
principles of supervision. Ten courses are currently being offered, mainly
for the construction and textile industries and for motor repairs. Outputs
from these courses were 280 in 1978. The proposed project would provide
250 additional places which will produce 432 outputs annually, mainly in
the construction trades.
Education Finance
1.20     The relatively modest growth rate of enrollments in recent years
(about 1.7% p.a. in 1970-79) has contributed to reducing the burden of edu-
cation expenditure from about 8.7% of GDP in 1970 to 7% in 1979. In terms
of total government expenditure, the proportion allocated to education and
training has declined from 27% to 19% between 1970 and 1979. However,
there is some evidence that the declining trend in education expenditures
as a proportion of total government spending is levelling off. There is
consequently a need for close control over recurrent costs, particularly
salaries, which account for around 85% of the total. The government is
aware of this need and is taking appropriate measures. Recent increases
in salaries are to be phased over a four-year period to reduce their



- 8 -
impact. Further opportunities for lowering costs in the longer term will
be sought through reducing repeater rates and improving school location
planning to ensure better utilization of facilities and teachers. Every
effort will be made to reduce unit construction costs and to ensure appro-
priate space and equipment standards in educational facilities. These
efforts are being reinforced through technical assistance for specialists
in school mapping and norms and standards being financed under the third
Bank education project.  In view of the government's commitment to con-
trolling cost increases, it seems likely that education expenditure as a
proportion of GDP can be maintained at around 7% to 1990.
Bank Strategy and Lending for Education
1.21     Bank lending for education in Tunisia (two credits and one loan)
has been consistent with the government's objectives as perceived at the
time. Early lending in the first two credits focussed on the need to sup-
port the expansion of secondary education to help meet middle level man-
power needs and to increase the supply of inputs to post-secondary institu-
tions. Qualitative improvement was also sought through the provision of
teacher training facilities, and equipment to upgrade workshop and labora-
tory training. Later lending has focussed on the priority of making educa-
tion more relevant to employment needs and ensuring that further training
opportunities are available to those leaving the education system to
increase their productivity and employability.
1.22     The first credit (US$5 million in 1962) financed four new
secondary schools, the expansion of one other, and extensions to a
teachers' college for training lower secondary teachers. This project was
implemented satisfactorily and completed in February 1967. The second
credit (US$13 million in 1966) financed 9 new secondary schools, expansion
and equipping of 6 existing schools, and equipment for 16 secondary
schools. Savings resulting largely from favorable contract prices allowed
for the financing of industrial equipment for an additional 11 secondary
schools to improve workshop training and also the provision of technical
assistance to upgrade educational planning. The Project Performance Audit
Report for this project (No. 2226 of September 29, 1978) found that the
project was generally in line with Tunisia's priorities for expanding
secondary education but greater emphasis on vocational courses in the proj-
ect schools would have increased their relevance to manpower needs.
Physical aspects of the project were implemented satisfactorily but the
later addition of the technical assistance program in the area of education
planning was less successful because Tunisia and the Bank were not fully
agreed on the objectives of the team of specialists who were not all of
appropriate calibre. This resulted in the impact of the experts' efforts
being much reduced and project completion being postponed by more than five
years. Subsequently, this effort to improve educational planning was
successfully renewed in the third Bank project.
1.23     The lack of clearly defined objectives posed problems for the
third Bank project, a loan of US$8.9 million in 1975. The project aimed at



-9-
improving the relevance of the primary curriculum to the socio-economic
environment through the introduction of practical work in grades 5 and 6
together with associated teacher training. The project also included tech-
nical assistance for education planning studies and an experimental
post-primary training scheme to serve as a pilot program for the later
development of a general scheme to cope with the growing numbers of primary
school leavers. After the loan became effective, the government indicated
*          that, having reconsidered education priorities, it did not wish to proceed
with the project as appraised. After extensive discussions in which the
Bank tried to keep the project focussed on the objectives for which loan
money had been allocated, the project was amended in March 1979.  It
retains its major thrust towards expansion of practical work in grades 5
and 6 while replacing the experimental post-primary scheme with support for
extending the primary cycle to grades 7 and 8 to incorporate practical work
for those who would otherwise be forced out of school. The project is
financing workshops in 325 primary schools, the expansion and/or equipping
of 7 teachers' colleges to train practical teachers for the workshops and
technical assistance for two planning studies related to the development of
a nine-year basic education cycle and to the relationship between educa-
tion, training and employment. The ongoing Bank education study is
expected to contribute to the identification of a possible fifth project.
The latter study contributed directly to the design of the proposed fourth
project. Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. An emphasis
on improving the capacity for education planning runs through both the
second and third projects and in spite of early problems, education plan-
ning is now well established in the Ministry of Education. A planning
unit, adequately and competently staffed and assisted by experts financed
under the third project, is functioning efficiently and is active in the
fields of school mapping, statistics and planning and evaluation studies.
1.24     The proposed fourth education project aims at supporting the
policy of expanding training opportunities for school leavers and for skill
upgrading of the workforce. More specifically, the project will support
the Office in its plans for expanding and upgrading the apprentice training
scheme, broadening the range of adult training opportunities through the
establishment of new centers and the addition of new sections to existing
centers, and improving the quality of vocational training through the
re-equipping of poorly equipped workshops. Attention will also be given to
technical assistance for reinforcing the institutional capacity of the
Office to discharge its overall responsibility for coordinating vocational
training in Tunisia. In view of past project difficulties related to
planning and commitment, particular attention has been given to ensuring
government support for the project and that the project fits clearly into
the Office's priorities and plans for future development.

II.  THE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01     The proposed project was identified during Bank missions in May
and November 1978 and prepared by the government with the assistance of the
Bank and consultants financed under the third education project.  Prepara-
tion assistance missions visited Tunisia in January, May, September and
December 1979. The project was appraised by Messrs. W.E. Rees (economist,
mission leader), A. El-Tobgy (architect) and J.C. Jones (technical edu-
cator, consultant) during June 1980.
Objectives and Scope
2.02      The project is designed to:  (a) increase the supply of skilled
technical manpower in response to regional employment needs through the
establishment of eight new centers and the addition of new sections to the
existing centers; (b) improve the quality of vocational and apprentice
training through re-equipping poorly equipped workshops; and (c) assist in
the development and strengthening of the vocational/apprentice training
system through the financing of technical assistance related to the organi-
zation planning, management and evaluation of the Office's operations,
together with staff training. The project institutions are located in
accordance with government policies for decentralized development and the
need to meet regional demand for skilled manpower. The project would
comprise:
(a) Construction, furniture and equipment for:
Length                        Estimated
of      Student Places        Annual
Course    Total        New       Output

(i) Seven new voca-
tional training
centers                3-24    2,046       2,046       2,640
(ii)  A new apprentice
training center          24       708        708       1,650
(iii)  Extensions to 13
existing voca-
tional centers
and 2 apprentice
centers                3-24         -        828       1,130



- 11 -
(b)  Furniture and equipment only for re-equipping existing work-
shops in four vocational and one apprentice center.
(c) Technical assistance to assist in long-term planning of the
vocational training system, and training related to project
management (13 man-years of experts and 3 man-years of
fellowships).
Vocational Training Centers
2.03     The vocational training program is direct post-school and pre-
employment full-time training in specific trades which leads to certifica-
tion/qualification for entry into industry. The seven centers would be
located at Ben Arous in the rapidly expanding industrial area of south
Tunis; Soliman, on the eastern edge of the industrial region centered on
Tunis; Sfax, the country's second largest city; Gafsa, an important inland
transportation and mining center; and the growing industrial cities of
Sousse and Gabes in the southern coastal region. The seventh center which
will provide secretarial courses will be located at Carthage in the northern
suburbs of Tunis and is well-situated to serve the whole of the greater
Tunis area. The other centers would offer courses in the building trades,
particularly masonry, metal trades, auto maintenance and repair, and elec-
tricity; courses for building supervisors would also be offered at Gabes.
Courses would be of 3-24 months duration with a minimum entry age of 18
years. Entry standards would vary according to course with a minimum level
of six years of schooling for less complex courses such as welding and eight
years for the more demanding courses in the electrical and mechanical
trades. The provision of courses would open training opportunities for
poorer, unskilled persons who did not pursue their education beyond primary
school. All courses in the project institutions are open to females though
there is a tendency for women to enroll in traditionally female-oriented
courses such as secretarial and hairdressing. The institutions are expected
to train, upgrade and certify about 2,640 skilled workers per year including
680 secretarial workers. Boarding facilities, readily adaptable to the
needs of female trainees, for about 1,225 trainees would be provided to
serve the needs of students from poorer homes and to allow trainees to be
drawn from beyond the cities in which the centers are to be established.
2.04     All the courses to be taught in the new institutions are already
being offered in existing centers and these have an acceptable balance
between practical and theoretical studies and adequately reflect the needs
of industry. Total teacher requirements for the institutions would be about
90 at full capacity and these would be recruited from among experienced
craftsmen and technicians in industry in Tunisia and from among Tunisians
working abroad. Instructor-recruits would undertake a six-month course at
the Rades instructor training center. Trainees in the project's institu-
tions would receive the normal financial assistance available to vocational
trainees under the Office which is adequate to meet individual needs. To
ensure close links with industry and the continued relevance of training to



- 12 -
local labor market needs, the government has agreed that advisory councils
will be created for the new centers within six months of their opening and
progressively established to serve other centers at the local and regional
levels where feasible.
Apprentice Training Center
2.05     This center would be established in the expanding southern indus-
trial suburbs of Tunis to provide part-time release training for untrained/
uncertified individuals already employed as apprentices in specific trades.
Courses would be of two-years duration leading to certification as a skilled
worker, with each apprentice spending one day per week in the center.
Courses would be offered in the building, metalwork, electrical and
mechanical trades as well as in hairdressing; the latter is expected to
enroll mainly women. Age of entry would be around 14-15 years for those
who have completed primary schooling, and it is expected that apprentice
courses will draw heavily from the outputs of the grade 8 extension to
primary school, which is being expanded to provide pre-vocational training
for those not proceeding to secondary schools. Total outputs from the
center are estimated at about 1,650 p.a. About 100 boarding places would be
provided to allow apprentices from outlying areas to stay overnight and also
to provide facilities for special short courses and seminars. Kitchen and
dining facilities would also be financed to provide a mid-day meal for
apprentices. Courses are well-balanced, providing four hours each of theory
and practice per day, the latter being closely linked with work conditions.
Staff requirements are estimated at around 35 to be recruited and trained in
the same way as for the vocational centers. An advisory council for the
center, with industry representation, would be established within six months
of opening date.
Extensions to Existing Centers
2.06     Extensions to existing centers, while directed primarily at con-
structing and equipping workshops to meet local training needs, also aim to
improve the social and administrative facilities of the centers to upgrade
them into fully functional and efficient institutions. Consequently, provi-
sion has also been made in various centers for boarding facilities, kitchens
and dining rooms, administration space, central storage facilities and some
additional classroom space. In total the project provides for extensions to
15 (including two apprentice) centers providing a mix of facilities related
to the needs of the individual centers. The project would provide for the
construction and equipping of 30 new sections in the construction, metalwork
and automotive trades, including a course for building supervisors. This
represents a major contribution to the expansion of the Ofice's vocational
training system which calls for the creation of 57 new sections during the
current Plan (para. 1.14). Two new apprentice courses would be established
in auto mechanics and electrical installation. The new courses are to be
provided in eight centers which are widely distributed to reflect both
regional employment needs and the policy of improving the distribution of
training opportunities. Courses are identical with those currently being



- 13 -
offered and are satisfactory in terms of practical and theoretical content
and relevance to employment needs. Total outputs from the new courses are
estimated at 1,130 p.a. Boarding facilities for about 575 trainees in five
of the centers would be provided. Total staffing requirements are estimated
at about 30, to be recruited and trained as above (para. 2.04).
Re-Equipping of Existing Centers
2.07     Although vocational courses and the apprentice program are satis-
factory in terms of content and relevance, teaching effectiveness is often
greatly reduced because workshops are poorly equipped. The unsatisfactory
state of many workshops has been observed in the field, indicating out-of-
date equipment or simply a lack of equipment to teach adequately many
courses. In response to this problem, the Office plans to renew the equip-
ment stock each year and the project would support this policy by providing
equipment to existing training sections which, after inventory, were found
to lack or require urgent replacement of key items of equipment. The pro-
vision of additional equipment would therefore contribute to improving the
quality of instruction.
Technical Assistance
2.08     The project would finance about 13 man-years of expert services and
3 man-years of fellowships. The technical assistance program would assist
the Office in strengthening its role in the planning, coordination, manage-
ment and operation of vocational training and in improving the efficiency of
its training programs. To these ends, the project would provide 36 man-
months for training of key personnel of the Office in such fields as
planning, management and new approaches to vocational training. The
specific objectives, terms of reference, and timetable of technical assis-
tance were reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
Instructor Requirements
2.09     The proposed new project institutions together with extensions to
existing centers would require about 155 new instructors. Recruitment would
be sought from among experienced craftsmen and technicians in Tunisia and
Tunisians returning from work abroad. It is recognized however that
recruitment of instructors will depend largely upon the Office maintaining
competitiveness with industry and to this end improved salaries and working
conditions are being sought. The government has agreed to offer terms and
conditions of employment competitive with similar levels in industry and
will keep the Bank informed of specific measures implemented in this
regard. Instructor recruits would receive a six-month course at the Rades
instructor training center where sufficient capacity exists for this pur-
pose; a stipend would be paid during training. The Office is giving
priority to the recruitment and training of instructors and the schedule for
their recruitment was reviewed and agreed at negotiations.



- 14 -
Employment of Graduates
2.10     The Office places great emphasis on finding employment for the
graduates of its vocational centers and currently over 80% are placed in the
first year after completion of training. The director of each center is
responsible for maintaining close links with local employers, evaluating
local job opportunities and placing graduates. This role would be rein-
forced in the new project institutions by the operation of the proposed
advisory councils (paras. 2.04 and 2.05). The broader perspective of
regional employment needs would be provided by regional employment commis-
sions which comprise representatives of government, employers and the
Office. The joint efforts of the advisory councils and the commissions,
which will continue to be reinforced during the current and new Plan
periods, would assist in ensuring that the outputs of the project's voca-
tional centers would be adequately trained in relation to industry's needs
and would secure employment in jobs for which they are trained. To monitor
the situation, the government has agreed to establish an appropriate evalua-
tion system before the graduation of the first trainees from the new center
with a view to identifying and evaluating in consultation with the Bank the
employment of graduates and the adequacy of their training. The results of
the evaluation exercise would be forwarded to the Bank for five years
folluwIrng the first outputs from the institutions.

Total Project Cost    8.4    10.4    18.8   21.0    26.0    47.0
3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates:  Estimated costs of civil works are based
on unit prices which are derived from analysis of current contracts for
comparable works and from construction industry cost data. Furniture and
equipment costs are based on current CIF unit prices and adjusted upward to
include local transportation and installation. Estimated costs do not
include import duties and taxes. In line with recent experience, the esti-
mate of technical assistance costs is based upon: (a) average costs per
man-month of about US$7,700 for experts (consisting of fees and per diem
allowances) and about US$2,200 for fellowships, of which 80% would be
foreign costs; and (b) average travel costs to and from home office or
study base abroad of about US$750 per trip. Baseline cost estimates have
been adjusted to reflect the anticipated prices at negotiations (December
1980).
3.04     Contingency Allowances:  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical additions equal to 10% of the estimated
cost of civil works, furniture, equipment and professional fees and 5% for
technical assistance. The project cost also includes contingencies for
price escalation calculated for the period beginning December 1980 in
accordance with an agreed schedule of implementation (Annex 1, Chart 2
a-d). In view of differences in prevailing rates of price increase



- 17 -
between local costs and international prices the contingencies for price
escalation were computed separately for local and foreign costs. Price
escalation contingencies for each category of expenditure of the project
are listed in Annex 1, Table 3.2. Prices are expected to increase during
the project implementation period by a weighted total of about 22% for
civil works, 27% for furniture, 33% for equipment, 17% for professional
fees and 19% for technical assistance. Accordingly, total price increases
are estimated at about 26% of baseline cost plus physical contingencies and
total contingencies at 39% of baseline cost.
3.05     Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange com-
ponent is US$26.0 million, equivalent to 55.3% of total project cost. The
calculation of the foreign exchange component is based on the expectation
that: (a) all civil works contracts and professional services will be
awarded to local firms; (b) all equipment will be of foreign origin and
about 90% will be directly imported; (c) about 80% of the furniture will be
procured by contracts with local suppliers; and (d) technical assistance
will be principally from foreign sources. The resulting foreign exchange
content of each category of expenditure is as follows: (i) Civil Works
26%; (ii) Furniture 69%; (iii) Equipment 90%; (iv) Professional Fees 0%;
and (v) Technical Assistance 85%.
3.06     Project Financing.  The proposed loan of US$26.0 million would
finance 100% of the total estimated foreign exchange cost of the project.
The balance of total project costs would be financed by the government.
The proposed financial plan is summarized below:

Administration
3.09     The project would be implemented by officials of the Office who
have appropriate technical, administrative and financial expertise. Imple-
mentation would be under the direction of a project director (a technical
educator), who is already closely involved in project development. The
Office is endowed with managerial, pedagogical and technical skills ade-
quate to the task of implementation. The technical division in the Office
comprising an architect and supporting technicians would be responsible to
the project director for the physical implementation of the project. This
division currently handles efficiently contracts, bids and physical super-
vision of the Office's ongoing projects; it is to be reinforced by the pro-
vision of a project coordinator, a civil engineer, a procurement specialist
and two man-years of short-term consultants financed under technical assis-
tance. To enable project management staff to keep abreast of new manage-
ment and pedagogical practice and new technology, provision is also made in
the technical assistance category for financing the full cost of travel and
training of fellowships (Annex 1, Chart 2-d).
Architects and Preliminary Designs
3.10     The government has selected consultant architects/engineers,
acceptable to the Bank, for the design of the project institutions. Pre-
liminary designs for each project institution were reviewed prior to
negotiations. The final architectural designs for the first phase of
construction (2 new centers and 5 extensions) will be ready by Board
Presentation.
Sites
3.11     Suitable sites for all of the new project institutions have been
acquired and existing institutions have sufficient land to allow for their
expansion.
Furniture and Equipment Lists
3.12     Preparation of preliminary furniture and equipment lists has been
completed and these have been reviewed and amended in collaboration with
the Office.
Procurement
3.13     In view of the dispersed nature of the civil works and the rela-
tively small cost of individual items (averaging US$2.0 million per new
center and US$0.46 million per extension, including contingencies) all
civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding under normal government procedures which are satisfactory to the
Bank and do not exclude foreign bidders. The local construction industry
is well developed, competitive and capable of executing the needed civil
works and it is expected that all contracts would be awarded to local
firms. Equipment and furniture items (amounting to US$20.5 million includ-
ing contingencies) would be grouped, to the extent possible, in large pack-
ages to permit bulk procurement. Contracts for furniture and equipment in



- 20 -
excess of US$100,000 would be awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding (ICB). Small items or groups of items estimated to cost
less than the above figure or items of a specialized nature for which ICB
would not be practical, would be procured under normal government procure-
ment procedures acceptable to the Bank and would include to the extent
possible, quotations from at least three manufacturers or suppliers; these
items would not exceed an aggregate total of US$1.8 million or about 9% of
estimated costs including contingencies. In ICB comparisons, local manu-
facturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of prefer-
ence equal to the existing rate of customs duties applicable to competing
imports or 15% of the CIF price, whichever is lower. Draft procurement
documents for furniture, equipment and civil works would be forwarded to
the Bank for review and approval. Bank approval of tender evaluation docu-
ments would be required prior to award of all contracts under ICB. Bank
reimbursement for all other contracts would be contingent upon Bank
approval of tender evaluation documents subsequent to contract awards.
Disbursements
3.14     Disbursements (Annex 1, Table 3.3) would be on the basis ot:
(i)  Civil Works:  26% of total expenditure;
(ii)  Furniture and equipment:  100% of foreign expenditures and of
local expenditures ex-factory; 85% of local expenditures for
locally procured imported items; and
(iii)  Technical Assistance:  100% of foreign expenditures for
fellowships for travel and training; and 80% of expenditures
for experts and consultants.
3.15     These percentages, which correspond to the estimated foreign
exchange content of each category above, would be adjusted if required to
assure continued financing from the available loan funds for the period of
implementation.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The main benefits expected to accrue from implementation of the
proposed project are as follows:
(i) an increase in the supply of scarce skilled man-
power from the vocational and apprentice training
system by about 5,400 p.a.;



- 21 -
(ii)  a qualitative improvement in vocational training
through re-equipping poorly equipped workshops in
four vocational centers;
(iii)  an improvement in the regional distribution of
training opportunities for adults and primary
school leavers; and
(iv)   development of the Office's capacity for the
planning, coordination and management of training
programs.
Risks
4.02     Although the project represents the first major cooperation
between the Bank and the Office, the latter has a core staff of experienced
administrators and technicians to be complemented by specialists under the
technical assistance program. The establishment of advisory councils with
industry representation should ensure continuing relevance of training and
satisfactory placement of trainees.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01     During negotiations agreement was reached on the following points:
(i) advisory councils with industry representation would be
established for the new project institutions within six
months of opening dates and progressively extended to other
training centers of the Office where feasible (paras. 2.04
and 2.05);
(ii) instructors would be offered terms and conditions of employ-
ment competitive with similar levels in industry; the Bank
would be informed of specific measures in this regard (para.
2.09);
(iii)  in order to evaluate the employment of graduates of the proj-
ect institutions and the adequacy of the training, the
government would establish an evaluation system before the
graduation of the first trainees from the new centers;
evaluation data would be submitted to the Bank for five years
following the first outputs from the institutions (para.
2.10);



- 22 -
(iv) the specific objectives, terms of reference, and modalities
of technical assistance together with the details of fellow-
ship programs (para. 2.08); and
(v) the implementation schedule for all project components (para.
3.08).
5.02     The project is suitable as the basis for a loan of US$26.0 million
to the Republic of Tunisia for a term of 17 years with a grace period of 4
years.
