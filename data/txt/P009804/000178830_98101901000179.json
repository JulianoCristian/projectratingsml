    of Bombay. This first phase will bring the production\n            capacity of the field to 5 million cubic meters of gas per\n            day. The development involves the supply and installation of\n            an offshore process platform complex, the laying of subsea\n            pipelines to connect this platform complex to the main\n            Bombay High gas and crude oil pipelines already in service\n            and the laying of a new 234 km gas pipeline from the South\n            Bassein site to the shore facilities located at Hazira in\n            the State of Gujarat. Associated shore facilities at Hazira\n            and telecommunications equipment are included in the project."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
