SOUTH BASSEIN OFFSHORE GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2241-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the South Bassein
Offshore Gas Development Project in India for which Loan 2241-IN in the amount
of US$222.3 million to India, and onlent to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission
(ONGC), was approved on February 24, 1983. The loan closing date of
December 31, 1985 was extended three times to December 31, 1988. The final
disbursement of Rs 11,884,000 (US$792,000) was made on July 13, 1989 when the
Loan Account was closed and the remaining balance of US$3,635,403.87 was
cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Transport and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department IV, of the Asia Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation, Summary, Parts I and III). ONGC, the Beneficiary, prepared
Part II which is included in the PCR without editing or other alterations.
Preparation of the PCR started in January 1990, and is based inter
alia on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements,
supervision reports and correspondence between the Bank, ONGC and the
Borrower.

INDIA
SOUTH BASSEIN OFFSHORE GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2241-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives
The principal objective of the project was to promote the sound and
economic utilization of natural gas. This was to be achieved by establishing
the basic policy framework and the essential infrastructure for supplying
natural gas to India's developing mL:-!et. In addition, the project supported
ONGC's strategy of developing known petroleum reserves as quickly as possible
(Part I, para. 3.1).
Implementation Experience
The project was successfully implemented, but the discovery of
hydrogen sulfide in the South Bassein gas and procurement deficiencies
extended implementation by about four years. ONGC's otherwise creditable -
implementation performance was spoiled by the excessively long delays,
sometimes compounded by a second round of bidding, in the processing of
procurement contracts. ONGC urgently needs to streamline its procurement
practices. Expeditious review and approval by Government agencies and at
times the Bank, would also help improve ONGC's procurement performance
(Part I, paras. 5.1, 5.2 and 5.4).
Bidding for the offshore pipeline contract resulted in
misprocurement and the cancellation of US$83 million from the Bank loan. This
situation arose from ONGC's practice of excluding taxes and duties from
offshore construction contracts. This presented no problem until India
extended its territorial waters to include the offshore petroleum operations
and an Indian firm objected to the pipeline bid evaluation because ONGC could
not assume its tax liabilities. The Bank proposed a quick rebid requiring all
bidders to add taxes and duties to their bid price. ONGC decided to avoid
this delay and awarded a contract funded from its own resources (Part I,
para. 5.3).
Results
The project was successfully completed with a 14Z cost underrun; the
objective of providing the necessary wells and facilities to deliver 5 million
cubic meters per day (MMCMD), later amended to 10 MMCMD, was fully achieved,
though four years later than originally planned. Gas deliveries to Hazira
during the four years, when production and desulfurization facilities were nct
completed, were supplied from Bombay High which continues to deliver 30Z of
the present (June 1990) 10 MMCMD Hazira requirement. The project is
economically and financial sound as illustrated by the following comparison of
the reevaluated economic and financial rates of return (ERR and FRR
respectively) with the values estimated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
(Part I, paras. 6.1-6.3).

Project Sustainability.
Based on conservative estimates of South Bassein gas reserves the
project benefits anticipated at project preparation should be sustainable for
20 years. There is a risk that actual reservoir performance will fall short
of current forecasts and that the expected benefits will not be fully
realized. The risk of a significant shortfall, however, is somewhat remote
given the thoroughness with which the reservoir's extent and characteristics
have been studied. Moreover, it is possible that reservoir behavior will
exceed expectations. Accidents can interrupt gas deliveries, but they should
be of short duration except for catastrophic offshore pipeline and production
facility accldents. It should be pointed out in this regard that such risks -
are inherent in offshore petroleum operations and that ONGC has had to date an
excellent safety record in operating its offshore facilities (Part I,
para. 7.1).
Findings and Lessons Learned
The high rate of gas production in association with crude oil from
the Bombay High field and the satellite fields in combination with marketing
and transmission restrictions has made it necessary to flare a large quantity
of gas, which presently is of the order of 14-18 MMCMD. This unforeseen
development made it possible to supply Hazira requirements initially meant to
come from South Bassein with Bombay High gas which otherwise would be flared.
In fact, with the required transmission capacity the entire present 10 MMCMD
Hazira requirement could have been supplied from Bombay High. With hindsight,
it can be seen that much of the Hazira offshore investment could have been
deferred and more economically directed at increasing Bombay High gas trans-
mission capacity. Also, it can be seen that there is an urgent need for
developing gas markets to eliminate, or at least minimize, the wasteful
flaring and for more fully utilizing the existing South Bassein production and
infrastructure investments (Part I, para. 6.2).
ONGC's procurement problems were the single main source of implemen-
tation delays. Considering the high economic cost of such delays, it is ur-
gent for ONGC to review its procurement practices with the aim of identifying
and correcting the causes. The Bank can assist, on projects it helps to fina-
nce, by (a) sponsoring appropriate procurement seminars in India, (b)
requiring ONGC to minimize the turnover of procurement officers assigned to
the projects, and (c) closely monitoring those procurement stages likely to
give rise to problems (Part I, para. 9.1).

RVP Unit:            Asia

2.   B&ckground
2.1       Following the oil crisis of 1973, accelerated exploration activity
led to India's two largest and most important petroleum discoveries, both in
the offshore Bombay area: the Bombay High oil field in 1974 and the South
Bassein gas field in 1976. These discoveries were made by the Oil and Natural
Gas Commission (ONGC) which was then, and still continues to be, the primary
offshore petroleum exploration and production organization in India. The
development of Bombay High was supported by two Bank loans (Ln 1473-IN in 1977
and Ln 1925-IN in 1980) which helped finance oil production goods and services
and included important provisions for advancing ONGC's technical and
institutional capabilities.
2.2       The South Bassein field is located in the Arabian Sea in about 53
meters of water 65 km west of Bombay. By project appraisal an additional 12
wells had been drilled to delineate the large reservoir structure. It was
cor.servatively estimated to hold gas reserves sufficient to support the
production of 20 million cubic meters per day (MMCMD) of gas (equivalent in
heat content to 6.5 million metric tons of oil per year or 20Z of India's
domestic oil production) for at least 20 years. The program for developing
production from the field consisted of two phases: Phase I designed for an
initial capacity of 5 MMCMD implemented by the project and a subsequent Phase
II designed to raise the production capacity to 20 MMCMD.
2.3       The development of South Bassein, as its first major gas
development, presented ONGC with a new challenge.  Aside from the new produc-
tion expertise required, the project unlike an oil project not only required
optimization in terms of reservoir parameters, but also with respect to future
market forecasts which bore directly on sizing and phasing processing,
pipeline and marketing facilities. The Bank, therefore, took an active part
in discussions with the Government and ONGC concerning the scope of marketing
studies, their findings and conclusions. The 5 MMCMD initial phase of
production development was chiefly aimed at the manufacture of nitrogen-based



-2-
fertilizer and the replacement of liquid fuels. Since industries based on
natural gas require sizeable investments, the Bank participated in financing
several industrial projects based on offshore gas.
2.4       ONGC, a state-owned statutory body created by an act of Parliament
in 1959, was the loan beneficiary and implementing agency for the project.
Its Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) group was assigned primery responsibility
for carrying out the project. BOP was competent to implement the project with
the assistance of consultants vhere special gas p:oduction, transportation and
processing expertise was required.
3.   Project Objectives and Description
3.1       The principal objective of the pro4ect was to promote the sound and
economic utilization of natural gas. This was to be achieved by establishing
the basic policy framework and the essential infrastructure for supplying
natural gas to India's developing market. In addition, the project supported
ONGC's strategy of developing known petroleum reserves as quickly as possible.
3.2       The pruject as originally appraised included the following
components for the Phase I development of South Bassein:
(a) Offshore platforms (one of each) - drilling, processing, living
quarters and flare;
(b) South Bassein to Umrat (landfall) pipeline, 36-inch diameter, 217-km
long;
(c) Umrat to Hazira pipeline, 36-inch diameter, 18-km long;
(d) South Bassein to Bombay High gas tie-in, 20-inch diameter, 17-km
long;
(e) Natural gas liquids tie-in to Bombay High crude oil, 12-inch
diameter, 17-km long;
(f) Hazira terminal facilities; and
(g) Engineering and technical services and reservoir consultancy.
4.   Project Design and Organization
4.1       The scope and objectives of the project, which were clearly defined
in project documents, were in full agreement with the energy policies of the
Government and the Bank. A unique feature of the project was its wide range,
encompassing every facet of offshore natural gas production from the drilling
of wells to the delivery of gas at the onshore terminal. Implementation
arrangements were thorough and well organized under ONGC's offshore BOP group.
BOP was well qualified for this task through its wide experience in developing
crude oil and associated natural gas production from the Bombay High field.
In addition ample provisions were included to back up BOP with technical
assistance from expatriate experts. These measures, however, could not have
prevented the im.plementation delays which were subsequently encountered.
Having to cope with adverse conditicns is not unusual with offshore petroleum



- 3 -
projects, but the extent and severity of the project's implementation
difficulties could not have been reasonably foreseeii during project
preparation.
5.   Project Implementation
5.1       The project was successfully implemented, but it was completed four
years later then planned (May 1985 planned versus March 1989 actual). There
were, however no adverse consequences from the delaye. completion because
similar delays were experienced with completion schedules of downstream
customers. The South Bassein to Hazira pipeline was completed in September
1985, one year later thLen the target date, but in time to supply the major
consumer, the Hazira fertilizer plant, with surplus Bombay High gas through
pipeline interconnection installed for this purpose. South Bassein gas was
first introduced into the natural gas pipeline system during September 1988.
Up to that point surplus Bombay High gas was available to meet the demand.
All project components were completed in March 1989 and have been functioning
satisfactorily since then.
5.2       A major cause of the completion delay was due to the discovery,
shortly after loan approval, of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in small amounts in the
South Bassein gas. This development was completely unforeseen because there
had been no previous indications of H2S during drilling in the Bombay High and
South Bassein areas. H2S is a highly toxic and corrosive gas which must be
removed before natural gas can be used in petrochemical processes and as a
domestic fuel -- the former because it "poisons" (deactivates) the catalyst
and the latter because of its extreme toxicity. Consequently, extensive
changes in project scope were required, namely the addition of a desulfuriza-
tion complex comprising gas sweetening (H2S removal), sulfur recover,
electricity co-generation and ancillary facilities at Hazira and the institu-
tion of stricter metallurgical specifications for piping and drilling
material. A second drilling platform and related well drilling equipment were
added to the project scope to boost the gas supply capacity from 5 to 10
MMCMD. These changes were expected to add 18 months to the completion date,
but actually more than two additional years were required to finish the
project.
5.3       A second major problem arose during implementation of the offshore
pipeline. It was the practice at the time to exclude taxes and duties from
offshore petroleum construction bids. Bidding for the pipeline contract
followed closely the extension of India's territorial waters to include the
offshore petroleum areas, and it included for the first time an Indian bidder
in a joint venture proposal with an American firm. The Indian firm complained
that the bidding conditions were unfair because its bid price included taxes
and duties for which ONGC legally could not assume responsibility. The Bank
suggested a quick rebid--which would have taken only two weeks--requiring all
bidders to include taxes and duties in their bid prices. ONGC, however, chose
to award the contract to the Indian-American joint venture on grounds that
rebidding would make it impossible to complete the pipeline on schedule. This
action was contrary to Bank procurement guidelines, and as a consequence US$83
million, the estimated contract price, was cancelled from the loan. Bank
staff shares some of the responsibility for allowing the reimbursement provis-
ion in the bidding documents, but ONGC must also be faulted for acting too



precipitously i.e. refusing to consider a quick rebid, especially since pipe-
line construction was subsequently delayed anyway, even without the rebid.
5.4       Aside from the two problems discussed above, ONGC's implementation
difficulties centered on procurement. ONGC did not have the ability to award
procurement contracts, for services and goods, without excessively long
evaluation and clarification (which tended to evolve into negotiations)
periods. At times procurement matters could not be resolved, and a new round
of bidding was required. OtIGC's procurement performance showed no significant
improvement during the implementation period.  The project illustrates that
ONGC's practices, along with Government reviews, are badly in need of
streamlining. Expeditious project implementation is particularly important
for petroleum projects which involve such high costs and benefits which a
exceedingly time dependent.
5 5       At the closing of the loan account in July 1989, US$3.6 million in
undisbursed funds were cancelled. The cancellation of this amount, although
small could have been averted. It was typical of ONGG's inability to execute
its procurement affairs in a prompt manner.
6.   Project Results
6.1       The project was successfully implemented with a 14Z cost underrun in
US dollar terms largely due to (i) a depressed oil industry construction
market providing keen competition for contracts and (ii) a higher than
estimated local cost conten: in combination with an appreciating US dollar
relative to the Indian rupee. The project objective of providing the wells
and surface facilities to deliver 10 MMCMD (it was 5 MMCHD before the project
was amended) South Bassein gas to Hazira was fully realized.
6.2       The large quantities of gas produced in association with crude oil
from the Bombay High field and satellite fields (causing the flaring of 14-18
MMCMD of gas at present) is an unforeseen development. It has in effect
inadvertently converted the project into an outlet for Bombay High gas which
otherwise would have to be flared. At present (June 1990), approximately 30Z
of the 10 MKCMD gas delivered to Hazira comes from Bombay High, and this
proportion can increase with the installation of additional compression
facilities at Bombay High. Closer coordination of developments at Bombay High
and the execution of the project could have brought about some deferment of
the project's offshore production investments.
6.3       The project is economically and financially sound as indicated by
the following comparison of the reevaluated economic rate of return (ERR) and
financial rate of return (FRR) with the values estimated in the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) for the project and also for the overall program which
includes Phases I and II. The reevaluated economic and financial rates of
return are very close to the values calculated in the SAR as the result of the
following compensating factors:

6.4       So far, no specific project investments have been made in Bombay
High to deliver gas to Hazira. However, with the continued high gas produc-
tion of Bombay High as much as 502 of the 20 MMCMD, which is estimated to be
required by FY 1994, could be delivered from Bombay High. In this case, the
Bombay High compression facilities to make this possible should be included in
the program (Phase I and II) investment. THe ERR and FRR would then be 312
and 172 respectively which are satisfactory results.
6.5       The project did not include activities which would cause significant
long-term harm to the environment. Those environmental interruptions
unavoidably caused by construction activities were of short duration.
Effluent from the offshore platforms and the Hazira terminal is adequately
treated before disposal. The only potential atmospheric pollutant, sulfur
dioxide from the desulfurization process, is converted to elemental sulfur and
not allowed to enter the atmosphere.
7.   Project Sustainabilitv
7.1       Based on conservative estimates of South Bassein gas reserves the
project benefits anticipated at project preparation should be sustainable for
20 years. There is a risk that actual reservoir performance will fall short
of current forecasts and that the expected benefits will not be fully
realized. The risk of a significant shortfall, however, is somewhat remote
given the thoroughness with which the reservoir's extent and characteristics
have been studied. Moreover, it is possible that reservoir behavior will
exceed expectations. Accidents can interrupt gas deliveries, but they should
be of short duration except for catastrophic offshore pipeline and production
facility accidents. It should be pointed out in this regard that such risks
are inherent in offshore petroleum operations and that ONGC has an excellent
safety record in operating its offshore facilities.
8.   Bank Performance
8.1       Except for the procurement incident discussed below, the Bank's
performance throughout the project cycle was helpful and well directed. The
project enabled the Bank to continue supporting the vitally important



6-
development of India's offshore petroleum resources. In addition to providing
financial support, the Bank was particularly concerned with assisting ONGC's
institutional and technical development. Bank sponsored project components
directed to this end undoubtedly contributed to BOP's development into the
competent offshore bran.ch of ONGC's petroleum operations it is today.
8.2       As practiced on all previous offshore projects, the offshore
pipeline bid documents provided that bid prices would be exclusive of taxes
and duties. The rationale was that more favorable bids would be received by
removing a major financial uncertainty. Furthermore, since operations were
outside India's territorial waters, there would in fact be no taxes or duties.
However, at the time the pipeline bids were opened two major changes had
occurred: India had extended its territorial waters so that they encompassed
the offshore operations, and an Indian firm had entered the bidding. The
latter created a problem because ONGC legally could not take on the respon-
sibility for an Indian firm's taxes. To resolve this problem, the Bank
proposed a quick rebid which would require adding taxes and duties to the bid
price. However, ONGC decided to proceed on its own with the contract award,
which then made it necessary for the Bank to cancel US$83 million (the
estimated contract amount) from the Loan. Although there was some merit for
excluding taxes and duties, Bank staff should not have approved bid documents
containing this provision which were at variance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. The subsequent one year delay in pipeline completion fortunately
produced no adverse consequences.
9.   ONGC's Performance
9.1       Over the years, ONGC has developed into a full fledged integrated
oil company capable of implementing and operating a wide range of oil and gas
enterprises. Its big weakness, which detracts from an otherwise creditable
performance, was and still is, extensive procurement delays some of which can
be of extraordinary duration. About half of the 4 years project completion
delay was attributable to procurement problems. Discounting procurement
deficiencies, ONGC's performance in implementing the project was entirely
satisfactory. It mobilized the necessary technical and managerial resources
from within its own organization, and it deployed expatriate consultants to
assist in areas where it lacked the requisite skills.  Commendably, ONGC had
no difficulty in dealing with the extensive project alterations made necessary
by the discovery of hydrogen sulfide in the South Bassein gas.
10. Project Relationship
10.1      Bank staff relations with ONGC and government officials were
cooperative and cordial throughout the project cycle. This relationship has
been sustained throughout the Bank's lending operations in the petroleum
sector. Except for some differences in interpreting contract terms, which
will arise from time to time, during contract implementation and
administration, ONGC appeared to have maintained satinfactory relations with
contractors and consultants.
11. Consulting Services
11.1      ONGC employed a reputable Indian consulting firm with wide
experience in all aspects of the petroleum industry to assist it in carrying



-7-
out the project. Expatriate consultents were appointed to deal vith
situations requiring specialized expertise. ONGC states that it had a good
relationship with all consultants and that all consultants performed their
services in a professional and satisfactory manner.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1      The staff appraisal report was comprehensive and well prepared.  It
gave an excellent account of all aspects of the program to develop offshore
natural gas resources and the project's role in the program. Moreover, it
precisely defined the project, its objectives and execution, all of which were
accurately reflected in the legal agreements. The legal agreements were clear
and specific and at the same time provided flexibility to readily redefine and
amend the project when hydrogen sulfide was discovered.
12.2      Both the supervision reports and the Borrower's quarterly progress
reports were informative and useful. However, for both there is room for
improvement in format and content to make them more suited for the purpose of
preparing PCRs. In general. it can be observed that too much emphasis and
effort goes into details which are necessary but not entirely relevant to an
analytic approach to project evaluation. It should be a standard requirement
that supervision and quarterly reports include the statistical data required
for Part III of the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(a)       Confirmation of the adequacy and accuracy of the factual information
contained in Part II of the PCR:
The figures indicated by ONGC in the various annexures of Part III
are based on actual as per the records maintained. From the informations made
available to World Bank in the annexure, it is evident that the actual are
very close to the revised estimates.
(b)       Comments on the Analysis Contained in Part I of PCR
Not applicable at this stage.
(c)       Evaluation of the Bank's Performance during the evaluation and
implementation of the project, with special emphasis on lessons learned that
may be relevant for the future:
The World Bank's procedure did not give any problem while
implementing the project. In fact all approvals of the project were obtained
in time. The documents for claiming reimbursement were submitted through
Ministry of Finance (Controller of Aid and Audit] for the projects financed by
World Bank namely Transportation [installation of BPA Process Complex,
fabrication and installation of two well platforms, Desulphurization Complex,
Gas Sweetening Plant, etc. at Hazira, Technical and consultancy services. The
co-ordination between World Bank Mission and ONGC was satisfactory and there
was no problem while implementing the execution of projects. With the
financial help of World Bank in time the South Bassein Gas Field was developed
and the gas was brought to shore for proper utilization.
(d)       Evaluation of the Borrower's own performance during the evaluation
and implementation of the project with special emphasis on lessons learned
that may be relevant for the future:
The BPA Process Complex. Due to several interface issues between
the contractors certain problems were faced during the different stages of
project execution but they were smoothly resolved. During the execution of
the process complex it was felt that award of the work on a turn key basis
would have facilitated the completion of the work.
In other projects no major problems, namely physical, financial or
managerial were envisaged while executing the work and they were completed
within the targeted dates.



- 1n -
As per the original plan of financJng. the pipelaying contract for
South Bassein Hazira Trunk Pipeline was to be financed. However, the
evaluation of bids by ONGC with particular reference to the treatment of
Income Tax was not agreeable to by World Bank which ultimately led to
surrender of 170 million US dollars of the loan amount of US$222.3 million.
Subsequently however, World Bank agreed to amend the loan agreement by
extending financial assistance to part of gas sweetening Phase I Project and
Bare pipes procurement of South Bassein Gas Development Project. The total
financing was however restricted to US$139.9 m.
In this regard it may be pertinent to point out the evaluation of
the tender for pipelaying as done by ONGC was in full conformity with the
procedures prevailing in the country with particular reference to the taxation
structure. The work was awarded with the consent of the GOI. This being so,
World Bank should have been a little flexible and accommodated the revised
evaluation. ONGC on its part however appreciates the significance of framing
a comprehensive and firm Bid Evaluation Criteria as indicated bv World Bank.
[e]       Assessment of the effectiveness of the relationship between the Bank
and the Borrower during the evaluation and implementation of the proiect:
Although the completion date of the loan agreement was December 31,
1988, World Bank at the behest of ONGC extended it to June 30, 1989. The need
for extension arose due to revision in the completion dates for process
complex which in turn was necessitated due to change in condition of gas from
sweet to sour. This extension helped a lot for the maximum utilization of
fund allocated by World Bank for Development of South Bassein Phase I. The
documents claiming reimbursement were submitted through Ministry of Finance
(Controller of Aid and Audit) upto June 30, 1989. The coordination between
the three agencies i.e. World Bank, Ministry of FInance and ONGC was very
cordial throughout the implementation of the projects.

Comment
5.1       The prc,ect was completed with a 142 cost underrun comparing actual
costs against the amended project following the discovery of H2S in the South
Bassein gas. The principal causes of the underrun are:
(a) a depressed oil industry construction market providing keen
competition for cont.acts; and
(b) the higher than estimated local cost content - 34? vs 14? estimated;
in combination with the change in the exchange rate of the US dollar
- from Rs 9.0 at appraisal to an average Rs 11.5.
6. Project Results
A. Direct Benefits
6.1       The main benefits which will be derived from the natural gas made
available by the project are:
(a) the foreign exchange savings which are realized through the
substitution of the gas for imported liquid hydrocarbon fuels;
(b) the reduction in atmospheric pollution where gas displaces pollution
producing fuels such as fuel oil, coal and lignite; and
(c) the potential benefits from the possession of a versatile indigenous
chemical feed stock.
B. Economic and Financial Impact
6.2       The economic rate of return (ERR) and the financial rate of return
(FRR) were reevaluated using the same methodology as in the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) for the initial evaluation. Annex 1 gives the gas supply
quantities from FY 1983 to FY 2000. Annexes 2, 3, 4 and 5 present the ERR and
FRR calculations and the basic assumptions used in the calculations. The SAR
and reevaluated rates of return compare as follows:
SAR       Reevaluated
Phase I (the Proiect)
ERR                                 38?             32Z
FRR                                 19?             162
Phase I and II (the Program)
ERR                                 49?             35?

6.3       There is a possibility that with the combined high gas production at
Bombay High as much as 50? of the 20 MMCMD shipped to Hazira under the full
program will consist of Bombay High gas. In this case, the Bombay High

compression facilities which will have to be installed to make this possible
should be charged to the program investment. The ERR would then be 31? and
the FRR 17? in lieu of the respective 35 and 20Z calculated without taking
this possibility into account. In either case, the economic and financial
returns from the program would remain satisfactory.
C. Financial Performance
6.4              ONGC's financial performance for the period FY 1983 to FY 1989 was
entirely satisfactory as shown by the performance indicators in the following

Notes:    Gas price is taken  at its opportunity cost, calculated On the basis of its use as
fuel for power generation at 897/ 1000 cm. Other economic uses of gas in fact would
yield higher netback values.
NGL price after LPG is extracted is taken *t naphtha export price.
LPG price is taken based on Singapore prices plus freight and insurance.
Depletion premiui is calculated on the basis of Bassein Sas being depleted in 2015
and LNG (priced at S100/1000cm in that year) being substitute fuel.
