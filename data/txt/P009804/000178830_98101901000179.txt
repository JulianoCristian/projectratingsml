I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01     Commercial primary energy (coal, oil, gas, hydro and nuclear power)
accounts for about 46% of total primary energy supplyl/ in India, with 1'e
balance (54%) coming from noncommercial energy (mainly firewood, agricultural
and animal wastes). Coal, hydro and nuclear power have important roles in
meeting commercial primary energy requirements and in 1981/82 accounted for
approximately 67% of total supply; the share of petroleum is relativel'y
moderate in comparison with other developing countries and accounts for about
33% of total commercial primary energy supply. The supply of commercial
energy has been growing faster (about 5.3% per year), than that of
noncommercial energy (between 1.7% and 2.5% per year), thus resulting in a
steady decline in the share of noncommercial energy in total energy supply.
1.02     India has consistently followed energy policies that limit the use of
petroleum to sectors where economic substitution by other energy resources,
particularly coal, is not possible. Despite the recent development of
offshore petroleum resources, the country remains dependent on imported oil to
meet a significant part of its primary energy requirements, particularly the
growing demand in transport, fertilizers and petrochemicals, as well as in the
modern agriculture sector where substitution by electricity continues to be
limited by insufficient power generation and distribution. The impact of the
increase in world oil prices after 1973 on India's balance of payments is
evident from the following: while the volume of petroleum imports grew by
30%, from 16 to 21 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) between 1972/73 and
1981/82, the cost of imports over the same period grew about 23 times from
$269 million to US$6 billion, equivalent to about 70% of India's estimated
merchandise export earnings. Well identified domestic energy resources such
as coal and hydroelectricity are large enough to supply most of India's future
commercial energy requirements for industry and power generation. However,
proven oil and gas reserves are not sufficient to meet the demand for oil in
sectors where further substitution by other fuels is limited.
1.03     In 1981/82, out of a total oil supply of 36.8 million toe, 16.2
million (or 44%) came from local production while the remainder (20.6 million
toe) had to be imported. Current projections based on production from known
petroleum reservoirs indicate a potential petroleum deficit of up to 34
million toe by the end of the 1980s. The high cost of petroleum imports will
remain a serious constraint to economic development unless new reserves are
discovered in the near future to compensate for the depletion of existing
reserves as well as to meet anticipated growth in demand. India's potential
oil and gas resources are significant, but many of the prospective areas are
largely unexplored. Therefore, the exploration for new and the development of
existing petroleum reserves are among India's most pressing priorities.
1/ Supply is defined as production plus imports less exports. When changes
in stock levels are not taken into account, then supply equals apparent
consumption.



-2-
1.04     It is against this background that India is making a concerted effort
to accelerate hydrocarbon exploration and development by the national oil
companies (i.e. ONGC and OIL) and also by foreign oil companies which were
invited in late 1980 and again in August 1982 to submit bids for exploration
and production sharing on many blocks offshore and onshore. The success of
these efforts, together with an active public sector program in developing
natural gas resources, currently untapped, over the next three to four years,
will be a key factor in determining whether indigenous hydrocarbon supplies
can be 'ncreased sufficiently above current forecasts to meet a major portion
of the anticipated growth in demand during the present decade.
Energy Supply and Consumption
1.05     In 1975/76 (the last year for which overall figures are available),
primary energy supply in India was 182 million tons of oil equivalent. The
breakdown by primary energy source is shown in Annex 1.1 and is summarized as

a/ Coal, lignite and oil used for power generation are excluded from these
consumption trends; however, all electricity (i.e. primary and
conventional thermal) consumption is included but on a delivered basis to
consumers (i.e. gross generation less internal power plant uses, as well
as transmission and distribution losses). Furthermore, oil consumption
excludes non-fuel uses (i.e. petrochemical feedstocks).
b/ Provisional.

Petroleum; and Department of Coal.
The household sector accounts for a relatively small share of commercial
energy consumption (7% of coal, 19% of petroleum and 10% of electricity).
However, consumption of noncommercial energy in this sector is high,
particularly in the rural areas where electricity and kerosene are mostly used
for lighting. Although the substitution of commercial energy for non-
commercial energy will continue, noncommercial energy will remain a
significant source of supply for rural households. Measures are however
needed to maintain and even increase production from noncommercial sources
(particularly firewood) as well as improve the efficiency of cooking stoves in
order to conserve commercial energy for applications where non-commercial
energy is not possible or practicable.
1.07     Energy needs in agriculture are mainly for land preparation, water
lifting, threshing and transportation. They are met mostly by animal power or
by the use of liquid fuels (mainly diesel oil) and electricity. Commercial



-4-
energy consumption in agriculture accounts for only about 6.3% of commercial
energy use but has been growing rapidly between 1960/61 and 1980/81 (about
7.8% p.a. for oil products and 16.2% p.a. for electricity), reflecting the
efforts made to modernize the sector. This trend towards increased use of
commercial energy in agriculture will continue with the efforts to further
modernize the sector and increase the standard of living of the rural
population.
1.08     The industrial sector is by far the largest user of coal and
electricity. In 1980/81, it accounted for 75% of coal consumption (excluding
power generation), about 63% of electricity consumption and 19% of oil
consumption. In contrast to other developing countries the share of industry
in total oil consumption is still relatively modest but has gradually
increased (it was only 11% in 1970/71). Over the past twenty years the energy
intensity of the industrial sector has increased from 0.12 to 0.17 tons of oil
equivalent per thousand rupees of gross domestic product originating from
industry (at factor costs in 1980/81 rupees) due primarily to the increased
use of electricity. In the future, the growth in the energy intensity of
industry is expected to slow down as a result of better capacity utilization
and use of appropriate technologies. The future industrial demand for energy
is difficult to predict since the sector has been affected by recurrent
shortages of power and raw materials as well as transport bottlenecks, so that
recent trends may not be representative. In addition, part of the industrial
capacity was built when energy was relatively cheap, and less attention was
paid to energy efficiency. It is believed that there is considerable
potential for energy savings in the industrial sector by improving the
efficiency of existing plant and equipment, improving the design of future
plants, and introducing energy efficiency standards, but this will require a
large investment effort.
1.09     The transport sector 1/ is the largest user of petroleum products and
the second largest user of coal. Over the past twenty years the structure of
demand has changed considerably as a result of the rapid growth of road
transport and the substitution of diesel-electric for steam locomotives. In
1980/81 oil products accounted for 66% of the commercial energy consumed in
the sector compared to 47% in 1970/71 while the share of electricity remained
small at about 3% in 1980/81. Current projections in the transport sector
indicate continuing decline in coal consumption as road transport increases in
importance and as railways continue to shift to more efficent diesel electric
locomotives, thereby contributing to a growing demand for petroleum
products. The transport sector is an area where significant energy savings,
especially in petroleum products, could be achieved over time if measures were
taken to increase the capacity of the railways and to electrify main lines,
improve their operating efficiency, encourage the use of railways for long-
distance freight and passenger hauls, improve the efficiency of road vehicles
(mainly trucks), and optimize the location of industrial plants. The
performance of the railways improved substantially during 1981/82 as a result
of several innovations introduced in 1980/81. The Sixth Plan provides for
many investments for the railways that are expected to ease some of the

bottlenecks in India and are reviewed in Economic Situation and Prospects in

equipment problems in the medium term although the Plan allocation for this
sector appears to be inadequate to make up for the under-investment during the
two previous plan periods.
1.10     In 1980/81 the power sector used about 38 million tons of coal (about
33% of coal production). Of the power generated (including self-generation b,v
industry), about 42% came from hydroelectric and nuclear plants, 46% from coal
and 12% from oil. Over the past ten years the share of coal in conventional
thermal generation by utilities has fluctuated between 85% and 90% and this is
expected to continue in the future. The share of hydro and nuclear energy has
varied between 40% and 50% of total power generation. It is expected that by
1987/88 the consumption of oil in the power utilities will be limited to what
is required to ensure the efficient operation of coal-fired plants. Total
electricity consumption has been growing at an average of 6.5% p.a. between
1970/71 and 1980/81, a rate significantly lower than previously. However, as
the power shortages which developed during the 1970s demonstrated, the growth
of demand for electricity has been and will continue to be supply-constrained.

1.11     Coal 1/ is the main domestic source of commercial primary energy in
India with reserves (in seams greater than 1.2 meters thick and at depths less
than 600 meters) estimated at about 85 billion tons, of which about 25 billion
tons are proven reserves. Most of the coal is of low to medium quality (3,500
to 5,500 kcal/kg). The 1981/82 coal production is estimated at 124.7 million
tons, making India the sixth largest coal producer in the world. Between
1975/76 and 1979/80, coal production stagnated at about 100 million tons per
year because of extensive flooding in 1978, serious power shortages, delays in
commissioning new mines, lack of explosives, labor unrest, and transportation
bottlenecks. During both 1980/81 and 1981/82, coal production increased by 10
million tons per year, a remarkable achievement, although, at present, coal
production is still about 10 million tons per year less than demand. Most of
the production and transport problems are being addressed. For example, the
Sixth Plan embodies further measures to overcome the infrastructure-related
constraints, and labor relations have improved in the past year. The Plan
also includes significant investments to bring new mines into operation. In
order to increase productivity, a high proportion of these new investments
will be in open-pit mining. Since in the past most of the delays in bringing
new mines into operation were experienced in underground projects, the shift
to open-pit mining is expected to help in reducing delays in project execution
and commissioning. About two-thirds of the planned increase in production (40
to 45 million tpy) between 1980/81 and 1984/85 is to come from open pit
mines. However, about 47% of this increase is to come from projects still to
be approved. Various demand projections for coal by 1984/85 range between 165
to 185 million tons while production is expected to range between 155 and 165
million tons. Of the expected 1984/85 coal demand, power generation would
account for about 42%, steel would utilize about 23%, the railways 6% and
cement about 4% of the total. In order to achieve the production targets, the
coal industry has to overcome the problems referred to above, and will need to

avoid delays in project preparation and implementation. Improvements in the
ability of local equipment manufacturers to provide new equipment and spare
parts in a timely manner will also be needed.
1.12     India's hydroelectric potential is estimated at about 400,000 GWh of
annual energy generation which might sustain an installed hydro power capacity
of 100,000 MW at a 45% load factor. But almost 70% of this potential is in
remote areas in the north and northeast and difficult to access. About 12,600
MW (13% of potential) is already developed and represents 36% of the total
installed generating capacity of approximately 35,000 MW (including 2,736 MW
of non-utility capacity). An additional 4,700 MW of hydro power capacity is
scheduled for commissioning by 1984/85, and a further 23,000 MW is under study
for development. India also has sufficient reserves of uranium (34,000 tons
equivalent of U308, of which 15,000 tons is considered economically
exploitable at current international prices) and thorium to meet the
foreseeable requirements of its nuclear power program.  The existing nuclear
power plants have a capacity of 860 MW. In addition, four units with a
combined capacity of 940 MW are under construction.
1.13     Demand for power has consistently exceeded supply in the last
decade. The gap has widened in recent years and the shortage in 1980/81 is
estimated to have reached about 13%. The reasons for the gap between demand
and supply are the strong growth in demand, delays in completing planned
thermal generation capacity and low capacity utilization. Capacity
utilization of thermal power plants declined from about 55% in 1976/77 to 45%
in 1980/81 but increased to 47% in 1981/82. The low capacity utilization is
partly due to difficulties in plant commissioning, delayed maintenance of
boilers and turbogenerators, lack of spare parts, shortages of appropriately
trained manpower, problems related to design and fabrication of domestically
produced equipment and continuing difficulties in the supply and quality of
coal. A high-level commission has recently carried out a comprehensive
analysis of the situation and has submitted its findings to the Government.
Several measures are being introduced to improve the efficiency of thermal
plants, including: (a) improved preventive and planned maintenance; (b) better
availability of spare parts; (c) improved training; (d) adequate coal supplies
of acceptable quality; and (e) more effective management. The results of
these measures are already having an impact in the sector. In 1980/81 and
1981/82, power generation increased by 9% and 10% respectively. With the
implementation of the above measures more progress is projected for the medium
term. Power generation capacity is planned to reach 50,900 MW by 1984/85,
(including about 2,750 MW of non-utility capacity). The increase will come
from thermal power plants (70%), hydroelectric units (25%) and nuclear plants
(5%). The country's overall average electrical energy requirements are
expected to be met by 1988/89 onwards, although a peak capacity deficit would
most likely continue until the mid-1990s and regional capacity differences
will continue to impose shortages in some areas.
1.14     India's remaining proven and probable recoverable reserves of
petroleum are currently estimated at 800 million tons of oil equivalent, of
which 470 million tons is oil and the remainder natural gas.  Domestic oil
production has increased from 0.5 million tons in 1961 to 16.2 million tons in
1981/82 and currently meets about 44% of India's domestic oil requirements.
Gas production is currently estimated at about 3.1 million tons of oil
equivalent, of which about 60% is used as fuel or feedstock, and the balance
is flared (mostly in Assam), mainly because there is no market within

reasonable distance. The petroleum sub-sector is discussed in more detail in
Chapter II.
1.15     Renewable energy represented 59% of total primary energy supply in
1975/76 but its share has been declining. Wood, charcoal, dung and vegetable
wastes made up an estimated 92% of the total with the remainder provided by
hydroelectric power. Renewable energy (especially traditional fuels) will
continue to play an important though decreasing role in rural energy supplies
as the agriculture sector is further modernized and the living standards of
the rural population improve with a corresponding increase in the use of
commercial energy.
Energy Prospects
1.16     Several studies of India's future energy demand and supply
alternatives have been carried out. The most comprehensive is the Report of
the Working Group on Energy Policy (WGEP), published in 1979, which
assesses: (i) whether the availability of energy may become a serious
constraint to India's economic development; and (ii) what would be the likely
impact of an active energy conservation program on India's future energy
balances. Although WGEP recognizes the limitations of such an exercise, given
that historical data may not be indicative of future developments, it
concludes that:
(i)  commercial energy availability may become a serious constraint
to economic development, either because domestic resources would
be insufficient to meet the anticipated demand or because the
effort required to develop domestic resources would imply human
and financial inputs which are not likely to be available;
(ii)  a coordinated and all-encompassing energy conservation/demand
management program would have a significant impact beyond the
late 1980s and could possibly reduce commercial energy demand by
as much as 20% (the main reduction being in the demand for power
and in the demand for petroleum and petroleum products across
the entire economy, but especially in the transport sector); and
(iii)  the most critical aspect of India's future energy policy will be
to contain (within economic limits) the demand for oil at as low
a level as possible.
1.17     The policy measures it recommends are:  (i) improvement in the
efficiency of energy utilization; (ii) introduction of fuel-efficient
technologies; (iii) reduction of transportation demand through improved
planning of production and consumption locations; (iv) reduction of the energy
intensity of industries; and (v) inter-fuel substitution from commercial
energy to noncommercial and renewable energy. The Working Group considers
that such measures, supplemented by appropriate pricing policies, would permit
India to reduce commercial energy consumption without affecting economic
growth. It is hoped that the ratio of energy use to GDP would decline by 50%
between the late 1970s and the early 1990s. The energy saving measures
outlined above supported by detailed implementation plans and an appropriate
pricing policy, could substantially reduce waste and improve energy
availability in the future.

II. THE PETROLEUM SUBSECTOR
Introduction
2.01     Despite rapid development of its largest oil field (Bombay High),
India currently imports about 56% of its petroleum requirements. By 1984/85,
the year of expected peak production from Bombay High, imports will still
account for about 33% of domestic supply as production reaches 30 million tons
compared with anticipated consumption of 45 million tons.
2.02     India's gas resources are currently underutilized, particularly
offshore. With a rapidly increasing production of associated gas in the
Bombay High field, and the discoveries of large free gas reserves offshore,
gas could become an important source of energy as it can replace oil products
advantageously, and be used as a fertilizer and petrochemical feedstock;
however a necessary prerequisite is the conversion of existing industries from
fuel oil to natural gas and the establishment of new gas-based industries to
take advantage of this resource, necessarily a long process because of the
large investments tl'at have to be mobilized, and the time required to convert
and construct such plaits.  The Government recognizes the potential of gas to
the economy, and has embarked on a large-scale program to foster the
utilization of offshore gas on a sound economic basis.
Petroleum Consumption, Production and Prices
a. Consumption and Production Trends
2.03     Crude oil consumption grew steadily from about 8.0 million tons in
1960/61, to 22.4 million tons in 1972/73. Following the first oil crisis in
1973, oil consumption was held between 23 and 24 million tons per year from
1973/74 through 1975/76. Consumption again started to gradually increase in
1976/77 reaching an estimated 32.3 million tons by 1981/82. While domestic
production accounted for only 6% of consumption in 1960/61, this proportion
had reached 36% in 1970/71 before falling to between 30% to 33% through
1974/75. As production from Bombay High started in 1976/77 and continued to
increase, domestic crude oil accounted for 36% to 41% of consumption during
1977/78 through 1979/80 and 44% in 1981/82.
2.04     The accelerated development (para 2.19) of the presently known
petroleum reservoirs is expected to increase domestic crude oil production
substantially, from about 16.2 million tons in 1981/82 to a projected 30
million tons in 1984/85. Thus, domestic oil can be expected to provide at
least 60% of total oil consumption by the mid-1980s (Annex 2.1) but less than
50% by the end of the decade. In addition, the development of the offshore
South Bassein gas field will provide the equivalent of about 1.8 million toe
of gas by 1985/86, rising to 5.1 million toe by 1989/90, making gas a
significant energy resource in the late 1980s. This is summarized below:

a/  Production forecasts are based on development of presently known petroleum
reservoirs and do not assume new discoveries from the accelerated
exploration program.
b/  Domestic crude oil production in 1980/81 was adversely affected by
political unrest in Assam.
c/  Crude oil equivalent of petroleum products converted at 1.0638 tons of
crude per ton of products (Annex 2.2).
2.05     These forecasts are realistic provided the accelerated development
program of ONGC and OIL, as well as the transport and downstream facilities
for the use of the projected gas production, are implemented in a timely
manner. However, it is also clear that a substantial exploration program
should be maintained if domestic oil production in the late 1980s is to be
maintained or increased. Petroleum imports could reach about 33.7 million
tons in 1989/90, compared to 20.6 million tons actually imported (net) in
1981/82, unless additional petroleum discoveries are made.
2.06     Almost all natural gas produced in India at present is associated
gas. The quantities produced are relatively small, however, and about 40% is
flared, particularly in Assam where the fields are small and dispersed, and
potential consumers are far away, making it uneconomic to utilize the small
quantities produced. The role of gas as an energy resource is therefore minor
so far, with consumption in 1981/82 at only about 2 billion Nm3 (1.6 million
toe), equivalent to 1% of commercial primary energy consumption and 4% of
crude oil consumption. With the development of the South Bassein gas field
just about to begin (1983/84-1985/86), and prospects for commercial quantities
of either free or associated gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin, the role of
gas in the commercial energy sector is expected to increase rapidly and become
significant in the late 1980s.

b. Pricing Policies
2.07     India, in recent years, has consistently followed a policy of
maintaining composite retail prices of oil products at international levels,
with a cross-subsidy from gasoline towards kerosene (on social and
environmental grounds) and naphtha (for fertilizers). The price of a
reconstituted barrel of petroleum products is $46.721/ at the retail level
based on prices in effect since July 11, 1981. In spite of the cross-subsidy
from gasoline to kerosene, the latter's consumption growth has been relatively
slow at 2.5% per year during 1970/71-1980/81 compared to 5% per year for all
light distillates and 6.5% per year for all middle distillates. Most of the
growth in consumption has been for naphtha, diesel oil, LPG and fuel oil.
Prices are as follows for the main products:
Prices as of July 1981
Rs per Liter                  US$ per US Gallon

Kerosene        1.81            1.14            0.76         1.39        -

Fuel Oil        2.79           0.75             1.20         0.88       1.50
a! Prices in New Delhi, about average for India.
Natural gas, unlike crude oil, is sold directly by the producers (OIL and
ONGC) to the consumer, on the basis of long-term contracts (which require
government approval). Offshore gas is priced on the basis of the end-use;
onshore gas prices can vary considerably from one customer to the next as they
are affected, for instance, by the year in which the contract was entered
into, local surpluses of gas being flared, etc. ONGC's gas prices are
discussed further in paras. 6.06 and 6.07.
2.08     Domestic crude oil is sold to the refineries at Government-regulated
prices which were raised substantially in July 1981. Although below
international levels, the current domestic crude oil prices (para 6.05) ensure
satisfactory profits and financial performance for the producers as well as
allow them to finance from internally generated funds a major portion of their
investment programs. Finally, exploration and development decisions are based
on international oil prices, rather than the relatively lower domestic price,
and the latter price does not act as a disincentive to invest in oil
exploration or development. The average level and structure of petroleum
prices in India are considered satisfactory at present.
1/ The cost of a reconstituted barrel was calculated by weighting the price
per barrel of each product by its proportion in consumption, using 1980/81
weights.

Petroleum Resources, Past and Future Development
a. Petroleum Resources
2.09     Petroleum reservoirs are found in sedimentary basins.  In India,
there are 27 sedimentary basins with a total area of approximately 1.7 million
km2 of which about 1.4 million km2 (82%) is onshore with the remainder,
offshore (to a water depth of 200 meters). Commercial petroleum production
has been established in only three sedimentary basins. The first is the Upper
Assam Shelf in parts of Assam in the eastern part of the country. The second
is the Cambay basin comprising an area in Gujarat. The third is the Bombay
offshore basin which includes the giant Bombay High field and several other
smaller fields (North Bassein, South Bassein, Heera and Ratnagiri). However,
petroleum has been found in seven other basins: Krishna-Godavari, Cauvery,
Rajasthan, Bengal, Himalayan Foothills-Ganga Valley, Andaman Islands and the
Assam-Arakan Fold Belt. In addition, four other basins, Saurasthra, Kutch,
Konkan-Kerala and Mahanadi are considered prospective on general geological
grounds. The Krishna-Godavari and Cauvery basins are the most promising new
areas today with the Krishna-Godavari particularly standing out as the next
likely major commercial discovery after Bombay High. Magnetic and gravimetric
surveys have been undertaken for most of the potential petroleum bearing
areas. However, modern geophysical surveys have covered less than 50% of the
prospective areas; and no exploratory drilling has been carried out in more
than 65% of the areas.
2.10     As of March 1981 cumulative oil production in India totalled 141.8
million tons of oil; and from 1970/71 to 1980/81 some 19.3 million toe of gas
were produced. The Government's estimate of remaining recoverable proven and
probable reservesl/ from existing fields is as follows:

Reserves as of January, 1981

1/ The estimates of recoverable petroleum reserves from fields already
producing or just recently discovered are generally classified into proven
reserves, probable reserves and possible reserves. Proven reserves have the
highest degree of certainty and are based only on areas delineated by actual
drilling and successful testing. Probable reserves are those inferred from
the full lateral extent of the reservoir structure, that is, beyond the limits
defined by existing wells. Possible reserves include the additional recovery
that could reasonably be expected from the known reservoirs if enhanced oil
recovery schemes are implemented.



- 12 -
2.11     The long-term estimates of the total geological petroleum resources
(i.e. initial oil or gas in-place) and the recoverable resources of a country
are based on prognostic studies, using geological extrapolations and
interpolations, as well as technical and economic assumptions. The results of
such studies are highly speculative and subject to wide divergence of
opinion. Nonetheless, they provide a broad indication of potential petroleum
resources and a framework for developing long-term energy sector policies and
petroleum subsector exploration and development strategies. A recent study
has estimated the total potential Indian geological resources of petroleum at
about 15 billion tons of oil equivalent, of which about 30% is considered
recoverable. About two-thirds of the potential recoverable petroleum
resources are estimated to be located offshore, and about three-quarters of
the potential reserves are gas. While these estimates may be considered as
optimistic, they are indicative of the substantial undiscovered potential.
b. The Role of the Private and Public Sectors in the Development of
India's Petroleum Potential
2.12     Commercial quantities of petroleum were first discovered in India in
1889 at Digboi, Assam, by the Assam Oil Company, a private firm. In 1915 the
Burmah Oil Company (UK) also began exploration in Assam and in 1921 acquired
full control of the Assam Oil Company. Until the 1950s, petroleum exploration
was concentrated in the northeastern part of the country, namely in Assam,
Tripura and Nagaland. In 1954, ONGCl/ began as a department of the Geological
Survey of India, and it was established in its present form by an Act of
Parliament in 1959. Oil India Limited (OIL) was established in 1959 following
an oil discovery in Assam by Burmah Oil Company (UK). The Government of India
initially took a one-third equity interest in OIL, then increased its equity
interest to 50% in 1961, and in October 1981, purchased the entire Indian
assets of the Burmah Oil Company, covering its interest in OIL and in the
Assam Oil Company. Starting in 1959, ONGC discovered petroleum reserves in
Cambay (1959), Ankleshwar (1960), Kalol (1961), and Sanand (1962), all in
Gujarat. Later, ONGC discovered oil in Lakwa (1964) and Geleki (1968) in
Assam.
2.13     Following the oil crisis of 1973, exploration activities accelerated
particularly offshore, resulting in the discovery by ONGC in 1974 of the giant
offshore field of Bombay High and a number of significant but smaller fields
in its vicinity. Assam was the major petroleum producing area (4.2 million
tpy) in the country until the early 1970s when production from Gujarat also
reached just over 4 million tpy. By 1979/80, production from Bombay High had
also exceeded 4 million tpy and by 1981/82 reached 8 million tpy.
2.14     International oil companies have been involved in petroleum
exploration in India intermittently. Prior to 1950, the Assam Oil Company and
the Burmah Oil Company were the only firms active in petroleum exploration.
In 1954, the Indo-Stanvac (Standard Oil and Socony Vacuum, now Exxon and
Mobil, U.S.A.) agreement with a 25% GOI interest was signed, providing for an
1/ ONGC's organization is reviewed in Chapter V.

exploration area of 10,000 km2 in West Bengal. The venture was abandoned in
1959, after drilling 10 (dry) wells. From 1974 to 1977, three joint-venture
agreements each covering 25,000 km2 of offshore area, were also concluded with
Asamera (Canada), Natomas (USA), and Reading and Bates (USA) but the companies
withdrew following completion of the minimum work requirements due to the
discouraging results. In the following years, the Government did not
encourage participation of foreign oil companies in petroleum exploration.
2.15     In late 1980, recognizing the urgent need to accelerate the pace of
exploration but aware of the technical and financial constraints on ONGC's own
exploration efforts, the Government decided to actively promote open arees for
exploration by foreign firms. Thirty-two blocks, each ranging in size from
10,000 to 30,000 km2 offshore and onshore, were offered to international
bidders. The total area offered, almost 0.9 million km2, represented about
50% of the country's sedimentary basin area. Although 34 foreign oil
companies were invited, only seven submitted bids and offers were concentrated
on just two offshore blocks in the vicinity of oil producing areas. This
response was somewhat disappointing but can be partly explained by the
probable concern of some companies that India would likely exercise its option
to buy back their oil share. Undoubtedly, the companies have so far adopted a
.."wait and see" attitude and still view India's new exploration strategy with
caution after a substantial period in which private industry involvement has
been minimal. Thus, it is not surprising that the initial round of bidding
involving relatively unknown areas with what can be regarded as modest
geological potential, as well as untested government policies, attracted only
a few bids which concentrated on the most promising blocks offered (i.e. near
producing areas). One production-sharing agreement has so far been signed
with a consortium led by Chevron (USA) for an 18,500 km2 block in the
Saurasthra basin offshore Gujarat, north of the Bombay High field. The terms
of the production sharing agreement provide for Chevron to drill at least
three wells, spending a minimum of US$29 million over a three-year period, at
its own risk. Upon commercial discovery, ONGC may assume up to 50% joint
venture in future development (without payment of exploration costs), and
production will be split according to a scale which escalates with field
profitability. Until India achieves self-sufficiency in oil, GOI has the
option to purchase Chevron's share of the oil produced at international
prices. Chevron started its seismic survey after contract signing and it was
completed in July 1982; drilling started in late 1982 after the monsoon
season.   Meanwhile, invitations to bid on a second round of offerings were
issued end-August 1982 to 37 foreign oil companies and bids are expected to be
received in February 1983. The second offering includes about 50 blocks both
onshore and offshore, including new areas such as west of the Bombay High
field (in 200 m of water), and the outer-shelves of the Krishna-Godavari and
Mahanadi deltas. In view of the fact that (i) ONGC has recently made a
discovery in one of the blocks previously offered (Palk straits) but not bid
upon by companies; and (ii) the contractual framework has enabled one major
oil company to enter into an exploration contract, the response to the
offering in this second round is expected to be much better. Therefore, one
may conclude that a process has been initiated which, if supported by further
discoveries, will, over time, lead to a substantial increase in private sector
activities and an acceleration of exploration work to levels commensurate with
India's prospective acreage.
2.16     In the public sector two companies, ONGC and OIL, have traditionally
undertaken exploration activities. ONGC has had, and will continue to have,



- 14 -
by far the largest involvement in the petroleum sector as the principal entity
in charge of petroleum exploration and development. OIL is much smaller than
ONGC and produces about 3 million tpy of oil, all from Assam. Until recently,
it had a licence covering only about 2,500 km2 in Assam and Arunachal
Pradesh. The company has explored its license area extensively and has
replenished its reserves through steady but small discoveries. Since late
1981, OIL obtained exploration rights in Orissa (the Mahanadi basin), both
onshore and offshore, and in areas in Rajasthan.
2.17     The Ministry of Petroleum is in charge of policy making in the
petroleum sector. It monitors activities in the sector closely and, inter
alia, has to vet all the programs and budgets proposed by public sector
enterprises. The Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB), a public body created
in 1974, provides financing to public sector enterprises in the petroleum
production and refining sectors. Its only source of revenues is a cess levied
on domestic oil production. The attached map (IBRD Map No. 16183) presents
the main features of India's petroleum subsector.
c. Development Prospects and Investment Strategy
2.18     The petroleum subsector program of the Government has four principal
components: (i) to increase production from existing fields, primarily by
accelerating development programs by ONGC and OIL in areas where petroleum has
already been discovered; (ii) to accelerate exploration for yet undiscovered
resources both by the national and foreign oil companies; (iii) to modernize
the existing refineries and construct new ones; and (iv) to develop the gas
pipeline system and construct additional gas-using plants (e.g. fertilizer and
petrochemical plants) to use more effectively the significant gas reserves
currently untapped.
2.19     Following the successful implementation of the initial four phases of
development of the Bombay High field as well as the encouraging results of
recent exploration activities, GOI has authorized both ONGC and OIL to
accelerate their petroleum exploration and development programs. Thus, while
the current Plan (1980/81-1984/85) originally earmarked about Rs 33.3 billion
in 1980/81 prices for petroleum exploration and development, representing a
47% real increase above the actual expenditures during the previous five-year
period (1975/76-1979/80), ONGC and OIL have responded with a much higher
revised budget proposal of about Rs 53.8 billion in 1980/81 prices for
exploration and development, most of which has already been approved. The
focus of this revised program is the accelerated implementation of the fifth
and sixth phases of the Bombay High field, the development of the offshore
South Bassein gas field and further exploratory drilling in Krishna-Godavari
basin. As mentioned earlier, several other areas are expected to be explored
by foreign firms on a production-sharing basis during the current Plan period.
2.20     The accelerated petroleum exploration and development program would
also mean larger investments in petroleum refining and distribution facilities
as well as investments for downstream processing plants (e.g. fertilizer and
petrochemical plants). In particular, the development of the South Bassein
gas field will require the rapid implementation of six new gas-based
fertilizer plants and related gas pipelines. A comparison of the actual
expenditures for the petroleum sector during 1975/76-1979/80 as well as the
original budget provisions and the revised estimate for the current Plan
(1980/81-1984/85) is shown below:

The Bank's Role and Lending Strategy in the Petroleum Subsector
2.21     Most of the Bank's lending operations to India in energy have been in
the power subsector (27 Bank/IDA operations for a total of US$3,059.0 million)
and spans a period of 32 years. However, the Bank's involvement in the
petroleum subsector has grown substantially. Three loans have been made to
ONGC including two for the development of the Bombay High fieldl/ (US$ 0
million in all), and one for exploration in the Krishna-Godavari delta_
(US$165.5 million); a US$200 million loan was made in April 1982 for the
modernization of several refineries3/.
2.22     The Bank's role in the Indian petroleum sub-sector continues to
address several inter-related aspects with varying degrees of emphasis
depending on the specific projects. These aspects are: (i) providing policy
advice on hydrocarbon exploration, development, processing and utilization
strategy through Bank involvement in key projects; (ii) assisting the domestic
petroleum companies develop their technical expertise and capability in each
major phase of hydrocarbon exploration, development and processing; (iii)
contributing to improve the technical design and implementation arrangements
of major projects; and (iv) strengthening the profitability and financial
structure of project entities so that they can self-finance a substantial
portion of their investments and attract more commercial financing for such
investments.
2.23     With regard to oil exploration, India's policy of having parallel
efforts by national and international oil companies is fully justified and is

well focused. In this respect, the Bank is helping to implement the "open
door" policy which India has recently adopted. The Bank has also, to a
considerable extent, assisted ONGC and GOI in defining the Krishna-Godavari
Project, using oil industry practices, with a view to minimize the risks
inherent in such a large and technically complex exploration venture.
2.24     The Bank has been associated with Bombay High development since the
early stages, and was instrumental in ensuring that all the required reservoir
and field development studies had been carried out in accordance with industry
practice before the huge development program was launched. Subsequently GOI
requested Bank financing for Bombay High development. The development of the
Bombay High field has proceeded largely according to plans, with ONGC
implementing progressively more complex and larger phases, after reservoir
studies and actual production performance have confirmed the initial
expectations. In line with modern oil industry practices, ONGC has planned
early for the introduction of reservoir pressure maintenance through water
injection, which should constitute the bulk of the next development phase.
Throughout the development of Bombay High, ONGC has used experienced foreign
consultants and contractors, to optimize the oil recovery and the technical
design, as well as to su~ lement ONGC's own capabilities.  A Project
Performance Audit Report_ for the first Bombay High Project was submitted to
the Board in October 13, 1982.
2.25      ONGC's efforts in the Bombay High development were supported by the
Bank through the two loans mentioned earlier which included undertakings by
GOI regarding the adoption of oil and gas pricing policies which would enable
ONGC to earn satisfactory profits, thereby improving its creditworthiness, and
increasing its commercial borrowing capability to help finance its large
investment program. In this regard, the Bank encouraged GOI and ONGC to seek
external financing for Bombay High development. The first Eurodollar
borrowing (US$50 million) was obtained on highly favorable terms in connection
with the first Bombay High Project loan, which paved the way for subsequent
larger recourse to private external sources in support of the Bombay High
program. From 1977-78 through 1981/82, ONGC obtained commitments for
approximately US$409 million from commercial sources, compared to nil prior to
that period. Though most of these borrowings cannot be categorized as
cofinancing, they can be credited, to some extent, to the Bank's advice and
catalytic role in securing commercial financing. More recently, GOI adopted a
policy of using ONGC as a major vehicle for commercial financing; under the
new policy, all eligible items put to competitive bidding are offered with a
request for commercial financing proposals (para. 3.23). Under this new
policy, ONGC has obtained during the first nine months of 1982/83, about
US$254.4 million of commercial loans/credits. Thus ONGC is currently one of
the largest Indian borrowers on the international capital markets.
2.26     While ONGC has acquired considerable expertise in offshore oil
development during the past seven years, it still faces substantial technical
and financial challenges during the next decade in undertaking a large and
ambitious investment program on its own as well as in any joint-venture
development efforts that would hopefully materialize with international oil
companies. Technically, ONGC will need to concentrate its capabilities
1/  Project Performance Audit Report No. 4139, October 13, 1982.



- 17 -
primarily on those areas where discoveries have already been made.
Financially, ONGC will need to continue mobilizing large amounts of foreign
exchange. So far, ONGC has successfully borrowed increasingly larger amounts
to help finance its investment requirements from foreign commercial
loans/credits, as discussed in paras. 3.23 and 6.12; the Bank will continue to
encourage GOI and ONGC to increase recourse to foreign commercial borrowing
2.27     Over the past two years, the Bank has had an extensive dialogue with
ONGC and GOI in relation to the development of India's offshore free gas
reserves, concentrating in particular on the optimization of the design s,f the
development of the largest gas discovery to date, South Bassein, and the
build-up of a market for natural gas. The development of South Bassein
represents a new challenge to ONGC as it is the first major gas development
project in India; unlike crude oil, such a project has to be optimized, not
only in terms of reservoir considerations, but also in relation to the future
market for natural gas. The Bank therefore discussed with GOI, ONGC, and its
consultants, at various stages of project preparation, the scope of market
studies to be carried out and their conclusions. As a result the main
components of the Project have been optimized in terms of the anticipated
market.
2.28     In relation to the utilization of offshore gas, until 1980, a policy
decision had been made to dedicate practically all of India's offshore
reserves of associated and free gas to fertilizer production. In view of the
potential for large-scale gas discoveries, as being experienced in other
countries, the Bank in 1980 commissioned an independent study aimed at
identifying the various potential economic uses of gas in the economy. The
study, which was subsequently discussed with the Government, examined the
merits of gas utilization for different purposes in India, and concluded that
gas would be an economic resource, not only for fertilizer production, but
also for a variety of other uses involving the replacement of liquid fuels,
and even for special cases of power generation as bottlenecks in coal supplies
cause, in turn, power shortages with adverse repercussions for the
manufacturing sector. Furthermore, as sizeable investments are required for
new gas-based industries, Bank has encouraged the development of India's gas
resources by participating in the financing of several projects based on
offshore gas. During the implementation of the proposed Project the Bank
intends to continue helping GOI formulate a long-term gas strategy designed to
accelerate the development of free gas reserves while building a market for
gas both as feedstock, and as a replacement of liquid hydrocarbons.

III. THE PROJECT
Objective
3.01     Natural gas, currently a minor source of energy, could become an
important source of energy by the end of the decade, given the potential large
gas reserves and prospects, not only as fertilizer feedstock but also as
substitute for liquid hydrocarbon fuels in a highly industrialized and heavily
populated part of India. The proposed Project consists of the first phase of
the South Bassein field development which is currently estimated to have the
potential to sustain a production rate of 20 million Nm3 per day (MMCMD) of
gas for a period of at least 20 years. The Project will bring the production
capability of the field to 5 MMCMD, help meet the feedstock requirements of
two fertilizer plants, and begin to meet the demand in Maharashtra and Gujarat
for the replacement of liquid hydrocarbons. The Project will also constitute
the cornerstone for the basic infrastructure required for the development and
utilization of offshore gas reserves in Western India.
Main Characteristics of the South Bassein Field
3.02     The South Bassein field is located approximately 65 kilometers west
of Bombay in the Arabian Sea at a water depth of 57 m. The discovery well was
drilled and completed as a gas producer in early 1976. Since then twelve
wells were drilled to delineate the structure and the reservoir. Map 16183
shows the location of the field.
3.03     The South Bassein field is located on the southern culmination of an
asymmetrical anticlinal feature having two well defined culminations aligned
in a north-northwest, south-southeast direction. The northern culmination of
the anticlinal feature constitutes the structure for the Panna (or North
Bassein) oil field. Production is obtained from the A Zone and B Zone
carbonate reservoirs of Lower Oligocene/Upper Eocene age encountered at about
1,600 m subsea. The entire South Bassein field is underlain by water and a
thin oil column. At the B Zone oil-water contact, the field is about 33 km
long and 10 km wide and has a total hydrocarbon column of 160 m.
3.04     The hydrocarbon reserves of the South Bassein field are estimated by
D.R. McCord and Associates (Consultants, USA) as follows:
Million Cubic Meters (MMCM)
A Zone         B Zone
Free gas                          30,900           244,100
Condensate                             4.4              35.2
Oil                                    3.9             214.6
Solution gas                         700            37,100
The oil reserves (218.5 million m3 or 1.4 billion Bbls) are widely distributed
throughout the reservoir within a 20-meter interval containing relatively high
transitional water saturations. To date all efforts to produce oil from this
thin oil column have been unsuccessful due to early water and/or gas
encroachment. About 74.5% of the free gas reserves (204.9 MMCM or 6.8 TCF)
are estimated to be recoverable in about 30 years, along with 29.5 MMCM (185.5



- 19 -
million barrels) of condensate. The reservoir is capable of maintaining a
plateau production rate of 20 MMCMD for at least 20 years through some 24
wells. The reserves of the South Bassein field and the production
characteristics are examined in more detail in Annex 3.1.
Project Design and Optimization
3.05     The Ministry of Petroleum appointed an Expert Committee on April 28,
1980 to consider ONGC's proposal for laying a pipeline from the South Bassein
gas field to Gujarat and other locations to the north. Its major task was to
select the optimum pipeline route, a matter of vital interest to the states of
Maharashtra and Gujarat. The choice finally devolved on two alternatives: to
make landfall at Nawapur in Maharashtra and then overland to the IDA-assisted
(Cr. 1125-IN of March 1981) Hazira fertilizer complex in Gujarat and on north
or whether to make the landfall at Umrat near Hazira in Gujarat (see Map IBRD
16184). After an exhaustive study of all pertinent factors and data related
to the two routes and the gas utilization plans, the Committee selected the
Umrat route. The results of these studies showed this alternative to be
marginally preferable, but the decisive factor in the selection was the fact
that construction could be completed at least a year earlier by taking the
offshore route.
3.06     D. R. McCord and Associates (USA) carried out geological and
geophysical studies of the field; the results of these studies form the basis
for the reservoir evaluation and development plan for the field (Annex 3.1).
Earl and Wright (USA) prepared the conceptual studies necessary for the sizing
and specification of the facilities required for the offshore production
complex, following a careful evaluation of the available alternatives.
3.07     Snamprogetti (Italy) was assigned to study optimization of the
pipeline from South Bassein to the Hazira terminal. An important element of
the study was to determine whether the pipeline should transport "dry" or
"wet" gas, the latter being a gas which would undergo some degree of
condensation depending on its composition and transient temperature and
pressure conditions in the pipeline. To avoid any condensation in the
pipeline the South Bassein gas would have to be chilled to around 100C to drop
out all the condensate before the gas enters the pipeline. Snamprogetti's
calculations show that at 20 MMCMD flow rate, a 36"-diameter pipeline is
needed to transport "wet" gas but only 32" for "dry" gas.  This reduction in
pipe size would save approximately US$50.0 million in materials and
construction costs. However, these savings would be offset by the necessity
to install additional offshore platform space along with the required
refrigeration, condensate, ancillary and utility facilities at a cost of about
US$35.0 million, and higher operating costs (about US$11.0 million per year
for fuel alone if one assigns the fuel oil equivalency value to natural
gas). Further, whenever the refrigeration unit is down for repairs or
maintenance, pipeline capacity would be reduced to about 75% of normal design
flow rate. This would require some consumers to accept periods of load
shedding or the installation of 100% refrigeration standby once the line
capacity is fully committed. On the basis of these and some other important
considerations the decision was made to transport "wet" gas to Hazira and take
care of the condensate removal there. The Bank agrees with this decision.
3.08     To determine the optimum pipe diameter Snamprogetti calculated the
investment and operating costs for 20, 25 and 30 MMCMD throughput at various



- 20 -
inlet pressures and pipe diameters. The terminal pressure at Hazira was kept
constant at 820 psig which is a reasonable selection from the standpoint of
the fertilizer plants' requirement, the cryogenic turbo-expansion unit to be
installed for LPG and C2/C31/ recovery, and flexibility to increase throughput
by adding compression at the terminal to make up for any drop in pressure
needed to induce a greater flow rate. The optimum pipe diameter for 20, 25
and 30 MMCMD was found to be 36", 40" and 42" respectively with an optimum
inlet pressure of 100 atmospheres.2/ The 36" diameter option (20 MMCMD) was
selected because:
(a) 20 MMCMD is the estimated plateau production rate from the South
Bassein field and forecasts indicate that this is a realistic
demand rate as well;
(b) should production capacity and demand eventually exceed 20
MMCMD, throughput can be increased by additional compression at
South Bassein and/or at the terminal; and
(c)  40  and 42" pipelines have not yet been installed in offshore
waters. This poses a technical risk, and since construction
costs and durations were extrapolated from experience with 36"
pipeline construction there is the possibility that costs for
the larger diameter pipelines could have been substantially
underestimated.
The Project gas reserves and optimization study are in the Project file
(Annex 7.1).
The Project
3.09     The Project comprises ONGC's Phase I development of the South Bassein
gas field which will provide a production capacity of 5 MMCMD. The remainder
of the development program will be implemented during 1984/85 - 1987/88 and
will raise the production capacity to 20 MMCMD. For the Project, the major
offshore facilities will consist of a central platform complex, located near
Well SB-7 at approximately latitude 19o-11' north and longitude 720-7' east,
and a 235-km pipeline (217 km will be under water) to the Hazira terminal.
The complex will have four steel platforms fixed to the ocean floor and
interconnected with bridges to accommodate respectively well drilling, gas
processing, gas flaring and operator living quarters. The primary function of
the complex is to serve as a gas gathering and shipping terminal for South
Bassein gas and as a compressor station for associated gas from Bombay High.
However, it will also serve as the nucleus for the expanding operations at
South Bassein and satellite fields in the coming years.
3.10     Six wells with the capability of producing a total of 5 MMCMD of gas
under normal operating conditions will be drilled from the fixed drilling
platform. Provisions will be included to permit drilling three more wells to
test oil bearing strata in the structure. An adjoining processing platform
1/  Ethane/propane mixture.
2/ Equivalent to 1,470 psig.



- 21 -
will have provisions for separating natural gas liquids (NGL with an API
gravity of 52.20) and moisture from the gas. The NGL will be pumped into the
existing 30" Bombay High crude oil trunk line via a 12" tie line, and the gas
will be shipped to Hazira over a 36" pipeline (see Map IBRD 16184). It will
also be possible to ship South Bassein gas to Uran through a 20" tie-line into
the existing 26" Bombay High gas trunkline and ship Bombay High associated g_
to Hazira through the same tie-line. Compression facilities on the process
platform will have the capability of delivering up to 5 MMCMD of Bombay High
associated gas to Hazira. A platform for flaring gas in an emergency
situation and a platform containing living quarters for 125 persons completd
the central platform complex.l/
3.11     The 36" gas pipeline will make landfall at Umrat in Gujarat and
proceed overland to the Hazira terminal (the actual locality is Kawas, a short
distance from Hazira) located adjacent to the fertilizer complex. The
terminal will consist of facilities for condensate extraction, and
stabilization, together with ancillary and utility units. An LPG recovery
plant is scheduled to be built by 1985/86 on the terminal site, but is not
included in the project scope.
3.12     The major components of the proposed project are summarized below.  A
detailed description of these facilities appears in Annex 3.2.
-  Drilling Platform:  Installation of one four-pile fixed platform
and drilling of six production wells (the platform will have
extra slots for three more wells) located in the vicinity of the
process platform. The two platforms will be connected by a
bridge which will also carry the production and test flow lines
from the wells to the process units.
-  Process Platform:  One two-deck, eight-pile fixed platform
containing natural gas and natural gas liquids processing
facilities designed to handle 10 MMCMD of free gas. The
platform will be installed in the vicinity of well SB-7 in
approximately 60 m of water.
-  Living Quarters Platform:  One four-pile, two-deck fixed
platform located in the vicinity of the process platform and
connected to it by a bridge. The platform will provide living
quarters and amenities for 125 persons and will contain the
necessary utilities and a helideck.
- Flare Platform: a four-pile fixed structure connected to the
process platform by a bridge, with a flare.
1/ In subsequent phases three drilling platforms supporting 18 production
wells, one 10-MMCMD process platform, and about 1,000 km of onshore gas
pipelines will be installed at an estimated cost of US$1.1 billion in end-1982
prices to increase South Bassein's production capacity to 20 MMCMD. In
addition, four LPG plants and two C2/C3 plants will be installed at a cost of
US$0.5 billion. The first LPG plant is being built in conjunction with the
proposed Project.



- 22 --
- South Bassein to Umrat Pipeline: a 36", 217-km long submarine
pipeline designed to carry 20 MMCMD of gas.
- Umrat to Hazira Pipeline: a 36", 18-km long land pipeline to
the terminal at Kawas adjacent to the Hazira fertilizer complex.
- South Bassein - Bombay High Gas Tie-in: a 20", 17-km long
submarine line from the South Bassein process platform to the
26"-Bombay High gas transmission line.
- NGL Line: a 12", 17-km long submarine line from the South
Bassein process platform to the 30" Bombay High crude oil
transmission line.
- Hazira Terminal Facilities: condensate separation,
stabilization and storage, pigging, utilities and ancillary
facilities.
- Engineering and Technical Services and Reservoir Consultancy:
includes consultants to prepare engineering design and bid
packages, assistance in construction supervision and overall
project management, other project services such as surveys and
certifications of offshore structures, and assistance to ONGC in
implementing and monitoring the gas production program.
Engineering and Construction
3.13     ONGC relies almost entirely on expatriate expertise in the
engineering and construction of its offshore installations. Earl and Wright
have prepared bid documents for all the offshore structures, production,
processing and utility units. The successful bidder for the supply of the
platforms will be responsible for detailed design and engineering,
procurement, and fabrication, and will also act as the main contractor for the
platform complex. Transportation, installation, hook-up and commissioning of
the platforms will be bid separately and the successful bidder will act as a
subcontractor to the main contractor; worldwide there are several fabrication
yards (i.e. shipyards) and about a half dozen or so installation firms with
the expertise and resources to undertake projects of this magnitude and
complexity. The supply of pipe materials will be bid separately from the
transportation and pipeline installation job. The latter requires highly
specialized pipe-laying expertise but there are several qualified contractors
worldwide. Engineers India Limited (EIL) will assist ONGC in supervising the
construction phase.
3.14     Snamprogetti has been assigned design and engineering responsibility
for the 36" offshore pipeline and the Hazira terminal. The consultant will
also assist ONGC in preparing all procurement documents, bid evaluations and
construction supervision. Construction of the land portion of the pipeline
and the terminal facilities will be contracted to qualified local firms.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that ONGC will continue to use
consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference are
satisfactory to the Bank in the design, engineering and preparation of bidding
documents and the supervision of construction of the project facilities.

3.15     The project will be executed by the Bombay Offshore Project (BOP)
group which is responsible for all operations related to Bombay High and the
surrounding areas.
3.16     Overall supervision of the project will be assigned to experienced
senior BOP staff at the General Manager and Deputy General Manager levels who,
along with senior project managers, have had extensive experience in the
Bombay High development program. The organization is burdened with a heavy
work load, but with the provisions which have been made for outside
assistance, the project should be successfully completed on schedule.
3.17     BOP's arrangements for executing the project have been reasonably
effective in the past and are satisfactory to the Bank. The central platform
complex, the onshore and the offshore portion of the South Bassein-Hazira
pipeline will be under the direction of the Construction Division with a
Deputy General Manager assigned to each of the three components along with
other project management staff from the division. A similar arrangement
exists for the Hazira terminal component under the direction of the Production
Division. The wells will be drilled by the Operations Division either with an
ONGC rig or a contract rig depending which is available for the time slot
allotted to the drilling. Supporting services will be provided by the other
BOP divisions.
3.18     In addition to the consultant assistance mentioned previously ONGC
has engaged the services of King Wilkinson (USA) to provide back-up support
for its entire offshore construction program. The consultants' assignment is
to provide advice and assistance during all facets of offshore construction
projects including: (i) project planning, scheduling and controls including
appropriate computer based techniques; (ii) supervision during fabrication,
construction and installation of offshore facilities; (iii) trouble shooting
throughout the project cycle; and (iv) preparation and administration of a
comprehensive training program.
Implementation Schedule
3.19     The project is scheduled to be completed and commissioned by the end
of May 1985 (Annex 3.3). For the pipeline and terminal facilities about 15
months have been allotted from tendering in March 1983 to the commissioning
in May 1984, which is tight but achievable. The platform complex will be
commissioned one year later in May 1985, about 25 months after tendering. The
pipeline work schedule is tight, because of ON GC's fertilizer gas supply
commitments beginning in early January 1984 0. With no unforeseen major
equipment delivery or construction setbacks, ONGC should succeed in meeting
its project completion target.
1/ GOI/ONGC confirmed during negotiations that supply of gas to the Hazira
fertilizer plant during the testing and trial production in early 1984 will be
arranged from ONGC's Gujarat gas production. From June 1984 to April 1985,
Bombay High associated gas will be supplied to Hazira through the South
Bassein pipeline.

Estimated Cost
3.20         The  total project  financing  requirement  is  estimated at about  US$702
million including the capitalized front-end fee on the Bank loan,
contingencies and customs duty on imported materials and equipment for the
onshore facilities and the subsea pipeline within the territorial waters of
India. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$603 million or 86%
of the total cost. Estimated project costs are summarized below; a detailed

3.21     Development drilling costs were derived from ONGC's historical costs
in the Bombay High field for wells drilled to similar depths as the South
Bassein wells. The cost of the offshore platform complex is based on current
steel tonnage and equipment cost of similar facilities being installed on the
Second Bombay High Project. The offshore and onshore pipeline and shore
terminal costs were estimated by the consultants, Snamprogetti. Overall
engineering services have been estimated at 8% to 10% of the basic project
cost in line with past experience on this type of project.  The expected
average cost per man-month for the various engineering services required for
the project is US$12,000 and US$1,800 for foreign (800 man-months) and local
consultants, respectively, including travel, subsistence and overheads.
Reservoir consultants (850 man-months) are expected to average US$17,500 per
man-month. These consultancy costs are based on actual contracts or in line
with those presently experienced by ONGC in other projects. A physical
contingency of 10% was applied to the total base cost (expressed in January
1983 prices) for all Project items which is considered satisfactory in view of
the advanced stage of project design.
ONGC's Financing Plan
3.22     The proposed Project represents about 6%, while the full development
program about 19%, of ONGC's overall investment program of about Rs 109.6
billion (US$12.2 billion) over 1982/83 - 1985/86. The financing plan of the
overall investment program of ONGC is shown in para. 6.10, and indicates that
internally generated funds will finance about 68%, and borrowings about 32%,
of the investment program. The aggregate Bank disbursements!' for the 1982/83
- 1985/86 investment program is projected to be about US$566 million, or
approximately 5% of ONGC's total investment program and about 9% of ONGC's
total foreign exchange requirements.
3.23     In recent years, the strategy of GOI and ONGC has increasingly been
to diversify the sources of financing to ONGC, essentially by securing
suppliers' credits when advantageous, and by Eurodollar borrowings
otherwise. The policy, adopted in late 1981 by the Government, is to utilize
as much external financing as feasible to meet the foreign exchange
requirements of ONGC's investment program; as a regular practice, ONGC now
requests financing proposals as it issues bids for major procurement items.
Once ONGC has evaluated the bids, a decision on final award, taking into
account the most suitable financing arrangement (e.g., bilateral loans,
suppliers' credits, commercial loans) is taken by the Government. During
1980/81 and 1981/82, against a total foreign exchange requirement of about
US$1.1 billion, ONGC utilized about US$230 million (21%) from commercial
loans/credits, and about US$385 million (35%) from official development
assistance, with the balance (44%) covered by foreign exchange purchased with
internally-generated resources. Following the recently adopted procedure
described above, it is expected that a substantial proportion (30-50% or
roughly US$2 to 3 billion) of ONGC's foreign exchange requirements for
investments during the period 1982/83 - 1985/86 could be met with foreign
commercial loans/credits. As mentioned earlier (para. 2.25) ONGC has already
obtained about US$254.4 million of commercial loans/credits during the first
1/ Disbursements from the Second Bombay High Offshore Development Project
(Loan 1925-IN), the Krishna-Godavari Exploration Project (Loan 2205-IN), and
the proposed South Bassein Gas Development Project.



- 26 -
nine months of 1982/83, in addition to about US$206.2 million of bilateral and
multilateral loans (including US$165.5 million from the Bank for the Krishna-
Godavari exploration project). Furthermore, bids with an aggregate value of
about US$167 million for which financing proposals have been received are
under evaluation and will be awarded shortly. Several major bid packages
requesting financing proposals with a combined value of about US$283 million
have also recently been issued or will be issued by the end of 1982/83.
Finally, ONGC is considering a Eurodollar loan of about US$300 million within
the next several months. Given that the worldwide demand for petroleum
equipment is declining and interest rates are expected to decrease somewhat,
it is reasonable to expect that ONGC can mobilize substantial commercial loans
towards its investment program during 1982/83 - 1985/86.
Project Financing Plan
3.24     The South Bassein Project is highly suitable for external commercial
financing, both in the form of suppliers' credits, and commercial bank loans
(para. 3.26). In line with the procedure described earlier, ONGC intends to
ask bidders for the pipes, the platform complex (equipment and fabrication),
the drilling materials and some of the equipment for the terminal facilities
to submit financing proposals together with their bids. As a result, the
financing plan for the Project can be anticipated to be as follows:
Project Financing Plan
US$ Million           %
Suppliers' Credit (Pipe)                        150.0           21.4
Suppliers' Credit (Platforms, Drilling
Materials & T rminal Facilities)               100.0           14.3
Proposed IBRD a/                                 222.3           31.7
Kuwait Fund                                       50.0            7.1
ONGC                                             179.2           25.5
701.5         100.0
a/ Including Front-End Fee
b/ The Kuwait Fund has negotiated an agreement with ONGC for about US$50
million towards the financing of the Project. The loan will be for 20 years
including a 5 year grace period with an annual interest rate of 4% to GOI and
an onlending rate of 12% to ONGC. The loan will finance part (US$30 million)
of the pipe-laying contract, the pipe coating/wrapping contract (US$18
million) and some technical and consultancy services (US$2 million).
ONGC's contribution would represent about 2% of its internal cash generation
during the period. During negotiations assurances were be obtained that, if
required, GOI will provide ONGC, or cause ONGC to be provided with sufficient
funds to meet ONGC's financial requirements for the Project.
3.25     The Bank loan of US$222.3 million would represent about 32% of the
Project cost, and about 37% of its foreign exchange cost. The Bank loan would
be made to GOI at standard IBRD interest terms over 20 years including a five-
year grace period with a front-end fee of 1.5%. GOI would onlend the proceeds



- 27 -
of the Bank loan to ONGC at an interest rate of at least 12% (in line with
rates to public sector enterprises) over, at most, 15 years including a five-
year grace period. The onlending maturity of 15 years is sufficient
considering the substantial cashflow potential of the full development program
after it is completed in 1987/88. The grace period of 5 years is necessitated
by the need for additional investments (US$1.6 billion in end-1982 prices)
during 1984/85 - 1987/88 over and above the Project requirements to complete
the development program and raise production capacity to 20 MMCMD from the
Project's initial phase development of 5 MMCMD (para. 6.08). In general, the
onlending terms are reasonable considering the long-term nature of the
investment and economic life of the gas reserves, the relatively long duration
of the full development program, and the need to invest in substantial
infrastructure (i.e., pipelines) particularly inland. The foreign exchange
and interest rate risks would be borne by GOI.l/ The onlending rate is
expected to exceed domestic inflation rates which are not likely to be over 8%
annually in the next five years. Execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Items Proposed for Bank Financing
3.26     A substantial proportion of the project costs, in particular the
offshore platforms and the pipes, are suitable for financing by export credit
agencies and by supplier's credits which generally provide financing of up to
80% of the FOB cost. Foreign engineering and consultancy services, as well as
offshore platform installation, pipe-laying, and drilling contracts, however,
are not normally financed by export/supplier's credits, especially pipe-laying
since the barges for this activity often do not fly the flag of the
contractor's nationality. These latter items have therefore been considered
for Bank financing. In selecting the specific items for Bank financing and
determining the proposed amount for the Bank loan, the following additional
factors were taken into account: (i) items most suitable for ICB and which
will involve the minimum (if any) retroactive financing will be selected; (ii)
that the Bank's financial involvement will continue throughout the
implementation period; (iii) that the weighted average of the grace periods
and the maturities of all the loans should be satisfactory for a project of
this type; and (iv) that the Kuwait Fund has already agreed to finance some
technical assistance, part (US$30 million) of the pipe-laying contract, as
well as the coating and wrapping of the main pipes. On the basis of these
considerations, it was judged that the platform transportation and
installation, about 85% of the pipe-laying contract and the pipeline materials
other than the bare pipe, would be the most appropriate items for Bank
financing. The foreign exchange cost of these items are estimated to be about
US$219 million, equivalent to almost 24% of the total project cost. A Bank
loan equivalent of US$222.3 million would meet the aforementoned objectives
and maintain an adequate Bank financial presence in the Project; the loan
would also finance the front-end fee of about US$3.3 million (which would be
capitalized) as shown below.

Procurement and Disbursements
3.27     ONGC procurement procedures, which for imported items are similar to
the Bank's international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, will be used
for the following items for which suppliers or exim-bank financing proposals
will also be sought for major items (para 3.23); bare pipe materials (US$170
million CIF); fabrication and supply of platforms (US$120 million FOB); well
materials and supplies such as casings, wellheads, drilling mud, cement, etc.
(US$9 million CIF); and terminal equipment and instruments, as well as
telecommunication and telecontrol equipment (US$5 million CIF). Bank ICB
procedures will be used for the following contracts: installation of the main
36" offshore pipeline and tie-in pipelines including supply of flanges,
valves, anodes, etc. (US$200 million); and transportation, installation, hook-
up and commissioning of the platforms (US$47 million). Kuwait Fund
procurement procedures will be followed for the pipe coating and wrapping
contract (US$18 million). The estimated values of the various packages
mentioned above include provisions for physical and price contingencies. Bid
invitation and evaluation will be the responsibility of ONGC with assistance
from consultants as required. The bidding documents, bid evaluations and
contracts for the two Bank-financed packages will be subject to Bank review
and approval.
3.28     Disbursement of the Bank loan is expected to be completed by March
1985. The closing date would be December 31, 1985. The disbursement schedule
can be found in Annex 3.6. The schedule is based on a three-month time lag
between the time the expenditure is estimated to have been incurred and the
time the equivalent funds have been disbursed from the loan.
Ecology and Safety
3.29     The proposed project will cause few environmental disturbances of any
significance except possibly for short intervals during the installation of



- 29 -
the offshore platforms and pipeline, and during drilling. Offshore platforms,
after they are installed, generally attract a large aggregation of marine life
and are not considered to be detrimental to the ecology. There is essentially
no risk of oil spillage or other oil pollution. Petroleum condensate (i.e.,
NGL) separated from the gas will be piped directly into the crude oil
trunkline. Water produced with the gas will be degassed and then processed
through a corrugated plate interceptor which will remove entrained hydrocarbor.
liquids to less than 25 parts per million oil content before disposal. Two
sewage treatment plants are included, each sized to handle the total occupancy
(125 men) of the accommodation platform, along with chlorinating facilities
for the effluent. Both the onshore and offshore portions of the pipelinr -ill
be buried, and the original surface features along the pipeline route will be
restored.
3.30     Care has been taken in design to ensure the structural integrity of
offshore installations. All such installations including the offshore portion
of the pipeline will be designed and constructed in accordance with the latest
standards and practices of the offshore petroleum industry. Design criteria
are based on the report "Meteorological-Oceanographic Conditions Affecting
Offshore Petroleum Operations in the Bassein Area, Offshore Bombay, India" by
A.H. Glenn and Associates (U.S.A.). Soil data for the pipeline route and
platform area was obtained and compiled by Fugro Geotechnical Engineers and
Surveyors (Holland). A major international certifying agency will be
appointed to inspect and approve the various stages of design, fabrication and
installation of the offshore facilities.
3.31     All measures are being taken to minimize fire and other hazards.
During drilling ONGC will monitor and enforce blow-out prevention and well
control regulations and the use of appropriate safety equipment. The
completed wells will be equipped with subsurface and surface safety devices
which will allow automatic or manual shutdown of gas flow during emergency
situations. The platforms (but excluding the flare platform) will have gas
detectors at all strategic locations along with an alarm system. A similar
system will be installed for fire detection which will comprise smoke, ultra
violet and heat detectors. A deluge type fire water spray system will be
automatically activated by the ultra violet sensors and by fusible plugs
melting at 1850 F. In addition, a dry chemical fire fighting system will be
installed on each platform deck and a Halon fire suppressing system for all
enclosed areas except living quarters. Ample abandonment and recovery
equipment will be provided including two survival crafts one for each of the
two continuously manned platforms. The measures discussed above are in
compliance with the Bank's general environmental guidelines for offshore
petroleum projects. During negotiations, agreement was reached that ONGC will
take precautions, in line with standard industry practices satisfactory to the
Bank, to protect workers and the environment during the installation and
operations of the offshore project facilities.
IV. THE GAS MARKET AND JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
4.01     Unlike crude oil, which .is an easily-traded commodity, natural gas
cannot generally be traded in small volumes and therefore can be used
beneficially only if there is a specific distribution system and market
established for its use. Such a market would generally consist of users which



- 30 -
have shifted to gas from other energy sources, or of facilities which have
been specifically established to take advantage of gas as fuel or feedstock.
Obviously, developing a market for natural gas requires time and sizeable
investments; however, the returns are often attractive as there is generally a
wide spread between the full cost of gas development and its value as a fuel
or feedstock replacement. The problems are compounded in the case of
associated gas (i.e. gas produced together with crude oil) as, unless there is
a market for it, usually, there is no alternative other than flaring it.
4.02     Gas is a minor commercial energy source in India at present, with a
production in 1981/82 of approximately 3,840 MMCM (3.1 million t.o.e.) of
which approximately 40% was flared because of the absence of either a
distribution network or the small and dispersed nature of the supply. Until
recently, the systematic development of a market for the economic utilization
of natural gas was given low priority as the emphasis was to accelerate
India's exploration and oil development activities to reduce the country's
dependence on costly crude oil imports. However following the rapidly
increasing production of Bombay High crude and its associated gas (in 1981/82,
Bombay High accounted for 35% of gas production), and the discovery offshore
Bombay of sizeable free gas reserves (particularly the South Bassein field),
the Government has recognized that gas is a significant resource whose
utilization can substitute for either fertilizer imports (by using gas as a
feedstock for domestic manufacturing) or oil products (particularly LPG,
naphtha and fuel oil) presently imported (whether in the form of crude oil or
as products); as a result, increasing attention is being given to the optimal
use of natural gas.
Current Pattern of Gas Production/Utilization
4.03     At present, gas is produced in Assam (both by OIL and ONGC), Gujarat
(ONGC) and in the Bombay High field; 1981/82 production and consumption
figures are as follows (MMCM):

4.04     Assam, located in the very northeastern part of India is a province
with limited development potential because of (i) its remoteness from the
major population and industrial centers of India; (ii) limited availability of
land suitable for agriculture; and (iii) harsh climatic conditions
(particularly heavy rainfalls 6 months out of 12). Historically, associated
gas production began in Assam, but significant quantities of gas had to be
flared (44% of the gas produced in 1981/82, as shown above) because many of
the oilfields are widely dispersed and individually have small associated gas
production, while the gas markets are located at considerable distances,
making the use of the gas uneconomic. Major consumers of gas in Assam today
are the Assam Electricity Board (gas turbines for power generation), the tea



- 31 -
estates, the Namrup fertilizer plant (currently being expanded), and a
refinery. OIL is currently constructing an LPG recovery plant in Assam. It
is estimated that, by 1985/86, consumers would be able to absorb 4 MMCMD
against a production of 6.4 MMCMD. Therefore, notwithstanding current efforts
to develop a market for associated gas in Assam, gas will continue to be
flared in the foreseeable future.
4.05     The situation is dramatically different in Gujarat, which is an
important industrial state. Production of crude oil began in the early 1960's
and within a few years, a market was developed, capable of absorbing virtually
the full production of associated gas. ONGC therefore contracted for gas
sales equivalent to 2.18 MMCMD against a production capability of 2.25 MMCMD.
Additionally, ONGC has committed supplies of 0.25 MMCMD which it intends to
produce by (i) developing small free gas fields; (ii) recovering associated
gas from certain isolated oil fields and laying new pipelines; and (iii)
compressing low pressure gas currently flared. Nevertheless, it remains that
Gujarat is considered a "mature" producing area; production of the main
reservoir (Ankleshwar) is declining and, ONGC's oil and gas production in
Southern Gujarat, unless new discoveries are made, is on a downward trend.
4.06     Approximately 55% of the gas sold in Gujarat is used for fertilizer
production by two fertilizer plants, 22% for power generation, 20% for five
industrial users (mostly as industrial fuel), and the balance for domestic
consumption in Baroda. Consumption of natural gas in Gujarat could exceed by
a considera le margin the present levels if additional quantities were made
available._
4.07     At Bombay High, which went into commercial production in May 1976,
associated gas was initially flared. Following the completion of the 4.5
MMCMD gas processing and compression facilities as well as pipeline from that
field to the Uran terminal (South of Bombay) in mid-1978, gas utilization rose
rapidly from 0.6 MMCND in 1978/79 to 2.7 MMCMD in 1982/83. A second
associated gas processing and compression facility, with a capacity of 5 MICMD
will be installed shortly and completed in 1984/85 since associated gas
production will reach about 7 MMCMD in 1983/84 and about 9.4 MMCMD by 1988/89.
4.08     At present there are three users for Bombay High gas:  (i) the Tata
Electric Company LTD (TEC) plant at Trombay (north of Bombay); (ii) the RCF
fertilizer plant at Trombay; and (iii) the gas turbines of the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board (MSEP) near Uran. TEC operates a power plant
presently consisting of four units with a combined capacity of 337.5 MW of
which 275 MW can also use natural gas as fuel. However the actual quantities
of natural gas that can be absorbed also depend on contractual obligations of
TEC with the two refineries in Bombay to acquire a fuel oil residue (low
sulfur heavy.stock or LSHS) for which there is no alternative use at
present.!' An additional 500 MW unit is to be installed in early 1983, whose
1/ The State of Gujarat is the second largest user of oil products after
Maharashtra, accounting for instance for 20% of fuel oil and 20% of the
naphtha consumption in India.
2/ Under the Refineries Conversion Project (Loan 2123-IN of April 1982),
catalytic cracking facilities are to be installed in a Bombay refinery by mid-
1984, which will help resolve the problems of LSHS surplus.



- 32 -
boilers will also operate on coal, LSHS or natural gas.l/ By then, TEC will
be able to absorb as much as 3 MMCMD of natural gas.
4.09     The RCF fertilizer complex at Trombay, consists of 4 units producing
essentially ammonia (1,250 tpd), methanol (130 tpd) and phosphate fertilizers.
The older units switched in 1978 from naphtha to natural gas as feedstock,
while the newer ones-were designed to use gas as feedstock. Fuel requirements
are met largely by natural gas, although fuel oil or LSHS can also be used.
RCF Trombay can use 1.82 MMCMD of gas as feedstock and up to 0.45 MMCMD of gas
as fuel.
4.10     MSEB commissioned in the first half of 1982 four 60-MW gas turbines,
which can also operate on diesel oil. These were connected by a 7-km gas
pipeline to Uran in June 1982. MSEB intends to use the turbines to meet the
base load as long as power shortages continue in Maharashtra. Subsequently,
they will be used for peaking only. Another set of four 60-MW units is
currently under consideration by GOI. MSEB can currently use up to 1.8 MMCMD
of natural gas.
4.11     In recent years, large quantities of Bombay High associated gas were
flared on account of: (i) a significantly higher gas production than
anticipated initially due to the acceleratred development program and higher
than expected gas/oil ratios2/; (ii) the requirement for TEC to use LSHS
surpluses as fuel, as explained in para. 4.08 above; and (iii) the delay in
the build-up of the market for gas. However, the situation is expected to
change dramatically in the next three years, with the commissioning of
additional gas-based industries.
Current Policy for Gas Utilization
4.12     In March 1979, the Ministry of Petroleum established a Working Group
to "recommend the most economic and optimum utilization of offshore gas
keeping in view the production program of crude oil/associated gas and free
gas." That Working Group proceeded on the assumption that the offshore gas
production potential was 21-27 MMCMD starting in 1982/83. The Working Group
recommended that: (i) for the C3/C4 fraction, conversion to LPG would be the
optimum use as LPG was a convenient substitute for kerosene; (ii) for the
C2/C3 fraction, its use as a petrochemical feedstock for ethylene and
propylene production (where it substitutes naphtha) would be optimal; and
1/ It is financed in part under Loan 1549-IN, of April 1978.
2/ For instance in 1980, production of gas was forecast to be 652.1 MMCM in
1981/82. In 1981, the forecast for the same year was 617 MMCM against an
actual of 1,344 MMCM. For 1984/85, the old and current forecasts are as
follows:
Year Made                1984/85 Forecast
(MMCM)
1980                          878
1981                        1,348
1982                        3,770



- 33 -
(iii) for the Cl (or lean gas) fraction, the optimal use would be as a
fertilizer feedstock; alternative utilizations of the Cl fraction for
industrial uses were discarded on various grounds (except for sponge iron
where it was recommended that minor quantities of gas be considered for the
reduction process). Use of the Cl fraction for power generation was turned
down in view of the.economic advantage of coal. Furthermore, the Working
Group recommended that no free gas be injected in the Bombay High-Uran gas
pipeline in order to avoid diluting that gas (which is richer in C3/C4).
4.13     As a result, the Working Group recommended the establishment of J new
1,350-tpd ammonia units in addition to the 4 under construction (two at Thal
in Maharahstra, South of Bombay, and two at Haziral! in Gujarat). The
locations and proposed commissioning dates for the new plants are the states
of Madhya Pradesh - 1986/87; Rajasthan - 1987/88; and Uttar Pradesh - two
plants in 1987/88 and another two in 1988/89. With the plants currently under
construction and the proposed six new plants, Nitrogen fertilizer production
in India is forecast to reach about 4.6 million tons of Nitrogen in 1984/85,
and 5.8 million tons in 1989/90 and onwards. However, Nitrogen fertilizer
demand is still expected to exceed production by about 0.9 million tons of
Nitrogen in 1984/85, 1.9 million tons in 1989/90 and 4.5 million tons in
1994/95. Thus, out of a total anticipated gas production capability of 21-27
MMCMD, 19 MMCMD were recommended to be used for fertilizer production; with
respect to the balance of gas, detailed feasibility studies were recommended.
As a result use of natural gas, even on an interim basis for replacement of
liquid hydrocarbons in the vicinity of the pipeline was ruled out.
4.14     Over the past two years, GOI progressively realized that those
recommendations had to be re-examined on the following grounds: (i) following
additional offshore discoveries, the production potential of free gas has
increased to 25-30 MMCMD over 20 years; (ii) associated gas production
forecast had increased from 7 MMCMD to about 10 MMCMD over 1984/85-1990/91;
(iii.) the realization that the utilization of gas for liquid hydrocarbons
replacement was an attractive proposition even though the potential demand
might not be as large as that for fertilizer feedstock.2/ As a result, in
October 1981, the Ministry of Petroleum, established a new task force with
detailed terms of reference which called for inter alia: (i) optimization of
the pipeline from Hazira in Gujarat to UP taking into account the feasibility
of extracting LPG on different locations on the pipeline route (which will
affect the size of the pipeline); (ii) examining the feasibility of providing
lean gas to cities such as Bombay, Ahmedhabad, Baroda and Surat (the largest
cities on the pipeline route) for domestic consumption; (iii) the feasibility
/  The Hazira fertilizer plant is being financed in part through Cr. 1125-IN
of March 1981,
2/ In 1980/81, fuel oil consumption in India was 7.4 million tons compared to
a production of only 6.1 million tons. By 1990/91 the annual deficit is
expected to double to 2.6 million tons (equivalent to 2.9 billion cubic meters
or almost 8 MMCMD of gas) as consumption increases to about 10.2 million
tons. About 57% of the expected fuel oil demand and 70% of the deficit in
1990/91 will be in the west and the northwest regions, where South Bassein gas
can be used as fuel oil substitute.

of establishing additional fertilizer plants based on offshore gas, taking
into account alternative feedstock possibilities; and (iv) improving the
utilization of associated gas from Assam and Gujarat taking into account the
long-term potential of the oil fields. The task force appointed consultants
to execute specific studies, and is expected to complete its various
assignments by April 1983.
The Market for South Bassein Gas
4.15     The task force has already completed a conceptual exercise aimed at
identifying the potential market for South Bassein gas both in Maharashtra
(South Bassein gas could be injected into the existing gas pipeline from
Bombay High to Uran) and in Gujarat and inland states. This forecast is not
based on an exhaustive review of all the opportunities of gas utilization; it
is based on the potential gas requirements of existing plants and plants under
construction and limited utilization of gas in selected sectors where it
appears a priori attractive to replace liquid hydrocarbons with natural gas.
In Maharashtra, the main consumers for Bombay High and South Bassein gas would
be as follows:
a.   Feedstock
-   the RCF-Trombay fertilizer complex already in operation;
-   the Thal fertilizer complex to be commissioned in July 1984
(first unit) and December 1984 (second unit);
-   the Deepak Fertilizers and Petroch l7icals Corporation Limited
272-tpd ammonia plant near Trombay- ; and
-   the Union Carbide petrochemical complex near Bombay.
b.   Liquid Hydrocarbons Replacement
-   the replacement of LSHS, fuel oil or diesel oil in boilers of
RCF, in the refineries, in the petrochemical complex, and in the
gas turbines; and
-   the introduction of lean gas to the existing town gas supply in
Bombay City, and in a new system to be established in Greater
Bombay. The existing system has a limited capacity (about
180,000 CMD), and is coal based (with adverse implications on the
environment). Presently, the system supplies 30,000 consumers,
while another 40,000 are on the waiting list (and potential users
cannot any longer be added to the waiting list). It is estimated
that for this system, within three years, and on the basis of
1/ This firm is the beneficiary of an IFC loan and equity investment
(Investment 493-IN of November 1979).



- 35 -
only the potential consumers at a distance of less than 6 km from
the existing pipeline grid, sales could reach 1.3 MMCMD of which
0.8 MMCMD would be for textile mills currently using fuel oil and
LSHS.
c.   Coal Replacement
-   This category includes the provisions of gas for power generation
at the TEC plant and as boiler fuel for the Thal fertilizer
plant.
4.16     In Gujarat, the main consumers would be:
a.   Feedstock
-   The Hazira fertilizer plant together with six future fertilizer
plants to be commissioned over 1986/87-1988/89 (para. 4.13).
Each 1,350-tpd ammonia/urea plant will have a peak requirement of
about 1.5 MMCMD of gas as feedstock and about 0.5 MMCMD as boiler
fuel.
-   Feedstock requirements of enterprises located near the proposed
inland pipeline route and who are presently using naphtha
feedstock.
b.   Hydrocarbon Replacement
-   The boiler requirements of the six future fertilizer plants;
-   The shortfall in the supplies of Ankleshwar gas to meet the
existing and future requirements of the existing ONGC grid (para.
4.05).
-   Fuel requirements of enterprises located near the proposed inland
pipeline route and who are presently using fuel oil or LSHS.
c.   Coal Replacement
-   The boiler requirements of the Hazira fertilizer plant.
4.17     It is anticipated that both in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the LPG and
C2/C3 fractions would be extracted before supplying the lean gas to
consumers. ONGC already operates a 4-MMCMD LPG plant at Uran whose capacity
is being doubled for commissioning in 1984/85. A third LPG plant will be
required around 1986/87. With regard to Hazira, ONGC has obtained Government
approval for that LPG extraction plant. In view of the high benefits of LPG
extraction, confirmation was obtained during negotiations that this plant will
be commissioned in 1985/86. The C2/C3 fraction will only be extracted when
new petrochemical complexes are commissioned; both the Gujarat and the
Maharashtra C2/C3 complex are due for commissioning in 1988/89.
4.18     The demand for South Bassein lean gas has been estimated by first
establishing the demand in Maharashtra and in Gujarat for fertilizer
feedstock, for liquid hydrocarbon (fuel) replacement and for limited cases of



- 36 -
coal replacement respectively. The feedstock requirements of the six proposed
fertilizer plants in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh were then
added to arrive at the total feedstock requirement. The resulting demand
forecast is shown in Annex 4.1. A forecast of the associated gas production
from Bombay High and nearby offshore fields as well as the proposed South
Bassein development program was then prepared (Annex 4.2). The lean
associated gas production is then assumed to be allocated first for feedstock
requirements and any surplus to liquid hydrocarbon and then coal replacement
respectively, reflecting the priorities for gas utilization. The balance of
the feedstock, liquid hydrocarbons and coal replacement demands not met by the
lean associated gas supply is then the market for the South Bassein lean
gas. This market is shown below which indicates a lean gas feedstock market
developing in the mid-1980s but increasing rapidly as associated gas
production peaks in 1988/89 and declines thereafter. As the table below
indicates, the potential lean gas requirements for feedstock will exceed the
production capability of the proposed Project by 1988/89 and that liquid
hydrocarbon replacement alone could utilize the entire Project production.
The combined feedstock and liquid hydrocarbon replacement requirements exceed
the Project capacity the year production starts in 1985/86 and the production
capacity of the full development program (i.e, 20 MMCMD) by 1989/90. In the
third case, (i.e., including some coal replacement) the gas requirement would
clearly exceed the full development production of gas at all times.

4.19     Although the Government's task force is to complete its studies only
in April 1983 (para. 4.14), GOI has apparently decided that free gas would,
under normal circumstances, be used essentially as feedstock and for liquid
hydrocarbons replacement. This policy appears reasonable at present. During



- 37 -
negotiations GOI confirmed its preliminary plans in relation to gas
utilization and that the Bank will have the opportunity to review and comment
on the recommendations of the task force when its report on gas utilization is
completed. As the volume of gas reserves are expected to increase in the
coming years, the market for gas will therefore have to be reviewed from time
to time. Agreement was reached with the Government tnat until March 1988, Lt
will update and furnish to the Bank the gas production and utilization
forecasts affecting the South Bassein and Bombay High gas whenever: (i) a
major development of a gas project is envisaged; or (ii) significant changes
in gas production from operating fields are expected; or (iii) signifi-ast
changes in either the mix of gas users or the total gas consumption becomes
evident.
Economic Rate of Return
4.20     The main assumptions used in the economic analyses are shown in
Annex 4.3. The analyses are done for, the Project (5 MMCMD production) as well
as the full development program (20 MMCMD production). All economic costs and
benefits are expressed in constant end-1982 prices. For the case of the full
development program, the economic capital costs include the Project costs
(excluding custom duties and taxes), plus the additional investments for the
four LPG and the two C2/C3 extraction plants, three more production platforms,
one more process platform, as well as the 1,000-km inland pipeline from Hazira
to Uttar Pradesh.
4.21     The economic benefits were taken to be the savings in imports
attributable to the Project. For the Base Case, the Project's gas production
is assumed to be entirely used for hydrocarbon replacement (i.e., fuel oil
substitute) which would give a conservative rate of return. The case where
the gas is used both as feedstock and fuel oil substitute according to the
expected demand mix is evaluated in the sensitively analysis. With regard to
feedstock for fertilizers, the netback value for the gas was estimated (Annex
4.4).l/ With regard to hydrocarbon replacement and LPG produced through the
TiW-ject, the values for the gas were estimated on the basis of its closest
substitute. The NGL fraction was valued on the basis of its best opportunity
use (i.e. naphtha). On the above basis, the gas values are as follows:
1/       In case there is a choice of either utilizing the gas as fuel at year
t or as feedstock x years later, then the netback value (US$192 per
1,000 Nm3) should be discounted at the opportunity cost of capital
for x years and the discounted value compared to the fuel oil
equivalent price (US$160 per 1,000 Nm3). If the discounted netback
value is less than the fuel oil equivalent price, then it is more
economic to use the gas as fuel in   year t than as feedstock in year
t + x. In this particular case, if the opportunity cost of capital
is at least 10%, then it would be more economic to use the gas as
fuel at any year t if the alternative use as feedstock will be at
least 2 years later.  In the sensitivity analysis, part of the Cl gas
fraction is valued at the netback value and part at the fuel oil
replacement value.

expected that domestic LPG will replace kerosene imports.
In view of the low demand for gasoline in India, the anticipated NGL from
the Project is expected to be blended with naphtha.
4.22     For the Base Case, these prices are kept constant throughout the
economic life of the investments. A sensitivity analysis was also performed
assuming energy prices will increase in real terms by 2% to 3% per year
between 1984/85 through 1994/95 and 1% per year thereafter, after initially
falling by 4% between 1982/83 and 1983/84. The Base Case rate of return
calculations are shown in Annex 4.5 (the Project) and Annex 4.6 (the Program)
while the sensitivity analyses are shown in Annex 4.7.

Project is 38% and that of the full program is 49%. The sensitivity tests are

a!  In the case of the Project only, the NGL recovered at the process platform
and at the pipeline terminal as well as the rich gas (i.e, before the
C2/C3 and LPG are extracted) at the Hazira terminal are the products. The
rich gas is priced as Cl fuel (US$160 per 1,000 Nm3 in the base case).
b/  See Annex 4.7 for details.



- 39 -
As the above table indicates, the rate of return is higher when gas is used as
feedstock (using the fertilizer netback value) but would still be very
satisfactory even if all the gas were used for fuel oil replacement only
(i.e., base case). Thus, the economics of the Project would still be
acceptable even if the proposed six new fertilizer plants are delayed or
cancelled. The rate of return is reasonable for this type of project and
development program. In the worst alternative, the rate of return is still an
acceptable 21 % for the Project and 26% for the full program. The high rate
of return is explained by the relatively low production cost of rich gas
(about US$95/MCM or US$2.54/MCF at 12% discount rate for the Project) when
compared to its economic value (plus the value of the NGL recovered with the
gas) and the fact that all the past exploration costs of the field are
considered as "sunk costs."
4.24     The rates of return above understate the benefits of gas utilization,
particularly as the offshore natural gas is virtually free of pollutants (in
particular sulfur), so that replacing fuel oil by gas would have a significant
environmental benefit particularly in the Greater Bombay area.
Project Risks
4.25     The risks facing this Project fall essentially into three
categories: (i) reservoirs may not live up to the expectations; (ii)
technical difficulties may affect the timely implementation of the project;
and (iii) the development of the gas distribution system beyond Hazira may be
delayed cutting off a large portion of the gas market for some time (applies
only to the full development program). Regarding the reservoir, reserves have
been evaluated, as explained in para. 3.06, independently by DeGolyer and
McNaughton (US), McCord and Associates (US) and ONGC who broadly reached
similar conclusions. Furthermore, twelve wells have been drilled on the
structure, which is in excess of what industry practice would normally
require. Therefore, while this risk cannot be discounted entirely, it has
been largely minimized.
4.26     The risk of technical difficulties either in drilling or in
connection with the construction of platforms and the laying of the pipeline
might cause a delay and cost overruns. However, (i) ONGC, while not having
previous experience in offshore free gas fields, has already gained
considerable expertise in offshore construction and offshore oil and gas
pipelines, and has performed generally well in the first two loans for Bombay
High Development; (ii) unlike offshore crude oil development where ONGC now
relies to a great extent on local consultants, foreign consultants have been
hired both for the offshore platforms and the offshore pipelines; and (iii)
all facilities are expected to be constructed and installed by experienced
contractors supervised by ONGC with the assistance of qualified consultants.
4.27     With regard to the development of the market for gas, the main risk
lies with a delay in the installation of the 1,000-km inland pipeline and/or
postponement or cancellation of the plans to construct the six fertilizers
plants inland. This risk does not however apply to the Project which has a
small production capacity that could be easily absorbed by the markets around
Bombay and the Hazira terminal. But even in the case of the full development
program, the market risk is considered low in view of the importance of these
plants to the Indian economy. Nonetheless, even if the gas is used mostly for
liquid hydrocarbons replacement, the rate of return remains satisfactory.



- 40 -
4.28     Since the main risks of the project have been recognized early, and
satisfactory precautions have been taken to minimize these, the Project is
highly justified, as it will provide significant savings to the economy by
reducing both fertilizer and crude oil imports.
V. THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMISSION (ONGC)
General
5.01     The Oil and Natural Gas Commission is a Government-owned statutory
body created in 1959 by an act of Parliament to "plan, promote and implement
the development of petroleum resources and the production and sale of
petroleum products produced by it." ONGC's statutes provide that it is a
corporate body with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property. ONGC also
has authority to contract and borrow. The Commission consists of a Chairman
and not less than two, but not more than eight, Members appointed by the
Government for a period of five years.
5.02     At present, the Commission consists of the Chairman, six full-time
Members (Finance, Materials, Personnel, Exploration, Offshore and Onshore) and
two part-time Members (representing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
of Petroleum. All decisions of the Commission must be approved by a majority
of the Members. ONGC owns Hydrocarbons India Ltd, a subsidiary which is
responsible for the Commission's ventures abroad (Iran).
Organization and Management
5.03     The Commission acts very much as an operating board of directors and
is responsible for setting ONGC's policies. Its plans and budgets have to be
approved by the Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry
of Petroleum, before they are sanctioned by Parliament. Over time, the
Commission has evolved into a full-fledged oil company. In many areas, ONGC
has developed an adequate in-house capability. However, aware of the rapid
technological progress in oil exploration and petroleum engineering, ONGC
continues to use foreign consultants when the in-house capability is
insufficient or to verify critical results obtained in-house. ONGC has
followed a consistent policy of ensuring that techniques developed in India
reflect the latest technology available worldwide and are properly applied.
5.04     The main administrative and financial functions (planning,
procurement and stores, accounting, personnel, computer activities, etc.) are
centralized in the corporate headquarters at Dehra Dun, along with the main
research and development and training facilities. Operational staff are
divided among three regional offices (Central, Western and Eastern Regions)
for onshore operations and the Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) for offshore
operations. Prior to 1974 most of the operational decisions were taken
centrally from Dehra Dun and the Regional Managers had little, if any,
operational authority. In recent years, the decision-making process has been
decentralized to the regions, which now have operational responsibility and
the authority to commit funds within their approved budget. ONGC's
Organization Chart appears at Annex 5.1.
5.05     The Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) is in charge of offshore
exploration and development. Headed by the Member (Offshore), BOP has been
the focus of intense activity over the past seven years with the



- 41 -
implementation of the successive phases of the Bombay High development and the
substantial increase in offshore exploration activity. The increase in its
staff has been particularly rapid: from 20 in 1974 to 600 in 1977 to 2,800 at
present. The staff is highly motivated by the importance of the offshore
projects to the Indian economy. Six General Managers report to the Member
(Offshore): Engineering and Planning; Construction; Operations; Production;
Exploration; and Materials. Also three Directors report to him (two for
Finance, and one for Personnel and Administration). In addition, a ManagemenL
Services Group assists the Member in project planning and monitoring as well
as in special duties (i.e. safety and environment). This recent organization
structure reflects the increasing scope and complexity of assignments given :o
BOP; it also aims for greater delegation of authority, as well as a more
equitable distribution of work loads, hence for instance the appointment of
two General Managers in charge of offshore development activities and two
Finance Directors to assist respectively in operations and construction.
BOP's organization chart appears at Annex 5.2. While major policy decisions
are still being taken at Dehra Dun and New Delhi, BOP has in recent years been
delegated sufficient powers to be able to run the offshore program effectively
and efficiently.
Staffing and Training
5.06     As of April 1, 1982, ONGC had an overall staff of approximately
29,500, including 5,500 technical officers (engineers, geologists,
geophysicists, etc.). ONGC gives strong emphasis to the training of
personnel, particularly in its offshore operations. Personnel are given
training by various institutions operating in India (management, finance, data
processing, geology) and abroad (oil companies, laboratories, contractors'
facilities), in addition to a wide array of courses and seminars given in-
house (ranging from highly technical subjects to "organizational
effectiveness" for senior staff). Particularly in the oil industry, where
techniquses are evolving rapidly, courses and seminars are important to keep
the staff abreast of the latest developments.
Management Information Systems
5.07     ONGC has developed in recent years adequate management information
systems; particularly in the case of BOP, a comprehensive monthly report is
prepared, which highlights to management the status of the different
activities and enables the Commission to take corrective actions whenever the
need arises. During the implementation of the first two Bombay High projects,
ONGC has provided the Bank, on a timely basis, quarterly technical progress
reports and, on a semi-annual basis, financial and statistical reports.
During negotiations, agreement was obtained that ONGC will continue to provide
the Bank with periodic progress and semi-annual unaudited financial reports
during project implementation, and a Project Completion Report when the
Project is completed. These periodic reports are to be submitted within 45
days after the end of the period covered.
Accounts and Audit
5.08     Each project unit has a Finance and Accounts Section reporting to the
Project Manager and to the Member (Finance) at ONGC's headquarters. The
Internal Audit Section is under the Member, Finance, in Dehra Dun, and
performs satisfactorily.  ONGC's accounts are audited by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, which is acceptable to the Bank. While ONGC's accounts are



- 42 -
generally available four months after the end of the fiscal year at the
latest, GOI rules and regulations provide that ONGC's audited accounts cannot
be made public before they have been approved by Parliament. During
negotiations, agreement was be obtained that the Commission's audited accounts
will be submitted to the Bank not later than twelve months after the end of
the fiscal year.
Insurance
5.09     ONGC has adequate insurance coverage for its existing offshore
installation, equipment, vessels, etc., with several insurance companies in
India which are reinsured in the international market. Insuring follows the
international practice, whereby designs are certified by independent
agencies. ONGC self-insures onshore facilities, which is reasonable given the
scope and extent of its onshore activites. ONGC's insurance coverage for its
existing facilities is satisfactory. Under the proposed Project, agreement
was reached that insurance coverage satisfactory to the Bank will be obtained
for the offshore facilities included in the project scope.
ONGC's Investment Program (1982/1983 - 1987/88)
5.10     ONGC is now in the third year of the 1980/81 - 1984/85 Plan.  The
Plan which was revised in August 1981, now provides for expenditures of
approximately Rs 97 billion (US$10.8 billion) in current prices against the
initial estimate of Rs 40 billion (US$4.4 billion) for the same period. This
more than doubling of expenditure reflects the introduction, over the past two
years, of the accelerated program for development of the Bombay High field and
its neighboring structures as well as the accelerated exploration program.
5.11     The 1982/83 - 1987/88 investment program is based on ONGC's revised
five-year Plan, that was submitted in August 1981, and a ten year (1980/81-
1989-90) Core Plan covering exploration and development approved in principle
by the Government in July 1982; it is reviewed in detail in Annex 5.3.
Proposed investments over 1982/83 - 1985/86 amount to Rs 109.6 billion
(US$12.2 billion) averaging nearly Rs 27 billion (US$3 billion) per year. The
proposed 1982/83 - 1985/86 investment plan can be summarized as follows:

Total                 109.6            12.2         100
a/  Common items have been allocated 75% to development and 25% to
exploration. The Bombay High development program will account for 28%,
the South Bassein development program 19% and the Krishna-Godavari
exploration project 5% respectively, of the total investment program
during this period.
5.12     The objective of the current investment program is to increase ONGC's
production of oil from 13.1 million tons in 1981/82 to 46.5 million tons in
1989/90.1/ Meeting this objective requires a considerable exploration effort
as well as maximum development and optimum operating efficiency of all known
field reserves. Bombay High currently contributes over 60% of oil and gas
production in India and most of the planned production increases will result
from further development of this province. By 1984/85, Bombay High will have
reached maximum production, and by about 1989/90 production will start
declining as the reservoir is depleted. In the absence of new major
discoveries, the reserves/production ratio will decline from about 24 years at
present to only 15 years in 1987. This emphasizes the importance of making
large new discoveries in the coming years and this is the justification for
the ambitious exploration program representing about 30% of total investment
over the period.
5.13     The ONGC exploration strategy is to balance the program between areas
of lower risk and low potential with areas of higher risk but with greater
potential for discovering large new reserves. During the 1982/83 - 1985/86
period, about half of the exploration investment will be in producing areas in
Assam, Gujarat and Bombay High which in the near term hold promise of modest
but more certain additions to reserves. In addition, ONGC will continue the
ongoing evaluation of the Krishna-Godavari delta which is the most promising
frontier area in India today and which in the medium term could contribute
major additions to petroleum reserves.
1/ The Plan therefore assumes a certain rate of discovery as ONGC's current
recoverable reserves can only sustain a production rate of 30 million tpy of
crude oil. The investment figures above, however, do not include provisions
for the development of future discoveries.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
6.01     ONGC's financial and accounting systems, while governed by GOI
regulations, are gradually becoming similar to those of a commercial oil
company. Key financial parameters (selling prices, investment programs) are
decided upon by GOI, which also arranges all the external financing
requirements of ONGC. Within this framework, ONGC operates in a financially
responsible fashion. Past policies have enabled ONGC to perform
satisfactorily so far, and it is expected that this will continue in the
future.
Past Performance
6.02     ONGC's audited Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Sources and
Applications of Funds Statements over 1978/79 - 1981/82 as well as the
forecasts up to 1987/88 appear in Annex 6.1. The assumptions for the
financial forecasts are in Annex 6.2. ONGC's Income Statements over the past
four years can be summarized as follows:

a/ Unaudited results.
b/ At 6% of Government Equity.
As the above table indicates, ONGC has experienced a steady growth in its
activities, primarily because of the expanding offshore production. The
results for 1980/81 are disappointing, due to the lengthy stoppage of
production in Assam (equivalent to 1.3 million tons of crude oil or about
Rs400 million of foregone revenues) on account of political disturbances.
Production in Assam has now returned to normal. The 1981/82 results reflect
both increases in oil production and selling prices (para 6.05).



- 45 -
6.03     Over the 1978/79 - 1981/82 period, ONGCts investments amounted to Rs
17.6 billion (US$2.0 billion) of which Rs 9.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) or 55%
was financed from internal cash generation.
6.04     The Balance Sheet, as of March 31, 1982, can be summarized as
follows:

Total                    18,397             2,044         100
As the above table indicates, ONGC is in a sound financial position with a
Debt/Equity ratio of 50:50, and a current ratio of 1.2. Over the past three
years, ONGC has obtained Rs 105 million (US$11.7 million) in equity contri-
butions from GOI. Most of the balance of its external financing requirements
was obtained from GOI in the form of long-term loans (including the IBRD Loan
1473-IN and Loan 1925-IN onlent by GOI to ONGC) and from the Oil Industry
Development Board (OIDB). Its debt coverage ratio is high (7.9 in 1981/82).
6.05     The prices at which ONGC sells crude oil and natural gas to refining
companies and gas consuming industries are regulated by GOI. Prices to ONGC
were raised significantly in July 1981, and are currently as follows:
Oil and Gas Prices (Inclusive of Taxes)
Rs/ton               US$/Bbl
Crude Oil                        1,182                17.28
Rs/1000 Nm3          US$/thousand SCF
Natural Gas        Offshore       500-2,500             1.49-7.44
Onshore        150-300              0.45-0.89
The price of crude oil of Rs 1,182/ton includes Rs 161/ton (US$2.35/Bbl) of
cess and royalties. Pipeline tolling fees are additional. While the domestic
crude oil price is low when compared to international prices, ONGC's netback
(i.e. net profits after taxes and royalties) was about US$4 per barrel of oil
or oil equivalent of gas in 1981/82 and is in line with the average for
western international oil companies. ONGC's netback is also expected to
increase to about US$5 per barrel by 1984/85 at the present level of domestic
prices provided anticipated increases in oil and gas production are
realized. Ultimate selling prices of petroleum products in India (para. 2.07)



- 46 -
are above import-parity so that the price obtained by ONGC should be
considered as a transfer price within the public sector, with the difference
accruing to GOI as current revenues.
6.06     The price of offshore gas is based on its intended use, whether as
feedstock or as fuel, and on the domestic price of the alternative feedstock
or fuel the gas is replacing. In general, the price of gas is lower when it
is used as feedstock than as fuel reflecting GOI's policy of pricing oil
products at a lower price when they are used as fertilizer feedstocks. It is
also priced lower when substituting for cheaper fuels (e.g. coal) compared to
the price when gas substitutes for more expensive fuels (e.g. fuel oil). On
average, ONGC receives about Rs 1,380/1000 Nm3 (US$4.11/1000 SCF) for offshore
gas, which is well above the cost of production, and in line with its economic
value (fuel oil equivalent). Thus, the average level of gas prices is
currently satisfactory, but the price structure may need revisions as the
number and type of consumers change with expanding supplies. This issue will
be carefully monitored during Project supervision.
6.07     In the case of the onshore gas in Assam, the price is low, on average
only about Rs 150/1000 Nm3, reflecting the surplus of associated gas which is
being flared due to the small size of the market. In the case of the onshore
gas in Gujarat, where the demand for gas has already exceeded the supply, the
average price of the gas (about Rs 300/1000 Nm3) is heavily influenced by the
low price stipulated in old long-term contracts. As these contracts are
renewed or renegotiated (which ONGC is trying to do), prices are being
increased with the ultimate objective of applying the same principles as those
for offshore gas.  Taking into account the relatively small quantities of
onshore gas, these revisions are expected to have a minimum impact on ONGC's
overall finances.
Financial Analysis of the Project and the
South Bassein Development Program
6.08     The proposed project, as a "stand-alone" investment with a capacity
of 5 MMCMD of gas, and no additional investments to raise production to 20
MMCMD (para. 4.20) has a financial rate of return of about 19% after taxes
(Annex 6.3), and a payback period of about 7 years (including the construction
period), assuming two-thirds of the gas will be sold as feedstock and the rest
as fuel. The return is sensitive to the sales mix between feedstock and fuel
because of the large differential in the financial prices of gas when used as
feedstock (Rs 1.241 per cubic meter) and as fuel (Rs 2.461 per cubic meter).
When all the project's gas output is sold as feedstock, then the return drops
to about 14% but is still satisfactory. A 20% increase in capital cost or a
one-year delay will result in a return of 16% or 17%, respectively. The South
Bassein full development program (i.e. including additional investments to
raise future gas production to 20 MMCMD), on the other hand, has an after-tax
return of about 26% (Annex 6.4) and a payback period of about 6 years. This
comparatively higher return is due to the extraction of the higher-valued gas
fractions (i.e. C2/C3 and LPG) for sale, the lower unit operating cost due to
economies of scale, and the full utilization of the offshore pipeline
capacity. The sensitivity analyses are shown in Annex 6.5. The additional
investments to fully develop the South Bassein gas field will stretch until
1987/88 and the full program is therefore not expected to generate positive
cash flows until that year in spite of the high financial return. It is
therefore preferable that loans with relatively long grace periods be utilized
for the Project and the program to the maximum extent possible. On the other

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01     The Government confirmed the following during negotiations:
(a) the arrangements for a provisional supply of gas to Hazira
(para. 3.19);
(b) its plans regarding gas utilization (para. 4.19); and
(c) the timetable for the construction of the 6 inland fertilizer
plants (para. 4.19).
7.02     During negotiations, agreement was also obtained from GOI that:
(a) it will provide ONGC or cause ONGC to be provided with
sufficient funds to meet ONGC's financial requirements for the
Project, and onlend the Bank funds to ONGC on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 3.24 and 3.25);
(b) until March 1988 it will update as required, and provide to the
Bank, the gas production/demand forecasts and give the Bank a
reasonable opportunity to comment on it (para. 4.19); and
(c) it will, from time to time, carry out a review of the prices of
crude oil and natural gas to ONGC, which will determine the
level of prices required to meet its operating expenses and earn
a rate of return on its assets employed in operations sufficient
to meet its debt-service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital, and finance a substantial portion of its proposed
capital investments (para. 6.09);
7.03     During negotiations, the following confirmations and agreements were
obtained from ONGC:
(a) it will use consultants whose qualifications, experience and
terms of reference are satisfactory to the Bank to assist
in design - engineering, preparation of bidding documents and
supervision of construction of the project (para 3.14);
(b) ONGC will take precautions in line with industry practices to
protect workers and the environment during the installation and
operations of the offshore project facilities (para. 3.31);
(c) the LPG plant at Hazira will be commissioned by 1985/86 (para.
4.17);
(d) periodic progress and financial reports will be submitted to the
Bank during Project implementation (para. 5.07);
(e) ONGC's audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank not later
than twelve months after the end of the fiscal year (para.
5.08);
(f)  ONGC will obtain satisfactory insurance coverage for the
offshore facilities included in the Project (para. 5.09); and



- 50 -
(g) ONGC will submit each year to GOI a report containing an
analysis of the financial situation of ONGC including a
financial evaluation of the South Bassein Project and of any
subsequent developments, which will indicate the level of prices
which would be required by ONGC to earn a DCF return after taxes
of at least 15% for the Project and any such subsequent major
developments (para. 6.08).
7.04     Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and ONGC under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of
effectiveness (para. 3.25).
7.05     On the basis of the above assurances, the Project would be suitable
for a US$222.3 million loan to GOI for a term of twenty years, including a
five-year grace period.

SOUTH BASSEIN OFFSHORE GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Reserve Estimates and Production Projections
Geology
1.        The Bassein structure on which the South Bassein field is located is
in an elongated asymmetrical anticline having two culminations separated by a
low saddle area. This feature trends north-northwest, south-southeast, nearly
parallel to the Indian shoreline some 65 km to the east. Of the two
culminations, the southern one (South Bassein) is appreciably larger than the
northern one (Panna or North Bassein), exhibiting a length of 33 km and a
width of 10 km at the oil-water contact. On the basis of seismic and well
data, the total hydrocarbon column in South Bassein is determined to be about
160 m.
2.        The geological section in South Bassein consists of 2,200 m of
Tertiary formations lying over the pre-Cambrian basement (Daccan trap). The
upper 1,200 m are predominantly clastic, mainly shale with a few limestone
beds and some fossil debris and range in age from recent to Miocene. The
remaining 1,000-meter sedimentary sequence (Miocene to Eocene in age) is
limestone composed of varying amounts of included clay and shale interbeds
with a basal sand and coal section, about 100 m thick. The reservoir section
includes the interbedded limestone and share of early Oligocene age (A Zone)
and the relatively pure limestone of Upper Eocene age (B Zone). A 10-meter
thick hard zones are encountered between 1,600 and 1,900 meters subsea. The
thickness of the A Zone is on the order of 50 m, while that of the B Zone
approaches 200 m.  The porosity and permeability of the reservoirs gradually
deteriorate towards the south, the facies change in the A Zone being more
pronounced than in the B Zone.
3.        The A and B Zones contain hydrocarbons in both the North and South
Bassein areas.  North Bassein (Panna) has an oil column of about 20 m in the B
Zone overlain by a large gas cap which is mostly confined to the A Zone. The
thickness of the oil column in the B Zone reduces rather abruptly to about 10
m in the northern part of South Bassein. South Bassein has a very large gas
cap in the A and B zones.
Reserves Estimates
4.        The hydrocarbon reserves of the South Bassein field consit of (i)
free gas, (ii) natural gas liquids (condensate), (iii) oil, and (iv) solution
gas contained in the oil. Using a three-dimensional mathematical model based
on reservoir data obtained from 19 wells drilled on the Bassein structure, D.
R. McCord and Associates (Consultant, USA) have estimated the hydrocarbon
reserves in place as follows:

Condensate, miilion m3                 4.4              35.2            39.6
Oil, million m                         3.9             214.6           218.5
Solution gas                           0.7              41.9            42.6
5.        About 74.5% of the South Bassein free gas reserves (204.9 billion
Nm3 or 6.8 tcf) along with 29.5 million m3 (185.5 million barrels) of
condensate produced gas are methan (75.8%), ethan (7.22%) and propane
(4.98%). Butanes and heavier hydrccardons (5.61%) and carbon dioxide (6.32%)
are also present. The condensate that separates from the gas has an API
gravity of 52.20 and is free 6f sulfur compounds. Although the volume of oil
estimated to be present in the reservoir is substantial (218.5 million m3 or
1.374 billion Bbls), its production does not appear to be economical at this
stage (para. 7). Reservoir formation and fluid properties are summarized in
the table at the end of this Annex.
Production Characteristics
6.        Three dimensional reservoir model studies indicate that:  (i) the
reservoir is expected to produce by pressure depletion although partial water
drive, which would be economically beneficial, cannot be ruled out; (ii) gas
production from both A and B zones can be commingled in the same well without
adverse effects on either well productivity or ga recovery; (iii) to prevent
botton-water coning, which would reduce both well productivity and reserve
recovery and increase production costs, completions in the main gas reservoir
(B zone) should be distributed along the highest structural elevations in the
reservoir; and (iv) with the provision of (iii) above, plateau gas production
rates of 0.7-1.0 MMCM/day/well could be maintained for approximately 20 years.
7.        Although ONGC's efforts in the past to produce oil from the thin oil
column ocntaining relatively high transitional water saturations have been
unsuccessful due to early water and/or gas encroachment, mathematical model
studies indicate that concurrent production of oil and gas could be
practicable from a reservoir point of view if the completion interval were
confined to the oil zone.  Under ideal conditions of well completi sn and
siimulation, rates of gas and oil production as high as 800,000 Nm /day and 80
m /day could be expected and the final oil recovery would be on the order of
5% of the initial oil in place. However, any oil production scheme would
require the handling of substantial produced water volumes and more than
doubling the number of development wells. Therefore, the economic viability
of producing oil from South Bassein is stilldoubtful at this stage.
Nevertheless ONGC intends to drill and complete one well on each well platform
in the oil zone only to investigate the feasibility of oil production in South
Bassein.

SOUTH BASSEIN GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Description of Project Facilities
Process Description
1.       Gas produced from the individual wells is first reduced in pressure
at the wellhead to meet the required pipeline system operating conditions.
The gas is then directed to the prodluction manifold on the process platform
except while a well is undergoing testing, in which case the gas is directed
to a separate test manifold.
2.       From the production manifold the gas passes through two parallel
processing trains each having a normal capacity of 5 MMCMD of gas and 7.5
MMCMD for intermittent periods. The front end of the process trains consists
of a gas cooler and high pressure separator for removing entrained liquids
from the gas. Gas flow from a well under test will pass from the test
manifold to a test separator where the pressure, liquid and gas quantities and
other parameters are measured. The test separator gas joins the main gas
stream from the high pressure separators.  Next the gas passes on to two
parallel dehydration units where water is removed from the gas by contact with
triethylene glycol (TEG). The dehydrated gas from both trains (less than 112
kg per MMCM under contract) is recombined, metered and introduced into the
Hazira pipeline either by itself or in company with any spare Bombay High
associated gas also being shipped to Gujarat. Compression facilities are
included to enable the delivery of 5 MMCMD of Bombay High associated gas to
the Hazira terminal. In place of shipping Bombay High gas to Gujarat it is
also possible to deliver South Bassein gas to the Uran terminal via the 26"
trunkline from Bombay High.
3.       Liquids leaving the high pressure gas separator are passed to the
condensate processing equipment where produced water and condensate are
separated. Dewatered condensate is further processed through a filter
coalescer to remove any residual water. The condensate is stabilized to the
desired vapor pressure by a two stage separation of gas and liquid
hydrocarbon. Gas evolved during stabilization is recompressed and combined
with the gas leaving the high pressure separators. Stabilized condensate is
normally injected into the Bombay High 30" crude line.
Offshore Platform Complex
Location
4.       The offshore platform comp:Lex will be located near well SB-7 at
approximately latitude 190-11 north and longitude 720-7' east. The process
platform will be set with its long axis running north-south. This same axis
will locate the drilling platform approximately 35 m to the north of the
process platform. The flare platform will be set on an east-west axis 95 m
directly to the east of the process platform. The accommodation platform will

South Bassein-Hazira Pipeline
8.       The pipeline will have an outside diameter of 36", and it will be
fabricated by the submerged arc welding process from API5L - Grade X60 steel
having a thickness of 28.6 mm. The pipeline will be buried throughout its
entire length to a depth which will provide three or more meters of cover for



- 62 -                       ANNEX 3.2
Page 5 of 5
the offshore and river crossing portions and one meter cover for the land
portion. For corrosion protection the pipe is given a 4 mm thick protective
coating consisting of successive layers of a coal tar enamel primer coat
applied to the cleaned pipe surface, a coat of coal tar enamel, a glass matte,
another coal tar enamel coat and an outer glass fiber wrap. Stability to
withstand currents and other forces on pipe laid in water will be provided by
a 10 cm or so thick oating of a very dense concrete having a density of at
least 3.04 kg per dm (190 lbs per cu ft, roughly 50% greater than ordinary
cement). Buoyancy stabilization in marshy areas will be obtained by ordinary
concrete weighting. The pipeline will be cathodically protected by zinc
sacrificial anodes where exposed to water and by an impressed current on land.
Hazira Terminal
9.       The gas and entrained hydrocarbon liquids which have condensed due to
cooling in the pipeline arrive at a receiver trap in the terminal. The gas
then passes through two parallel scrubbers and filters which remove all
entrained liquids before it is metered and delivered to the fertilizer plant
and other subsequent customers. The liquid is caught in a slug catcher
consisting of about 135 m of 36" pipe designed in such a manner as to
dissipate the kinetic energy of the liquid and to provide hold-up for the
estimated   190 m  per hour flow rate at maximum design throughput.  To
produce a condensate that can be safely handled, stored and transported, the
liquid is stabilized to a Reid vapor pressure of 10 psi in a distillation
column. The light ends which are stripped off are recompressed and returned
to the gas stream. Storage and shipping facilites for the stabilized
condensate are included in the terminal facilities.

a/ The liquid hydrocarbons being replaced are LPG, Kerosene, and fuel oil.
b/ Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS) replacement. This has a lower priority than the other liquid hydrocarbon
replacement in case of gas supply constraints.
NOTE: In addition to the substitution possibilities listed above, there are several enterprises near the proposed inland pipeline route who are presently using liquid hydrocarbons
that can be replaced by lean gas.  The additional subsitution will involve naphtha (1.5 million tons per year equivalent to 3.1 million cubic meters/day of lean gas) as well as
fuel oil and LSHS (0.6 million tons per year equivalent to 1.9 million cubic meters/day of lean gas).  The enterprises are located in Barauch (GNFC), Baroda (GSFC and IPCL), Kota
(SFC), Kampur (IEL) and Gorakhpur (FCI).

INDIA
SOUTH BASSEIN GAS OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return -- Assumptions
I.        Capital Cost
1.        The capital cost of the Project is based on the Appraisal estimate
excluding custom duties, taxes and price contingencies. As a producticn
platform has a capacity of 5 MMCMD, a process platform of 10 MMCMD, and an LPG
plant of 5 MMCMD, additional provisions were made for future investments, in
the above, as the demand for gas develops, based on the following end-1982
prices:
US$ Million
Three Production Platforms
(with a total of 18 wells)                        135
One Process Platform (with flare)                       75
Four LPG Plants (including the
one to be completed in 1985/86)                   300
Two C2/C3 extraction plants1/                          245
Furthermore, the Hazira-UP 1,000 km pipeline, which will bring the gas to the
six future fertilizer plants, was incorporated in the investment program over
1985/86 - 1987/88, with a capital cost of US$700 million (economic cost; for
the financial cost, add US$160 million for import duties and taxes) in end-
1982 prices (including 3 compressor stations, pressure reducing stations and
telemetry/telecontrol).
II. Operating Cost
2.        The operating costs were taken to be 8% of the investment cost in
operating assets plus variable costs of US$20 per 1,000 Nm3 of rich gas
produced (ex-platform).
a. Unit Values
3.        A separate value was given to each fraction of the gas of the basis
of its opportunity cost.  In the case of the lean gas (Cl fraction or
methane), the netback value was calculated for feedstock use; for other uses,
the replacement value was calculated on the basis of calorific equivalence.
All prices were kept constant at their base values (para 6) for the base case
but a sensitivity analysis, assuming real term increases in energy prices
during the next 20 years, has also been performed. These real term price
increases are based on the following trend for oil and coal (expressed in 1981
prices):
1981      1982       1983       1985       1990      1995
Oil (US$/Bbl)          34.3       32.0       31.0       32.0      37.0       41.0
Coal (US$/ton)         55         53         52         51        55         59

4.        The value of natural gas liquids (NGL) was take:> -o be the f.o.b.
price of naphtha.l/ as India currently produces an excess of gasoline, which
is blended with naphtha.  Naphtha is exported, although i- small qua?tities,
at present.  The LPG value is based on the coi.f. orice c- L-erosene  . The
C2/C3 fraction should be based on the netback value of ga2  :or
petrochemicals.  A conser7vative ebstimate was made at US$5 _5/1,000 SCF.
5.        With regard to the Cl fraction, different valu2s -.ere assigned,
depending on the end-useO When lea. gas is used as feeds.-ck-, the netback for
fertilizer production was taken as the measure of benefits D  The netback value
was taken to be the one for which the econcmic rate of reL>rn of a fertilizer
project in India would reach 12%, the opportunity cost olf capital. The
calculation was made on the basis of the next fertilizer cliant scheduled to be
built, using the actual capital costs of the Hazira fertizer complex as a
base for estimating the costs.
6.        When the lean gas is used for hydrocarbon replase-ent, it
essential y replaces fuel oil.  Therefore, the value oL g2s was taken to be
fuel oili' equivalence, after adjusting for the calorific -values.  When lean
gas is used to replace coa}, calorific equivalence was calculated to obtain
the value of natural gas._   The cost of gas for various a.plications is,
therefore, as follows:
End-Kl ,2 Prices
US$/l,000        US$ 1,000 SCF
NGL (US' per ton)                           300           --

Quantities
7.        Quantities of South Bassein gas required to meet -he three demand
scenarios were established on the. basis of Annex 4.1.  rhE priority for gas
use is as follows: first as feedstock, second as liquid .ydrocarbon
replacement and lastly, as coal replacement in a few selc--ad cases.
4! f.o.b. price of naptha at US$300/ton-
2/ c.i.f. kerosene price of US$389/ton adjusted for calcr-°:ic equivalence.
-   The end-1982 c.i.f. Bombay price oi fuel oil was take-, -  be US$200/ton
which is equivalent to US$160/l,C0O0 Nm of natural gas.
4/  The end-1982 price of coal was taken as US$53/ton fo--          with a
calorific value of 6,600 kcal/kg-

However, the feedstock plus hydrocarbon replacement demand always exceeds the
South Bassein lean gas supply and, therefore, none of the gas is assumed to be
used for coal replacement in the economic analysis.

B.  Present Value of Gas Feedstock Consumption Assuming Unit Price of US$1.00 per 1,000 Nm3 = US$1.53 million.
C. Netback Value of Gas as Feedstock (A divided by B) = US$192 per 1,000 Nm3.
Notes:-  1.  Ammonia/Urea planit with 1,350 TPD ammonia capacity and 2,296 TPD urea capactty.  All ammonia p5oduction is converted to urea at the rate3of 0.588 tons ammonia per ton
of urea.  100% capacity utilization corresponds to 330 stream days.  Gas consumption is 660 Nm  per ton of urea for feedstock and 230 Nm  per ton of urea for fuel.
Capital and operating costs are based on updated costs for the Hazira fertilizer plant currently under construction adjusted for size (llazira has two trains of 1,350
TPD ammonia each) and fuel type (Hazira is based on coal as fuel).
2.  Economic prices (in end-1982 US$) are:  IJrea - US$320 per ton, Gas as fuel - US$160 per 1,000 Nm3 based on fuel oil equivalence.  Other variable operating costs
excluding feedstock and f,,el, total US$20 per ton of urea.
3.  The presen,t values under A anld B above are based on a 12% discount rate or opportunity cost of capital.
4.  Should the netback value of the lean gas be calculated on the savings in capital and operating costs that a gas-based ammonia/urea plant would have over a fuiel oil-
based plant of identical output or capacity (with an economic value of US$200 per ton for fusl oil used as feedstock and as fuel), then the netback value of the
natural gas used as feedstock and as fuel would range between US$180 and US$190 per 1,000 Nm

INDIA
ONGC'S Investment Program
Background
1.       ONGC is now in the third year of the five-year plan period 1980/81-
84/85. The initial plan document (June 1980), provided for expenditures of Rs
40 billion (at 1980 prices) approximately; it was revised in August 1981 in
order to incorporate the accelerated program, and outlays were increased to Rs
47.9 billion (at 1981 prices). The production target over the plan period was
increased from 51.3 million tons of crude oil to 62.8 million tons.
2.       In March 1982, ONGC completed a 10-year conceptual planning exercise
over the period 1980/81-89/90 where two scenarios are presented: Variant I
has an annual production objective of 46.5 million tons of crude oil by
1989/90, while Variant II has an o"bjective of 60.5 million tons in the same
year.  Taking into account that ONGC's existing reserves cannot sustain a
production rate above 30 million tons per annum, both scenarios assume that
increased exploration expenditures would yield commercial discoveries which
will start producing in the second half of the 1980's.
3.       ONGC recognizes that in order to accelerate its exploration program
during the seventh plan period (1985/86-89/90), additional exploration and
development expenditures will have to be incurred already during 1983/84
through 1984/85 so that when the seventh plan begins, it will have adequate
materials and equipment, trained personnel and resources to achieve its
objectives. One should note, how vver, that the Government has not yet
approved ONGC's recommendations._   In consultation with ONGC, it was decided
that for the purposes of the financial projections over the period 1982/83-
1987/88: (i) Variant I of ONGC's expenditures program would be adopted (with
all capital costs expressed in current prices); (ii) no new discovery would
come under production during the forecast period (a conservative assumption
since recent oil discoveries could come under production during the forecast
period); and (iii) no expenditure for the development of such discoveries
would be provided for. The investmnent program appears at the end of this
Annex, which has also been used as an input for the financial projections
(Annex 6.1), should therefore be considered as the broad outline of an
expenditure program which could be, at relatively short notice, significantly
altered, for instance on account of reservoir studies (which would lead to
additional investments in producing areas), or commercial discoveries.
1/ The Government in principle approved, in November 1982, all the
exploration components as well as the development of presently known reserves
proposed in Variant I, but did not approve the speculative portion of the
development investments dealing with future (expected) discoveries. These
types of development investments will be proposed by ONGC as the discoveries
are actally made. The GOI-approved plan is now known as the Core Plan.

Exploration
a. Onshore
4.       The Western Region includes the Cambay, the Rajasthan, the Saurashtra
and the Kutch basins; but only the Cambay basin, has been fairly well
explored. The region's recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 113.6
million tons as of 1/1/82 (51.5 million tons as of 1/1/81). The exploration
strategy adopted here is to: (i) locate extensions of prospects already
delineated; (ii) identify subtle traps in different basement blocks on the
basis of sophisticated seismic work and geological modelling; and (iii)
explore new areas such as the shoal project in the Cambay Gulf, Kutch,
Saurashtra and Rajasthan. Deeper prospects in the existing known areas are
also to be drilled. During the forecast period 1982/83-1987/88, ONGC plans to
carry out about 22,230 line-km of seismic surveys and drill 200 wells (about
490,000 meters).
5.       The Eastern Region (Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, etc.) is considered
very prospective. Recoverable oil reserves were estimated at 61.4 million
tons as of 1/1/82 (50.0 million tons as of 1/1/81). More than 40 prospects
identified from seismic and geological surveys are yet to be drilled. Virgin
areas such as Dansiri Valley, Naga Hills, and north bank of Brahmaputra are
planned for drilling. 14,600 line-km of seismic surveys are planned during
the forecast period, together with 156 exploratory wells (altogether
580,000 m).
6.       In the Central Region, which comprises the balance of the onshore
area, no commercial discoveries have been made so far, but a number of
attractive prospects have been identified, including the basins of Bengal,
Krishna-Godavari and Cauvery. ONGC also plans to initiate exploration efforts
in new areas (Himalayan foothills -- Ganga Valley) and is in the process of
acquiring modern equipment for that purpose (digital seismic units, equipment
designed for desert conditions, etc.). 47,900 line-km of seismic surveys are
now proposed in the forecast period, together with 186 exploratory wells
(744,000 m).
b. Offshore
7.       Offshore exploration activities have given very encouraging results
in recent years. In 1981, a new structure known as B-57 has been discovered
south-east of the Bassein field. On the east coast, oil has been discovered
for the first time in a new structure in the Palk Straits known as PH-9.
Offshore recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 345.8 million tons as of
1/1/82 (328.3 million tons as of 1/1/81). The objective of the exploration
program here is to complete the seismic reconnaissance and semi-detailed
surveys of most of the promising areas, and extend the same to the continental
slope and deeper areas offshore. For this purpose, about 165,000 line-km of
seismic surveys and 219 exploratory wells (719,000 m) are proposed in the
forecast period.

Development
a. Onshore
8.   Primary production for many of the fields in the Western Region is
declining, and sophisticated secondary and tertiary recovery techniques (water
flooding, polymer injection, thermal in-situ combustion, gas injection) will
be needed to maintain production. Contracts have been signed with the USSR to
assist in work-over operations, and with Nowasco of Canada to provide advanced
technology for well stimulation, acidization and fracturing. 226 development
wells are proposed during the plan period (326,000 m).
9.   In the eastern Region, an accelerated production program aiming to
produce 4.1 million tons by 1985/86 is underway. 273 wells (815,000 m) are
proposed for the forecast period.
b. Offshore
10       The accelerated offshore production program includes the further
development of Bombay High and the development of new structures such as Ratna
(R-12), Heera (B-37/38), Bombay High East and Panna (North Bassein). In
addition, the South Bassein offshore gas field will be developed. CFP
(France) has been retained for the reservoirs studies and development of
Bombay High and neighboring fields. 341 development wells (789,000 m) are
proposed during the forecast period.
Research and Development
11.      Three institutes for research and development function within ONGC;
the Institute of Petroleum Exploration (IPE) and the Institute of Drilling
Technology (IDT), both at Dehra Dun, ONGC's headquarters, and the Institute of
Reservoir Studies (IRS) at Abmedabad.  These institutes support ONGC's
activities both onshore and offshore. IPE primarily frames the exploration
strategy, reviews exploration programs, and prepares reserves estimates. IDT
aims at improving the drilling techlnology, and to that effect develops tools,
carries out research in indigenous development of mud chemicals and cement
additives, as well as supervising and monitoring key exploratory wells
projected for deeper targets. IRS establishes drilling plans for various
discovered fields, monitors the bebLavior of producing reservoirs, carries out
economic studies and investigates enhanced recovery methods.
12.      ONGC now is considering establishment of an Offshore Technology
Research Institute in Bombay, which will be active in offshore oil
exploration, development, production and transportation, as well as updating
the know-how on offshore technology, deep water techniques, etc.

INDIA
OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMISSION
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Projections
I. Background
1.01     The financial projections are based on:  (i) ONGC's revised five-year
plan 1980-85 submitted to the Government in August 1981; (ii) the revised
budget for 1982; (iii) the budget for 1983; and (iv) the Core Plan (1980/81-
1989/90) approved in principle by the Government last November 1982.
Appropriate physical contingencies have been incorporated in the investment
program, and investment and operating costs include price contingencies (at an
average rate of 7.5% per annum).
II. Income Statements
a. Operating Revenues
2.01     Operating Revenues are calculated on the basis of the prices
currently obtained by ONGC for crude oil, natural gas and LPG. The price of
both onshore and offshore crude oil was set at Rs 138.535 per Bbl, for 340 API
crude, on July 11, 1981, with an escalation formula for lighter crudes. The
cost of offshore crude on that basis turns out to be Rs 1,188/ton, including a
cess of Rs 100/ton and a royalty of Rs 61/ton. If the crude oil is piped to
shore, a pipeline tolling fee of Rs 50-75/ton is added to the crude oil price
(the tolling fee is based on a complex formula, taking into account the
investment cost, operating cost, the annual quantities of crude oil piped, and
a weighted rate of return to ONGC). If the crude is sent to shore by tankers,
the users pay directly the transport cost. The price of onshore crude varies
between Rs 1,181/ton and Rs 1,204/ton, depending on the quality of the crude.
2.02     The price of gas is, in the case of offshore production based on the
replacement value of naphtha, and the end-use. In the case of onshore
production, it is based on the consumer's ability to pay, and the end-use.
2.03     The price of LPG is based on the current one, i.e. Rs 1,830/ton,
although ONGC has requested an increase in this price.
2.04     Detailed calculations of revenues appear in page 4 of this Annex.
Operating Expenses
2.05     Operating Costs for both the onshore and offshore operations include
salaries and wages, stores and spares, operating costs of various capital
items under leasing arrangements (supply vessels, helicopters, rigs), selling
expenses and overheads.
2.06     Sales tax, Royalty and Cess are based on actual qualities of oil and
gas produced. Sales tax is only applicable for onshore production. Rates are



- 90 -                    ANNEX 6.2
Page 2 of 14
as follows: 4/104 for onshore crude, 11/111 for Western Region gas, and 7/107
for Eastern Region gas. Royalty is Rs 61/ton for crude oil (both onshore and
offshore), and 10% of the well head value for gas. Cess is equivalent to Rs
100/ton, both onshore and offshore. Detailed computations appear in page 5 of
this Annex.
2.07     The depreciation of the tangible assets is calculated on the basis of
Income Tax regulations. However, depending on the actual use of equipment,
the depreciation is allocated to the production, development or exploration
activities.
2.08     The expenditure incurred on exploration, including the depreciation
allocated as stated above, is charged uniformly at 1/15 th of the gross
expenditure incurred year after year until the area is declared abandoned or
productive. If the area is abandoned, the balance of the amount not yet
written off is depreciated over three years beginning in the year in which the
decision is made. If the area is declared productive, the balance of
exploration expenditures is written off over a ten-year period beginning in
the year in which the decision is made; subsequent exploration expenditures
are written off in equal installment, during the ten-year period. Any
subsequent exploration expenditures (i.e. beyond the ten-year period) is
charged immediately against revenues.
2.09     The cost of surveys is not capitalized and charged immediately
against revenues.
2.10     For production assets, typical depreciation rates either by reducing
balance or straight line methods, are as follows:
Pipelines and Machinery - 10%;
Platforms - 30%;
Development Wells - 10 years;
Stabilization and Processing Plants - 15%.
The depreciation schedule appears in page 6 of this Annex.
2.11     The schedule of debt servic,e payments appear in pages 8 to 14 of this
Annex.
2.12     Income tax rate is 56.375% iand is based on the following
principles:  (i) until a decision is made to abandon or develop, exploration
expenditures are not deductible - following that decision, exploration
expenditures are written off over a three-year period and subsequent
expenditures are deductible immediately; and (ii) an amount equivalent to 25%
of the value of an asset being commissioned is deductible for tax purposes on
that year (investment allowance).
III. Balance Sheets
3.01     Gross Assets build-up are based on the investment program in Annex
5.3.
3.02     Long-term investments refers to ONGC's subsidiary, Hydrocarbon India
Ltd, which undertakes ventures abroad but is being phased out at present; no
further investments are contemplated.



- 91 -                   ANNEX 6.2
Page 3 of 14
3.03     Debtors were forecast on the basis of ONGC's current arrangements,
i.e. 24 days of sales for offshore crude and gas, 16 days for onshore crude,
30 days for onshore gas and 16 days for LPG.
3.04     The current portion of the long-term debts are included in current
liabilities in this financial projection (although ONGC does not follow this
practice). A minimum current ratio of 1.2 is maintained in the forecast
period by increasing the cash holdings as necessary.
3.05     The debt schedule appears in pages 8 to 14.  Additional medium-term
borrowings were assumed to be at 14% over seven years, (including 2 years
grace period) a reasonable assumption. The proposed IBRD Loan is assumed to
be over 15 years, including a five-year grace period, and a rate to ONGC of
12%.
3.06     Grants in small amounts are anticipated from the Oil Industry
Development Board (OIDB) to cover primarily research projects. No provisions
are being made to cover an increase in the amount of government equity.
IV. Sources and Applications of Funds Statement
4.01     The investment program is examined in detail in Annex 5.3.
4.02     Dividends would continue to be paid to the Government at a rate of 6%
of government equity.

-'! For the case of the project only, the rich gas (i.e., before LGP and C2/C3
are extracted) at the Hazira Terminal and the NGL extracted at the process
platform and the terminal are the products. Two thirds of the gas is sold
as feedstock (Rs 1.241/cm) and the rest as fuel (Rs 2.461/cm) in the Base
Case 
bi This is equivalent to the case where all the gas is sold as feedstock.
