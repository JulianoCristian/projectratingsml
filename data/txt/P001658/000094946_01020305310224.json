"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Fisheries Development Project's\n            outcome is rated as unsatisfactory, since the main\n            development objective, realizing the economic potential of\n            the fisheries sector, was not achieved. The lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) The design of a project must\n            be compatible with the capacity of the implementing agency\n            to carry out the planned activities. 2) This project\n            demonstrates that complex projects present substantial and\n            often unique management demands. Procurement and financial\n            management are critical functions that demand a level of\n            expertise generally not found in government departments.\n            Poor performance in these areas typically results in serious\n            delays in implementation. 3) The new capacities of the\n            Fisheries Department did not need to create a separate\n            project implementation unit. 4) In every project involving\n            sustainable management natural resources, the balance\n            between environmental and social objectives should always be\n            negotiated with care. 5) The requirement that the Government\n            of Malawi divested itself of some commercial undertaking\n            that were serving the fishing community, without ensuring\n            the continued provision of such services by the private\n            sector to the sub-sector, was a serious shortcoming of the project."}, "docdt": "2000-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
