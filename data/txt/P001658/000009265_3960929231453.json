capacity and focusing\n            on demersal stock assessment, lake resource conservation,\n            and developing pilot fish farming models that will help\n            integrate aquaculture into crop farming systems in different\n            ecological zones; (iii) a production component for\n            rehabilitating and developing existing capture fisheries by\n            supporting artisanal fishermen, semi-commercial and\n            commercial fishing activities, and establishing a pilot\n            program to increase the involvement of women in fisheries\n            (fish
