Project for Mongolia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory and Borrower performance was\n            also a satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            government commitment remains central to implementation\n            success. The enthusiasm of the Government was a critical\n            factor in meeting project objectives. However, when the\n            respective agency did not consider the specific advisory\n            service relevant to its perceived needs, implementation was\n            less successful. Umbrella-type projects with their high\n            degree of flexibility require careful assessment of the\n            Borrower's capacity to implement. Involvement of many\n            international agencies may make project, related budget\n            plans too complicated. While reliance on agencies to make\n            their own work plans may make the process demand-driven and\n            participatory, it may not always be appropriate or relevant\n            in fulfilling objectives of project."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
