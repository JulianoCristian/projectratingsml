the agricultural sector.  The principal\n            objectives of the program are to stimulate sectoral growth\n            through promoting intensification of production and better\n            use of Kenya's limited land; improve producer\n            incentives; and expand the flow of investment resources to\n            the sector.  Above all, the program is geared to lifting the\n            obstacles to increased production by the 1.9 million\n            smallholder farm families who are the backbone of\n            Kenya's agricultural sector.  To achieve these\n            objectives, actions have been taken and others will be\n            implemented in the following two years. They will include\n            (i) improving the availability of key agricultural inputs\n            and services; (ii) increasing production and investment\n            incentives, (iii) implementing programs to address critical\n            parastatal problems; (iv) launching a major restructuring of\n            the public investment and expenditure program; and (v)\n            increasing flows of credit and expanding access to credit,\n            particularly for smallholders.  The foreign exchange\n            provided by the Credits will be used to finance an agreed\n            program of imports of inputs needed for the sector."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
