It\n            also intends to strengthen instruction in science and\n            mathematics in general education, and increase the number of\n            graduates qualified to enter higher scientific and\n            technological studies.  The project aims to accomplish this\n            by assisting 140 secondary and 30 primary schools to\n            modernize the curricula through the use of computers as\n            instructional tools for the teaching of mathematics, science\n            and language skills, and for developing computer literacy.\n            The proposed project will assist Portugal in its human\n            resource development strategy to meet ongoing structural\n            changes in the economy and enhance its competitiveness\n            within the European Community (EC)."}, "docdt": "1987-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
