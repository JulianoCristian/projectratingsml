The\n            project will also provide technical assistance for: (a)\n            evaluating existing road pavements and preparing a pavement\n            strengthening and maintenance program; (b) improving their\n            design and planning of roads and waterways; (c) assistance\n            in carrying out the provincial transport corridor study; and\n            (d) staff training. The main thrust of the technical\n            assistance component is to strengthen the ability of\n            transport staff at both the provincial and county levels in\n            the areas of project management, transport investment\n            planning, and implementation."}, "docdt": "1991-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
