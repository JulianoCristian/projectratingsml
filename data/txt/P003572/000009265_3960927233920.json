southern part of the province. The project therefore\n            includes: (i) a three year time slice of the five year road\n            network rehabilitation program; (ii) rehabilitation of the\n            Nanjing-Shanghai corridor road; (iii) rehabilitation of the\n            Danyang section of the Grand Canal; (iv) construction of a\n            new shiplock at Nantong and an adjacent bridge at\n            Jiuweigang; (v) consultant services to help train Jiangsu\n            Provincial Communications staff (JPCD) in the supervision\n            and quality control of all civil works; and (vi) assistance\n            to JPCD in devising an immediate and long term plan of\n            action to develop independent construction units. The\n            project will also provide technical assistance for: (a)\n            evaluating existing road pavements and preparing a pavement\n            strengthening and maintenance program; (b) improving their\n            design and planning of roads and waterways; (c) assistance\n            in carrying out the provincial transport corridor study; and\n            (d) staff training. The main thrust of the technical\n            assistance component is to strengthen the ability of\n            transport staff at both the provincial and county levels in\n            the areas of project management, transport investment\n            planning, and implementation."}, "docdt": "1991-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
