Development Project for VietNam were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            decentralization in management decision-making to the\n            provincial level and below is the key to the success of\n            integrated conservation and development projects because\n            coordination and communication among different sector\n            agencies are more effective at local levels. Linked to\n            decentralization are the accountability and the ability to\n            shift resources from the center to the provinces and between\n            provinces based on performance. Simplicity in project design\n            is critical to avoid a heavy dependency of implementation on\n            external technical assistance. Local absorptive capacity\n            should be carefully considered to match with the complexity\n            of the design. An early mid-term review (MTR) is important\n            to assess and make necessary changes to cope with new\n            developments. Restructuring should not be seen as failure\n            but a means to up-date a project design and to improve the\n            quality of design and implementation in order to achieve the\n            project development objective (PDO). The number of provinces\n            should be limited to a manageable size to ensure good\n            quality and project management. For complicated projects,\n            there should not be more than 4-5 provinces per project."}, "docdt": "2008-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
