The restructuring is designed to remedy both\n            problems, and to take into account the changed needs of the\n            Project, brought about by socio-economic, and environmental\n            changes in the Project area. The Project set out to\n            reestablish, and protect a vital natural resource (the\n            coastal mangrove forest), and to help poor people, who\n            currently depend on the forest, to move from the Full\n            Protection Zone (FPZ), resettle in the Buffer Zone (BZ), and\n            gain more sustainable livelihoods. Following the\n            restructuring mission, the Project made significant\n            achievements in two of the four provinces, indicating that\n            the objective not only remains valid, but is also\n            achievable. The restructuring of the Project will allow\n            these achievements to be consolidated, thereby protecting an\n            investment already made, and positioning the Project to\n            achieve a development goal of national importance. A\n            complete reassessment of reforestation, and other\n            interventions in the BZ is also being prepared, because of\n            major changes in land use, and land values since Project\n            appraisal. The expansion of physical infrastructure, and\n            agricultural development together, indicate that mangrove\n            reforestation is no longer feasible in many parts of the BZ.\n            On the basis of foregoing discussions on the merits of the\n            revised Project, it is recommended to approve the\n            restructuring of the Project, and the Development Credit\n            Agreement be amended as set forth in the attached Draft\n            Letter of Amendment."}, "docdt": "2004-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
