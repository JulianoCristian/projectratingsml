 F. Results Framework Analysis

 Project Development Objectives

 The objective of the project, which covered the Southern Mekong Delta provinces of Ca Mau,
 Bac Lieu, Soc Trang, and Tra Vinh, was to re-establish the coastal mangrove wetland ecosystems
 and protect sustainably their aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions. The project was
 designed to generate two main outcomes in order to achieve the objective: (a) the expansion of
 mangrove planting in the depleted natural mangrove forest area and the sustainable management
 and protection of the coastal ecosystems; and (b) the improvement of incomes and livelihoods of
 the coastal population, and a reduction in the risks they face, via diversification and an increase in
 agricultural and aquatic production.

 Revised Project Development Objectives

 There were no changes made to the Project Development Objective (PDO) during project
 implementation. However, following a formal restructuring in November 2004, and on the basis
 of the early implementation experience and a reassessment of the absorptive capacity of each of
 the four provinces in which the project was being implemented, there was a substantial down-
 sizing of the project and the project log-frame was revised accordingly. In particular, the Key
 Performance Indicators to measure progress towards the PDO were adjusted. Indicators covering
 marine productivity and coastal erosion were formally replaced by the following: (a) the increase
 in mangrove plantation and protection areas; (b) the decline in the barren areas in the Full
 Protection Zone (FPZ); and (c) an improvement in the management and protection of the Mui Ca
 Mau National Park. In addition, the risk of future encroachment into protected areas was to be
 reduced through alternative sustainable livelihood development of vulnerable groups in priority
 communes and resettlement sites and measured based on the reduction of absolute poverty in the
 vulnerable communes (see Project Restructuring Report, dated March 30, 2004 and approved by
 the Prime Minister, Decision 1204/QD-TTg, dated November 2004).

             The revised targets were achieved. The initial targets were exceeded if the achievements of
             the project and the government's Program 661 are combined. During 2000-2007, 4,662 ha of
             mangroves were planted under the project and approximately 20,000 ha under Program 661,
Comments
             bringing the forest cover in the FPZ to more than 96 percent (from around 50 percent in
             2000). Most barren areas in the BZ suitable for mangrove planting were also planted. All
             mangroves in the FPZ were protected through contracts either with smallholders supported by
             the project or with State Forestry Enterprises (SFE) through the Program 661.

             Average per capita income has increased steadily in all provinces, and poverty rates have
             decreased significantly in the project area. The project contributed significantly to the
             improvement since the funding from the International Development Association (IDA) and
Comments     the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) represented substantial
             incremental resources allocated to the most vulnerable communes. On average, a poor
             commune received about $35,000 per year from Program 135 but about twice as much from
             the project investments (i.e., US$70,000 per year), which suggests a strong contribution of the
             project activities to this outcome.

             The revised targets were achieved. Forest cover in the FPZ increased from around 50 percent
             in 2000 to more than 96 percent in 2007. Most barren areas in the BZ suitable for mangrove
             planting were also planted. All mangroves in the FPZ were protected through protection
             contracts. Forest law violations in the project area (470 km of shoreline along four project
Comments     provinces) were reduced considerably. The coastal erosion area in Ca Mau was substantially
             reduced by 40 percent and the length and the area of coastline accreting was increased by 20
             percent during the same period. Natural near-shore aquatic resources (such as sea crabs and
             blood clams) re-appeared and increased in some places (the most obvious was at My Long
             Nam commune of Tra Vinh). The institutional capacity for mangrove planting and protection
             at local levels, including awareness of conservation values, was enhanced.

2004)                                              implementation arrangements, enhancing targeting of
                                                   project interventions, amending the Technical Assistance
                                                   contract, and increasing attention to capacity building. All
                                                   this led to a significant reduction of the project cost, and
                                                   the DANIDA Grant was reduced from US$11.3 million to
                                                   US$7.3 million; IDA Credit savings (US$6 million) were
                                                   transferred to the VBARD to support the demand of
                                                   smallholders for credit in the project area (see Sections
                                                   1.6.3 and 1.7.7).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    In the 1990s, the rapid decline of Vietnam's mangrove forests, both in terms of area and
quality, and the unsustainable nature of shrimp aquaculture were key concerns of the
Government. The increased population pressure and development of aquaculture were identified
as an important contributor to the loss of mangroves, as people usually turned to cutting forests
after unsuccessful shrimp years. Around the time the project was conceived, in the mid-1990s,
there had been a severe outbreak of shrimp virus, worsening this effect.

1.1.2    In this context, the Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project was developed
to address the rapid losses of coastal wetland mangroves and the need to protect what was left. A
strategic choice of the project was to include social support to improve livelihoods of the coastal
poor residing in and adjacent to mangrove areas through better extension and support services,
including rural infrastructure. This integrated approach required a combination of extension,
credit and social support tied in with environmental promotion, policy and contractual measures
to ensure that incentives existed for forest protection. With the devastating impact of the shrimp
disease and Typhoon Linda, private credit sources virtually dried up and credit institutions were
also more reluctant to lend new money to shrimp farmers.

1.1.3    The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Vietnam in the 1990s1 identified five
areas in which the Bank Group support would need to shift to: (a) a deeper focus on poverty and
social issues; (b) clearer links between projects and policy dialogue; (c) broader partnerships and
decentralized implementation; (d) redirection of lending towards rural development; and (e)
better aid coordination and a transition towards program financing.

1.1.4    The project contributed to this shift in all five areas: (a) it targeted some of the poorest
districts in the Mekong Delta; (b) it was implemented in a decentralized manner (provincial
project management with participation from "grass roots" organizations, research institutes and
private sector); (c) it focused on rural development; (d) it was prepared in close collaboration
with a bilateral donor, DANIDA; and (e) it was engaged in policy dialogue on state enterprise
restructuring, land-use planning and how to handle the trade-off between growth and
environmental protection.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

1.2.1    The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to re-establish the coastal mangrove
wetland ecosystems and sustainably protect the aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions.

1.2.2    Three key performance indicators (KPIs) were stated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) for the achievement of the PDO: (a) the minimization of land losses to and maximization
of land gains from the sea through reduced erosion and increased accretion; (b) a decline in the
barren areas in the FPZ; and (c) increased coastal and near-shore marine productivity.

1.3.    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
        reasons/justification

1.3.1    The PDO remained unchanged throughout the implementation of the project. However,
the KPIs were formally revised at the time of restructuring to become: (a) the increase in
mangrove plantation and protection areas and the decline in the barren areas in the FPZ; and
(b) the reduction of the incidence of absolute poverty in the vulnerable communes.

1.3.2    The justifications for the changes were: (a) the need to take into account the dramatic
socio-economic changes that had occurred in the project area since the project was appraised and
the revised scope of the project components with more emphasis given to poverty reduction and
social development in the BZ; and (b) the fact that the original KPIs were long-term indicators
(i.e., the minimization of land losses to and maximization of land gains from the sea, and
increased coastal and near-shore marine productivity) which were difficult to measure with
confidence within the short remaining implementation period.


1.4.    Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1    The project benefited the following six main groups:

     (a) the poor and poorest populations in the project area, whose lives were dependent on
         extracting local forest resources, by ensuring better and more stable sources of household
         incomes through (i) the introduction and dissemination of low-cost improvements in
         agricultural and aquacultural farming techniques; (ii) the improved accessibility to credit
         support, including the issuance of long-term LURCs which can be used as collateral; and
         (iii) the improved accessibility to basic rural infrastructure needs and associated social
         support services.

     (b) the ethnic minorities (mainly the Khmer) living in the project area of Tra Vinh, Soc
         Trang, and Bac Lieu provinces, through the preparation and implementation of the Ethnic
         Minority Development Plans (EMDPs).

     (c) the re-settlers from the FPZ, by providing them with (i) better and safer living places with
         long-term tenures; (ii) improved accessibility to social support services, credit and basic
         rural infrastructure, and (iii) improved and more diverse farming technologies.

     (d) Mui Ca Mau National Park Management Board, through improving its capacity and
         efficiency in protecting the biodiversity of the Park.

     (e) Central and local government bodies, especially the provincial and district Forest
         Protection Departments, through improving their institutional and administrative
         capacity.

     (f) Other stakeholders in the project area, through improving community infrastructure,
         environmental protection and social stability.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1    Seven components were designed to meet the expressed PDOs and covered four
provinces in the Mekong Delta.

1.5.2    Component 1: Mangrove Planting, Rehabilitation and Protection (US$13.9 million).
This component consisted of three sub-components: (a) reforestation in the FPZ and BZ; (b)
protection of newly-planted and existing forests in the FPZ; and (c) protection and management



                                                   2

of priority key protected areas in the FPZ, including two nature reserves (Dat Mui and Ong Trang
Nature Reserves) and one fish sanctuary (Bai Boi Fish Sanctuary), which were subsequently
merged into the Mui Ca Mau National Park.

1.5.3    Component 2: Technology Development and Transfer in the BZ (US$15.9 million).
This component had two sub-components: (a) implementation of the technology development and
transfer (TDT) program; and (b) the provision of credit to local farmers through VBARD.

1.5.4    Component 3: Social support program (SSP) for vulnerable communes and
commune villages receiving re-settlers including ethnic minorities (US$10.2 million). This
component had two sub-components: (a) the development and implementation of CAPs; and (b)
the establishment and implementation of (i) Social Support Funds (SSFs) operated at commune
and village levels for the very poor households and (ii) the EMDF for the communes with a high
population of the Khmer minority (above 20 percent), to provide them with additional support to
meet their special needs through the preparation and implementation of EMDPs.

1.5.5    Component 4: Policy and institutional development (US$2.1 million). This
component supported activities for: (a) carrying out land and water use zoning; (b) improving the
security and allocation of long-term land-use rights to farmers in the BZ; and (c) restructuring
selected SFEs.

1.5.6    Component 5: Resettlement of FPZ occupants (US$16.2 million). The component
was designed to support the relocation of the FPZ occupants into the BZ with safer living places
(i.e., not directly exposed to sea surges or rising sea levels, strong winds and typhoons) and better
living conditions (i.e., with improved access to basic infrastructure such as schools, health care,
drinking water and transport).

1.5.7    Component 6: Project monitoring and evaluation (US$2.3 million).This component
consisted of five groups of activities: (a) water quality monitoring; (b) aquatic productivity
monitoring; (c) coastal areas and land use monitoring; (d) biodiversity monitoring; and (e) socio-
economic monitoring.

1.5.7    Component 7: Project coordination and management (US$4.9 million). This
component provided the necessary resources, including the required technical assistance, for
effective project coordination and management at all levels.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1    A formal restructuring of the project, with amendments to the Development Credit
Agreement, was approved by the IDA Board on November 23, 20042 on a "no-objection" basis.
This "corrective" restructuring was the result of an intensive MTR started in May 2003 and
carried out jointly with representatives of the government and DANIDA. The PDO and the
original number of project components remained unchanged after restructuring but the project
was substantially reduced in size, especially the TA inputs to take into account the absorptive
capacity of each project province and the remaining time for implementation. Also, the relative
importance of the project's components also changed significantly and several components were

adjusted accordingly, in particular Component 1 (Mangrove Planting, Rehabilitation and
Protection), Component 3 (Social Support Program) and Component 5 (Resettlement Program) as
explained in Section 1.7 below. As a result the Key Performance Indicators to measure progress
towards the PDO were adjusted. Indicators covering marine productivity and coastal erosion
were formally replaced by the following: (a) the increase in mangrove plantation and protection
areas; (b) the decline in the barren areas in the Full Protection Zone (FPZ); and (c) an
improvement in the management and protection of the Mui Ca Mau National Park. In addition,
the risk of future encroachment into protected areas was to be reduced through alternative
sustainable livelihood development of vulnerable groups in priority communes and resettlement
sites and measured based on the reduction of absolute poverty in the vulnerable communes.

1.6.2    During the MTR, several options were considered including total or partial cancellation
of the Credit and formal restructuring of the project. Following extensive consultations with the
various stakeholders, it was felt that, despite the disastrous start-up, the project had produced
significant achievements in two provinces, Soc Trang and Tra Vinh, indicating that the objective
of the project was still valid and achievable. Also, canceling the project without completing the
resettlement component would have entailed a major reputational risk for both the government
and the Bank since people would have been left in very unsafe areas exposed to typhoons.

1.6.3    The main reasons for restructuring included the following: (a) unsatisfactory
implementation caused by weak management at the central level of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development (MARD), delays in mobilizing the technical assistance, and
unavailability of land for resettlements in Ca Mau and Bac Lieu Provinces; (b) poor institutional
design, which was identified by the Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in its QSA5 of
December 2002 as one of the main causes of slow implementation; (c) a detailed land survey
analysis available at the time of the restructuring and a reassessment of the government
reforestation program called for a reduction in mangrove planting and protection needs under the
project; and (d) dramatic changes in the socio-economic environment in the project area called for
a better prioritization and targeting of the project interventions (the changes included a dramatic
increase in land values in the BZ; an important intensification in land use in many areas of the BZ
which had become extensions of the Economic Zone (EZ); and an increasing risk for poor
households to become increasingly marginalized as more of the BZ became economically
attractive to wealthy investors).

1.6.4    Several key changes were introduced by the restructuring, including:

    (a) strengthened decentralization, through (i) empowerment of Provinces and delegation of
         authority to the provincial level. The four Provincial Project Management Units
         (PPMUs) were made fully accountable and managed four Special Accounts which
         represented 80 percent of the Credit; and (ii) the transfer of staff and resources from the
         Central Project Office (CPO) to the Project Field Coordination Unit (PFCU) which
         became the CPO2 and was moved from Ca Mau to Soc Trang, a more central location
         within the project area.

    (b) stream-lined implementation procedures, through strengthened procurement capacity at
         both central and provincial levels, simplified internal approval processes, and direct
         communication between PPMUs and the Bank, as opposed channeling communications
         through the CPO which was a source of important delays.

    (c) the introduction of flexible and performance-based implementation arrangements: the
         management information system (MIS) was further developed and used to monitor




                                                   4

        results and to reassign funds on a periodic basis to the best-performing provinces and
        communes.

    (d) enhanced targeting, with more emphasis on poverty reduction in the BZ by focusing
        project assistance on the most vulnerable households and by strengthening linkages
        between components to support poor communes and resettlement sites development.

    (e) amendment of the TA contract with: (i) a reduction of the contract amount by
        approximately 30 percent because of the late mobilization of the consultants (about 18
        months delays); and (ii) a shift of resources from international to national consultants as a
        result of increased availability of national expertise.

    (f) a significant down-sizing of project cost with the DANIDA Grant reduced from US$11.3
        million to US$7.3 million; IDA Credit savings (US$6 million) were transferred to
        VBARD to support the demand for credit of smallholders in the project area.

1.7. Other significant changes

1.7.1   The new mangrove planting program in the FPZ under the project was significantly
reduced from the original target of 17,600 ha to a revised target of around 4,000 ha. At the time
of restructuring, some 11,715 ha of mangrove forest cover had been gained in FPZ since 1995
(when the data on the coastal land area were prepared for the appraisal), much of which was the
result of planting under Program 661 (approximately 9,600 ha) since the project was appraised,
the balance (2,113 ha) had been planted under the project. In addition, a re-survey of the FPZ in
2003 provided the restructuring with a detailed land survey and analysis on which the revised
mangrove planting and protection needs were based. In contrast to Program 661 which was
implemented in large areas under the control of FFEs, it was agreed that the project would
maintain its small-farmer and participatory focus, mainly in remote and scattered planting areas,
and develop adapted technologies for planting on barren areas.

1.7.2   The resettlement program was reduced significantly based on a thorough DMS carried
out during implementation. This was fully in compliance with the Bank's resettlement policy and
monitored by independent consultants. Based on the results of the surveys and the project
resettlement criteria, the number of Project-affected households (PAHs) (to be relocated or
compensated for their land assets lost) was reduced from 2,149 households (at appraisal) to 1,452
households (at the project's closing).

1.7.3   The Technology Development and Transfer Program was focused on fewer communes
where the poor were most concentrated. To enhance the linkages with the SSP, the scope of the
TDT program was adjusted to cover only 33 priority communes (18 priority poor communes and
15 communes receiving re-settlers) out of the 48 originally included in the project at appraisal.
This reduction in the number of communes helped the Program better target the poorest
communes and those receiving re-settlers, thereby enhancing its quality and impact through
developing synergies between the respective components.

1.7.4   The implementation period was extended for 11 months to August 31, 2007, mainly to
allow for the resettlement program in Ca Mau and Bac Lieu to be completed.

1.7.5   Reallocation of funds: As a result of the project restructuring, the total project cost was
reduced from US$65.6 million to US$55.4 million. The funds released in the IDA Credit from
project restructuring (around US$6.0 million) were transferred to VBARD, which provided the
necessary funds from its own sources (i.e US$4.2 million) to make up the total cost of the



                                                  5

VBARD subcomponent (US$10.2 million). A partial cancellation of DANIDA grant funds of
approximately US$4 million was made (reducing the total grant from US$11.3 million to US$7.3
million equivalent).

1.7.6    Project cost by component. Table 1 presents the changes in project cost by components.
The main changes are as follows: (a) for mangrove planting, rehabilitation and protection, the
budget was substantially reduced as much was covered by the government's Program 661; (b) for
the SSP, the budget was slightly reduced, though the expenditure per commune was higher as a
result of the reduction in the number of communes from 48 to 33; (c) for the resettlement
program, the budget was increased to take into account the increases in the value of land (and
therefore the amount of compensation) and an increase in the construction costs for housing and
infrastructure in resettlement sites; and (d) for project coordination and management, the budget
was substantially increased as the result of the extension of the project implementation period and
the intensive training needs associated with decentralization to the provincial and local levels.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1    Project Preparation. The project preparation was exceptionally long, having started in
1995 and only being completed in 2000. During this period, there were many changes in the
project area; in particular, there were spontaneous and uncontrollable changes in farming patterns
and practices by farmers in the BZ as agriculture in general, and aquaculture in particular, were
intensified in response to improved economic incentives and opportunities. In such a fast
changing area, the data on land use, farming models and social aspects that were used at appraisal
were quickly becoming out-of-date after delays in project implementation in the first three years.

2.1.2    Project Design. As stated in the PAD, project design was built on lessons learned from
experience with other natural resource management projects financed by the Bank and other
donors in Vietnam and in the Southeast Asia Region: (a) the need to complement forest
protection with addressing the underlying social causes of encroachment; the project design was
centered on the balancing of environmental improvement and protection with the livelihood needs
of people dependent on natural resources; (b) to improve the income status of the adjoining
communities, particularly the more vulnerable (poorer) ones required a combination of extension,
credit and social support tied in with environmental promotion, policy and contractual measures
to ensure that incentives exist for improvement and protection; and



                                                   6

(c) to coordinate and manage a complex project with seven components, implementation needed
to be decentralized to the provincial level.

2.1.3   It should be noted that the project was designed during the 1990s when Vietnam had not
had much experience with Bank-financed projects and this was one of the first IDA projects for
Vietnam in the forestry sector. The key weaknesses in project design were: (a) a poor
appreciation of the institutional arrangements of the forest sector, which led to a design heavily
dependent on TA which, through procurement delays in turn contributed complexity to what was
already a challenging implementation environment (both physically and institutionally); and (b)
the lack of reliable land survey on which to base the assessment of mangrove planting needs.

2.1.4   Quality at Entry. As assessed by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in its Quality of
                                           3
Supervision Assessment (QSA5) in 2002 , the poor institutional design of the project was the
fundamental problem that caused the serious implementation delays. The project design was too
complex institutionally for provinces with weak absorptive capacity. Moreover, it called for the
employment of 500 staff (from the central to commune levels) under a single TA contract.
Virtually all of the project implementation depended on this large TA contract to be financed
from the DANIDA grant, which only became effective in February 2001 (some 15 months after
the approval of the IDA Credit), thus severely handicapping implementation.

2.2. Implementation

2.2.1   Overall. The overall implementation of the project is considered to have been
satisfactory, with the PDO being achieved. After a prolonged delay at its onset and a deep
restructuring prepared by the government and its development partners, the project made good
progress and disbursed most of the IDA Credit and the DANIDA Grant over the remaining four-
year period (from the start of the restructuring process in May 2003 to the closing of the project in
August 2007). By the Closing Date, the project had met all of its restructured output targets.
Details of project implementation are presented in Annex 2. To summarize, the project
implementation period can be divided into three parts:

  (a)   December 1999 - May 2003. Project performance was poor with a very slow start-up
         and disbursement rate (i.e., only 5 percent of IDA Credit had been disbursed by the end
         of 2002). There were long delays in the preparation and signing of the DANIDA Grant
         Agreement as a result of which the Grant only became effective in February 2001, about
         15 months after IDA Credit approval. The main constraint to project implementation
         during this period was the negotiations of the large TA contract (around US$7 million),
         which took more than two years to conclude as the MARD wanted to negotiate unit rates
         under the Quality- and Cost-Based Selection method. The issues were passed to the
         Ministry of Planning and Investment and the Ministry of Finance, and finally to the
         Prime Minister for a final decision. The TA contract negotiations were resolved finally
         and the contract was signed in October 2002, about 35 months after the Credit approval.
         During this period, almost no activities were implemented in the field because of the
         absence of TA. In June 2002, the rating of the project's "implementation progress" was
         down-graded to "unsatisfactory" status. Also, the results from the internal review by the
         Bank's QAG in December 2002 rated the project as "unsatisfactory", mainly because of
         its poor design which led to very slow implementation over a long period.

  (b) May 2003 - December 2005. Project performance started to pick-up but was still
      lagging until June 2004 when the Implementation Status Report (ISR) rating for
      "implementation progress" was restored to "satisfactory" status. The MTR, carried out in
      May 2003, concluded that a successful outcome for the project was at risk because of the
      slow pace of implementation and the delays in implementing the TA contract. A
      restructuring mission from IDA and DANIDA visited Vietnam in July 2003 to assist the
      government in restructuring the project. In parallel with the restructuring efforts, changes
      in project management and supervision started to yield significant performance
      improvement, mainly in the provinces. On the government side, decentralization of
      project implementation to project provinces was fully implemented, in accordance with
      the original design, by a more decentralized CPO2. On the Bank side, the Task Team
      Leader was also decentralized to the Country Office in Hanoi. With all these efforts,
      confidence in the project was restored, and by June 2004, when all seven components
      were being implemented, disbursement reached 13 percent of the total Credit.
      Disbursement reached 27 percent by the end of June 2005 and 51 percent by the end of
      2005.

  (c) January 2006 - August 2007. Project implementation was at full speed. The Credit's
      Closing Date was extended by eleven months to August, 31 2007. By the Closing Date,
      the project had met all of its restructured output targets and the Credit and DANIDA
      grant funds had also been fully disbursed. This was the result of three factors: (i) the TA
      team was fully in place; (ii) a fully decentralized implementation system existed, with
      greater responsibility for procurement and decision-making at the provincial level; and
      (iii) intensive supervision was provided from the government and the Bank.

2.2.2 Several factors had an impact on the implementation of the project:

  (a) Weak project management. Project management encountered serious challenges at the
      outset because of the heavy degree of dependence on the TA. After the restructuring and
      once the contracted TA was in place, the project management began to improve
      significantly. Several factors assisted in improving the management performance: (i) the
      shift to full decentralization decided at the project restructuring; (ii) the down-sizing of
      the large TA contract, and the shift of resources from international to national consultants
      as local expertise became more available in the Mekong Delta; and (iii) the establishment
      of the CPO2 in Soc Trang, a more central place to the project area. A Project
      Coordinator and the TA team were located in CPO2 which facilitated quicker decision-
      making and management follow-up action.

  (b) Lack of coordination with the government's planting program. One of the main issues
      encountered during the restructuring was the large difference between the planting target
      established at appraisal and the actual availability of land. The planting target under the
      project was reduced from 17,600 ha in the FPZ to 3,898 ha (22 percent of the original
      appraisal target) as most of the suitable areas had been planted under the Program 661
      because of the initial delays in project implementation.

  (c) The lack of experience in mangrove planting. The technical models for difficult planting
      sites had to be developed and MARD cost norms were too low and unattractive to local
      communities, especially for areas having poor accessibility.

  (d) Building community participation took longer than anticipated. The involvement of local
      communities and smallholders in mangrove planting, maintenance and protection was a
      good means of mobilizing community participation in forest protection and development;




                                                 8

        however, it took considerable time for the PPMUs to prepare, sign, manage and monitor
        small contracts with local farmer groups and/or communities.

  (e)   The lack of available land and counterpart funds for resettlement. The success of the
        project depended heavily on the success of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), which
        was necessary to achieve the objectives of poverty alleviation (by improving the
        livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households) and mangrove protection (by decreasing
        human pressure on the resources of this eco-system). However, in 2004 progress was
        well below the appraisal targets mainly because: (i) the slow approval of Provincial
        People's Committees (PPCs) for replacement land and counterpart funds to be used for
        the compensation and rehabilitation; and (ii) the problem of availability of replacement
        land for PAHs. These issues were particularly acute in Bac Lieu and Ca Mau, and their
        resolution was one of the restructuring conditions.

  (f)   The lack of integration of project components during implementation. Because of the
        complexity of the project design (seven components implemented in three very different
        zones - the FPZ, the BZ and the EZ - across four provinces) and the important delays in
        implementation, provincial officials tended to focus on the physical targets of each
        component and lacked an overall integrated vision of the project. In 2005, the PPMUs
        innovated greatly in concentrating attention and resources on the resettlement sites and
        introducing the RASDAPs, the main purposes of which were: (i) to prepare and
        implement resettlement site-specific livelihood action plans, with support activity
        recommendations prioritized and attached to clear time-frames, budgets and available
        resources; (ii) to identify and develop livelihood options for resettlement households,
        with specific consideration and resources put toward households with and without
        production land; and (iii) to inform the monitoring and planning of related resettlement
        component activities. RASDAPs were also used to align TDT training and
        demonstration support as well as vocational training for resettlement sites.


2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1   Design. The monitoring indicators were presented in the PAD. A separate component
(Component 6) was dedicated to M&E, which was largely TA dependent, to cover a base-line
survey, environmental and socio-economic monitoring and evaluation studies. During the project
restructuring, the indicators were reviewed and revised to be more practical and measurable
during the remaining period, though these were rather too simple to capture all project impacts as
they did not measure the quality of mangrove planting and the linkages between poverty
reduction and forest protection. A revised log-frame was discussed and agreed upon during the
MTR.

2.3.2   Implementation. A practical and effective MIS was established to provide timely data
for project monitoring and management. It was based principally on the output indicators
reflected in the project log-frame, supplemented by others that provided progress and feedback
information to assist in managing the project. While initially the MIS was managed primarily by
the TA and the PPMUs, it was later linked to a monthly commune-level report that allowed a
more timely response to local issues. Based partly on the information in the MIS, monthly,
quarterly and annual reports from the CPO and PPMUs were prepared using a standard format.
The required information was collected at the commune level and transmitted to the district, the
PPMU, and finally to the CPO/CPO2 for consolidation and reporting. Progress reports prepared
by the PPMUs showed continuous improvement throughout the project.




                                                  9

2.3.3    Utilization. The project M&E system was delayed in its establishment and operations by
the late arrival of the TA but was well utilized to support the monitoring and supervision of the
project. Input data for the M&E system were mainly derived from progress monitoring reports
prepared by the CPO and PPMUs, the Socio-economic Special Study, the Water Quality
Monitoring Study, project evaluation activities carried out by the TA, and the MIS maintained by
CPO2. As a result of the late completion of the base-line survey (in 2005), the TA team prepared
an Interim Project Evaluation Report (TA PER) in December 2006: (a) to report on the existing
data and the current state of knowledge on the evaluation of project activities; and (b) to develop
recommendations and an Action Plan for future project evaluation activities and a relevant guide
to future project implementation activities. The Action Plan was implemented in the first half of
2007, including the collection of primary and secondary data in relation to project evaluation
indicators. Supplementary data was collected through surveys of resettled households,
CAPs/VAPs and EMDF households.

2.3.4    By the Credit's closing, monitoring data showed that: (a) the coastal erosion area was
substantially reduced by 40 percent and the length and the area of coastline accreting was
increased by 20 percent; (b) natural near-shore aquatic resources such as sea crabs and blood
clams re-appeared and increased in some places (the most obvious was at My Long Nam
commune of Tra Vinh); and (c) the incidence of poverty decreased by 38 percent and average
annual incomes increased by 55 percent. Average per capita incomes have increased steadily in
all provinces and poverty rates have decreased significantly.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1    Project implementation was in compliance with the Bank's safeguards and fiduciary
requirements. Regular and interim supervision missions together with frequent dialogues
between task team members and the PPMUs and the CPO were conducted to ensure adequate
monitoring and supervision.

  (a)    Environmental safeguards. In the initial period, because of the delays in the TA
         recruitment, the Bank used its own staff for monitoring environmental compliance and
         the activities were later taken over by the TA and the Departments of Natural Resources
         and Environment (DONREs). Subsequently, the construction of small works has
         followed DONREs' procedures and the Bank's safeguards. As part of the environmental
         monitoring under the project, the provincial DONREs were supported and involved in
         environmental monitoring activities (i.e., monitoring of water quality). All resettlement
         sites have been closely monitored for treatment of waste-water and solid waste disposal.

  (b)    Social safeguards. Key social safeguards issues were the implementation of the EMDP
         and the RAP, which were prepared in accordance with the Bank's OD 4.20 on
         Indigenous People and OP 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. The former was very
         successful and highly appreciated by local Khmers and central and local authorities
         because it has not only helped improve the social life and spiritual value of the local
         Khmer but also contributed to improving social stability. The latter, which was
         monitored by an independent consultant and the Bank's Social Specialists, was also
         successful although there were some concerns regarding the restoration of livelihoods in
         the resettlement sites completed in the last year of implementation. To mitigate these
         risks an agreement was reached with local authorities to secure additional budgetary
         resources for a period of 18 months upon the project closing to support these resettlement
         sites.




                                                  10

  (c)    Fiduciary safeguards. Financial management (including auditing) was satisfactory
         during the implementation period. Negotiations of the TA contract were seriously
         prolonged because the government persisted in a two-year effort to change provisions of
         the contract. However, the whole process was transparent and in compliance with the
         Bank's procurement guidelines. After project restructuring, most procurement activities
         took place at the provincial level and were satisfactorily handled by the PPMUs (mostly
         for small-value contracts). The use of Community Supervision Boards in supervision
         and monitoring of project investments at the commune level appeared effective in
         enhancing the transparency and accountability of the PPMUs with regard to procurement
         and financial management.

  (d)    Anti-collusion efforts. One case of collusion in bidding for small works was found in
         Ca Mau in 2004. It was investigated by Ca Mau PPMU and corrective measures were
         taken against the colluding bidders. As a result, three bidders were banned from
         participating in all procurement under the project. The names of those bidders were also
         published in national and/or provincial newspapers and other public media in the project
         area. An Action Plan for dealing with collusion in procurement was developed and
         agreed with CPO and PPMUs during the seventh supervision mission in January 2005
         and closely followed up to the end of the project.


2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1    With regard to forest maintenance and protection, after the project closed, the provinces
used national funds from the Program 661 to continue financing forest maintenance and
protection activities in the project area. Forest protection contracts with local households have
been maintained. Ca Mau also allocated funds to the MCMNP to continue activities in the
approved management plan for the Park.

2.5.2    The project's investments in the SSP, TDT, EMDP and resettlement sites have been
handed over to local communities and the respective government institutions in accordance with
the government's regulations for use and maintenance. Training has also been provided to local
communities for effective utilization and operations. The provinces are using their budgets to
finance operations and maintenance, and are committed to continue supporting resettled
households after the project closed to stabilize their new livelihoods.

2.5.3    The government is committed to using its own funds to maintain the project structure for
about one year after closing of the Credit to complete its internal inspections, take care of the
project's investments and consolidate project impacts. It is clear that capacity building under the
project directly assisted the government at different levels in creating institutional capacity to
manage future projects. For instance, at the central level the CPO has been assigned by MARD
to manage the implementation of a similar project (Forest Development and Livelihood
Improvement in the Central Highlands, financed by the Asian Development Bank).

2.5.4    Regarding new operations in the project area after the CWPDP, the GTZ4 is financing a
project in Soc Trang: "Management of natural resources in the coastal zone in Soc Trang with a
total investment cost of around US$5 million starting from March 2007 to 2012. The government
is also in the process of preparing a new National Program for Coastal Wetlands for the next ten
years.

3.    Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objective, Design and Implementation

3.1.1    With regard to the country's priorities, the objective of the project remained valid
throughout the project cycle and was in line with the new National Forestry Development
Strategy for the period of 2006-2020 approved by government in February 2007. The project's
objective was also consistent with the government's National Strategy for Socio-Economic
Development for 2001-2010 and the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy.

3.1.2    The objective, design and implementation of the project were also fully consistent with
the Bank's current country and sectoral assistance strategy, as described in the Country
                     5
Partnership Strategy . The goal of Pillar III of the Strategy is the improved management of
forestry, biodiversity, land and water resources, where the Bank Group's activities will include
support to: (a) an increase in the coverage of forests and an improvement in the management of
Special Use Forests; and (b) the improvement of the coverage of critical natural habitats in
protected areas.

3.1.3    The project's objective was highly relevant; the project was based on the careful
diagnosis of a series of inter-locking problems, the solution to which represented a development
priority of the highest order. In a dynamic environment in terms of natural resource use,
modifications to the project's design and implementation structure were introduced to maintain
their high level of relevance. The project remained important to achieving sectoral and national
development objectives. The importance of restoration of mangrove forests and their role in
natural disaster management was forcefully emphasized by the tsunami catastrophe of December
2005. As a result, the project was highly relevant in its objective, design and implementation
throughout its life.

3.2. Achievement of the Project Development Objective

3.2.1    The project achieved its development objective and met the revised targets.

3.2.2    The increase in mangrove plantation and protection areas and the decline in the barren
areas in the FPZ, as evidenced by:

  (a)    the increase in forest cover in the FPZ (from around 50 percent in 2000 to 96 percent in
         2007 as a result of the project and the Program 661);

  (b)    the effective protection of mangroves in the FPZ (through protection contracts with
         smallholders supported by the project and with SFEs under the Program 661);

  (c)    the improved institutional capacity for mangrove planting and protection at the local level
         (the boundary demarcation between the FPZ and BZ in the field and the up-grading of
         forest guard stations with the necessary equipment for effective forest protection);

  (d)    the improved environmental protection awareness among local forest rangers and
         communities and the decline in forest law violations in the project area; and

  (e)    the upgrading of Dat Mui Nature Reserve to the MCMNP by the Prime Minister's
         Decision No. 142 dated July 7, 2003;

                                                  12

  (f)    the preparation, adoption, and implementation of a sound management plan for the Park;

  (g)    the study of biodiversity for the Park in 2007; and

  (h)    the improved facilities, equipment, and necessary infrastructure for the Park for effective
         patrolling and forest protection.

3.2.3    Even though the reduction in coastal erosion was no longer a formal KPI for the project,
we note that the coastal erosion area in Ca Mau was substantially reduced by 40 percent and the
length and the area of coastline accreting was increased by 20 percent during the same period.
Similarly, there are anecdotal evidences that natural near-shore aquatic resources (such as sea
crabs and blood clams) re-appeared and increased in some places (the most obvious was at My
Long Nam commune of Tra Vinh).

3.2.4    The reduction of the incidence of absolute poverty in the vulnerable communes, as
evidenced by:

  (a)    the introduction and implementation of an effective TDT program in poor communes and
         the implementation of RASDAPs in communes receiving re-settlers;

  (b)    the improved land tenure for BZ farmers through the issuance of LURCs for residential
         and productive lands;

  (c)    the improved access to commercial credit (provided by VBARD) and/or to the project
         Revolving Fund (managed by VBSP through the Vietnam Women's Union - VWU);

  (d)    the preparation and successful implementation of the SSP and EMDP in poor and Khmer
         communes, which significantly improved the quality of life for vulnerable groups and the
         Khmer minority; and

  (e)    the improved livelihoods for vulnerable groups in a more sustainable way through
         enhancing agriculture and aquaculture practices and improving and maintaining
         productivity and diversity in the BZ.

3.3. Efficiency

3.3.1    Despite initial delays, the project was able to catch up and achieved its development
objectives with an extension of the Credit and Grant of less than one year. The results of the
economic analysis6 carried out in May 2007 show an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the
overall project of 17 percent and a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$14.2 million compared to the
ERR of 14 percent calculated at appraisal. The higher ERR is due principally to a combination of
the reduced project costs (which were scaled down by US$10.2 million), the increased
investments in smallholder credit and the impact of the TDT program (which was supported by
an active training, workshop and cross visit program). The long-term benefits from the increase
in the land area (from reduced erosion and increased accretion) and the restoration of the
mangrove systems in the project area (which are difficult to quantify) are not reflected in this
analysis. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the ERR is quite robust. With a reduction in
benefits of 20 percent for all categories, the ERR estimates remain at 14 percent. However, the
project is sensitive to a reduction in the price of shrimp as a 10 percent decrease in prices reduces
the ERR to 15 percent.

3.3.2   There are many important unquantifiable benefits generated by the project, including:

    ·   the improved environmental awareness and enforcement capacity and the decline in the
        number of violations of forestry law across provinces;

    ·   the restored and improved biodiversity and coastal protection values of the FPZ which
        needs some time (outside the length of the project) and a detailed study to measure with
        any confidence;

    ·   secure land tenure (through the provision of LURCs) that allow beneficiaries to obtain
        commercial credit, make long-term investments and improve their stewardship of the
        land;

    ·   the quality of life indicators of vulnerable groups including poor, ethnic Khmer minority
        especially for those who do not have production land;

    ·   the social benefits derived from the creation of new employment- and income-generating
        opportunities for beneficiaries;

    ·   the knowledge gained through the training of government staff, especially at the local
        level, and the training of farmers (both men and women) that will be retained and used in
        future endeavors;

    ·   the improved institutional capacity for managing future development projects; and

    ·   the spill-over effect from project-supported research that will be used by other
        development projects and by the government extension service for the benefit of all
        farmers.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1   Overall, the outcome of the project is considered to be moderately satisfactory. However,
if based on the revised targets agreed at the time of the restructuring, it could be considered to be
satisfactory. The highly successful results of the last four years of implementation after the
restructuring far outweigh the significant shortcomings of the start-up period. The objective of
the project has maintained its overall relevance and remained fully consistent with the country's
development priorities and the Bank's Country and Sectoral Assistance Strategies. Institutional
development and local capacity was substantially achieved through the multi-sector and
participatory approaches introduced by the project.

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1   Poverty Impact. The project had significant positive social impacts, particularly on
poverty reduction in the poorest areas, including increasing household incomes and creating
employment opportunities7. The project directly benefited about 20,000 local households and

7
    The project contributed significantly in the improvement since IDA and DANIDA resources
    represented substantial incremental resources allocated to the most vulnerable communes. On average,
    a poor commune received about US$35,000 per year from government Program 135 but about twice as
    much from the project investments (i.e., US$70,000 per year).



                                                    14

indirectly 100,000 households through research and extension, training and dissemination.
According to surveys by the TA in early 2007 before the project closed, poverty rates in
vulnerable communes had decreased by 38 percent and average annual incomes had increased by
55 percent. The majority of resettled households considered that the quality of their lives in the
new resettlement sites is much better than it was in the FPZ. Small-scale infrastructure provided
by the project through the implementation of the CAPS/VAPs was important in meeting the basic
needs of local communities, including vulnerable groups. With improvements in access to
farming technologies, critical infrastructure and markets, the livelihoods of local communities
have been significantly improved and are likely to be more sustainable.

3.5.2    Gender aspects. The involvement of women in training under the TDT component
appears to have been reasonable, reaching between 10-25 percent participation (and in some cases
reaching 50 percent or more, for example on livestock raising and credit activities). The project
also made a particular effort to ensure that LURCs included the names of husband and wife,
which gave them an equal say over the use of the land and the decision on how it should be used
for collateral. Improvements in health and sanitation conditions, literacy and other social aspects
particularly benefited women and children. The project included poverty reduction and increased
household incomes, and these can be expected to have positive impacts on women's lives.

3.5.3    Ethnic minority development. There are high populations of the Khmer minority in the
project area of Soc Trang, Tra Vinh and Bac Lieu. The project targeted them through the
preparation and implementation of an EMDP, as part of Component 3, specifically to support the
social and cultural lives of Khmer minority households. The EMDP was prepared using
participatory approaches and mainly focused on 17 Khmer pagodas, including the up-
grading/expansion of classrooms for Khmer children, the construction of crematorium, and the
procurement of Khmer traditional racing boats and musical instruments used in festivals. In total,
an estimated 5,000 Khmer minority households have benefited from the EMDP and the
implementation of the EMDP was well received and highly appreciated by local Khmer
communities. In addition to the EMDP, the ethnic minority communes also received other
project support such as technical training, TDT research and extension, issuance of LURCs and
improved access to micro-credit.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4    The project made a considerable contribution to strengthening local institutional capacity
through an integrated approach to development activities. It was the first Bank-financed project
in the provinces of such magnitude with many investments in capacity building. It brought about
spill-over effects from the TA to all levels. The decentralization and empowerment to provinces
also boosted the capacity of local staff and exposed them to new working experiences. Training
and equipment provided to MARD, the Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development
(DARDs), DONREs and sub-regional research centers has not only strengthened their capabilities
but also promoted cross-working relationship across different provincial departments and sectors.
From the provincial to commune levels, there have been improvements in coordination and
management and dealing with multi-sectoral and participatory approaches. PPMU staff returned
to their agencies after the project closed and are expected to continue to use the skills gained from
this project.

3.5.5    Another significant institutional change brought about by the project was the
establishment of contractual arrangements with small farmers for preparing mangrove seedlings,
planting and maintenance. This has served the project well, and the government has been
encouraged to continue to use this form of institutional arrangement.

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.6    Provision of rural credit. The need to provide credit to poor farmers and re-settlers to
enable them to restore their livelihoods was recognized during project design. Therefore, in its
design, the project was expected to provide commercial credit through VBARD (i.e., US$10
million in total, of which US$4 million was to come from VBARD's own funds and US$6
million from the Credit) and micro credit through a small Revolving Fund managed by VBSP
(i.e., around US$0.9 million financed entirely by the DANIDA Grant funds). While VBARD
accepts LURCs as collateral for commercial loans, some poor farmers and re-settlers were not
able to access commercial loans from VBARD. Although recognizing these constraints to poor
farmers and re-settlers, the project decided not to attempt to intervene in the lending policy or
appraisal procedures of VBARD because such an approach would distort the rural credit market.
Consequently, many poor farmers and re-settlers had difficulty in generating the necessary funds
to invest in their production. Also, as the scale of the RF was quite small, it hardly met all credit
demand of the poor and re-settlers.

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1    A resettlement household survey carried out in the first half of 2007 indicates that the
average monthly income in resettlement sites had increased by 23 percent since the 2005 survey.
In addition, 41 percent of resettled households indicate that their household income had increased
since relocation to the resettlement site. Poverty rates have decreased since resettlement, with a
reported poverty rate of 12 percent among interviewed resettled households. This compares to a
reported poverty rate of 22 percent prior to resettlement. Increases in household incomes and
reductions in poverty have been accompanied by changes in the structure and sources of
household income. Since resettlement there has been an increase in the number of households
practicing agriculture and aquaculture and a reduction in the number of households practicing
fishing. Reliance on hired labor remained relatively unchanged; however, the negative links
between hired labor and poverty and hired labor and lack of production land are less pronounced
than found in 2005. The majority of the interviewed resettled households stated that their quality
of life in resettlement sites had been improved.

3.6.2    An EMDF household survey and a CAP/VAP survey carried out in the same period with
the resettlement household survey show that a high proportion of ethnic minority households
were satisfied with the type and quality of EMDF activities and reported that the activities had
resulted in improvements to their lives and helped to conserve their traditional culture (i.e.,
crematoriums, traditional musical instruments and traditional racing boats for festivals). The
CAP/VAP survey showed high rates of utilization of all types of CAP/VAP infrastructure among
vulnerable groups, particularly poor households. There was a very high reported satisfaction of
beneficiaries with CAP/VAP activities. Over half of the interviewed households reported a direct
or indirect increase in household income as a result of CAP/VAP activity implementation, while
over three-quarters reported an improved quality of life. Improvements in village paths, electricity
supply and canals were the activities that resulted in the most significant benefits.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.1.1   The project had positive impacts on mangrove restoration, protection and development,
and on poverty reduction, and thereby: (a) reduced forest resources dependency in the poorest
areas; and (b) established the initial linkages between forest protection/conservation and
livelihood development at local levels. The early achievements, though important, are still fragile
and need to be maintained and strengthened. This is generally true for most conservation and
development projects, which often require time and consistent effort to create a sustainable
impact. However, significant achievements have been made in institutional development and
capacity building at local levels and there is a strong commitment of the provinces in maintaining
project development outcomes. There is still, a high risk of underfunding and/or untimely
funding for continued activities after the project closed as these provinces are poor and their
annual budgets are heavily dependent on central funding, which in turn depends on the country's
economic growth and stability.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Unsatisfactory

5.1.1 The design process was exceptionally long (1995-1999) with a change of the task team
leader at the end. The main weaknesses of project design included: (a) poor assessment of the
mangrove planting needs target, with little coordination with the Program 661; and (b) too much
reliance on external TA (about 500 positions from the central to commune levels to be packaged
under one single contract with a total cost of above US$7 million). The poor institutional design
of the project was the fundamental problem causing serious implementation delays. In addition,
project design was too complex institutionally for the provinces with weak absorptive capacity.

(b)     Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2   The quality of supervision is considered to have been "moderately unsatisfactory" before
project restructuring and "satisfactory" after restructuring. Despite little progress in the first three
years of implementation, the ratings for the Development Objective and Implementation Progress
were "satisfactory" during this period and the rating for Implementation Progress was only down-
graded to "unsatisfactory" in June 2002. This indicates that supervision was less rigorous than
necessary and that management was somewhat slow in demanding corrective action.

5.1.3   The Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA5) second-stage review in December 2002
gave a rating of "4" ("unsatisfactory") to the overall supervision of the project, noting with
concern that the sector and country management performance had been "unsatisfactory" in its
support of the Task Team (which was rated as "marginally satisfactory") in the early years of
project implementation. Task team performance, was rated "marginally satisfactory". Most of the
severe problems faced by the project appeared to QAG to cut across most of the portfolio. The
assessment found that "The project in a large sense never got started" and concluded that the



                                                  17

rating for Implementation Progress should have been "unsatisfactory" as soon as this was
recognized. The main problem was the large TA contract, which was not signed until October
2002 but "... probably should have been negotiated before Board presentation (November 1999)
and signed the next day." The Assessment did not confine itself to supervision, discussing
fundamental aspects of project design (including the project's apparent lack of connection with
the government's mangrove replanting support through the Program 661) and country portfolio
management. It emphasized that the MTR scheduled for early 2003 should review the TA
contract and decide on whether (and how) to introduce changes to the project in order to move it
out from its "unsatisfactory" rating, noting that time was of the essence in taking radical steps or
improvements mandated by the Bank's rules.

5.1.4    The quality of supervision was much improved after the MTR in May 2003 following the
change of the Bank Task Team Leader (TTL) and is considered to have been "satisfactory" to the
end. With the change of the TTL location from Washington DC to the Hanoi Country Office,
corrective actions were taken by the Task Team and Bank Management and the quality of
supervision was significantly enhanced as a result of the more proactive field missions and timely
review and responses, which accelerated the pace of implementation dramatically and resolved
threats to the achievement of the project's development objective. Supervision of fiduciary and
safeguards was also diligent with proper follow-ups and concrete agreed action plans.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4    Although the quality of project design was poor and there were significant shortcomings
in the initial years of project supervision, the Bank made substantial efforts to turn around
performance and provide effective support toward the achievement of development outcomes.
Therefore, the overall Bank performance is considered to have been "moderately satisfactory"
because of a successful corrective restructuring following the MTR which allowed the project to
achieve the project development objective in a little less than four years.


5.2      Borrower Performance


(a)      Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1    The government's performance in supporting project implementation is considered to
have been "moderately unsatisfactory" before restructuring and "satisfactory" after restructuring.
The government was unable to negotiate and conclude the TA contract in the first two years,
which resulted in extremely slow implementation and eventually the restructuring of the project.


(b)      Implementing Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Implementing Agencies: The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
                             The Provinces of Tra Vinh, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu and Ca Mau.




                                                  18

5.2.2    The performance of the implementing agencies is considered as "moderately
unsatisfactory" before restructuring and "satisfactory" after restructuring. Before restructuring,
there were long delays due to the problems associated with the TA selection managed by MARD
and little decentralization was made to project provinces. After restructuring, full
decentralization resulted in improvements in the performance of all PPMUs. Initially, Tra Vinh
was the only province that had always been on track with "highly satisfactory" performance,
followed by Soc Trang with "satisfactory" performance proven in its excellent resettlement and
social development work. Subsequently, Ca Mau's performance was also considered to be
"satisfactory" based on its very good performance in the last three years and given the province
has the largest program to implement. The performance of Bac Lieu is considered as "moderately
satisfactory" because of its delays and lower quality work in comparison with other provinces,
however, this province only accounted for 9.6 percent of the total Credit.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3    The Overall Borrower Performance is considered to have been "moderately satisfactory",
based on its performance during preparation and implementation, and with the specific following
references to:

    ·    Acceleration after project restructuring. The implementing agencies, through successful
         decentralization by MARD, made excellent efforts and improvements in implementation
         after project restructuring. The PDO and restructured targets were achieved with an
         extension of the project's life of less than one year. The IDA Credit and DANIDA Grant
         funds have also been fully disbursed.

    ·    Cooperation with the Bank team. The concerned ministries, central agencies and
         implementing agencies cooperated closely with the Bank during project implementation
         and supervision. Most of the actions agreed during supervision missions or
         recommended in audit and procurement post review reports were followed up in a
         satisfactory manner or implemented (although in some cases with significant delays).


6.       Lessons Learned

6.1.1    The major lessons learned from the project are:

(a)      Linking forest protection with rural livelihood development is a more effective approach
to protection of critical forest areas than relying on enforcement alone. However, this approach
often requires a complex project design and strong local capacity to implement it. Ultimately,
coastal wetland protection is not just about planting trees. The people using the protected natural
resources must be involved and their livelihoods improved, and there is no simple way to do that.

(b)      Decentralization in management decision-making to the provincial level and below is the
key to the success of integrated conservation and development projects because coordination and
communication among different sector agencies are more effective at local levels. Linked to
decentralization are the accountability and the ability to shift resources from the center to the
provinces and between provinces based on performance.




                                                   19

(c)      Simplicity in project design is critical to avoid a heavy dependency of implementation on
external technical assistance. Local absorptive capacity should be carefully considered to match
with the complexity of the design.

(d)      Enhanced targeting of activities for the most vulnerable yields greater impacts on
poverty. The introduction of the RASDAPs integrating all components of the project to support
resettlement site-specific livelihood action plans has been considered as "best practice" by
MARD and is likely to be mainstreamed into regular resettlement programs.

(e)      An early MTR is important to assess and make necessary changes to cope with new
developments. Restructuring should not be seen as failure but a means to up-date a project design
and to improve the quality of design and implementation in order to achieve the PDO.

(f)      The number of provinces should be limited to a manageable size to ensure good quality
and project management. For complicated projects, there should not be more than 4-5 provinces
per project.

(g)      The inclusion of a credit line in project design will not only increase complexity in
implementation but also may result in possible inconsistencies in the lending policy of a
commercial bank like VBARD. It would be better if all demands for rural commercial credit
were to be addressed in a single rural finance operation to improve VBARD's performance and
avoid possible distortions of the financial market. This recommendation has been implemented
by the country team, which has limited the use of lines of credit in the rural sector to a single
operation, the Third Rural Finance Project, approved by the Bank's Board in May 2008.

(h)      Complementarity between Grant and Credit resources, the former financing "soft"
activities targeted to vulnerable communities and ethnic minorities and the latter financing access
to basic infrastructure for the benefit of a larger population, contributes to enhancing the quality
of development and reduces inequalities among project beneficiaries.

7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.1    A summary of the Borrower's Completion Report is included in Annex 7. Overall, the
Borrower agreed with the ICR's findings, assessments and ratings. More specifically, the
Borrower concluded that the project has significantly contributed to (a) the protection and
development of the remaining area of mangrove forests with high biodiversity in the country, (b)
the effective environmental protection including the reduction in coastal erosion in the project
provinces, (c) the efficient rural development and improvement of the living conditions of coastal
people, especially the poor and the Khmer ethnic minority groups both in terms of materials and
spiritual life. The Government highly appreciated the outcomes of the project and the assistance
of the World Bank and DANIDA in project implementation.

(b) Co-financier

7.1.2    DANIDA, in principle, agreed with the assessments of the ICR. The CWPDP is a
complex project which was seriously delayed at the beginning but went back on-track later after a
successful project restructuring in 2004.




                                                   20

7.1.3   DANIDA is pleased to see that DANIDA funds were used for supporting the protection
of coastal mangroves and for improving the livelihoods of the coastal poor including the Khmer
ethnic minority communities. The results of the project have demonstrated conclusively that
environmental protection should go hand-in-hand with the development of alternative livelihoods
for the poor who are using the resources unsustainably, and a balance must be achieved between
regulation and incentives to allow the stakeholders to plan for the long term.

7.1.4   To enhance the sustainability of the project's impact, DANIDA strongly recommends that
the government should continue building on the results of the project to improve further the
livelihoods of the poor, especially the resettlement people and Khmer communities, and to ensure
consistency of future programs in the project area.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

7.1.5   There were no comments received.

Component 1: Mangrove planting, rehabilitation and protection

2.1 The component achieved its revised targets of new mangrove planting, maintenance and
protection. The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Increased area and greater diversity of mangrove forests in the FPZ through planting: During
2000-2007, 4,662 ha of mangroves were planted in the FPZ by the project, which were
complementary to approximately 20,000 ha planted by Program 661, bringing the total forest
cover in the FPZ to more than 96 percent (increasing from around 50 percent in 2000). Most
barren areas in the BZ suitable for mangrove planting were also planted (around 1,214 ha
including 980 ha of scattered tree planting). Project provinces have also established two seed
stands in Soc Trang, three concentrated nurseries in Tra Vinh and Soc Trang, and many
household nurseries in the project area to supply large quantities of seedlings for the project's
planting activities. New plantings contained a wider range of mangrove species. The planting
activities have resulted in positive impacts on the environment; for example, the coastal erosion
area was substantially reduced (by 40 percent) and the length and the area of coastline accreting
was increased by 20 percent during the above period. Natural near-shore aquatic resources such
as sea crabs and blood clams re-appeared and increased in some places (i.e., the most obvious
was at My Long Nam commune of Tra Vinh).

(b) Improved protection and maintenance of forests in the FPZ by local institutions: All existing
mangroves in the FPZ of the project were under protection contracts, either with smallholders
(about 34,395 ha under the project) or with SFEs (more than 100,000 ha under Program 661).
The boundary between the FPZ and the BZ was demarcated in the field along the coastline with
1,454 land-markers and 211 signboards. The project also supported the new construction and up-
grading of 19 forest guard stations including the provision of the necessary equipment to enforce
forest protection. About 132 training courses in forest law and protection, 298 courses in planting
techniques and 22 in-country study tours were organized for forest rangers and local villagers. As
a result, forest law violations in the project area (470 km of shoreline along four project
provinces) were reduced considerably from 1,757 cases in 2002 to 318 cases in 2006. The
institutional capacity for mangrove planting and protection at local levels, including awareness of
conservation values, was enhanced significantly.

(c) Improving management and protection of special use forest and fish sanctuaries: Dat Mui
and Ong Trang Nature Reserves and Bai Boi fish sanctuary were merged and up-graded into the
MCMNP by the Prime Minister's Decision No. 142 dated July 7, 2003. The project assisted the
Park in developing a management plan and strengthening its infrastructure to enhance protection
activities (see the park brochure below). The preparation of the management plan was completed
in December 2004, followed by boundary demarcation between the core and buffer zones and
habitat restoration in 920 ha of the Park through natural regeneration. An environmental
awareness education program was carried out and completed in December 2005 and a
biodiversity study in 2007. The study provided diversity data, showing high diversity and
important species, but is not sufficient to measure changes in biodiversity.

              "Restoration of Coastal Ecosystems is a Major Priority in Tra Vinh"

Location: Ho Thung village, Dong Hai commune, Tra Vinh province and village 4, My Long
Nam commune, Cau Ngang district.

Whilst travelling along the sea dike of Ho Thung village we were instantly aware of the
miraculous change in landscape and growth in vegetation. This change has been vastly
noticeable from the start from the Casuarina plantation in the rainy season of 2002 by the
CWPDP. After only three years since plantation, the Casuarinas have grown in height to over six
meters and offer great protection to the coastal dune and the agricultural land (further inland).
With Mr. Hong Thanh Liem (head of the Dong Hai forest guard station) we visited Mr. Nguyen
Van Nam's house and were greeted by him and his two neighbors, who were both carrying bags
of dry Casuarina leaves. Mr. Nam explained to us that, "We use the dry Casuarina leaves to
cover our land during cropping as it prevents the sand from shifting and also reduces the
moisture evaporation from sunlight and humidity. The rainy season is now over so every farmer
here needs Casuarina leaves".

Knowing we were from the CWPDP, Mr. Nam then excitedly told us a range of benefits provided
by the Casuarina plantations not only to his family but also to the whole community. He
confirmed that generally 70 percent of the sea wind is dissipated by the Casuarina belt, and that
salt spray is now rarely a problem on the farms. As a result, the villagers now grow a range of
crops such as watermelon, peanut, corn, sweet potato and various vegetables that are generally
sensitive to weather. For example, last season a farmer adjacent to Mr. Nam's house harvested
six tons of watermelon per 1000 m2 whereas in the past he could only harvest two to three tons.

Ho Thung villagers now enjoy the benefits of the Casuarina belt and without any hesitation they
participate in the planting and protection of the forest belt which they now considered their own
treasure.

Component 2: Technology Development and Transfer

2.2 This component was successful in meeting its targets of delivering a technical development
and transfer program suitable to local farmers' conditions and improving credit provision to
farmers for production activities. These, in turn, have contributed to livelihood development of
vulnerable groups in priority communes and resettlement sites, reducing pressure on mangrove
exploitations. The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Developing appropriate extension packages for priority communes: The project supported a
comprehensive farming system survey in the BZ, followed by four adaptive research programs,
12 special on-farm studies and 40 short term on-farm trials. About 350 fisheries and agricultural
farming manuals and 21,350 leaflets were prepared and printed for dissemination at
demonstration sites.

(b) Improving local research and extension capacity: Research and extension capacity in the
Mekong Delta region in general, and in the project area in particular, was significantly
strengthened by the project through the up-grading of four Sub-Regional Research Centers, 13
district extension centers, and 35 communal demonstration posts. The project also provided
training for METs in 18 priority communes. Government extension staff were re-trained in both
new technologies/techniques and new approaches to the delivery of extension. These are
expected to improve the quality of extension service delivery in the region in the future. For
instance, many extension staff acknowledged that they continued using the project-supported
approaches for the government's extension programs.

(c) Providing technical training and financial support to farmers to enhance food security and
livelihood options: To transfer new improved technologies to farmers, the project supported the
establishment of 955 on-farm demonstration sites of more than 20 different farming models
including crops, animal husbandry and aquaculture, and organized 500 training courses and 209
field workshops in four project provinces. At least 20,000 local farmers, including re-settlers,
have directly benefited from the project's research and extension programs. Many new improved
farming models were successfully demonstrated and replicated widely in the BZ, such as cow-
grass-earthworm and shallots with polythene cover models in Soc Trang; pig-biogas and shrimp-
crab-mangrove models in Bac Lieu; pig-raising, rice-fish models in Ca Mau; and watermelon
with polythene cover, groundnut, cockle, and crab models in Tra Vinh. Together with extension
efforts, commercial loans were provided to farmers through VBARD for investment in
production. The project also earmarked US$6 million of the IDA Credit to provide commercial
loans through VBARD for farmers to help them diversify away from shrimp farming. All the
funds were fully disbursed (6,594 loans provided from the IDA credit source and 20,025 loans
from VBARD's own funds).

                      "Fish culture in the wet season at Dan Thanh commune"

Location: Dan Thanh commune, Duyen Hai district, Tra Vinh province

Before the project:
Most ponds in this area were used for shrimp culture during the dry season and nothing was produced
during the wet season. Some people tried extensive fish culture (without supplementary feeding);
however, there were no benefits and so for some years now, the fishponds were left empty and
unutilized during the wet season.

Mr. Nguyen Van Thua, a farmer attending the demonstrations of mud loach fish culture at Lang Chao
village, Dan Thanh commune, said that "In the past this 3000 m2 pond was only used for shrimp
culture in the dry season. I had no use for it in the wet season. This yea,r I was supported by the
project to learn the technique of fish food for mud loach. Now, you can see the mud loaches are
abundant on the surface of this pond. Many people of this commune actually come to visit my pond
and ask about my technique. These visitors all want to apply the same model for their pond, in the
next wet season.

Besides the obvious benefits from fish culture, I can also save money from the usual pond preparation
before shrimp culture. This is thanks to the fish cleaning the bottom of the pond. If the fish were not
bottom cleaners, I would have to pay 2.5 million VND for 1000 m2 of pond preparation, which would
equate to 7.5 million VND for this pond".

Mr. Thua was then asked to calculate the cost and income of his model, to which he replied, "If I pour
2000 fingerlings of mud loach for 1000 m2, 50 percent survive only, after 5 months I can get 250 kg
for 1000 m2 with the price of 35,000 VND. The gross benefit is 87.5 million VND for 1000 m2
subtracting the total cost, the net income of this 3000 m2 pond is 10 million VND. If I leave the pond
empty - like last time - I get nothing."

Some farmers of this commune harvest two shrimp crops per year, but recently they lost one crop due
to shrimp disease. They changed to fish culture in the wet season, but did not immediately reap the
benefits as the fish were only fingerlings and they did not know how to feed them. If you take a look
around here, all the fish ponds are empty and unused (during the wet season) as everybody is waiting
for the shrimp season (which commences in the beginning of January). However, the farmers believe
that this will change as of next year as all of the ponds will be used for fish during the wet season as
well. The farmers are now confident with their acquired techniques and skills for mud loach and sea
bass (another breed of fish) culture.

Mr. Pham Van Loi is the MET of the project and is a fish farmer too. He said that "We can imagine if
all of the ponds in this commune are used for fish culture in the wet season, the benefit of farmer will
increase a lot. Furthermore, the commune people will have work if they do fish culture, but now the
people have no work at this time".

Mr. Thua and Mr. Loi then commented that even if all farmers adopted fish culture, the market for fish
would still be fine. They said, "We are not worried as the mud loach and sea bass species have a big
market and we can all sell the products easily."

The project has introduced intensive fish culture in the wet season through demonstrations for 8 sites:
                                        2
    -    Mud loach: 4 sites of 3000 m
                                     2
    -    Sea bass: 2 sites of 3000 m
                                                              2
    -    `Gift phi' (another breed of fish): 2 sites of 3000 m

Component 3: Social Support Program

2.3 This component was successfully implemented and met its targets of improving livelihoods
for local people in the project poor communes. PRAs were carried to prepare CAPs and VAPs,
which were then implemented in 18 priority (poor) communes and 15 resettlement sites. The key
outputs of this component were:

(a) Improving basic infrastructure in resettlement sites and other vulnerable communes: Basic
needs of local communities identified during the PRAs were addressed through the
implementation of the approved CAPs and VAPs (i.e., construction of small-scale community
infrastructure such as up-grading of primary schools and health care centers and provision of
training for women on primary health care and environmental sanitation). In each of these
communes, a Community Supervision Board with representatives from villagers was formed to
monitor the implementation of the CAPs and VAPs, including implementation progress and
quality of the procured services, goods and small works construction. Results of CAPs/VAPs
implementation were highly satisfactory and much appreciated by local beneficiaries. Detailed
information on specific investments under CAPs/VAPs is presented in the above summary table.

(b) Providing micro-credit support to the very poor households: As the poor often have bad
debts, they are not able to borrow commercial loans from VBARD. To improve their access to
credit, a RF financed by the DANIDA Grant was set up under the project and managed by the
VBSP. The VWU at local levels was also invited to assist the VBSP in providing various basic
training to loan borrowers. Altogether, the RF provided loans of around a total of VND 14.2
billion (equivalent to US$0.9 million) to more than 5,200 poor households in the project area. By
the project's closing, the disbursed funds had been recycled and completed the second round with
a high repayment rate.

(c) Providing literacy training to the poor: The project implemented an illiteracy eradication
program through the DANIDA Grant. The program followed the Action-Aide model using the
participatory methods with community empowerment techniques. A total of 88 classes on
literacy training for 1,720 local adults were organized in Soc Trang with successful results. The
training not only helped people to read and write, but also promoted their involvement in social
activities and community development.

(d) Ethnic minority development. The project placed priority on addressing the special needs of
the ethnic minority (the Khmer) in the project area through the preparation and implementation of
an EMDP for 12 communes in Soc Trang, Tra Vinh and Bac Lieu. The EMDP was financed by
an EMDF as part of the DANIDA Grant contribution to the project. The implementation of the
EMDP was well received and highly appreciated by the Khmer communities, particularly those
activities supporting Khmer pagodas. Small-scale works, such as incineration crematoriums and
classrooms, and special goods and equipment such as "Ngo" racing boats, festival costumes and
five-toned musical instruments have contributed to the improvement of the physical and social
life of Khmer ethnic people. In total, an estimated 5,000 ethnic minority households have
benefited from the project's EMDP. Detailed information on specific investments under the
EMDP is presented in the above summary table.

Component 4: Policy and Institutional Development

2.4 This component was successfully implemented, though with some delays. Key outputs from
this component were:

(a)     Land and water zoning and commune land use planning: The Prime Minister's Decision8
on planning and zoning for the project area was issued in 1999 and remains effective to date. The
project provided necessary support, training and equipment to provincial DONREs and District
land administration agencies to enhance their capacity in land use planning. The project carried
out a survey of land use in the FPZ which was completed in 2003 and a follow-up survey in the
BZ in 2006. These surveys provided PPMUs with a solid base to identify suitable lands for
mangrove planting, maintenance and protection and to up-date commune-level land use planning
and maps. As a result, 53 commune-level land use plans have been up-dated and approved by the
government.

(b)     Issuance of LURCs to farmers in the BZ: Following the government's procedures and
based on the results of the land use planning, approximately 12,386 ha of land in the BZ have
been measured and 7,627 long-term LURCs (red books) have been allocated to 5,854 households
in the BZ. In addition, 1,563 resettled households also received LURCs for their residential and
productive lands in their new resettlement sites. Improving land tenure for BZ households and
especially resettlement households, was one of the most important outcomes of the component,
which encouraged long-term investments in land; the LURCs are used as collateral for farmers to
obtain commercial loans from VBARD.

(c)     Pilot restructuring of State Forestry Enterprises: To facilitate the development of the
government's policy to restructure SFEs and to improve forest management in the FPZ and BZ, a
study on restructuring SFEs was conducted for Tam Giang 1 and Dam Doi SFEs. The final
report, which was available in August 2004, consisted of an analysis of the social, environmental
and financial status of the SFEs, guidelines for improving management arrangements, and a
restructuring Action Plan defining steps needed in the restructuring process. Following the
completion of the study, the implementation of the proposed restructuring plan for the SFEs went
as planned, which converted them into Forest Management Boards with more autonomy and
greater responsibility for sound financial and natural resource management. Restructuring of the
SFEs has resulted in improved forest land management. Moreover, more than 6,000 ha of forest
land under the management of the SFEs were re-allocated to 1,091 households for protection and
management. This has allowed households to improve their livelihoods and incomes from forest
protection and maintenance activities.

Component 5: Resettlement of FPZ Occupants

2.5 The component was successful in relocating 1,452 households from the FPZ to the BZ and
in providing them with alternative livelihood options. The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Relocating households from the FPZ to the BZ: Based on a thorough DMS carried out during
implementation, the number of households that were relocated was reduced significantly to 1,452
households compared with the appraisal target of 2,149 households. The relocated re-settlers
were assisted to move to safer living places in the BZ, which are less exposed to sea storm surge
and typhoons. All of them received compensation and other support according to the project's


8Decision of Prime Minister on approval of the zoning and planning for restoration of mangroves (in the project area)
of Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, Soc Trang, and Tra Vinh as one of the conditions of Project Negotiations.



                                                        32

RAP which was approved by the Prime Minister and was found to be satisfactory to IDA. An
independent audit of the RAP showed that the livelihoods of re-settlers had been improved and no
households moved back to the FPZ.

(b) Restoring livelihood for re-settlers: This was a priority of the component after relocation of
FPZ occupants. In addition to implementing the approved RAP, the PPMUs, especially in Soc
Trang and Tra Vinh, made extra efforts by providing landless re-settlers with standard housing
(i.e., a Grade 4 house) and 5,000 m² of productive land. Vocational training was provided to re-
settlers according to their demands and they were introduced and encouraged to join agricultural
production groups, handicraft cooperatives or linked with traders/exporters.

(c) Reducing incidence of absolute poverty: The most innovative feature in implementation of
this component was the introduction and implementation of RASDAPs for all resettlement sites
since 2005. The main purposes of RASDAPs were: (a) to prepare and implement resettlement
site-specific livelihood action plans, with support activity recommendations prioritized and
attached to clear time-frames, budgets and available resources; (b) to identify and develop
livelihood options for resettlement households, with specific consideration and resources put
toward households with and without production land; and (c) to inform the monitoring and
planning of related resettlement component activities. RASDAPs were also used to align TDT
training and demonstration support as well as vocational training for resettlement sites.
Implementing RASDAPs has not only contributed significantly to restoring livelihoods for re-
settlers but also reduced the incidence of absolute poverty in the area. A resettlement household
survey carried out in the first half of 2007 indicates that the average monthly income in
resettlement sites has increased by 23 percent since the 2005 survey. In addition, 41 percent of
resettled households indicate that their household income has increased since relocation to the
resettlement site. Poverty rates have decreased since resettlement, with a reported poverty rate of
12 percent among interviewed resettled households. This compares to a reported poverty rate of
22 percent prior to resettlement. Increases in household incomes and reduction in poverty has
been accompanied by changes in the structure and sources of household income. Since
resettlement there has been an increase in the number of households practicing agriculture and
aquaculture and a reduction in the number of households practicing fishing. Reliance on hired
labor remained relatively unchanged; however, the negative links between hired labor and
poverty and hired labor and lack of production land are less pronounced than found in 2005. The
majority of the interviewed resettled households expressed that their quality of life in resettlement
sites had been improved.

(d) Reducing forestry violations: A clear trend in reducing forestry violations in the project area
over time suggests a positive impact of resettlement activities on protection of the coastal
mangroves.

Component 6: Monitoring and Evaluation

2.6. The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Establishing and operating a simple and effective management information system: The
socio-economic baseline survey was completed in 2005. A practical and effective MIS was
established to provide timely data for project monitoring and management. The MIS was
operational at central and provincial levels. While initially the MIS was managed primarily by
the TA and the PPMUs, it was later linked to a monthly commune-level report which allowed
more timely response to local issues. Based partly on the information in the MIS, monthly,
quarterly and annual reports of the CPO and the PPMUs were prepared using a standard format.


                                                  33

The required information was collected from the commune level, then was transmitted to the
district, PPMU, and finally to CPO/CPO2 for consolidation and reporting. Progress reports
prepared by the PPMUs showed continuous improvement throughout the project. The project
M&E system, though with delays in the establishment and operations due to the late arrival of
TA, has been well utilized to support the monitoring and supervision of the project.

(b) Strengthening institutional M&E capacity: The project provided necessary support to
provincial Departments of Science and Technology (DOSTs) in staff training and up-grading of
its laboratories to undertake environmental monitoring. The two special studies on socio-
economic and water quality conditions were conducted, which provided valuable information to
assess the impacts of the project.

(c) Project impact assessments: A PER was prepared by the TA in December 2006 (i) to report
on the existing data and the current state of knowledge on the evaluation of project activities and
(ii) to develop recommendations and an action plan for future project evaluation activities and to
guide future project implementation activities. The Project Evaluation Action Plan contained in
the Interim TA PER was implemented in the first half of 2007, including collection of primary
and secondary data in relation to project evaluation indicators. Supplementary data has been
collected through surveys of resettled households, CAP/VAP and EMDF households. By the
project's closing the monitoring of physical progress was on track and the collected data and
additional surveys were available to assess the key project outcomes and impacts. For the final
project evaluation, data were compared between the 2005 and 2007 surveys and between the
project communes with communes outside the project having similar conditions in the same
region. In early 2007, before the project closed, a series of evaluation surveys on the impacts of
the CAPs/VAP, the EMDF and resettlement were designed and conducted to provide inputs for
the final project impact evaluation.

Component 7: Project Coordination and Management

2.7 The key outputs of this component were:

(a) Strengthening local institutional capacity: The project provided various types of training to
staff of the CPO/CPO2, PPMUs, DARDs, DONREs, DOSTs and other central and local agencies.
While the implementing agencies (i.e., CPO and CPO2, and PPMUs) have gained invaluable
experiences in project management (including procurement, financial management, ethnic
minority development and M&E) other local institutions benefited from the provision of
necessary equipment and technical training to their staff. As a result, the technical capabilities of
DARDs, DONREs and DOSTs have been strengthened significantly, especially in agricultural
research and extension, land use planning, issuance of LURCs, and social and environment
monitoring. These improvements will benefit future projects and programs in the Mekong Delta
region.

(b) Testing and confirming the decentralization approach: The CWPDP was the first IDA-
financed forestry project with Special Accounts at the provincial level. The successful project
management at the provincial and local level has demonstrated the right approach of
decentralization in the forestry sector. Other IDA-financed projects in the rural sector are
building on experiences from this project.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Assumptions for Economic Analysis

Background

3.1 This complex and ambitious project experienced some set-backs during implementation and,
while the project appears to have achieved little from start-up in late 2001 to 2004, the project
managed a comparatively good and successful outcome by project closure in 2007. The project
was restructured in 2004 and no serious project-based benefits could be identified prior to this
period. But from 2004 the project appears to have progressed well. Some preliminary work was
done in 2004 for the agricultural and aquaculture extension (TDT), but in general the project was
implemented strongly from mid 2004-2007. This difficulty of implementation also needs to be
placed in the context that the original project ERR of the project was estimated to be only 14
percent which was judged to be marginal.

Project costs and duration

3.2 Changes to the project that have been taken into account include a restructuring of project
and the major impacts to the project financing were to reduce the size of the overall project cost
from US$65.6 million to US$55.4 million9.

3.3 By component, the restructuring had the following effect:

     ·    to reduce the size of the mangrove planting and protection from US$13.9 million to
          US$3.8 million;
     ·    to reduce US$6 million for credit with VBARD;
     ·    to reduce the contribution from DANIDA; and
     ·    to increase the duration of the project by 11 months.

9The impact of this cost reduction is discussed elsewhere, but would be expected to have a positive impact
on the final ERR and would, to an extent, offset the lack of benefits for the period 2002-04.

Aquaculture and Agriculture

3.4 The farming systems of the project area were extensively studied by the project and a
number of mixed and straight aquaculture and agricultural technology demonstration models
were developed , in particular, to support diversification in smallholder agriculture and risk
reduction and diversification in aquaculture for the project's BZ; general increases in shrimp
production or the area of shrimp production were not an objective of the project.

3.5 The project based its support to the farmers on a number of reports that reviewed the farming
systems of the project area; the benefit model has subsequently been based on the different types
of agricultural and aquaculture10 smallholder models. The following assumptions, based on field
work and review of the project reports on agriculture and aquaculture, have been made:

(a) Aquaculture:

    ·    The technology for following an improved management and risk reduction approach on
         shrimp culture appears to be most appropriate (as opposed to a general increase in shrimp
         production area or intensification of production) and was well received by the shrimp
         smallholder farmers, suggesting good up-take of the various models.
    ·    Increased production has been easily absorbed by the market with apparently quite strong
         increases in market demand, which appears at times to outstrip supply11.
    ·    For shrimp farming there are improvements in reducing shrimp mortality i.e. from 2004/5
         and this continues. This includes semi-intensive shrimp (improved) production in the
         "with project" model with the project contributing to risk reduction measures from
         improved management from training.
    ·    There is an improvement in the risks facing the smallholder shrimp farmers through
         greater understanding of diseases, understanding climatic impacts (rain) on pH of the
         water, water circulation, improved feed and hygiene.

(b) Agriculture:

3.6 The TDT activities appear to have been well chosen to support the farming systems in the
BZ (i.e. no dramatic changes but improvements to existing crop production techniques). The
main TDT training began in 2005; training for credit began in 2005 so this allowed a reduced
time for follow-up and for the TDT technological changes to be transferred. However, this can be
off-set by the comparatively wide scale of the demonstrations and high levels of interest in many
of the models, and replication was evident in many instances.

Forestry and land reclamation

3.7 In the original project financial and economic analysis, the project's forestry component
returned an ERR of about 26 percent which was mainly due to benefits from accretion, but the
original economics show that the project was relatively insensitive to any change in these


10Based on the farming systems of the region (see "Survey of the Farming Systems in the Buffer Zone of Tra Vinh,
Soc Trang, Bac Lieu and Ca Mau Provinces" prepared by the College of Aquaculture and Fisheries and College of
Agriculture Can Tho University October 2004; and "Diversification of Cash Crop Production with new Varieties and
Cropping Systems Final Report, Special Study" prepared by the College of Agriculture Can Tho University; September
2006), project TDT models and field work throughout the project area.

activities. As noted elsewhere, it has not been possible to identify clearly the rate or area of
accretion over the whole project coastline or to estimate the impact of the mangrove plantings on
accretion.

Credit

3.8 It has not been possible to review in depth how the credit has been used, therefore it has
been estimated that credit will bring in benefits at 15 percent. This is based on a review of the
Bank's Rural Finance projects in Vietnam which have some similarities and lend through
VBARD and the VBSP. The line of credit was taken to have a positive impact on the borrowing
households and to provide a return of 10 to 15 percent to the investment. Similarly, the
performance of the revolving credit, which is generally for small amounts with short terms, which
tend to have higher rates of return to investment, provided 25 percent returns to investment.

Civil works

3.9 Benefits from civil works are taken to be positive. The project did not sub-divide the cost of
civil works into type of civil works even though a wide variety were completed, (such as canal-
side roads, small bridges, drainage, social infrastructure) so an overall benefit of 10-15 percent is
estimated based on previous small-scale rural infrastructure Bank-financed projects in Vietnam.

Methodology adopted for the economic analysis

3.10 The economic analysis, in similarity to the original project analysis, has focused most
attention on the agriculture and aquaculture aspects of the project and is based on smallholder
farmer models that are representative of the farming systems found in the project area.

Agriculture and Aquaculture

3.11 The project provinces are quite different in their agriculture and aquaculture mix and this
has been reflected in the different benefit models, with Soc Trang and Tra Vinh having a much
higher percentage of agriculture than Bac Lieu (which has a mixture of aquaculture and
agriculture) and Ca Mau (where the project area has very little land for agriculture and is strongly
orientated to extensive smallholder shrimp culture).

3.12 Benefits from TDT were taken as a gradual increase in benefits by 8-10 percent from a
without- to a with-project situation (assumed on the national and provincial average agricultural
growth rates plus an incremental percent for the project activities). The without- and with-project
smallholder farm budget models developed for the benefit model follow in the Tables 1 to 4
below which are used to represent the land use in the different parts of the project. The crop and
aquaculture gross margins were based on data collected during field work and data collected from
the project, and the gross margins were calculated over a 10-year period with different risk factors
based on loss of production (these are described in the different models below) for semi-intensive
shrimps (moderately high), extensive shrimps (medium) and low-risk shrimp and crab. The
perennial crops are based on mangoes which are widely grown in the project area; these begin
limited fruiting at year 4 and are expected to be at full fruit by year 10.

3.13 It is assumed that the TDT has a gradual up-take of the information and impact on
improving agricultural crop and aquaculture diversification and production, coupled with reduced
risks for shrimp aquaculture which peaks ten years from the initial extension work (i.e., to
coincide with the full production of the perennial crops, thereafter the impact decreases).



                                                 37

3.14 Farm-gate or market prices may have come down relatively speaking due to the improved
and more competitive marketing. This would be expected to be offset by the rise in demand
nationally and internationally and better access to market information. However, there is also
some market price seasonality (prices firm in the weeks before Tet) and volatility (mainly as a
result of failures in different parts of the country or the impact of bad weather).

3.15 Clearly some farmers are able to command better prices, especially for the larger, good
quality shrimps, and a number of progressive farmers, typically with more experience of
marketing, have invested in simple cold storage and use of ice to allow them to have more
flexibility when seeking a good market price12.

Economic analysis

3.16 The ERR of the project is 17 percent and the NPV of the project is US$14.2 million at a
discount rate of 12 percent which, given the size, complexity and obvious problems experienced
during implementation, is a comparatively successful outcome, particularly when it is understood
that the original project ERR was only 14 percent. The original project used a 40-year time
horizon which has been followed. The original NPV was US$18.2 million at a discount rate of
10 percent and the original project was judged to be only marginally economically viable.

3.16 It should also be noted that there are significant benefits that are unquantified; if these were
added, the ERR would be higher. Included here is the value of land gained by accretion which
was included in the original ERR and the benefits that would accrue from mangrove forest
protection, rehabilitation and mangrove plantings; if these are calculated following a total
economic value (TEV) approach then value and benefits of the mangrove systems is often
considerable. This point on the value of mangrove system was partly made in the original
estimate of the ERR and in the PAD where it recognized that mangroves have a "nurturing
function", resulting in a mangrove nurturing value of US$350/ha, but no attempt was made to
calculate the TEV of the mangrove systems, which can range from US$3,100 - 3,800 per ha. It
was, however, stated that the full environmental benefit of mangroves may have been understated
in the analysis13.

12Mr. To Thanh Lam had his own small cold store allowing him flexibility to choose a good market price from passing
or local shrimp buyers after harvesting his shrimp if a suitable market price could not be agreed. The alternative is to
agree a price before harvest or sell the harvest more or less to the first passing or local shrimp buyer.

13
   Where the unquantified benefits are approximated (e.g., using some indicative TEVs developed for
mangroves in other regions and some rough extrapolation of accretion rates) the ERR increases to around
25 percent.

                   Sensitivity Analysis

                   3.17 The assumptions for the sensitivity analysis include a reduction in benefits of 20 percent for
                   all categories, and a 10 percent reduction in the price of shrimp. The results of the sensitivity
                   analysis show that the project is quite robust as the ERR falls to 14 percent with a reduction in
                   overall benefits by 20 percent, but the project is sensitive to the price of shrimps as the 10 percent
                   price fall produces an ERR of 15 percent.

                   3.18 The original project was also judged to be sensitive to changes in shrimp prices and
                   insensitive to the benefits from accretion and forestry.

                   Discussion on the original and final economic analysis

                   3.19 Much has changed in the project and also in the project's target Provinces during the
                   implementation, and the project is characterized by the following:

                                 ·      The original project states that the main quantified benefits were expected to be
                                        increased coastal land reclamation and increased income for households in the BZ.
                                        The quantification of the land reclamation aspects in the original project were not
                                        completed, probably due to market weakness.14


                   14   A review of the valuation of land was made, but at the time of the analysis there would have been only a
                   very limited market; however, investment costs required to bring the land into production were not added



                                                                                                    39

          ·    The initial ERRS for the project were comparatively weak and it may have been
               difficult to forecast the general rapid changes in investment, improved technology
               (particularly disease control), marketing and demand.
          ·    Access to market information and to national and international markets by Vietnam-
               based companies has improved dramatically and there has been a rapid increase in
               the domestic and international market for shrimps.
          ·    Large investments in shrimp handling at the local market level and communications
               at the point of international export allows for rapid national movement of shrimp to
               domestic markets and for rapid international export.
          ·    Access to technology has improved15 (during implementation the project extension
               activities helped in this process) and there is improved knowledge and understanding
               of shrimp diseases.
          ·    Improved sources of P Monodon are more widely available from outside of the
               Project Provinces (e.g., shrimp fry from Nha Trang is now used by many of the more
               progressive farmers and has made an impact in terms of improved quality and
               disease resistance).
          ·    The initial project ERR was sensitive to the changes in prices and impact of shrimp
               production; this is due to the high value and volume of production, from a reduction
               in risk, and in a similar manner the recalculation is also sensitive to changes in
               shrimp price and outputs.
          ·    The original ERR was not based on increases in shrimp production area or increased
               intensification.
          ·    As shown in the original ERR sensitivity analysis, the impact of the accretion of land
               and forest aspects of the project were minimal in economic terms compared to the
               impact of the shrimp production on the project outcome16.
          ·    The final costs for the project are significantly down (from US$65.6 million to
               US$55.4 million) which had a beneficial impact on the final ERR but was tempered
               slightly by the increase in the duration of the project.
          ·    The value of land has changed significantly, in part because of the increased shrimp
               production in the area and the development of informal land markets, but also due to
               policy changes and the gradual development of a formal market based approach to
               land.
          ·    Smallholder use of credit has been introduced on a much larger scale than was first
               envisaged.
          ·    The original project estimated a nurturing function of one hectare of mangroves,
               based on coastal fishery, to be (conservatively) US$0.5 per kg, resulting in a
               mangrove "nurturing value" of US$350 per ha.
          ·    No estimate was attempted for the TEV or the value-added by the protection of
               mangroves or for the additional area of mangrove that was planted by the project.
               The TEV of mangrove systems is normally considered to be high, often being
               calculated to be in the range of US$3,100 - 3,800 per ha (a significant part of the


and the cost associated with this would probably not have been easy to obtain (again, because of the very
limited market information.

15Although not part of the project or this review, it is apparent that there has been considerable
international investment in shrimp production in the project area particularly from Japan and Australia.
This has also improved the technology in the provinces with improved cultivation and much improved
processing and handling of the shrimp products.

16This problem can be avoided if a TEV or similar approach is used to calculate the full economic value of
mangrove forest, but this does require a detailed analysis of the mangrove system.

               TEV is normally associated with the protection value). The project completed a
               biodiversity survey of Mui Ca Mau National Park which does provide evidence of
               the relatively high levels of biodiversity and also supports an expected high TEV.

Project benefits

3.20 From the original document, the main project benefits were to help by reclaiming 470 km
of coastline in the Mekong Delta as a result of the coastal protection function of the mangrove
forest; but to date it has been difficult to establish exactly how much coastline has been
reclaimed. It has not been possible at this stage to establish exactly where the BZ is or how wide
it is. This is partly because the BZ is supposed to move as more land is reclaimed with the FPZ
moving outwards followed by BZ and then the EZ.

3.21 The project was also aimed at increasing, stabilizing and diversifying farming incomes, and
in general the project appears to have contributed very positively towards this - together with
other sources of investment external to the project.

Beneficiaries and impact on poverty

3.22 The total number of immediate beneficiaries was originally estimated to be approximately
100,000 households; this figure is now approximately 134,000 households. These are the people
in all of the 49 coastal communes in both BZ and EZ - including excluded (non-priority) ones -
and are assumed to be the main project beneficiaries (i.e., the BZ and BZ/FPZ and BZ/EZ
areas17). There were around 31,000 poor people, but as noted elsewhere it is difficult to assess
change or comparison to controls. At least 20,000 local farmers, including re-settlers, directly
benefited from the project-improved farming models. VBARD disbursed approximately US$6
million of commercial loans to 3,915 farmers and 1,452 households were resettled from the FPZ
to the BZ.

Impact on production

3.23 The annual production of all produce from the project has, apparently, been easily absorbed
into Vietnam's markets and, at the time of this survey, there has been a firming-up of prices of
aquaculture produce as demand has been growing for shrimp (internationally), fish and crab (both
international and local Vietnam markets).

3.24 The TDT program of crop diversification and promotion of the diversified and lower-risk
mixed fish or crab with shrimp systems has helped smallholder farmers increase their marketing
and production options away from relatively higher risk mono-culture shrimp systems,
particularly as the smaller farmers are often the most exposed to falls in price resulting from gluts
in shrimp production

Unquantified Benefits

3.25 The unquantified benefits from the original project include: (a) increased marine
productivity because of the nurturing function of mangroves; (b) the storm protection function of
mangrove forests; (c) the indirect benefits from applied research on aquaculture which accrue to

areas outside the project area; (d) social benefits such as improved education, drinking water
supply and sanitation, reduced poverty and employment generated; and (e) the multiplier effects
of increased farm production on rural services and small-scale industries.

3.26 For the review of the project, the following unquantified benefits were identified:

Un-quantified Benefit                Project Benefits                                Comments
Coastal accretion        356 ha land was added in Ca Mau area       These are probably significant benefits over
                         by 2007 which accounts for half of the     time as the demand for and value of land

                         less rapid in other parts; total accretion kept no data on accretion or the value of
                         could be expected to range from 498 ha     land. Some limited data became available
                         to 569 ha.                                 on one section of the coast. Accretion and

Institutional            Improved land use planning and policy      The provincial governments have gained
                         on land use; improved mangrove             valuable experience of projects to support
                         protection; improved policy on             further accretion and protection of the

Social benefits          The project included a variety and         Social benefits were included in the
                         number of small-scale civil works.         estimated benefits.


3.27 The only figures available for accretion for the project were for Ca Mau which provided
data for every segment of the coastline (36 regions), comparing the extent of erosion and
accretion in 2000 to the situation in 2007. This covers 256 km of coastline, or approximately half
of the entire coastline within the project area of 470 km. The results indicate that the length, area
and rate of erosion have been substantially reduced from 2000 to 2007. The length and area of
coastline accreting has increased substantially during the same period, although the linear rate of
accretion is lower in 2007 than in 2000. In 2000, 54 percent of the coastline was eroding and 25
percent was accreting. In 2007, 50 percent of the coastline is still eroding (though at a reduced
rate) and 38 percent is accreting.

3.28 It is difficult to identify specifically the impact of the project on these results compared to
other government planting programs and natural variations. Nonetheless, the results are


                                                     42

encouraging and support the view that coastal environmental restoration is reducing erosion and
enhancing accretion and are shown below. Benefits have not been extrapolated further due to the
probable changes in rates accretion and erosion along the coast.

3.29 In the original analysis, the area of additional land was expected to be about 2,000 ha and
the value of land was taken as a flat rate of US$2,000 per ha, but no costs for developing the land
seem to have been taken into account and, as shown in the original ERR sensitivity analysis, the
impact of the accretion of land were minimal on the project ERR outcome. The average rate of
accretion in the original analysis was estimated to range from 6m to 60m per year in the Ca Mau
peninsular, but the average rate of accretion for Ca Mau is estimated by the project to be only
24m per year. No other values for accretion are available, but the 2,000 ha estimated in the
original analysis looks to be of the right order; without more sophisticated analysis, and possibly
including a seasonal approach, not available to the project, it is not possible to be more exact.

3.30 Today, roughly similar land (US$2,000 per ha is assumed to be for poorer quality land,
although no definition of land quality was given in the original analysis) would have a value of
around US$3,750 per ha for land used for forestry. For better quality land (but still at the poorer
end of the provincial valuations) and suitable for annual crops, this rises to US$15,000 per ha and
to US$18,750 per ha for perennial cropping. However, it is difficult to realistically quantify this
project-related benefit other than applying an approximate value. The value also needs to take
account of fact that the land cannot be immediately used and that an investment cost is also
required for bringing the land into production at some time in the future18.

Mangrove systems

3.31 Mangrove species diversity is well known for the larger animals and plants, but poorly
known for smaller organisms and insects. A crucial aspect of biodiversity for mangrove
management is that many species (e.g., fish, birds, crustaceans and shellfish) use the mangrove
forest ecosystem for only part of the time. Thus, the mangrove habitat supports many more
species as visitors, or indirectly, and these support functions must be taken into account as part of
mangrove management.




18
   Figures based on Soc Trang land values; US$3,750 per ha x 2,000 ha = US$7.5 million minus investment costs of
bringing the land into production, say, 15-20 percent of the value of the land leaves a very approximate project benefit
of US$6.0 to 6.4 million.

3.32 The mangrove ecosystem has important direct and indirect economic,
ecological and social
value to man. Mangrove ecosystems have consistently been under-valued, usually
because only their direct goods and services have been included in economic
calculations (e.g., as was the case in the original project analysis, where forestry
resources where valued), but this represents only a minor part of the total value of
mangroves.

3.33 Mangrove systems are rich ecosystems and can be considered to comprise two main
sources of values (use value and non-use value) and these are used to provide the TEV of the
system as shown below.

                 pollutants from coastal rivers.


3.34 Some example values of the mangrove systems are shown below which clearly show the
importance and value of the mangrove areas. It should be pointed out that the TEVs were
collected as part of research programs. It should be noted that while the coastal protection value
makes up anything from 22 percent to 95 percent of the TEV this is most likely undervaluing the
coastal protection aspects on current day prices, due to the wide-scale increased emphasis and
value of coastal protection due to global warming and in the project case, the potential high value
of land behind the mangrove areas and low level of the land.

                              Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1 In April/May 2007, a number of beneficiary household surveys were carried out. Below are
the main findings:

·    There is no evidence that any relocated households have returned to the FPZ following
     resettlement, which is a significant positive outcome of the project.

·    In terms of project effects on household incomes and the quality of life for resettled
     households, a range of positive effects has been recognized based on the results of the 2007
     data collection. The data indicate that many of the negative impacts observed in the 2005
     study have been reduced or ameliorated as households pass through a transition period in
     the resettlement sites. The average monthly income in resettlement sites has increased by
     23 percent since the 2005 survey. In addition, 41 percent of resettled households indicate
     that their household income has increased since relocation to the resettlement site. Poverty
     rates have decreased since resettlement, with a reported poverty rate of 12 percent amongst
     interviewed resettled households. This compares to a reported poverty rate of 22 percent
     prior to resettlement and a rate of 34 percent amongst resettled households in the 2005
     survey.

·    Increases in household incomes and a reduction in poverty were accompanied by changes
     in the structure and sources of household income. Since resettlement there has been an
     increase in the number of households practicing agriculture and aquaculture and a reduction
     in the number of households practicing fishing. Reliance on hired labor has remained
     relatively unchanged; however, as noted below the negative links between hired labor and
     poverty and hired labor and lack of production land are less pronounced than found in the
     2005 investigations. Lack of production land amongst resettled households has decreased
     (from 39 percent to 33 percent) following relocation to the resettlement sites and from the
     rates found in the 2005 studies.

·    The vast majority (over 80 percent) of resettled households consider that the quality of life
     in resettlement sites represents an improvement from the quality of life in the FPZ,
     although there were concerns expressed about the quality of services in the resettlement
     sites particularly in relation to water and electricity supply.

·    The project effects on vulnerable households in resettlement sites require particular
     attention. The household income of all vulnerable groups remains lower than the project
     average (60-80 percent of the project average). However, all groups reported a higher-
     than-average rate of increase in household income following resettlement. Poverty rates
     are still higher amongst vulnerable households than across the project on average,
     particularly in ethnic minority households. However, all vulnerable groups reported
     decreases in poverty rates following relocation to resettlement sites. Households that rely
     on hired labor are more likely to be poor than other households; however, decreases in
     poverty rates amongst this group have also been experienced following relocation to the
     resettlement site. Higher-than-average rates of households lacking production land are
     found amongst poor and ethnic minority households; however, rates of households lacking
     production land decreased in these groups following resettlement. Despite the
     improvements in household incomes, rates of poverty and households without production
     land, vulnerable households were less likely to report that their quality of life had improved



                                                 52

  in the resettlement site when compared to the FPZ conditions. This is likely to occur
  because, despite improvements, these households still remain poorer than other groups in
  the project area.

· In terms of access to and the effects of micro-credit, VBARD loans were processed
  throughout the project area. These loans were provided predominantly to existing or
  previous customers. There was a low rate of access by resettlement households and
  vulnerable groups (less than 10 percent), although improvements in access for these groups
  since the 2005 investigations have been experienced. The vast majority of VBARD
  borrowers considered that the activities financed by the loan had improved their household
  income and quality of life.

· RF loans were also processed throughout the project area. RF loans were more commonly
  provided to resettlement households and ethnic minority households than VBARD loans;
  however, poor households had very low access to RF loans. The average amount of RF
  loans was one-tenth that of VBARD loans. RF loans were used predominantly for
  agriculture, livestock and aquaculture activities. Across the project area, implemented
  activities were generally not linked to project-related skills; however, in resettlement sites
  RF loan funds were more commonly used to implement project learnt skills. The vast
  majority of households (90 percent) indicated that household incomes and quality of life
  had improved as a result of RF loan financed activities. Nearly one-third of households
  reported difficulties in meeting repayments, mostly as a result of the scheduling of
  repayments that did not correspond to harvest cycles.

· TDT activities were developed as a mechanism of stabilizing and diversifying household
  incomes in the BZ/EZ and resettlement sites. About 955 Demonstration Models were
  implemented across the project area. There was a good forecast rate of adoption of TDT
  models (over 70 percent of the resettled households), particularly for those models
  involving agriculture and aquaculture. Lower forecast rates of adoption were found for
  DMs that required high capital inputs or that had a long period to harvest, including some
  livestock and aquaculture models. Of the DMs that were undertaken in resettlement sites, a
  high proportion of households reported an increase in income as a result. In those
  households that were not expected to implement DMs, the main reason cited was a lack of
  financial resources highlighting the link between access to micro-credit and ability to
  successfully implement project activities.

· Significant progress in livelihood improvement activities in resettlement sites was made in
  2006 and 2007 through the implementation of revised RASDAPs at all resettlement sites.
  These were highly targeted and owned by participants, and included more comprehensive
  packages of support across areas of agriculture/aquaculture demonstrations, vocational
  training, cooperative development (e.g., handicrafts and aquaculture cooperatives) and
  labor market placement (e.g., labor export and investment promotion).

· The EMDF was developed specifically to provide support to ethnic minority households in
  the project area. A range of direct and indirect benefits has resulted from the
  implementation of EMDF activities. A high proportion (87 percent) of the interviewed
  ethnic minority households were satisfied with the type and quality of EMDF activities and
  reported that the activities had resulted in improvements to their quality of life, even if the
  nature of the activities meant that they were used infrequently (e.g., crematoriums, musical
  instruments and boats for festivals).



                                              53

· CAP/VAP activities were implemented throughout the project area and resulted in a range
  of benefits. High rates of utilization of all types of CAP/VAP infrastructure were reported.
  High rates of usage were reported amongst vulnerable groups, particularly poor households.
  There was very high reported satisfaction with CAP/VAP activities (90 percent of the
  interviewed households). Over half of the interviewed households reported a direct or
  indirect increase in household income as a result of CAP/VAP activity implementation,
  while over three-quarters reported increases in quality of life. Improvements to roads,
  electricity supply and canals were the activities that resulted in the most significant
  benefits.

· The illiteracy eradication program at Soc Trang helped about 1,700 people. It thus
  contributed to raise the knowledge, communication skills and management ability in
  production. Amongst 30 surveyed households, over 70 percent said after participating in
  the training course that the knowledge has helped them to increase household incomes.
  Moreover, the newly-gained education has helped them to participate more easily in
  training course involving technique development and transfer and vocational training
  organized by the project. After participating in the illiteracy eradication courses, 47 percent
  of participants continued being members of training courses in agriculture, livestock
  husbandry, aquaculture, handicraft skills. This has contributed to up-grading knowledge,
  improving chances in job seeking and increasing household incomes in the long run. The
  survey also shows that the majority of re-settlers wishes to continue learning, and the
  program will continue to be operated by the Province in the future.

1. The objective of the Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project (CWPDP), which
covers the Southern Mekong Delta provinces of Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, Soc Trang and Tra Vinh, was
to re-establish the coastal mangrove wetland ecosystems and protect sustainably their aquatic
nurturing and coastal protection functions.

2. To achieve the above objective, a full protection zone (FPZ) and an adjoining buffer zone
(BZ) comprising a 460 km long coastal protection belt was established in the project area. The
project included the following seven components which contributed to reaching the project
outputs and its development objective: (1) Mangrove planting and improved ecosystem
management and protection in the FPZ; (2) Resettlement of FPZ occupants; (3) Technical and
economic support for households in the BZ and in the adjacent economic zone together with joint
commitments by farmers and the forest service to protect the FPZ; (4) social support for
vulnerable (poor) communities including ethnic minority people in the BZ; (5) institutional
support and policy development; (6) ecosystem and socio-economic monitoring and evaluation;
and (7) project coordination and management.

Disbursement

3. By the project's closing, disbursement level of the IDA credit reached $36.175 million19 (96
percent of the total) and of the DANIDA reached DKK45.381 million (100 percent of the total).

Key Factors Influencing Implementation

4. There were a number of factors that influenced the implementation of this project, including
both positive innovations and some challenges. The key factors included:

     ,,  Project complexity, both in design and implementation

     ,,  Influence of a relatively large Technical Assistance element

     ,,  Decentralisation of implementation to project Provinces

     ,,  PPMU capacity building

     ,,  Macro-economic and geographic challenges

Assessment of Outcomes

5. The Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Program is a complex and multi-faceted
undertaking that can be conceptualized as being comprised of a combination of a series of
physical components (e.g. reforestation planting activities and resettlement site development,)
and a series of institutional and social support components (e.g. natural resources management
planning, livelihood development and training activities).

6. At the time of the interim project evaluation (December 2006), a number of concerns were
identified about the lag between the implementation of the project's physical components and its
social support components. At that time, while positive benefits of the project were being realized
in terms of planting activities and removal of direct pressures on the Full Protection Zone (FPZ)
through resettlement, positive impacts of the project on the community--especially vulnerable
groups and resettled households--were less evident. Delays in provision of infrastructure in the
resettlement sites, difficulties in access to sources of micro-credit for resettled households, low
implementation rates of vocational training and Technology Development and Transfer (TDT)
activities and high levels of resettled houses without production land meant that household
incomes and employment structure in resettled households were not improving significantly. It
was hypothesized at the time that such outcomes may have been symptomatic of the transitional
period when disruption to livelihoods is largely unavoidable. It was therefore recognized that a
greater focus was required on those support activities that aimed to provide resettled households
with sustainable livelihoods so that long-term project benefits could be realized in terms of
protection of coastal mangrove wetland ecosystems.

7. Project evaluation data collected over recent months shows that there has been a significant
improvement from the conditions experienced in 2005 and interim project evaluation. There has
been ongoing implementation of planting, maintenance and protection activities in the FPZ and
Buffer Zone (BZ) and planting targets have been exceeded across the project area. The survival
rate of planted areas is high and evidence suggests that biodiversity and coastal protection values
of the FPZ are continually improving.

8. Planting and protection activities have been coupled with acceleration in the relocation of
households from the FPZ; all identified households have now been relocated from the FPZ to
resettlement sites and interviews within resettlement sites indicate that while use of FPZ
resources, predominantly gathering of fuelwood and fishing, is continuing, levels of resource use
are less than before resettlement and are continuing to decrease. Simultaneous with improvements
in environmental awareness and enforcement capacity, violations of forestry law are decreasing
across all project provinces.



                                                   60

9. Importantly, for resettled households, benefits of the project are now being realized. The
majority of households report increases in household income and quality of life indicators
following relocation to the resettlement sites. Vulnerable groups, including poor, ethnic minority,
female headed and households without production land are more likely than other households to
report increases in household income. Poverty rates have decreased following relocation to
resettlement sites. While vulnerable groups, particularly ethnic minority households, have higher
rates of poverty than the project average, reductions in the numbers of poor households within
these groups are occurring. While a similar proportion of households still rely on hired labour as a
main income strategy, poverty rates amongst this group are reducing. Negative linkages between
lack of production land and hired labour appear to have been reduced, with households without
production land that rely on hired labour showing a lower poverty rate.

10. Access of resettlement households to support activities such as micro-credit, vocational
training and TDT activities for resettled households and vulnerable groups has improved since the
interim project evaluation, although levels of participation in some activities such as Viet Nam
Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) loans are still relatively low. However,
for those resettled households that have been involved in these activities positive impacts have
generally been experienced with increased household incomes commonly reported.

11. The project has delivered benefits to the majority of households in the BZ and Economic
Zone (EZ) and data indicates strong economic growth and livelihood development. Access to
project activities such as VBARD loans, TDT activities and CAP/VAP infrastructure has been
high and a range of positive benefits have resulted. Activities financed under VBARD loans have
resulted in generation of increased income for the vast majority of borrowers. Demonstration
models have had good rates of adoption, although some aquaculture and livestock models have
not been adopted because of requirements for high initial capital outlay, delays in seasonal
production cycles or unsuitability for local conditions. CAP/VAP infrastructure shows high rates
of utilization amongst vulnerable and non-vulnerable households and infrastructure works
involving roads, electricity and canal dredging have had high levels of benefits in terms of direct
and indirect improvements to household income and quality of life.

12. Activities carried out under the Ethnic Minority Development Fund (EMDF) were designed
to specifically support the social and cultural lives of ethnic minority households and benefits
from these activities have been on the whole positive.

13. Project sustainability will rely strongly on the capacity of stakeholders to implement their
responsibilities throughout the remainder of the project and following project completion.
Institutional strengthening benefits for both human and technical resources have resulted
throughout project-supported organizations. Ongoing training has resulted in increased capacity
of personnel to implement project related responsibilities and such skills will be transferable to
future work. The majority of staff were originally from the local area and the resulting increase in
their skills will have benefits for the region in the long term.

14. In summary, the project has achieved its Project Development Objective (PDO). Replanting
and forestry protection activities have been complemented by relocation of households from the
FPZ which has reduced a direct source of pressure on FPZ resources. The biodiversity and coastal
protection values of the FPZ appear to be recovering from past disturbances. Adequate social
support services have been provided to households in resettlement sites and the BZ and EZ,
including vulnerable households, to ensure that ongoing stabilization of livelihoods will continue,
leading to long-term benefits for local communities and the natural resources of the coastal zone.

Lessons Learned

15. Some of the key lessons learned from implementation of the TA for CWPDP include:

    ,,  Rapid mobilisation of the TA as soon as possible after the project's inception is important
         to ensure solid progress of activities from the start of the project.

    ,,  Regular transfer of experience, for example through monthly management meetings, is an
         important and effective means of rapidly initiating and implementing management
         initiatives, as well as transferring lessons learned from one region to others.

    ,,  A flexible management approach is needed at all levels (within broad policy guidelines)
         to ensure that the project can make adaptive responses to changes in the operating
         environment.

    ,,  Project design must be comprehensive to provide a holistic approach to achieving
         development objectives. A strong, integrated focus on socio-economic development
         through improved farm production, infrastructure investment, resettlement, training and
         livelihood support is needed to reach those objectives.

    ,,  Early capacity building is crucial, especially in areas such as procurement and financial
         management.

    ,,  Technical transfer and extension services are very important to success in the field, but
         can be difficult to establish from an organisational/management perspective.

    ,,  Rural credit is critical for the adoption of improved production methods and sustainable
         livelihood improvement.

    ,,  Participation of all levels in decision-making, especially effective PRA techniques is very
         important. However, the needs and aspirations expressed by farmers and local people
         must also be balanced with good technical guidance.

    ,,  Decentralisation is an important and necessary step in effective project implementation,
         and is critical to the sustainability of project interventions.

    ,,  Early and effective implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation including collection of
         comprehensive baseline data to characterise pre-project conditions is important to ensure
         that the project can be objectively evaluated at completion.

    ,,  Commitment and involvement from the whole Provincial government organisation in
         settling and approving the activities of the PPMUs is required.

    ,,  Attention is needed from the World Bank and Government agencies in guiding and
         approving project requests and proposals.

Summary of Project Evaluation Findings

(a) Reducing immediate pressure on coastal mangrove ecosystems by relocating households
from the FPZ to BZ:

16. The project to date has made a significant contribution to the achievement this objective by
relocating a large proportion of households from the FPZ and avoiding self-relocation of
households back to the FPZ. There is no evidence that any households have returned to the FPZ
following resettlement, which is a significant positive outcome of the project.




                                                   62

17. Data collected in 2007 indicates that rather than eliminating reliance on FPZ resources some
resettled households are still collecting resources from the FPZ (small scale hand collection).
Vulnerable groups are more likely to rely on collected resources for household use, while non-
vulnerable households are more likely to rely on resources for commercial purposes. However the
data also indicates that use of these resources is not increasing and for 33 percent of interviewed
households it is in fact decreasing. Data from 2005 to 2007 indicates that reliance on FPZ
resources is decreasing as livelihoods become increasingly stabilized in resettlement sites and this
trend should continue into the future.

(b) Reducing ongoing pressure on coastal mangrove ecosystems through providing sustainable
livelihood development for vulnerable groups in priority communes and resettlement sites;
enhancing sustainability of agriculture and aquaculture practices by improving and maintaining
productivity and diversity in the BZ & EZ; and improving quality of life for vulnerable groups
including poor and ethnic minority households throughout the project area:

18. In terms of project effects on household incomes and quality of life for resettled households,
a range of positive effects has been recognized based on the results of the 2007 data collection.
The data indicates that many of the negative impacts evidenced in the 2005 study have been
reduced or ameliorated as households pass through a transition period in the resettlement sites.
The average monthly income in resettlement sites has increased by 23 percent since the 2005
survey. In addition, 41 percent of resettled households indicate that their household income has
increased since relocation to the resettlement site. Poverty rates have decreased since
resettlement, with a reported poverty rate of 12 percent amongst interviewed resettled households.
This compares to a reported poverty rate of 22 percent prior to resettlement and a rate of 34
percent amongst resettled households in the 2005 survey. Increases in household incomes and
reduction in poverty has been accompanied by changes in the structure and sources of household
income. Since resettlement there has been an increase in the number of households practicing
agriculture and aquaculture and a reduction in the number of households practicing fishing.
Reliance on hire labor has remained relatively unchanged; however, as noted below the negative
links between hire labor and poverty and hire labor and lack of production land are less
pronounced than found in the 2005 investigations. Lack of production land amongst resettled
households has decreased following relocation to the resettlement sites and from the rates found
in the 2005 studies, although one third of resettled households remain without production land.

19. The vast majority of resettled households consider that the quality of life in resettlement sites
represents an improvement from the quality of life in the FPZ, although there were concerns
expressed about the quality of services in the resettlement sites particularly in relation to water
and electricity supply.

20. The project effects on vulnerable households in resettlement sites require particular
attention. The household income of all vulnerable groups remains lower than the project average.
However, all groups reported a higher than average rate of increase in household income
following resettlement. Poverty rates are still higher amongst vulnerable households than across
the project on average, particularly in ethnic minority households. However, all vulnerable groups
reported decreases in poverty rates following relocation to resettlement sites. Households that rely
on hire labor are more likely to be poor than other households; however, decreases in poverty
rates amongst this group have also been experienced following relocation to the resettlement site.
Higher than average rates of households lacking production land are found amongst poor and
ethnic minority households; however, rates of households lacking production land decreased in
these groups following resettlement. Despite the improvements in household incomes and rates
of poverty and households without production land, vulnerable households were less likely to



                                                  63

report that their quality of life had improved in the resettlement site when compared to the FPZ
conditions. This is likely to occur because despite improvements these households still remain
poorer than other groups in the project area.

21. In terms of access to and effects of micro-credit, VBARD loans were processed throughout
the project area. These loans were provided predominantly to existing or previous customers of
VBARD. There was a low rate of access by resettlement households and vulnerable groups,
although improvements in access for these groups since the 2005 investigations have been
experienced. VBARD loans were on average for larger amounts than RF loans and were used
predominantly for aquacultural and agricultural activities; although usually not for new
technologies learnt under the project. The vast majority of VBARD borrowers considered that the
activities financed by the loan had improved their household income and quality of life.

22. RF loans were also processed throughout the project area. RF loans were more commonly
provided to resettlement households and ethnic minority households than VBARD loans;
however poor households had very low access to RF loans. The average amount of RF loans was
one tenth that of VBARD loans. RF loans were used predominantly for agriculture, livestock and
aquaculture activities. Across the project area, implemented activities were generally not linked to
project related skills; however, in resettlement sites RF loan funds were more commonly used to
implement project learnt skills. The vast majority of households indicated that household incomes
and quality of life had improved as a result of RF loan financed activities. Nearly one third of
households reported difficulties in meeting repayments mostly as a result of the scheduling of
repayments which did not correspond to harvest cycles.

23. TDT activities were developed as a mechanism of stabilizing and diversifying household
incomes in the BZ/EZ and resettlement sites. About 955 Demonstration Models (DMs) were
implemented across the project area. Initially DMs were targeted at households with the
available financial and technical resources to ensure the highest chance of success of the DM.
There was a good forecast rate of adoption of TDT models, particularly for those models
involving agriculture and aquaculture models. Lower forecast rates of adoption were found for
DMs that required high capital inputs or that had a long period to harvest including some
livestock and aquaculture models. A high proportion of households implementing DMs received
a profit from the activity. Of those that did not receive a profit in the majority of cases it was due
to as yet un-harvested production, or to a lesser extent a failed harvest. DMs usually resulted in a
higher level of economic output than comparable traditional methods, however, they also required
a higher level of financial input that traditional models. Following the implementation of DMs in
the BZ and EZ, modified demonstration models were also implemented extensively in
resettlement sites. Of the DMs that were undertaken in resettlement sites, a high proportion of
households reported an increase in income as a result. In those households that were not expected
to implement DMs, the main reason cited was a lack of financial resources highlighting the link
between access to micro-credit and ability to successfully implement project activities.

24. Vocational training activities were carried out in resettlement sites across the four provinces.
Earlier investigations revealed a number of deficiencies in the implementation of these activities
and a lack of resulting benefits. However, current investigations indicated that in Tra Vinh and
Soc Trang provinces the effects of vocational training for surveyed households in these provinces
were positive and it appears that the increase in benefits was linked to the implementation of
handicraft training and cooperative development activities. Within Tra Vinh and Soc Trang, rates
of participation in vocational training increased since 2005, including vulnerable households and
the majority of households had implemented the skills learnt and had experienced a resulting
increase in household income.



                                                   64

25. Significant progress in livelihood improvement activities in resettlement sites was made in
2006 and 2007 through the implementation of revised Resettler Agricultural and Social
Development Action Plans (RASDAPs) at all resettlement sites. These were highly targeted and
owned by participants and included more comprehensive packages of support across areas of
agriculture/aquaculture demonstrations, vocational training, cooperative development (e.g.
handicrafts and aquaculture cooperatives) and labor market placement (e.g. labor export and
investment promotion).

26. The EMDF was developed to specifically provide support to ethnic minority households in
the project area. A range of direct and indirect benefits have resulted from the implementation of
EMDF activities. A high proportion of ethnic minority households were satisfied with the type
and quality of EMDF activities and reported that the activities had resulted in improvements to
their quality of life, even if the nature of the activities meant that they were used infrequently (e.g.
crematoriums, musical instruments and boats for festivals).

27. CAP/VAP activities were implemented throughout the project area and resulted in a range of
benefits. High rates of utilization of all types of CAP/VAP infrastructure were reported. High
rates of usage were reported amongst vulnerable groups, particularly poor households. There was
very high reported satisfaction with CAP/VAP activities. Over half of the interviewed households
reported a direct or indirect increase in household income as a result of CAP/VAP activity
implementation, while over three quarters reported increases in quality of life. Improvements to
roads, electricity supply and canals were the activities that resulted in the most significant
benefits. A relatively high proportion of interviewed households indicated their involvement in
CAP/VAP planning and implementation; although, the rate of these households that were trained
to carry out their assigned responsibilities was low.

(c) Restoring degraded coastal mangrove ecosystems by carrying out replanting activities and
providing for ongoing protection and maintenance:

28. Based on available information, significant progress has been made in meeting this
objective. Over one quarter of the area identified as barren land in the FPZ in 1999 has been
reforested as a direct result of project activities. When combined with other forestry activities
being implemented by the GOV in the project area, more than 90 percent of barren areas in the
FPZ have now been reforested. Protection and maintenance contracts are in place in all forested
areas. Over 70 percent of the planted areas have experienced mangrove seedling survival rates of
more than 85 percent. Overall planting activities carried out under the project have resulted in
significant positive outcomes.

29. In terms of forestry violations, available data indicates increasing trends in the number of
violations prior to the substantive commencement of project activities and decreasing trends
across all provinces once project activities had commenced.

30. Data on related benefits of forestry activities, such as improvements to water quality, coastal
protection and biodiversity values are currently very limited. However, anecdotal evidence
combined with preliminary results of studies on land use and water quality indicates that benefits
are occurring in the FPZ.

31. The environmental and economic benefits of mangrove ecosystems are well recognized.
These benefits include values as fish nurseries, export of primary and secondary productivity,
protection from flooding, a cleansing system for sediments and nutrients in estuaries, coastal



                                                    65

erosion protection and as a forestry resource (Kaly and Jones 1998). Many of these benefits
relate directly to subsistence and community fisheries (Saenger et al. 1983; Robertson and
Phillips 1995; Tam and Wong 1995). Mangroves provide critical habitats, a direct food source
and structural diversity used by many fisheries species. Mangrove areas in the Tra Vinh, Soc
Trang and Ca Mau regions of the Mekong Delta have an estimated economic value of US$2340
to US$4593 per hectare per year (Anon 2003). Thus it can be inferred that the planting
undertaken by the CWPDP has realized similar benefits in the project area.

(d) Providing institutional strengthening to organizations with responsibilities for protection of
coastal mangrove ecosystems and provision of social support services to BZ & EZ communities:

31.   Project sustainability will rely strongly on the capacity of stakeholders to implement their
responsibilities following project completion. Based on the results of the analysis, institutional
strengthening benefits appear to have resulted for staff and across project supported
organizations. Despite initial concerns about capacity of staff to meet GOV and international
project management requirements, ongoing training has resulted in increased capacity of
personnel to implement project related responsibilities and such skills will be transferable to
future work. Almost all staff were originally from the local area and the resulting increase in their
skills will have benefits for the region in the long term. Support to research institutes and forestry
related management units and enterprises appears to have been relevant to their needs and
supported by adequate training; as a result high levels of equipment usage and institutional
benefits have been reported. Improved coordination between the project and DONRE/DOST
laboratories would have assisted in the better identification of required institutional support and
allowed adequate and coordinated training of staff. Overall, significant progress has been made
towards achievement of this objective.

           Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

8.1 The Embassy of Denmark received the final draft Implementation Completion Report of the
CWPDP project. In principle, we agree with the assessments of the ICR team. The CWPDP is a
complex project which was seriously delayed at the beginning but went back on-track later after a
successful project restructuring in 2004.

8.2 We are pleased to see that DANIDA funds were used for supporting the protection of coastal
mangroves and for improving the livelihoods of the coastal poor including the Khmer ethnic
minority communities. The results of the project have demonstrated conclusively that
environmental protection should go hand-in-hand with the development of alternative livelihoods
for the poor who were using the resources unsustainably, and a balance must be achieved between
regulation and incentives to allow the stakeholders to plan for the long term.

8.3 To enhance the sustainability of the project's impact, we strongly recommend that
Government should continue building on the results of the project to improve further the
livelihoods of the poor, especially the resettlement people and Khmer communities, and to ensure
consistency of future programs in the project area.
