The\n            Project has largely achieved the project development\n            objective (PDO) outcomes, and overall project implementation\n            is satisfactory with most of the intermediate results at the\n            component level fully achieved. The final rating for\n            development objective (DO) is satisfactory and that for\n            implantation progress (IP) also satisfactory. The\n            disbursement rate is 72 percent as of June 27, 2012. The\n            restructuring is to reallocate International Development\n            Association (IDA) credit between different disbursement\n            categories to reflect a parallel cancellation of US$6.6\n            million. While the majority of planned activities have been\n            implemented with good results, there appears to be\n            overestimates of costs for several main activities, leading\n            to a balance of US$6.6 million of the IDA credit unutilized.\n            At the same time, the Government of Kenya has clearly\n            indicated where the funds can be better used within the\n            Bank's country portfolio."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
