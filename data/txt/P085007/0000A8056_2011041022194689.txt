                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project aims to increase productivity and employment in participating micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). This objective will be achieved by
                         strengthening financial and non-financial markets to meet the demand of MSMEs, strengthening support for employable skills and business management, and
                         reducing critical investment climate constraints in MSMEs. The project will focus on key value chains and on both formal small and medium enterprises and
                         informal microenterprises that have high potential for dynamic growth, including "graduation" from informal to formal status.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         institutions (FI) have been supported by the project and have in turn provided 933,124 loans to Kenyan MSMEs, in addition almost US$4.7 million worth of deposits in FIs supported
                         by the project. Financiers have also committed US$11.4 million to the Risk capital fund, support from which has led o the creation of over 1,000 new jobs.

                         The second Phase of the Business Plan competition would soon be underway; during the first phase, over 2,000 businesses plans were given awards. The Matching Grant scheme
                         continues to be a great performer, notably also on the leather sector which was one of the latest value chains supported, including the Launch of the Leather Development Council

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been re-configured to better deliver results and the implementation period extended through June 30th, 2012. The project's steering committee is being proactively
                         engaged to provide on-time strategic guidance and ensuring approved budgets and implementation schedules are adhered to.

                         "Improving the Business Environment" component was dropped in view of changing circumstances in Kenya . The Kenyan Investment Authority and Kenya Revenue authority have
                         instituted initiatives that have made the component's activities and expected outcomes redundant, hence the need to drop the component. The freed up resources have been, in
                         agreement with Government re-assigned to other activities. Other departments of the World Bank Group continue to provide support for further enhancing the business enabling
                         environment.
