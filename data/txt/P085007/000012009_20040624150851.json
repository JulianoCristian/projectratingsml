Medium Enterprise\n            (MSMEs) Competitiveness Project aims to increase\n            productivity, and employment in participating MSMEs, by\n            strengthening financial, and non-financial markets to meet\n            the their demand, strengthening institutional support for\n            employable skills, and business management, and, reducing\n            critical investment climate constraints on MSMEs. Through\n            its components, the project will: 1) deepen and expand the\n            reach of financial services, and products available to\n            MSMEs, including new risk capital instruments. This will be\n            achieved through performance based matching grants, to\n            assist a range of financial institutions build capacity to\n            provide financial services to different segments of MSME\n            sector; 2) strengthen enterprise skills and market linkages,\n            by addressing market failures that limit the ability of\n            MSMEs in obtaining the necessary skills and business\n            services to exploit opportunities and overcome bottlenecks.\n            It integrates a set of complementary, and mutually\n            reinforcing activities to support enterprise needs,\n            including a value-chain based subsector matching grant fund,\n            tools for business schools to better train managers,\n            business plan competition to catalyze innovation, and\n            entrepreneurship, and restructuring of the national levy\n            scheme, to ensure sustainability of firm-level training; 3)\n            reduce compliance costs in business regulations regarding\n            the formal sector, and create incentives for informal MSMEs\n            to graduate to higher levels of formality, and thus\n            facilitate their access to resources for growth. It will\n            assist in implementing the simplified taxation regime for\n            micro, and small businesses, and in reducing the cost of\n            starting-up businesses, through a one-stop shop approach."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
