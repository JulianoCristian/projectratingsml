2. The Project has largely achieved the PDO outcomes, and overall project
   implementation is Satisfactory with most of the Intermediate Results at the
   component level fully achieved. The final rating for DO is Satisfactory and that for
   IP also Satisfactory. The disbursement rate is 72 percent as of June 27, 2012. For
   details please refer to the attached Project’s Implementation Status Report dated June
   26, 2012.

3. The proposed restructuring is to reallocate IDA credit between different disbursement
   categories to reflect a parallel cancellation of US$6.6 million. While the majority of
   planned activities have been implemented with good results, there appears to be
   overestimates of costs for several main activities, leading to a balance of US$6.6
   million of the IDA credit unutilized. At the same time, the Government of Kenya has
   clearly indicated where the funds can be better used within the Bank’s country
   portfolio.
