to\n            development outcome.  Both the Bank and Borrower's\n            performances were moderately satisfactory. Although the\n            Project suffered serious delays under several subcomponents\n            in the first two to three years, implementation started to\n            accelerate in 2007 and went into full swing after the 2009\n            restructuring. Of the eight intermediate results, five were\n            met or exceeded, two were largely met and one was partially\n            met. Several lessons are learnt from this experimental joint\n            Bank/IFC Operation: innovations can succeed under Bank\n            financed projects, if the environment for innovations is\n            favorable, and the implementing entities know the local\n            market well and are highly motivated; details are important\n            in project design and supervision; better approach is needed\n            for joint IDA-IFC operations; monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) design should factor in the cost and capacity\n            requirement; and standard economic analysis methodology may\n            not be universally applicable pending the nature of the main\n            interventions of a project."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
