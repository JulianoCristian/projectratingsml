A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

politically stable countries inEast Africa. The followingtwo decades of economic mismanagement,
however, reversedthis enviable position to a state of extensive poverty (currently estimated at 56 percent
o fthe population) and economic decline. Average GDP growth fell from approximately seven percent in
the 1970stojust over two percent inthe 1990s. The resultant stagnation was accompaniedby a decline in
the efficiency ofcapital and factor productivity, negatively impactingKenya's competitiveness inthe
world economy.

A new government was elected inDecember 2002 on aplatform ofchange. It is committedto reversing
the past decades' economic decline, mismanagement, contractioninper capita income and increaseinthe
numbers living below the poverty line. Ithas prepared the Economic Recovery Strategyfor Wealthand
Employment Creation, 2003-2007 (EM) which outlines a recovery centered on a reanimated private
sector. Revivingprivate sector activity and investment and specifically micro, small, and mediumsized
enterprise (MSME) development, feature prominently inthe Government's strategy for raising incomes
and employment. The Government's objectives, policies and strategy for MSMEdevelopment are
articulated inthree critical policy and strategy documents. The E M and the "Investment Program        "
translate the Government's mandate into a prioritized program of action for the nextfive years and
emphasize the importance o f the micro and small enterprise sector injob creation. Additionally, the
Micro and Small Enterprise SessionalPaper lays the policy framework and government vision for the
sector's development.

Data on the MSMEsector inKenya i s scarce; although the National MSEBaseline Survey' provides
comprehensive and reliable information, it has not beenupdated since 1999 and does not contain
information for medium-sizedfirms.2 The survey indicates that the contribution o f the MSEsector to
GDP increased from 13.8 percent in 1993 to 18.4 percent in 1999. Ofthe labor force inthis segment (1-
50 employees), 99 percent was concentrated inenterprises of less than 10 workers, while only 1percent
comprised firms with 10-50 employees.

The increasing role ofthe MSMEsector is confirmed bythe recently completedKenya2003 Economic
S~rvey.~   According to the survey, total employment recorded inthe informal sector increased from 3.7
million employees in 1999 to 5.1 million in2002, while the formal sector increased only from 1.74
million to 1.76 million employees duringthe same peri~d.~        However, the growth of the informal sector in
number of employees does not necessarily reflect growth and highproductivity o fthe enterprise itself, as
the number of informal sector companies grew largelybecauseofthe depressedformal economy and
underemployment inthe formal firms.

SmallEnterpriseBaseline Survey, 1999.
  The availablesurveys do not cite employmentfigures for medium-sizedfirms (50-99 employeesper firm); this
proposedProject's target group will, however, include not only micro (1-9 employees) and small (10-49
employees), but also medium-sizedfirms, as this segment plays a critical role inemploymentgeneration and market
linkages.

  The survey does not specificallycategorize by size and number o f employeeso fMSMEs. This definition o fthe
informal sector includes domestic servants which are not consideredas MSEs inKenya. The sector as reportedin
the Economic Survey is thereforelargerthanthe actualMSE sector.

Specific sector issues include:
Market failures have constrained MSMEdevelopment inKenya, as inmany developing countries, by
limitingthe necessaryaccess to information, finance, labor skills, andbusiness development services
(BDS) to increase competitiveness andproductivity. Lack of information andpast experience with
transactions is a common factor that limitsthe willingnessof small firms to pay for services and potential
suppliersto take risks (or calculate them reliably) or to adapt products to MSMEs. Past dependenceon
government agencies for these services, often at highly subsidized rates, has blunted MSMEs' orientation
toward seeking private providers, who inturnhave been crowded out.

Nevertheless, Kenya, with its long private sector tradition, has significant potential to establish
sustainable financial, business and other service markets suitable for MSMEs. Recent experience with
demand-driven approaches within the Bank and other donor projects indicates that well-designed
subsidies can leverage potentialdemand and bringforth a sustainable supply responsebeyondthe life o f
the subsidy. The proposed project takes a strategic approach to overcoming market failures and raising
competitiveness through short-to-mediumterm support designed to leverage sustained willingness of
MSMEsto pay for services, as well as to catalyze potential suppliersto consider product adaptation and
innovation for the MSMEmarket.

Access to Finance: A significant gap remains betweenthe small portion of the informal economy served
by microfinance institutions (MFIs)and Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs), andthe narrow
portion o fthe formal economy served by commercial banks and licensednon-bank financial institutions.
Onone end o fthe spectrum, the financial marketcatering to the lower end o fthe market is comprised of
over 5,000 institutions which provide microfinance products. Within this diverse group (which include
MFIsand SACCOs), the institutionstarget nichesegmentsofthe populationwith different instruments,
cover different geographical areas, and are guided by different forms o fregulation and supervision.
These financial institutions have helpedincreaseaccess for the lower endo f the market, particularly for
the entrepreneurial poor engagedinpetty trade or other income-earning activities withrapidturnover.
However, their poverty focus and difficulty inachieving commercial licensed status (needed to mobilize
savings for scaling up) has limitedtheir development of products suitable for enterprise-based lending.

On the other endo f the spectrum is the commercial banking sector, which inKenya is large (estimated at
Ksh491 billion, or approximately US$6.5 billionequivalent, as ofNovember 2003) and fairly active.
However, banks have traditionally avoided lendingto the MSMEsector due to their relatively high
transaction costs, difficulties assessingand managing risk, and the inability o f most small firms to provide
the required financial documentationand collateral. This problemhas beenexacerbated by the `crowding
out' effect o f Kenyan Government debt instruments, which effectively provided highrisk-free returns for
the banks. The recent dramatic change inthis situation, with yields o f government debt at recordlow
levels and very high liquidity inthe banking sector, has greatly increased the interest of commercial banks
inlendingto MFIsandMSMEs. However, inroadshave beenlimitedby the above-mentioned market
constraints and imperfections.

To addressthe large gap inthe middle, inroads can be made by assisting MFIsto move upmarket and
commercial financial institutions to move downmarket. Yet, the mid-range small and mediumenterprise
(SME)segment remains very difficult to reachthrough either standard microfinanceor commercialbank
methodologies. SME loanrequirements tend to be large relative to microfinance character-based loan
sizes, but too small tojustify the costs o f processing according to commercial bank requirements-
especially when their weak financial management systems may make data collection and loan monitoring
more onerous than for larger firms. The heavy collateral requirements that banks impose to help manage
risk, servesto screen out the vast majority of SMEs. Hence, inaddition to improvingSMEaccessto

commercial loans, it will be necessaryto develop a range of other commercially viable financial
instrumentsto help meetthe various financing needs of SMEs.

Labor Productivityand ManagementSkills: Labor productivity features prominently among the key
factors that drive economic competitiveness and growth. Recent analysis ofthe manufacturing sector in
Kenya indicates that both labor and capital productivity have declined significantly when compared to the
mid-1990s. The overall medianvalue-added per worker inKenya is slightly higher today (US$3,457)
than in 1999 (US$3,025), but current levels have still not recoveredto that of the mid-90's (US$4,520).
InvestmentClimate Assessment (ICA) data also suggeststhat value-added per worker insmall firms,
specifically, have consistently decreasedover the last decade (US$3,099 in 1994; US$2,521 in 1999; and
US$2,439 in2003).

Risingunit labor costs hasbeen identifiedas akey factor inthe erosionofthe competitiveness ofthe
Kenyan manufacturing sector.6 Although unit labor cost inKenya is lower than other Sub-Saharan
African countries, it is about 12 per cent higherthan inIndia and 33 per cent higher than inChinaa7
Giventhe higher rate o f literacy among the Kenyan workforce when compared to other sub-Saharan
countries, the labor productivity issues are associatedmore with the prevalence, level and quality o f skills
development and technical training.8

Labor market imperfections make it difficult to overcome this gap. Kenya's formal technical, vocational
and educational training (WET) institutions have little orientationtoward the practical needs o f the
enterprise sector. Despite the substantial assistance offered through the recently closed World Bank
MSETTP voucher training program, approximately 80 percent o f the training was provided from within
the MSMEsector rather than from formaltraining institutions. While the Industrial TrainingLevy
scheme is intendedto overcome the tendency of firms to underinvestintraining, the current operation o f
the scheme does not adequately meetthe expectations andrequirements offirms bothinterms ofcapacity
and quality o f skills delivery systems.

Weak market linkages: Collaboration as well as competition are requiredamong enterprises inorder to
assurethat full growth potential is realizedwithin the MSMEsector. Thejoint use of assets, the
development o f external markets through business support services and the adoption of trade standards
and protocols among trading partners are some of the ways inwhich collaboration can reduce transaction
costs, improve market access and enhance competitiveness.

Inthe case ofKenya, however, avalue chainanalysis offour sub-sectors, completedas part ofproject
preparation, demonstrates that mutual support systems and value chain linkages are extremely weak. A
small number o f large privately operated firms compensatefor this weakness by internalizingvalue
adding activities along the entire value chain under the vertical control of their own enterprises. This
"vertical internalization" o f entire farm-to-finished good value chains is a "second best" solution which
reduces the ability and competitive adaptability of enterprises which adopt it. Inany case, vertical
integration within a single enterprise is not an option for MSMEs. The value chain study also found that
participants within value chains are highly compartmentalized and that commercial links between
suppliers and buyers tendto be ad-hoc, one-time transactions and highly personalized. Moreover, high
levels of distrust exist among companies within sub-sectors, and betweenfarm level producers and farm
product processors/merchandisers. As a result, transaction costs tend to be extremely highand useful
informationtends not to be distributedquickly and efficiently within chains.

Support institutions that ordinarily facilitate subcontracting relationships indeveloped markets are absent
inthe Kenyan economy, andBDSproviders are oriented mainly toward large firms. These weaknesses
are compounded by ineffective or non-existent sub-sector membershipassociations, which inother
countries have assistedwith the development of supply chain linkages betweenkey segments. This set of
factors makes it extremely difficult for MSMEsto rely on vendors or customers as sources of competitive
advantage or to depend on specialized BDSproviders to assist with strategic enterprise development. As
a direct result, entire value chains remain frozen inearly stages o ftheir strategic development -
constrained by management incompetencies, resourcesand technologies isolated from markets that tend
to be available only within individual enterprises.

Businessand RegulatoryEnvironment: The creation o f an enabling environment for private
investment, bothlocal and foreign, is a clearly stated government priority inthe ERS. These promises
have generatedhighexpectations among investors and the population at large. Although resolutions to
the myriad ofproblems are complex and long-term, intermediate-term reforms demanded by the private
sector can be implementedwithin the nextfew years.

According to a survey conducted in2003, firms that were registered at start-up are significantly more
likely to "graduate" (grow to a larger size category) than those that are unregistered. "Registration seems
to be an epoch inthe lifecycle o f informal firms and is crucial for firm graduation. This finding leads to
the conclusionthat informality imposes major penalties on firms with uncertainlegal statusthat reduces
access to credit andpublic services such as electricity, telephone and water, all o f which are important for
improved performance and grad~ation."~

To date, there have been a few successful attempts to reform the business environment inKenya. Most
notably, the Government of Kenyawith technical assistance and funding from UK Department for
International Development(DFID), introducedin2000 the single business permit which combined 16
individual locally issued business licenses into one. However, the process o f formalization still remains
complex - it is regulated by different procedures and requires multipletrips to Nairobi. According to
Doing Business data, firms who wish to register formally are requiredto perform 11separate procedures,

Insightsfrom Ghana, Kenya, and Zimbabwe," 2003.

which takes on average about 60 days. Some informal industry estimates suggest the process is even
more complex andtime consuming. While the cost, time, and complexity are better thanthe Sub-Saharan
Africa average and in line with other low incomecountries, these numbers compareunfavorably with
high-income countries.

Inmost cases, MSMEsalso needto dealwith localauthorities-municipalities -to obtaindifferenttypes
of permits to start their businesses. The impact of the regulatoryenvironment on MSMEsare more
extensivethan for larger firms as the time and cost of registeringa business and dealingwith disputes
with regulatory agencies is more expensiveper unit of production. The informal sector also bears high
costs from harassmentfor non-complianceand from risksofpermanently being closed." These
constraints, coupled with the problemsassociatedwith tax andtax administration, serve as an incentive
for firms to operate informally.

2. Rationalefor Bank involvement

The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, to be discussed at the Boardon June 17,2004, is a strategy o f
reengagement. The thrust ofthe Bank's programfor FY 2004 to 2007 supportsthe goals set forth inthe
Economic Recovery Strategy, stimulating growth with equity, reducingpoverty, and consolidating
improvementsingovernance. This project addressestwo ofthese three main pillars -- stimulating
economic growth, while reducingpoverty.

This project falls underthejoint IDA/IFC Micro, Small, andMedium EnterpriseDevelopmentProgram
for Africa", intendedto achieve greater impactfor the country by integratingthe expertise, resources and
instruments ofthe World Bank, International FinanceCorporation (IFC), and other bilateral donors and
leveragingthe comparativeadvantages ofthese institutions. This approachwill enable the World Bank
Group to respondmore effectively to African client countries' growing demands for assistance to put
MSMEsinthe forefront ofprivate-led growth andemploymentgenerationfor poverty reduction. The
first operationdevelopedunder this Program, for Nigeria (Report Number 27213-UNI), demonstratedthe
synergy of combining International DevelopmentAssociation's (IDA) ability to address policy and
regulatory issues andto provide technical assistancewith IFC's ability to assess market opportunitiesand
mobilize investment(e.g., for microfinance). The proposedproject adopts a similar innovative approach
for addressinggaps inMSMEdevelopment.

Other donors, particularly DFID, EuropeanUnion (EU), U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), andUnitedNations DevelopmentProgram(UNDP), havecontinuedto actively support MSME
development, insome cases through an integratedprogramwith similar pillars of assistance (Access to
Finance, Business Services, andBusiness Environment). Duringproject preparation,thejoint BankAFC
team consulted with donors in both the Private Sector Development (PSD) donor technical working group
forum and bilaterally with those most active inprivate sector development. The PSD donor technical
working group provided feedback on the project design and welcomed new IDA funds into PSD work
which they felt was "long overdue." They welcomedthe World Bank Group's interest inaddressing
important gaps and its support inencouraginggovernment not to relapseinto direct service delivery, and
urgedthe Bank to utilize the project to leverage government's focus on policies, priorities, and
institutional arrangements.

3. Higher levelobjectivesto whichthe projectcontributes
The higher level objective is increasedgrowth andcompetitiveness ofMSMEs. This higher level
objective is aligned with the recently approved CAS and with the Government's focus on MSME
development as an important vehicle to raise incomes and employment.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Lendinginstrument
The project will be supported by a sector investment loan. This instrument is appropriate as it will
provide direct financing for activities which have been identifiedby a wide range of stakeholders to
achieve higher levels of competitiveness.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveand key indicators
The project aims to increaseproductivity and employment inparticipating MSMEs. This objective will
be achieved by strengtheningfinancial andnon-financial markets to meet the demand o fMSMEs,
strengthening institutional support for employable skills and business management, and reducing critical
investmentclimate constraints onMSMEs. The project will focus onkey value chains and onboth
formal small and mediumenterprises and informal microenterprises that have highpotential for dynamic
growth, including "graduation" from informal to formal status.

3. Projectcomponents
The project supports the Government programto increasethe competitiveness ofMSMEsthrough
mutually reinforcing components -(i)    access to finance, (ii)strengtheningenterprise skills andmarket
linkages, and (iii)improvingthe business environment.

                  -
This component will co-finance a Financial Sector DeepeningTrust, aimed at deepeningand expanding
the reach o f financial services and products that are available to MSMEs. This objective will be achieved
through performance based grants for a range o f financial institutions to buildcapacity to provide
financial services to different segments o fthe MSMEsector. This component will support the following:

    MFIStrengthening,Outreachand Commercialization: Capacity buildinginexistingMFIsand
    SACCOs, with three main areas o f focus: (i)    a technical skills transfer program for well-performing

    MSMEs,suchas leasinganddiscountingreceivables.

SubcomponentB -SME Risk Capital and TechnicalAssistance Fund (IDA US$6..5mm: other private
investment US$ISmm)
There are severalreasons why small and medium firms cannot access commercialbank financing, not
only inKenya, but also inmany developingcountriesaroundthe world. Banks typically requirewell
secured collateral from applicants and are ill-suitedto serve the needs of young small andmedium-sized
firms due to information asymmetrieson project quality betweenbankersand entrepreneursandthe lack
of adequate collateral. Riskcapital funds, on the other hand, specialize inthe financing of start-up and
first expansionprojects andprovide close support and supervision, which can mitigate these asymmetries
and later provide comfort to banks for the financing of suchprojects. By solving problems relatingto
information asymmetries, riskcapital funds canthereforebridge the gap betweenemerging entrepreneurs
andthe banking system. However, while risk capital financing is apotential solution to the difficulties
SMEshave accessingandservicing debt financing, thistype offinancing instrumentfor SMEsinAfrica
has sufferedfrom obstaclesrelatedto limitations on growth potential, exit opportunitiesfor equity
investorsandhigh costs of processingfor relatively small investment amounts.

Consistentwith the objectivesof subcomponentA, this subcomponentwill help catalyzenew riskcapital
instruments(mix of debt, equity andquasi-equity) tailored for SMEsby adaptingmethodologiesthat have
successfully reacheda large number of SMEs inother countries. IDA funds would be usedto support the
introduction of a risk capital SMEfund inKenya by sharingaportionofthe operatingcosts of the fund
andthrough the establishmentof an associatedtechnicalassistance (TA) facility for the SMEinvestees,
subjectto fulfillment of eligibility andperformancerequirements. The use of IDA funds isjustified by
the ability to leveragerelatively large amountsofprivate investmentfunds designedto supportsignificant
numbersof SMEs.

IDA funds would additionally be usedto create aTechnicalAssistance Fundfor SME investees of
existing or new Kenyan risk capital funds to promote and encourage additional investmentsinthe SME
sector. Selection ofbeneficiarieswill be determined on the basisof proposalsreceivedinresponse to
requests for expressionsof interest to potential investorsand fund managers in accordance with
establishedeligibility and performance criteria.

Component Two -Strengthening Enterprise Skills and Market Linkages
This component addresses market failures that limitthe ability ofMSMEsto obtainthe necessary skills
and business services to exploit opportunities and overcomebottlenecks. It integratesa set of
complementaryand mutually reinforcing activities to support a wide range of enterprise needs, including
subsector specific BDS, tools for businessschoolsto bettertrain managers, activities to catalyze
innovation and entrepreneurship, andrestructuring of the national levy scheme to ensure sustainability of
firm-level training beyonddonor financing.

Subcomponent A -Pilot Value Chain Based Matchina Grant Program (IDA US$4mm)
The objectiveofthis sub-componentisto strengthencompetitivenessandraisevalue-addedinsupply
chains by enhancingaccess to business development services (BDS) and strengtheninglinkages (both
betweenfirms and from MSMEsto markets). The core ofthe subcomponent would be a matchinggrant
fund designedto stimulate increaseddemandby MSMEsfor BDSanda supply responseorientedtoward
servicing specific markets on a sustainablebasis. The fundwould provide partial financing for eligible
training and other BDS,particularly `knowledge-based, services directedtoward improving
competitiveness and performance at critical points invalue chains. To fillthe information gap and
strengthenthe role of intermediariesneededto makeBDSmarketsfunction, accessto the fund would be



                                                       7

basedon the submission and approvalof avalue chain basedbusinessplan draftedjointly by
representativecompanies and/or industryassociationshetworks. For example, inthe case of the cotton-
to-apparelsupply chain, companies or representativesfrom member-basedorganizations inthe cotton,
ginning, spinnindweaving, knitting, and apparel industrieswould be expectedto work together to
formulate ajoint business plan that addresses key sub-sectorissues, as well as to develop a
comprehensivechain strategy. The purposeof the pilot would be to act as a demonstrationmodel and
provide lessons andbest practicesthat canbe scaledup and applied across other value chains.

SubcomponentB -Restructuring of the Industrial TrainingLevv Scheme (IDA US$0.5mm)
The objective ofthis subcomponentis to enhance the level and quality oftechnicaltraining and skills
development inorder to increase labor productivity and competitiveness of key economic sectors. Kenya
has a long-establishedIndustrial Training Levy scheme under which employerspay a levy to a dedicated
industrial training fundwhich providesreimbursementof total or partial expensesfor pre-approved
training programs. Firms that contribute a mandatory levy to the fund(in principle, those with morethan
five workers) have an incentiveto train their workers, offsetting the tendencyto under-investintraining
due to labor mobility. While the scheme is broadly accepted by the Kenyanprivate sector and has been
useful inthe past, there is aneedto modernizeand restructure it to meet the evolving skills needs of firms
inthe growing sectors ofthe economy. The expectationis that increasedtraining ofemployeesat all
levels inthe appropriateset of skills will leadto higher levels of labor force productivity.

Under this subcomponent, a study will be carriedout to address four key issues: (i)  the developmentof an
industrial skills funding strategy that is demand driven, basedon the principlesof private-public
participation, andwhich is consistentwith on-going Government initiatives to establishaNational Skills
Authority; (ii) developmentof a new legal, regulatory and institutional framework to more effectively
                the
support the delivery of industrial skills; (iii)
                                               designof afuture levy fund governance, management and
institutional arrangements to fit the Kenyan environment. The study will consider the merits of adopting
a single levy mechanism(such as a payrolllevy) and changingthe levy collection mechanism. Itwill also
design atransparent and efficient system for firm registration,training approval, submission and approval
of claims andreimbursements; and (iv) re-design ofthe existing industrialtraining qualification structure,
supportedby anew skills needs assessment and accreditationpracticesinconsultationwith the private
sector.

SubcomponentC -Global BusinessSchoolNetwork: Improving opportunities and training for
Entrepreneurs and MSMEs (IDA US$2.0mm)
This componentwill introduce a Business Plaflnnovation Competition (US$1.4 mm) through a
competitively selected firm of consortium of firms/institutions, basedupon best practice models to
encourageinnovative business ideas. The competition would provide potential entrepreneurs with
screening, training, and mentoring. The business plan competition may adopt prizes onthemes for
particular types of enterprises such asjua kali, social enterprises, andrural-basedenterprises. Aspects of
this subcomponentwill be modeledonthe DevelopmentMarketplace. The IDA support will bephased
over five years, eventually supporting only 25 percentofthe costs ofthe program inyear five, inorder to
ensure ownership and sustainability of program.

Additionally, the componentwill scale up activities of Global Business SchoolNetwork (GBSN) (US$0.6
mm), an initiative startedby IFC in2002, designedto strengthenthe institutional capacity ofbusiness
schools indevelopingcountries through anon-profit entity called Global Business SchoolNetwork
Center. The GBSN Center brings together top global business schools with business schools in
developing countries and creates, for the first time, a multilateral approachto managerialcapacity
building. InKenya, GBSN Center will be pilotingits activities with at leastthree businessschools. The
activities to be implementedat the business managementschools inKenya are twofold. First,
strengtheningthe curriculumand development/integrationof locally relevantcases to increase


                                                      8

effectiveness o fthe training available for entrepreneursand owners of MSMEs. Second, schools will
develop short courses for managersof MSMEswho do not have the time and/or resources to become full
time business students.


ComponentThree Improvingthe BusinessEnvironment(IDA US$tmm)
                     -

This component will contribute to improvement ofthe businessenvironmentby reducingthe costs of
investment and doing business. Specifically, it will reduce cost of compliance with business regulations
for the formal sector and create incentives for informal MSMEsto graduateto higherlevels of formality,
and thus facilitate their access to resources for growth. This component will assist the Government in
implementingthe simplifiedtaxation regimefor micro and small businesses and inreducingthe cost of
starting-upa business through a one-stop shop approach.

The informalsector has playedan important role inemployment generation inKenya. However, the
transition from informal to formal is critical both for the enterprise (for increased access to markets,
financial services, contracts, contract enforcement, security, and protectionfrom the rent-seeking
behavior o f control agencies) and enterprise growth, as well as for the Government (through increasedtax
revenue and environmentalhafety compliance). A prohibitive business environment -- hightaxation,
cost andtime of business start-up and compliance with business regulations -- are among the main
reasonswhy firms prefer to operate informally.

This component will use an integrated approach for addressingthe above-mentioned issues. The primary
objective is to enable prospective entrepreneurs to comply with businessstart-up regulations and tax
liabilities ina single interface with government institutions (One-Stop-Shop approach). The introduction
o f such a system will combine the current partial legalization (e.g. singlebusiness permit) with the other
necessary legal obligations (e.g. receiving PIN, trade license, business name registration) and tax liability.
Second, the component will support the design and the implementation, subject to parliamentary
approval, o f a simplified taxation system for micro and small businesses.This system will likely be inthe
form o f a unifiedtax and will be applicable for businesses operating below the VAT threshold. The
proposed unifiedtax will substitute the existing numerous taxes and fees for which MSMEsare liable.

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
The project has beendesigned drawing onthe World Bank Group's experience inSub-SaharanAfrica and
other regions, and has benefitedfrom the inputsof various World Bank Group networks and global
products groups, includingFinance, Private and Infrastructure (FPSI) network, IFC GlobalFinancial
Markets and IFC Africa Region, the SME Department, Africa Project Development Facility, Africa
Region RuralDevelopment units,Foreign InvestmentAdvisory Services (FIAS), and Investment Climate
Unit. The project was also preparedinconsultationandwithcontributions from the PSDDonor
Technical working group inKenya.

Inaddition, avariety ofeconomic and sector work influencedthe design duringproject preparation
including several Government studies (Economic Recovery Strategy, InvestmentProgram, Micro and
Small EnterpriseSessionalPaper) and World Bank studies (Value Chain Analysis o f four sub-sectors,
InvestmentClimate Assessment, draft FIAS Administrative Barriersresults, Financial Sector Assessment
Program, Survey of Management Education inAfrica, and the Kenya MSETTP World Bank project
completion report), as well as other donor-funded studies and evaluationreports.

This project falls under thejoint IDNIFC Programfor Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise
Development, which is intendedto expand on successful approachesalready under way inthe Bank

Group's work inAfrica and will provide innovative solutions to chronic difficulties in small enterprise
work inAfrica.12 The project designreflects the following key lessons learned:

(a)      Integratedapproach: A principal conclusion ofreviews of past MSMEprojects was the need
for an integrated package of interventions (access to financial services, business development services,
and improvements inthe business environment for MSMEs)that address interrelated constraints and
enable MSMEsto access markets on a sustainable basis. This project is built on these three
complementary pillars.

(b)      Performancegrant agreements:Insome components, the project will utilize performance
agreementswith intermediary service providers inorder to re-enforce a commercial and results focus to
project-funded activities. The performance basedgrants are designed to (1) leverage private funds and
offset up-front development costs inorder to maximize market development effects and minimize price
distortions, as inthe case of the SMErisk capital fundcomponent or to (2) buildthe capacity and
products o f potential suppliersthat are interested inservingthe MSMEmarket on a sustainable basis in
the future, as inthe case ofthe FinancialSector Deepeningcomponent. The risksofpossible market-
distorting effects are minimized by (i)     focusing on segments where the market is very thinor non-
existent; and (ii)targeting development costs and avoiding subsidies on product prices. Thus, the use of
IDA funds for these subsidies isjustified by the catalytic longer-termeffects on sustained development of
this market niche, as well as by the direct impact onthe enterprises as aresult ofthe interventions.

(c)      Cost sharinglmatchinggrant: A few o fthe components have a cost-sharing (matching grant)
approach. Based on the many years o f lessons from matching grant schemes inAfrica and elsewhere, the
demand-driven approach will be designed with attention to achieving a suitable balance between
incentives for potential demand to come forward and sufficient co-payment to ensure adequate
willingness to pay when assistance is removed. While these matchinggrants will go to private entities
(for-profit as well as non-profit organizations), the products developed andthe demonstration effects o f
success constitute public goods that are expected to facilitate subsequent further adoption, expansion and
innovation by other institutions.

(d)      Privatesector service deliveryand sustainability: The project places a heavy reliance on
private sector delivery channels inorder to promote responsiveness to enterprise demand and commercial
sustainability. An evaluation o fthe previous World Bank Micro and Small EnterpriseTraining and
Technology project (MSETTP) found evidence of good prospects for sustainability o f the private BDS
market for MSMEs on boththe demand and supply sides. However, the evaluation notedthat
sustainability could have been improvedthrough better targeting and cost-sharing by users who were
likely to continue purchasingthe services on their own. The project draws onthese lessonsby targeting
growth-oriented value chains with effective coordinating mechanisms, where continued demand and
willingness to pay are likely.

(e)      Privateprocurement: One o fthe lessonsfrom the recently closedMSETTPproject was the
needfor procurement arrangements that do not involve the Government for matchinggranthowher type
instruments. Inthe case o fMSETTP, the dependence on Tender Boardapprovals and annual Ministerial
budgets caused major delays and inflexibility. Project managers should have signatory rightson project
accounts, subject to normal oversight procedures. The proposed project addressesthis major
implementation lessonby usinga private management contractor (with financial management and
procurement responsibilities) to have sole signatory rights.



  Referenceto World Bank Group, "Program FrameworkDocumentfor Joint IDNIFC MSMEProgramfor Africa," for the
discussionofthe Bank's history of lendingto MSMEs andof associatedchronic difficulties.

(0       Industry and value-chain focus: The proposedprojectdesign for the integratedvalue-chain
basedmatching grant fundovercomes some of the approaches previously taken by adoptingan integrated
value chain approach, which enables assistanceto be targeted on solving key bottlenecksthat inhibitthe
competitiveness and growth o f strategic high-potential sectors. Specifically, the matching grant would be
made available only when key players and their representativeorganizationsalong a supply chain are able
to develop a consensus to work together, andto form an alliance that responds to the needs of an entire
supply chain. Experiencewith matchinggrants inother countries shows that well-designedincentives
can promote behavior change and sustainablemarket development.

(g)      BusinessEnvironment: The designofthe business environment component is basedon the
lessons learnedfrom the previous experienceinKenya, particularly, from the DFIDfinancedproject,
which introducedthe single business permit at the local level. It is also basedonthe preliminary findings
of the recent FIASAdministrative Barrierreport, the InvestmentClimate Assessment andanalytical work
of other donors. The approachused inthe project design has also beenproven innumber of developing
countries.

(h)      Specialized financialproducts:There is a growing body of experienceinproviding small
businessloans profitably -either through microfinance institutions enteringthe marketor through
commercial bank downscaling. These experiencesare drawn predominantly from experience inLatin
America and EasternEurope. The critical factors underlyingthese success stories are often less to do
with the injection of new liquidity and more to do with the application of new technology, the
introduction of new corporate incentives, the developmentof new staff skill sets andthe provision of
institutional support to staff responsiblefor MSMElending portfolios. This proposedproject will pay
particular attentionto these capacity building considerations.

(i)      Managementeducation: The 2003 survey ofmanagementeducationinAfrica highlights the
need for case studies that relateto the local economic environment, resources to support faculty
development, development of stronger linkagesbetweenbusiness schools and local business
communities, and partnershipsbetweenlocal andregional institutions to enhance information flow andto
sharingof best practices. Consultationswere heldwith Kenyan business schools and Global Business
School faculty and administrators to designthe project to yield maximum benefits inacost-effective
manner. The project also takes into account lessons learnedfrom previousbilateralprograms and
partnerships inbusinesseducation.

5. Alternatives consideredand reasons for rejection
The growth objectivesarticulated inthe ERScritically dependon a reanimatedprivate sector. Thus, the
World Bank Group supportto the Government to help achieve this objective has been designedthrough a
series of carefully sequenced activities.

Early considerationwas givento incorporatethese MSMEpilot activities under a larger Privatization and
Private Sector CompetitivenessProject which would comprise a more integratedprogram of policy and
institutional reform. However, such a programwould require longer preparatorytime, especially as the
focus onthe privatization agenda is complex andrequiresthat certain preconditionsbe met. Furthermore,
a substantialamount of analytical work has already been undertakenthat can form a basisfor the design
of specific interventionsto achieve relatively quick results. Inview of the World Bank Group's interest in
demonstratingearly results through support to the private sector reform agenda ofthe new Government,
the priority placedonmicro, small, andmediumenterprises inthe Economic RecoveryStrategy, andthe
additional policy dialoguenecessary ina larger, more complex program, it was decidedthat the MSME
project be preparedquickly as a first step. The future Privatization and Private Sector Competitiveness




                                                     11

Project (FY05-FY06) will seek to facilitate the privatization process, while promoting private sector
development more broadly.

Duringthe project concept review, a Sectorwide Approach(SWAP) was suggestedas an instrumentfor
consideration. The SWAP approach was not pursuedas an alternative due to two major concerns -(a) the
private sector delivery approach of thejoint IDA/IFC initiative and o fthis MSMEproject; and (b) the
absence o f the necessary conditions for the SWAPtype of instrumentto be effective. The Government
recently commissioned a report, Coordination of Government,Donor, and Civil Society Interventions in
the MSE Sector in Kenya, which discussesthe conditions requiredfor a SWAP to be successful. The
main pre-conditions include: (1) political commitment and ownership of the program; (2) issues o f
corruption, accountability, and bureaucratic redtape; and (3) coherent and realistic policy direction
regarding the MSEsector.13 The new Government is working towards these goals, but will needtime to
achieve them. The SWAPcouldbe considered duringthe mid-termreview.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
 1. Partnershiparrangements
One o fthe project's core differences with that o ftraditional World Bank projects is the partnership with
IFC. The project was designednot only to leverage IFC investments and financial partners, it was also
prepared with a uniquecombination o f Bank and IFC expertise.

The project is also collaborating closely with other donors; most notably with DFID on the "Financial
Deepening" subcomponent, which will use the same implementation structure for co-financing purposes.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements
 The ERScalls for redefiningthe role o fthe state as a facilitator for private sector growth and investment.
 The strategy entails strengtheningthe policy and regulatory functions of the state and transferring
 productive and service delivery activities to the private sector. The project implementation arrangements
 will adhere to this strategy, as well as builduponthe lessonso fproject implementation from other similar
 private sector development projects throughout Sub-SaharanAfrica and other regions. The overriding
 principle guidingthe institutional and implementation arrangements is the Government's delegation o f
 maximum feasible operational responsibility to the private sector inmanaging implementation. The
 Government's role will focus on facilitation, consultation, policy-making, and evaluation. Details of
 project implementation arrangements are given inAnnex 6.

 The project will be overseen by a Steering Committee consistingo f approximately six to nine members,
 half o f which will be from the private sector, with core Ministries represented at the Director level. Itwill
be supported onthe Government side by a small Project Secretariat withinthe Ministryo fTrade and
 Industry(MOTI) that will provide policy advice and be responsible for evaluationo fproject progress and
provide information to the Steering Committee. Project management will be delegated to a private
Project Management Contractor (PMC), responsible for annual work programming, financial
management, procurement, public relations, monitoring, and reporting. A number o f subcomponents will
be contracted out to technical partners. The PMC will provide quantitative oversight o f contracts for
 implementingsubcomponents (e.g., procurementprocess, progress toward specifiedtargets, financial
accounting), while the Project Secretariat will focus on qualitative aspects regarding achievement o f
results consistent with project objectives. The PMC and Project Secretariat will have shared responsibility
on public relations. (See figure 1.)

0 A Public-Private SteeringCommittee,chairedby the PermanentSecretary (PS) ofMOTI, will be an
  inter-ministerial committee with relevantMinistries as well as private sector representation.
  Responsibilities include:
  >
  >>  provide strategic guidanceand oversight for the project;
       approve annualworkplan and budget; and
      review quarterly progressreportsandaddress any major problems affecting project
       implementation;
  The SteeringCommittee will establishaTechnicalTask Forceto provide guidanceonthe Business
  Environment andLabor Skills components -especially since it will be critical to involve additional
  ministries to provide guidance, monitor the component implementation process, review and approve
  reports, and advisethe SteeringCommittee on issues relatedto the policy and legislation changes.

e A Project Secretariat inMOTIwill serve as asecretariatto the SteeringCommittee interms of
  reviewing and analyzing reports from the PMC on behalf ofthe SteeringCommittee, providing
  guidance as requestedon project issues, and filtering policy issues that arise from the project for the
  SteeringCommittee to address. Itwill communicatepolicy guidanceto the PMC andtechnical
  partners. It will also assist inthe coordinationwith other donor programs inareas addressedby the
  project and will review regular progressreports submittedby the PMC.

  The Project Management Contractor (PMC), competitively selected, will be primarily responsiblefor
  the financial managementandprocurementaspects ofthe Project andensure thatthe Project is
   implementedinaccordance with the DevelopmentCredit Agreement andthe ProjectImplementation
  Plan/Manual. The PMC will be a private firm to be recruitedthrough competitive process inline with
  IDA'SProcurementGuidelines: Selectionand Employment of Consultants. Contracting at the
   subcomponent level will be carriedout by the PMC inaccordancewith the operationalguidelines set
   out inthe Implementation Manual. Itwill retain sole signatory rights andmanage the project account.
  The selectionandhiringofthe PMC will be acondition of credit effectiveness.

For the interimperiod- inorder to allow for more immediatestart-upof project effectiveness/activities -
the Project Secretariatwill perform the PMC functions, untilthe PMC is recruited and established. The
Project Secretariatwill contract a short term procurementconsultant to assist them during this interim
period.

Contracts with the PMC andtechnical implementing agents for subcomponentswill be signedby the PS
of MOTIon behalf ofthe Government; however, this does not apply to minor subcontractingby these
agents for specific aspects of implementation. The specific subcomponentsthat will be contractedto
technical partnersinclude:

   0 The Financial Sector Deepeningsubcomponent will be contractedto aprivate technical manager
     who will send out a call for proposals, screen and select potential recipientsbasedon agreed
     eligibility criteria, provide guidance on technical assistance partners, andmonitor performanceto
     ensure performance milestones are being met. A proceduresmanualwill guide the day to day
     operations. The Project will use the same implementation arrangementsthat are being established
     for donor pooling (initiated by DFID)to maximize donor coordination. However IDA funds will
     not be usedto pay for the operationof this technical contractor.

   0 The SME RiskCapital Fundsubcomponentwill follow eligibility criteria for selection. The
     beneficiarieswill respondto a call for Expressionsof Interest and will have to meet pre-established
     eligibility criteria.

   0  The technical andadvisory work for the IndustrialTraining Levy subcomponent will becontracted
      to a competitively selectedprivate consulting firm. The Skills DevelopmentTask Force will
      oversee the implementation of the component. The task force composition is expected to include
      Directorate o f IndustrialTraining, Ministryof Trade and Industry, and Ministry of Education.

   0  The GBSNsubcomponent will be contracted'to the GBSNCetlter, while the Business Plan
      Competition will be contracted to a competitively selected consortium o f institutions.

   0  The technical andadvisory work for the Business Environmentcomponent will becontracted to a
      competitively selected private consulting firm. The Business Environment Task Force will oversee
      the implementation ofthe component. The task force composition is expected to include
      representatives of the Kenya Revenue Authority, Ministryo f Local Government, MOTI, Ministry of
      Labor, and Office of the Attorney General.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results
Despite extensive enterprise support programs over the past three decades, there has been inadequate
attention to the development and application o f results-oriented impact measurementtools inthe field.
Donors involved inmicrofinance assistancehave developed good quantitative and qualitative indicators
o f outreach, sustainability, and poverty impact. However, the monitoringand impact measurement
framework for MSMEassistance is less well developed, especially for BDS and the business
environment. The lessons learned from microfinance impact assessment from donors active inthis area,
such as USAID's Assessing the Impact o f Microenterprise Services (AIMS) program and the Ford
Foundation's Imp-Act program, have been leveraged indesigningthe M&E system for this project.

Annex 3 provides a detailed planfor monitoring and evaluatingthe project's outcomes and results. To
evaluate project outcomes, firm-level data will be collected from participatingMSMEs. There is a plan
for the 1999MSEBaseline Survey to be updated in2004 and will provide valuable baseline information.
Firm-leveldata on project outcomes will be collected again after two years and after five years to assess
the project's effectiveness inreachingthe project development objective. The PMC will be expectedto
contract an outside evaluation expert to collect and analyze the project outcome data.

Data for the project's results indicators will be drawn from several sources, including financial
intermediaries, supply chain experts, participatingbusiness schools, and national level business
environment assessments. Each data source corresponds to a specific project component. For results
indicators under component three, for example, information from the Doing Business database and
Investment Climate Assessments (ICAs) will be usedto the extent feasible to provide both baseline and
follow-up data on changes inthe business environment.

As specified inAnnex 3, the M&Edata will either be provided by project partners or will be collected by
expert consultants who are contracted by the PMC. Outside experts will beneededbothto supplement
the evaluationcapacity andto avoid conflicts of interestinmonitoring and evaluatingproject outcomes
and results. The arrangements for results monitoring includes mid-project evaluations, which can be used
to by managers and policy-makers to assess project effectiveness duringimplementation, as well as end-
of-project evaluation, which can be usedto evaluate the effectiveness of the project after it is completed.

4. Sustainability
This project supports the ERSframework for micro, small, and medium enterprise development. Thus a
highdegree of stakeholder commitment is expected inthe implementationofproject activities. This is
particularly important inthe area of business environment, inthat a participatory process must be
established to ensure continuedconsultationand pressurefrom the private sector on Government
authorities to implementand maintainthe expected reforms.

5. Critical risks and possible controversialaspects
The major risksfacing the MSMEsector could include:
    Government coordination: Overlapping roles between ministriesmay weigh onthe success, not only
    for the proposed project, but also for national policies and other donor efforts inthis sector. The
   Department o f MSEDevelopment is currently housedwithin the Ministry o f Labor and Human
    Resource Development (MLHRD),and has beenthe focal point of the MSE SessionalPaper.
    However, the Ministryo f Trade & Industryplays the major role inPrivate Sector Development. The
    fragmented structure withintwo government bodies does not allow for effective integration of
    policies and institutions between the various stratawithin the MSMEsector. This issue i s being
    discussedaddressed within the Government and among donors.
    Private-public partnership: The Government has recently demonstrated a commitment to
    partnership/consultationswith the private sector through the newly formed KenyaPrivate Sector
    Alliance (KEPSA). KEPSA was actively involved inthe preparationo f the Economic Recovery
    Strategy and the Investment Program. However, as it is still inits infancy, attentionmust be givento
    ensure that the dialogue remains effective and grounded to enterprise needs. The proposed project
    implementation arrangement has integrated a public-private Steering Committee.
    Government role inthe financial sector: The World Bank's on-going dialogue with the Government
    as part o f the recently completed,Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), as well as the
    upcoming Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) and Finance and Legal Sector Technical
    Assistance Credit (FSLTAC) aims to reduce the level o f direct Government interventioninthe
    financial sector and a divestment o f the Government's stake in state-owned commercial banks with
    the ultimate objective ofstrengtheningcompetition. The accessto finance component is consistent
    with this overarchingobjective o futilizingprivate sector resourcesto secure sustainable accessto
    finance to the MSMEsector. It is critical that the government distinguishbetween IDA funds used
    for capacity buildingand incentives to leverage private market development versus the existinguse of
    government funds through development finance corporations (DFCs) and state-owned banks.
    Donor coordination: Ineffective donor coordination could be damaging given scarce donor resources
    and potentially overlapping efforts. Inthis context, donor coordination and support to send a singular
    message to the government and to push for an integrated solution is considered a critical factor for the
    success o f the proposed project. Efforts to date have been extremelypromising, with a well-
    functioning and active PSD donor coordination group.
    Ownership of the training levy: the restructuring o f the levy requires consensus amongst various
    Ministries,betweenthe Government and private sector, within the private sector institutions
    (Federation o f Kenyan Employers, Kenyan Association o f Manufactures andKenyaPrivate Sector
    Alliance) and labor organizations on the role o fthe NITC and DIT, the governance and management
    of the levy and a firm commitment from the Government for an expanded role for the private sector.

    The implementationphase of the Business Environmentcomponent, particularly the UnifiedTax is
    contingent on Parliamentary approval.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economicand financialanalyses

The Net Present Value (NPV), the relevant decisioncriteria for this type of project, is calculated usinga
simple model. Inthe base case scenario, the project generates aNPV estimated at US$19.8 million. The
project is expected to contribute to directjob creation driven by increased production. However, it is
important to note thatjob creationcould be hinderedby the relatively low capacity utilization rate of 63
percent, the relatively highlabor costs and low level o f demand. That said, duringthe lifetimeo f the
project, a part from improving the enablingenvironment for MSME development, a minimumof 2750
jobs are expected to be created. All the sensitivity and scenario analyses conducted yield positive NPVs
which confirm the project robustness.

The project is expected to generatefiscal revenues for the Government. Indeed, for the 12-year forecast
time frame (including the 5-year project implementationperiod), the project would generate US$13.5
million as the result o f incremental personal and corporate income taxes. This amount does not capture
the potentialfiscal impact from the increasednumber ofregistered MSMEsandthe reducedtax evasion
which are difficult to reasonably estimate ex-ante. The detailed results are presented inannex 9.

2. Technical
The project will seek to ensurethat appropriate technical standards are achieved inthree ways: (i)
partnering with practitioners andtechnical experts with proven track records; (ii) focusing on commercial,
market-driven provision o fservices that will limit grant dependency among beneficiaries and promote a
demand responsiveness among service providers; (iii)    developing specialized financial services for the
MSMEmarket andtargeting BDSto addressspecific industry needsthat will increasequality, market
relevance and uptake o f services. The public sector role would be to: (i) revise public policies and
regulations that produce hightransaction costs and thus create a competitive disadvantage for MSMEs,
and (ii) review government-sponsored programs to ensure efficiency and avoid crowding out ofprivate
initiatives. This approach represents a fundamental shift inthe role o f the government, away from direct
provision o f services andtowards facilitating the development o f private markets and networks.

3. Fiduciary
Although the Project does not currently satisfy minimumIDA financial management requirements, the
Project's financial management function will be carried out by a private Project Management Contractor
(PMC), the procurement o f which is a condition of credit effectiveness (Paragraph C6). Completion o f an



                                                      16

assessment ofthe project's financial management capacity and orientationof the PMC on IDA accounting
and reportingrequirementswill be carriedout once the PMC is inplace, prior to credit effectiveness.

4. Social
There are no social issues triggeredby this project. A number of project components are expectedto lead
to favorable social outcomes, including employment generationandpoverty reduction.

Key stakeholdersfrom both the public andprivate sector have beenconsultedthroughout project design,
including several focus groups to refine project design.

Kenya has traditionally hadavibrant private sector which enableditto create, by the end ofthe 1980s, a
strong and fairly diversified economy with a largemanufacturingsector and dynamic tourist market. In
addition, Kenya's strongfinancial sector built its position as the regional financial center andboastedthe
second largeststock market inthe continent.

The decade of the 1990s, however, witnessed a sharpdeteriorationinthe investment climate,
accompaniedby a decline inquality of physical infrastructureand institutions supportingthe market.
Together, with uncertainties over the Government's commitmentto economic reform, the impact on
business confidence was significant. Kenya's competitivenessandparticipation inthe world economy
suffered andthe country witnesseda sharp deterioration inincome and living standards, with poverty
rates rising from 48 percent in 1990to 55 percent in2001.

Kenya has anestimatedpopulation of 31million with an annualpopulation growth rate of 2.1 percentand
an annualemploymentgrowth rate of 1.8 percent. The average life expectancy is 46 years for males and
47 years for females. Between 1986and 1996, the average growth rate inthe total available labor force
was over 4 percent per year. Yet, employment only increasedbetween2 and 2.5 percentannually from
1986to 1995. As a result, morethantwo million Kenyanswere unemployed. Among those countedas
employed, a significant proportion was underemployed, particularly those working insmall scale
agriculture andthe informal sector. Average unemployment is currently estimatedat 23 percent.

While facing slow employment growth inthe formal manufacturingsector (2 percent ayear during the
1990s), the micro and small enterprise sector became the second largest (after small scale agriculture) and
fastest-growing source of employment. In 1999, the national MSEbaselinesurvey counted 1.3 million
MSEsemploying 2.4 millionworkers, and consistingover 20 percent ofemploymentand 18percentof
GDP. This survey also showedthat the majority ofKenyan MSEs are inthe trade, services, and
manufacturingsub-sectorsand that an overwhelming percentagehave less than five employees(table
below).

Looking Ahead: The year 2003 markedapoint of change inKenya. After aconfident beginning by the
new NARC government, there have beenhigh expectationsfor private-sector ledgrowth. Moreover, the
private sector itself has beenable to demonstratesuccess insome key sectors ofthe economy. Bothtea
andhorticulture products(including cut-flowers) reinforcedtheir position inworld markets during the
1990s, despite declining world prices insome marketsand a highly competitive environment. With the
market-openingopportunities provided by the African Growth and OpportunitiesAct (AGOA), the
garments sector experiencedspectaculargrowth, increasingexports from a mere US$l0 million in 1999
to aroundUS$220 million in2003, accompaniedby an increase inemployment inthe sector from 6,000
to over 40,000 workers. The challengeahead is to sustainthe growth inthese promising sectors, while
catalyzing the effective integrationof micro, small, andmedium enterprisesector inhigher value-added
activities.

NigeriaMicro, Small, and MediumEnterpriseProject(joint IDNIFC): The MSMEproject in
Nigeria was the first project to be approved by the Boardunder thisjoint IDA/IFC Programfor MSME
Development inAfrica. The project inNigeria aims to increasethe performance and employment levels
o f MSMEs inselected non-oil industrysubsectors and inthree targeted states o f the country. To achieve
this objective, the Project will: (i)
                                    develop and strengthenthe capacity o f local intermediaries to deliver
financial and non-financial services to MSMEs; (ii)   reduce selected investment climate barriers that
constrain MSMEperformance; and (iii)     mobilize increasedprivate investments inMSMEsand
intermediaries. The project was approved by the Board (Report 27213-UNI) inDecember 2003.

World BankKenya-PrivateSector Development: The Africa RegionPrivate Sector Development
Department i s carrying out economic and sector work to deepenthe understanding o fthe sources and key
obstacles to growth and much o f this analysis has informedthe preparationo f this project. The
Investment Climate Assessment, recently completed, provides a greater understanding ofthe factors that
determine investment and business activity inKenya. The administrative barriers study being conducted
bythe Bank Group's ForeignInvestmentAdvisory Service sheds lightonthe administrative and
regulatory costs of doing business inKenya. The analysis will identifymeasures neededto strengthen the
competitiveness of the private sector, including actions to increase efficiencies inthe supply chain, to
upgrade skills, and to reduce administrative and other impedimentsto private sector investment. The
upcoming Privatization and Private Sector Competitiveness Project (FY05-06) will seek to facilitate the
privatization process, while promoting private sector development. The project will strengthen the key
institutions responsible for implementation o fthe privatization program, support training on regulatory
and other issues, assist the preparationo f corporate restructuringplans, and strengthen the capacity and
design o fregulatorybodies.

World BankKenya FinancialSector Development: The Bank's Financial Sector Development
                       -
program combines diagnostic work and financial assistanceto implement reforms and to build
institutional capacity. The Bankjointly with the IMFrecently completeda comprehensive assessment of
the sector under the Financial Sector Assessment Program(FSAP). Basedon the Bank's ongoing
dialogue with the Kenyan authorities andthe findings o f the FSAPthe Bank i s designing two financial
sector operations. The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC, FY05) supports policy and
institutional reforms, including divestitureof the state's remainingownership stakes inthe banks,
enhanced banking supervision, and design o f a policy to improve access to financial services. The
Financial and Legal Sector Technical Assistance Credit (FLSTAC, FY05) will support the buildingof
capacity inthe financial sector as well as inlegal/judicial sector, thereby facilitating the implementation
of financial sector reforms.

World BankKenya-RuralDevelopment: The KenyaAgricultural Productivity Project (KAPP)
supports new channels for technology generation and dissemination to farmers. These new channels
could entail the outsourcing o f agricultural extension services to the private sector. Hence, they may
benefit directly from the development o f private sector advisory services which are either commodity or
industryspecific, also one ofthe key objectives ofthe proposedMSMEproject. With respect to policy
development, a strong synergy exists between the proposed MSMEand the KenyaAgricultural
Productivity Project. The MSMEproject supports reforms on the demand side o f agricultural markets, by
adaptingthe marketindregulatory environment to increased private sector participation and to increased
marketing innovationand experimentation. This support neatly complements the Rural Development
Department's ongoing institutional reform dialogue with Government which operates primarily on the

supply side ofthese same markets. The combinedeffects of demandand supply side influences can be
quite significant on key sub-sectors suchas coffee or pyrethrumwhich are stultified by government direct
intervention, indirect control and strict regulation. Inaddition, the analytic work which was undertaken
during project preparationwill help to convincepolicy makersthat tangible growth and substantial
development benefits canresult from a combinationof marketderegulationandprivate sector outreach.

IFCKenya: IFC investmentactivity hadlaggedinrecentyears with lack ofprogressonkey issues inthe
investmentclimate. IFC is fully engagedwith Kenyan private sector and workingjointly with the Bank
on addressingsome ofthese longstandingissues inthe investment climate andsupportingnew private
investment, particularly inprivate provision of infrastructure.IFC's committed portfolio inKenya is now
US$125 million, having increasedwith new projects inthe past year from about US$90million two years
ago. It remains one of IFC's largest countryportfolios inAfrica.

Ininfrastructure, IFC has investedinthe first project-financedIPP, Tsavo Power, and aprivate bulk grain
terminal in Mombasa. IFC has been working with the Government to improve the framework for
attracting private investment, both informally and formally through an advisory mandate on the
privatization of Kenya Railways. In May 2004 IFC co-sponsored an Africa regional conference held in
Kenya focusing on infrastructureinvestment. IFC's manufacturing andtourism portfolios are significant,
with a new investment in FY 04 in Magadi Soda Company, IFC's largest industrial client. IFC also has
current andplannedinvestmentswith Mabati Steel, the largestregional steel productsproducer, and inthe
tourism industry with Tourism Promotion Services, a network of hotels, and several smaller individual
projects.

InSMEfinance, IFC was one ofthe founding investorsinK-RepBank,the first commercial
microfinance bank inKenya. More recently, IFC supportedEquity Building Society-which provides
financial servicesto the low income population-with equity via the Africap Fund and a soft loan from
GEF. K-REP and IFC are structuring a linkageproject with the leadingCocaColabottler, an IFC client,
to establisha financing andtechnical assistance facility for the company's network of SMEdistributors
andretailers. InSMEcapacitybuilding andtechnicalassistance, Africa ProjectDevelopmentFacility
(APDF) andthe SME Departmenthave implementeda large programworking with firms inagribusiness,
manufacturing, andtourism. IFC/APDF are working on the expansionof credit reporting services, and
with other aspects of providing information and capacity buildingto providers of finance to SMEs.


DFIDKenya: The purpose of DFID'sPSDprogramisto generate sustainable increasesinincomeand
employmentthroughthe growth anddevelopmentof the private sector inKenya, throughthe following
three areas of focus: (a) Improved enablingenvironmentfor businesses throughadvocacy and policy
dialogue, capacitybuildingwithin GOK departments andcommercialjustice sector reforms; (b) Improved
capacity ofKenya's financial sector to meet the needs of poor rural andurbanhouseholds, micro, small
and mediumenterprise on a sustainable basis; and (c) Improvedbusinessservices marketto stimulate
business transactionsinvolving poorer households inKenya. These objectives are achievedthrough a series
of strategically focused interventionsthat will pro-actively try to leveragemarket-basedsolutions to key
business constraints at the micro- or sectoral-level.The support aims to facilitate private sector actorsto
respondto specific constraints as service opportunities.

USAIDKenya: The USAID's Microenterprise programhasthree components: policy, microfinance and
business development services. The project involves strengtheningthe capacity of relevantGovernment
departmentsresponsiblefor policy implementation; developing a system for policy monitoring and
evaluation; and strengtheningMSEassociationsand lobby groupsto makethem more effective in
dialogue with policy makers. The microfinance component strengthens the institutional capacity of
microfinance institutions to become sustainable andexpandoutreach, and supports themto develop new

savings and loan productsthat are suitable for rural-basedenterprises. The BDS component increases
outreachand sustainability of BDS activities by removing the constraintsthat inhibit commercial
transactionsof private sector-based business services inthe market.

Inaddition, the KenyaBDSproject is a five year MSEdevelopmentprogramto increaseaccessto
commercial BDSamongrural MSEswithin subsectors of high growth potential. Specifically, the
program has selected three subsectors of high growth potential for MSEs andhas identified market
inefficiencies along the supply chain. Centralto the project is the Market Intervention Fundthat finances
a combination of supply- and demand-side interventions, as well as information disseminationtechniques
to stimulate commercial transactions.

Agence Francaisede Developpement(AFD) Kenya:AFD has two projects which address the financing
needs of MFIs and SACCOs. For the top-tier MFIs, AFD is providing a partial guarantee for MFIs
issuing bonds on the Nairobi Stock Exchange.AFD's AAA rating allows the participating MFIto lower
its cost of borrowing in local currency. So far, AFD has beenworking with one MFI, FauluKenya, for a
2004 bond issue. The project was approvedby their boardin late December2003. For the secondand
third-tier MFIs, as well as for the SACCOs, AFD is currently designingaproject (at appraisalstage) with
an objective to develop bankingrelationshipsbetweenregulatedwholesalers andMFIs/SACCOs. Inthis
upcomingproject, AFD would lendto GoK, who would on-lendto wholesalers (for the first tranche, K-
Rep, EBSand Coop Bank were selected), who would inturnlendto MFIs. The aim is to provide
resources and expertiseto develop a market-basedrelationshipbetweenwholesalers andMFIsthat will
enhance, but not distort, the existing market. Inaddition, a capacity building componentwill complement
the credit line, targetingthe wholesalers (to developtheir ability to assess MFIs), the MFIsand SACCOs
(to develop governanceandcredit worthiness), and possibly to the Ministry of Finance(for policy making
inmicrofinance).

EUKenya:After the first ECMicro and SmallEnterprise Supportproject(MESP) expired inDecember
2002, an independentKenyanMESP Trust was establishedunder Kenyan Law to provide micro-credit,
and startedto do so at the beginning of 2004. A second EUSupport project to micro and small

years, with anenvelope of 6.5 Million e. After a broadconsultationwith stakeholders,a feasibility study
enterprises is currently being designed.The project is expectedto start in2005 andwill runfor three

and a financing proposalhas beendrafted. The project, still a draft, proposes to concentrate ontwo
elements. The first component would focus on assistanceto micro-finance, with development ofnew
service models andnew financial products (the project will not include direct credit). The second
componentwould target non-financial services (development of BDS, strengtheningofthe sector to make
it morecommercially-oriented,strengtheningof MSErepresentation(reinforce associations, increase
information flows, etc.)

COMPONENTONE-ACCESS               TO FINANCE
SubcomponentA -Financial Sector Deeueninz
Issues: The Kenyan MSMEcredit market consists o f a large variety o f institutions providing micro and
SME financial services, ranginginsize from those serving25 clients (village self-help groups) to 85,000
(the largest SACCO). As of December 2002, providers o f finance to the Kenyan MSMEsector included:

    0    Four commercial banks15offering a full range o f banking services
         Two Building societies offering savings loans and money transfer services
         2,668 SACCOs offering savings loans and money transfer services
    0    TenNGO MFIsoffering loans only16
         67 Community Self-help organizations offering savings and loan facilities
    0    Three DFIs offering loans only.
Ofthe above providers of finance only the commercial banks and buildingsocieties are supervised by the
Central Bank o f Kenya and are subject to prudential regulations. While the banking sector inKenya i s
large and fairly active, banks have traditionally avoided lendingto the MSMEsector due to relatively
highcosts per transaction, difficulties assessingand managingrisk, and giventhe inability ofmost MSEs
to provide the requiredfinancial documentation and collateral. This problemhas beenfurther
exacerbated by the `crowding out' effect ofthe Kenyan Government debt, which effectively provided
risk-free highreturns for banks. Although the recent dramatic change inthis situation, with yields of
Government debt currently at record low levels and liquidity very highinthe banking sector has greatly
increasedthe interest of commercial banks inlendingto MFIsand MSMEs, inroads have been limitedby
market constraints and imperfections, as well as weak ability o f MSMEsto meet collateral and financial
documentationrequirements.

Commercial banking methodology includes heavy reliance on collateral. This in itself is a huge barrier
for MSMEsas they have little or no tangible assets that can serve as acceptable collateral for the banks.
The exception is a few large MFIswho holdmembers savings (which they are notpermittedto
intermediate) and can offer these deposits as collateral. The absence of an effective credit reporting
mechanismand the lack of information sharing betweeninstitutions is a sufficient deterrent to non-
collateral based lending.

The Kenyanmicrofinance sector is also characterized by the highdegree of segmentation andthe lack of
linkages among different types o f finance providers. Providers o f microfinance operate indefinedniches
which the individual institution has identified as best suitedto its lendingmethodology, mission and
values. The lack o f a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework and a lack o f information sharing
contributes to the segmentation. This highdegree o f segmentation affects the provision o f financial
services to the MSMEsector adversely as it (i)    prohibits the flow of funds and often times makes it more
expensive; (ii)limits the ability o f the borrower to graduate and transform into a larger enterprise; and
(iii)resultsingapsinaccesstofinan~e'~.

Another significant feature of the Kenyan microfinance sector i s the important role o fthe SACCOs,
particularly the 113 rural SACCOs which are the main source of finance inthe rural areas. SACCOs hold
an estimated Ksh70 billion in assets and have over 1.7 million members. The SACCOs are covered by
two umbrella organizations Kenya Rural Savings and Credit Societies Union (KERUSSO) and Kenya
Union o f Savings and Credit Cooperatives (KUSSCO), but are also affected by segmentation and lack o f
information sharing as the umbrella organizations provide little inthe way o f capacity building. Some of
the large SACCOs are bigger than some of the banks (inassets and loans) and many SACCOs operate
effectively as banks but are not supervisedby any regulatory body. There are serious concerns about the
financial viability o f many o fthe SACCOs as they are plagued with problems caused by poor governance,
lack o f qualified staff and lack o f standardized accounting systems.

Despite the variety of financial intermediaries, access to finance remains an issue for MSMEs. According
to the 1999National Micro and Small Enterprise(MSE)Baseline Survey, 90 percent o f the 1.3 million
MSEshave never receivedcredit and only 5.7 percent received such credit from a formal source
(including NGOS).'~Although the total proportion o f those with credit from any source is about the same
as found inearlier baseline surveys, the proportionreceiving credit from formal sources is slightly higher
in 1999relativeto 1995. Among all firms surveyedfor the ICA, cost offinance was ratedas the second
highestobstacle (after corruption), while small firms specifically rate cost o ffinance as the highest
obstacle. Small firms also mention access to finance ingeneral as a larger obstacle relative to other
groups of firms. Micro enterprises are almost twice less likely to have overdrafts and almost four times
less likely to have loans relative to large enterprises. Interestingly,micro and small enterprises are almost
halfas likely to apply for a loan. Despite their higher demandfor loans, they do not apply becausethey
expect to be rejected and therefore choose not to incur the costs o f applying.

Activities:
This subcomponent will use performance basedmatching grants to leverage private funds and offset up-
front development costs inorder to maximize market development effects and minimize price distortions.
The focus will be on:    .

     0    Initialcosts o f developing new products;
     0    Incentives (e.g., to meet risk and security requirements) and start-up costs (e.g., training) for
          commercial banks moving downmarket;
     0    Capacity-building for MFIs to move toward financial self-sufficiency and transformation to
          licensed status, as well as to develop individual loan (and other) products;
While these subsidies will go to private entities (for-profit as well as non-profit organizations), the
products developed and the demonstration effects o f success inMSMEfinance constitute public goods
that are expected to facilitate subsequent further adoption, expansion and innovation by other institutions,
as well as those that qualify for the assistance on the basis of transparent, results-oriented criteria. The
focus is on technical assistance and capacity-building, rather than direct provision o f credit, inorder to
better leverage liquidity inthe banking system, household savings that MFIs can mobilize, and potential
investment infinancial institutions serving the MSMEmarket. The risks o f possible market-distorting
effects are minimized by (i)    focusing on segments where the market is very thin or non-existent; and (ii)
targeting development costs and avoiding subsidies on product prices. Thus, the use of IDA funds for
these subsidies isjustified by the catalytic longer-term effects on sustained development o f this market
niche, as well as by the direct impact on the enterprises that receive financing as a result o fthe
interventions.

The technical assistancewill be providedwith performance basedgrants which will be made available to
institutions satisfying the eligibility and performance criteria. The project will also benefitfrom the
creation of a credit reference bureau or other information sharing mechanism and improvements in
leasing law both o f which are beingpromotedby IDA'SFLSTAC project, which is inpreparation.

The eligible activities through this subcomponent are, among others:
a. MFIStrengthening, Outreachand Moving Upmarket:Capacity-building o fMFIsbasedon sound
financial performance and potential for greater outreach to rural areas andthe poor will be focused on
three key areas that are important for increasedaccess by MSMEs:addition of individual lending
products in selected MFIs orientedtoward group methodologies; greater outreach inrural and provincial
areas; and commercialization o f high-performing SACCOs and MFIs. Assistance under this
subcomponent will be aimed at improvingthe absorptive capacity which currently impedes the ability of
apex MFIs and other financial institutions interested inwholesale lendingto the MSMEsector.
         Product Development: The approach is to support the transformation o fexistingMFIs active in
         the MSME sector to move from primarily group lendingmethodology to the adoptionof
         individual lendingprocessesand systems that are more suitedto successfully growing
         microenterprises. Technical assistancewould be provided inthe form of management and
         operational staff training, preparation o f manuals, credit procedures, acquisition of software, and
         implementation o f MIS.
         Regional Outreach: A large number o fMFIs and SACCOs have remainedmainly
         regional/provincial players, constrained by their reliance mainly on internally generated
         resources. This sub-activity is designedto leverage the ability o f eligible MFIsto grow rapidly
         beyondtheir traditional niche, increasecompetition and improve access to finance to the sector.
         This activity will be designedto assist existingMFIsand SACCOs, with a proventrack record,
         acceptable lendingcriteria and a highquality loan portfolio.
         Commercialization: Skills transfer andtechnical assistanceto highpotential MFIs and SACCOs
         to improve their operations, management and governance structures for greater commercial
         orientation and outreach on a sustainable basis (as well as for eventual licensing under the new
         MFIBill).
b. Commercial Finance Moving Downmarket: Support for capacity buildingand product development
would be made available to selected commercial financial institutions that are interested innew systems
and lendingmethodologiesfor the MSMEmarket segment. This would permit banks to better understand
"cash flow-based" lendingto the MSMEsector and thus encourage non-collateralizedlendingto take
place. Non-bank financial institutions would also be supported to develop products such as leasing and
discounting receivables specifically for the MSMEmarket. Selection of commercial financial institutions
will be basedonthe future sustainability o fthe institution and a corporate commitment to enter the
MSMEmarket or expand its existing MSMEportfolio.

SubcomuonentB -SME Risk Cauital Fund and TechnicalAssistance
Issues: Indeveloped countries most SMEs obtain formal financing from banks usingassets and real
property as collateral against bank loans, and early-stage SMEs may also finance start-up costs with credit
card debt or soft loans from family and friends. However, few o f these sources of debt are available to
most SMEs indeveloping countries, where SMEinvestment relies predominantly on equity from the
savings o f the owner and hisher family and reinvestedprofits. Providers o f finance to SMEs face some
important challenges inAfrican countries, including:
         Lack of collateral. Evenwhere bank lendingis available inprinciple, most SMEs are unable to
         provide sufficient and satisfactory collateral to meet commercial bank requirements (often 150




                                                       29

         percent o f loanamounts), andthe weak enforceability of property rightsfurther discourages
         banks even from collateralized lending other than to the largest concerns.
         High cost of appraisal. Unable to obtain sufficient security for collateralized lending, lenders
         mustrely on the strengthofa company's projectedcashflowto service debt. Cashflow-based
         lendingentails considerably more due diligence andtherefore is more costly than collateral-based
         lending. Thisencourages banks again to focus on only the largest borrowers, so as to amortize
        the costs of due diligence over a larger investment amount.
    0    High cost of investment. SMEs are often managedby an owner-operator who has a
         sophisticated knowledge o fthe technical and operational aspects of the business, but who often
         has limited financial management skills. Infact, limitedfinancial skills is often cited as the main
         reason for SME failure. Consequently, a third-party investor inan SME must be preparedto be
         involved incomplementingthe entrepreneur's skill set, which is expensive and usually associated
         only with equity investments.
    0    Limited upside. The majority of SMEs are lifestyle businessproviding a steady income to the
         owners, who have little interest inrapid growth or selling the company to a third-party.
         Consequently, the smaller end of the SME spectrum is rarely of interest to private equity fund
         managers, who otherwise would have the resourcesto perform the due diligence necessary and
        the ability to structure appropriate investment instruments. It is only the larger end ofthe SME
         spectrum and the few high-growth potential smaller SMEs that attract any interest from private
         equity financiers.
    0    Limited exit potential. Related to the limitedupside issue, the `lifestyle' orientation o fmany
         SMEs makes an exit to athird-party a difficult proposition, sincethe entrepreneur is unlikelyto
         agree to give up control o f the company that supports his or her lifestyle. Inmost cases, third-
         party buyers would be expected to seek a controlling position, particularly ina SME where there
         only other shareholder is the owner-operator. Moreover, most SMEs are too small to qualify for
         public offerings, which, especially inAfrica, are reserved for only the largest concerns.

Furthermore, both equity and debt financing pose problems for SMEs. Owner-managers typically are
reluctant to give up a substantial share o f ownershipto external investors for fear o f losing control of the
business they have built up through years o f hard work. The burden of debt service payments, especially
inthe many African countries with persistently highreal interest rates, can siphon offprofitsthat SMEs
badly needto reinvestfor rapid growth. While Subcomponent A will help fill some o f the SME financing
gap through increased lendingto this segment by bothMFIs and commercial banks, this is likely to be
insufficient inmeetingthe needs o f many SMEs with growth potential that can be realizedonly with a
longer-term commitment and a well-designed package o f financing complemented by technical
assistance.

Rationalefor World Bank Group Supportthrough the MSME project: Equity funds generally have
not had good success in African countries, especially with respect to SMEs, for the reasons cited above, in
particular weaknesses at the enterprise level and lack o f exit opportunities. While there is still a certain
amount o f interest among promoters of equity funds inthe potential SMEmarket, there is not inKenya
such a fund with a model that specifically addressesthe special financing needs o f SMEs or that has a
track record o f success inreaching SMEs insignificant numbers.

Activities: This subcomponent will helpcatalyze newrisk capital instruments (mix o f debt and equity)
that can leverage private investment and will be tailored to reach substantial numbers o f SMEs, including
availability o ftechnical assistance financing to overcome enterprise-level shortcomings. While private
investors will finance the corpus o fthe fund and cover the majority o fthe start-up and operating costs,
IDA funds ofUS$2.5millionwould support an associated facility to finance TA for the SME investees




                                                      30

and a share a portion of the operating costs of the fund, subject to fulfillment of eligibility and
performance requirements.

The selection o fthe fundwill be determinedonthe basis of proposals submitted inresponseto a Formal
Request for Proposals and the Risk Capital Fundwill be chosenbasedon fulfillment o f criteria including,
but not limitedto the following:
         extensive experience financing SMEs inAfrica;
         a financing model that is provento be commercially viable and sustainable;
         business model and financing instrumentsmust be easily adapted for use inKenya;
         locally basedmanagement teams managing the day-to-day business of the fund;
         target mainly the SME sector with investments of a maximum o f US$200,000;
         demonstrated absorptive capacity (financial, managerial, operational -human and systems
         resources, application o fbest practice methodology) for executingthe project;
         commitment by all private investors and the Manager to the longterm success o f the project;
         fund size o fa minimumo fUS$8 million;
         submission o f a comprehensive 10year business plan; and
         experience, success record and reputationof the major investors inthe Fundandthe Fund
         Manager.
Inaddition, this subcomponent will provide for the creation of aTechnical Assistance FundofUS$4
million for capacity building in SME investee companies of existing or other new Kenyan funds.
Currently, inKenya there are a few risk capital funds that are marginally engaged in investinginthe SME
sector. The provision of technical assistanceto such SME investees will help remove some of the
impedimentsto growth o friskcapital finance inthis sector and should encourage the growth of local
SMEriskcapital funds. Selection ofbeneficiaries will also be done onthe basis ofresponsesto
expressions of interest and eligibility criteria will include:
         experience financing SMEs inKenya;
         a financing model that is provento be commercially viable and sustainable;
         locally basedmanagement teams managingthe day-to-day business of the fund;
         target mainly the SME sector with investments o f a maximumo f US$200,000;
         demonstrated absorptive capacity (financial, managerial, operational-human and systems
         resources, application o f best practice methodology) for executingthe project;
         commitment by all private investors and the Manager to the longterm success o fthe project;
         fund size of a minimumof US$4 million;

COMPONENT TWO         -STRENGTHENINGENTERPRISE                SKILLS AND MARKET        LINKAGES
Subcomponent A -Pilot Value Chain Based Matching Grant Fund
Issues: Collaboration as well as competition are required among enterprises inorder to assure that full
growth potential is realizedwithin the MSMEsector. Thejoint use o f assets, the development of external
markets for business support services and the adoption o f trade standards and protocols among trading
partners are some ofthe ways inwhich collaboration can beginto reduce transaction costs, improve
market access and enhance competitiveness. InKenya, however, supply chains are highly segmented,
with little systematic flow of information between segments and no collaborationamong subsector
associations representingdifferent levels o f the chain. Thus, potential demand for BDSthat could raise




                                                        31

productivity or solve bottlenecksremains unarticulatedfor lack of mechanismsto assess needs and
mobilize demandacross groups of firms.

A value chain analysis of four sub-sectorswas completedas part ofproject preparation. The analysis
highlighted that mutual support systems andvalue chain linkages are extremely weak inKenya. A few
large private firms compensate for this weakness by internalizingvalue addingactivities alongthe entire
value chain under their ownvertical control. This "vertical internalization" of entire farm-to-finished
good value chains is a "second best" solution which reduces the flexibility of enterprises which adopt it.
Vertical integration within a single enterprise is not an option availableto SME's. The value chain study
also found that participantswithin value chains are highly compartmentalizedandthat commerciallinks
between suppliersand buyerstendto be ad hoc, one-timetransactionsandthat commercialdealings are
highly personalized.

These weaknesses are compoundedby ineffective or non-existent sub-sectormembershipassociations
which inother cases have helpeddevelop the supply chain linkages betweenkey segments. Moreover,
high levels of distrustexist amongcompanieswithin sub-sectorsand betweenfarm level producers and
farm product processors/merchandisers. As a result, community goods that support entire value chains
tendto be under-invested,transactioncosts tendto be extremelyhighanduseful information tends not to
be distributed quickly and efficiently within chains. This set of circumstances,makes it extremely
difficult for SMEs to rely onvendors or customers as sources of competitive advantage or to depend on
specializedBDSproviders to assist with strategic enterprise development. As a direct result, entire value
chains remain frozen inearly stages oftheir strategic development-constrained by the management
competencies, resourcesandtechnologieswhich happento be availablewithin individual enterprises.

Focus group meetingsof key players from each sector along an entire supply chain were conducted
during project preparationfor a number of strategic sectors. For example, inthe cotton-to-garments,key
players and sector associationsrepresentingcotton growers, ginners, spinners, weavers, textile and
garment manufacturerswere invited to consider anumber of key cross chain issues, which are inhibiting
competitive development. While the textile and garment sector is a critical engine for the Kenyan
economy, no dialogue hadtaken place betweencotton growers andproducersof finishedgarments before
the project preparationworkshop. This is all the more remarkable, consideringthat the sourcing of local
inputs is apre-requisite for AGOA, andthat AGOA will continueto be acatalystfor growth ofKenya's
textile and garment sector. This single example was duplicated inseveral value chain dialogues which
clearly revealedthat promoting dialogue and stimulating collaboration alongthe entire supply chains is a
critical missing ingredient inthe growth and competitive development ofvarious sectors ofKenya's
economy.

Activities: The proposedproject designovercomes some of the isolatedapproaches previously taken to
support strategic sectors by taking an integratedvalue chain approach, which broadens the scope of
assistance andconsiders some of the key issues that inhibitthe overall competitivenessof these strategic
sectors.

Access to the matching grant fund will be basedon a business plan to be draftedjointly by representative
organizations along the entire supply chain. For example, inthe case of cotton-to-apparel supply chain,
representativesfrom membership associationsinthe cotton, ginning, spinning/weaving, knitting, and
apparelwill be requiredto work together to formulate ajoint business plan which addresses a number of
key sub-sector issues, as well as to develop a comprehensive chain strategy.

The business plan is expectedto articulatea number of critical issues: training andcapacitybuilding
needs of each sub-sectoralong a supply chain; linkage mechanismswhich promotesthe flow of



                                                       32

information andknow-how betweensub-sectors; and the formulation and implementationof a
comprehensivechain strategy.

Eachprivate sector offeror will submit proposalsfor value chain strengthening, enhanced business service
delivery and critical skills development inresponseto aFormal Request for Proposalswhich will address
severalkey issues regardingcompetitivenessenhancementwithin the sub sector from which they come.
It is anticipatedthat the Fundwill be usedsolely for the purpose of procuring `knowledge-based' services
directedtoward improving the competitivenessand performanceof out growers and suppliers.
Specifically, funds from the matching grant can be appliedtowards the purchase oftechnical assistance to
train out growers/suppliers. For example, at the farming level, on-farm technicaltraining, training in
quality control, standards, post-harvesthandling and other activities that strengthenthe backwardslinkage
betweenthe corporate intermediary andtheir growers/suppliersto better respondto demands of the
market. Similarly, at the factory level, grant funds can be usedto procureprocess specific technical
assistance, total quality management, and modernproduction andmanagement techniques to help
improve the quality, cost and delivery of companiesinthe sub-sector.

The amount of funds availablefor the matchinggrant will be definedby the level of capital investment
that the sector is willing to make inits supply chain. It is anticipatedthat the sector group proposingto
accessthe match grant will be requiredto make investmentsincapital equipmentand inputs requiredto
develop its supply chain. Inreturn, the proposedgrant will match, dollar-for-dollar, the investmentmade
by the sector group with financing for `knowledge-basedservices'. Inaddition, the funds are expectedto
be directedtowards:

     e    Strengtheningsub-sectormembership associationsthat act as a catalyst andfocal point for
          expandingout grower andvendor development activities. Such activities would include,but not
          be limitedto the identification oftraining needs of suppliers, andcoordinate the delivery o fBDS
          services and funding to their suppliers; and
     0   Activities that stimulate collaboration across the entire supply chain with the objective of
          formulating and implementing a chain strategy which takes into considerationthe needs of each
          sub-sectorinthe supply chain.
SubcomponentB-Restructuring.Industrial Levy Scheme
Issues: According to the ICA, micro and small enterprises are significantly less likely to offer formal
training programs.None o fthe sampled 10 micro enterprises offered formal training, while only 24
percent ofthe small enterprises did so. However, most of the medium (55 percent) and large enterprises
(70 percent) do offer training of some kind, although the type and quality of skills provided is uncertain.

Kenya was amongst the few pioneers inAfrica to establisha fairly successfulindustrial training levy,
which was subsequentlyviewed as a model for the region. The Industrial Training Levy is managedby
the DirectorateofIndustrial Training (DIT) ofthe MinistryofLabor andHumanResourceDevelopment
underthe Industrial Training Act. The DIT functions as the Secretariatto the National Industrial Training
Council (NITC) which governsthe overall operationofthe scheme. The current scheme operates
accordingto differenttraining levies set for each of the 11industrial sub-sectors by the respective
Training Committeesunder the NITC. These range from KSH150-300per employee, per halfyear to
0.25 per cent of the total contract price or quarterly turnover (for some sectors and subjectto a ceiling on
the contract/turnover sum). Underthe provisions ofthe Industrial Training Act, all employers (with five
or more employees) are required to register with DIT andpay the levy every six months. Employers are
allowed to submit claims for reimbursementfor pre-approvedtraining programs at approved institutions.

There is broadconsensus within the Governmentandthe private sector that the current training levy has
to be revamped, inthe context ofthe restructuring ofthe national training system, to make it more

Activities: This subcomponentwill consist of five activities:
Activity 1:SkillsNeeds Inventory
The scope o fthis component is to conducta skillsneedsinventoryto identifythe priority sectors
(manufacturingindustriesandtourism) andskills development requirementsto betargetedby the levy
scheme. This inventorywill identifythe skills shortages andthe trainingneedsofbothlarge exporting
enterprises as well as domestic MSMEs.The skills needsinventorywill provideinputsfor the designof
the scheme interms o f skills sets and industrialsectors to betargeted by the scheme (examininga wider
range of sub-sectorsincludingthe existinglist ofelevensub-sectors). The inventorywill be carriedout
througha firm-levelsurvey usingastandardsurvey instrumentthat will capturethe current training
practices,needsandestimatesof future demandas well as feedback from firms onthe traininglevy,
public trainingsystems and TVET policiesandprocesses.

Activity 2: Governance and managementof industrialskills development
The scope ofthis component is to developpolicy proposals on governanceandmanagementarrangements
that will increase the responsivenesso fthe DITto workplaceskill needsand improvethe overall
performanceofthe skills developmentsystem inclose partnershipwith the privatesector. Issues that will
be considered includethe role ofthe Ministry of LaborandHumanResourceDevelopmentand
specificallythe DIT ingoverning, managing, financinganddeliveringindustrialskills development. This
componentwill also evaluate the proposalto restructure the DIT into aNationalIndustrialTraining
Authority (NITA) andseek measuresaimedat strengtheningthe public-privatepartnership inthe
governance of industrialskills developmentby reviewingthe size, composition,role, responsibilitiesand
functions ofthe existingNITC, assignmentofspecific roles andresponsibilitiesto the Ministry ofLabor

and HumanResourceDevelopment,the revampedNITC (including labor organizations)andthe DIT. It
will also address issues pertainingto accountability,performanceassurance and institutional and
instructional changes neededto enhance the performanceofthe publicly supportedskills training and
vocational training centers underthe DIT. A strategy will be developedto improve the performanceofthe
skills training and vocationaltraining centers taking into considerationcurrent initiatives by other donors.
The following issues could be considered:(i)the needfor greater institutionalautonomy; (ii)    new
governance and management arrangements, including new models of public-private partnership and
funding modalities; and(iii)  improving the quality of institutional level business andskills planning

Activity 3: Sources and level offinancing
The scope ofthis component is to developproposalsto supportincreasingaccess to andsustainableand
stable funding for industrial skills development; increasingreturns to public funds investedin industrial
training; greater responsiveness of training to current and future workplace skill needs; more efficient and
cost effective training delivery; apprenticeships; and adequate investments intraining infrastructure,
systems andpractitioners.This component comprisestwo parts. The first will explore options for
diversifying the current funding base and increasingcost sharing, while the second will recommend
collection anddisbursement modalitiesthat will enhancethe performanceof the training levy system. The
key issues to be addressed are:

a) Review the current state of financing for industrialtraining, includingthe levy fund, budgetary
     appropriationsfrom the Ministry ofLabor andHumanResourceDevelopment, donor funding, tuition
     fees andfee-for-service activities.
b) Restructuringthe training levy system, considerthe feasibility of introducing a single payroll levy
     scheme, the rate and thresholdto be applied, the impact and benefits ofthe levy on businessand
     employment, the modalities ofprivately managedlevy collection and disbursement,the coverage of
     the scheme (public sector, apprenticeships, enterprise-basedtraining, private providers), addressing
     the prospectoflevy funds being"raided" andthe costs ofmanagingvarious options including
     introduction of IT-based(including web-based) systems.
c)   Consider the efficacy ofthe current disbursement ofpublic funds to industrial training. This involves
     the funding ofthe skills training andvocational training centers (but notthe youth polytechnics).
d) Develop an industrial training funding strategy comprising disbursementoptions andmodalities
     considering issues such as incentive regimes andthe manner inwhich skills developmentfunds will
     be governedandmanaged.

Activity 4: Legislationfor Restructuringthe TrainingLevy
Review the presentTVET regulatory environment andthe current IndustrialTraining Act inthe context
ofthe proposalsfor a national W E T legislation and formulate a new Industrial Training Act basedon the
proposals inthe other componentsthat will impact on the quality of provision andthe promotion of
training provision. Importantregulatory issuesthat needto be consideredincludethe governanceand
managementof industrialtraining, roles, responsibilities andfunctions of the Ministry,NITC andDIT,
the managementof the levy system, the implications of provider registration and accreditationpolicies
and access to the levy fund. The draft legislationto establish aNational Industrial Training Authority/
National Skills Authority will needto be reviewed inthe context ofthe findings ofthe other components
ofthis study.

Activity 5:An industry-led apprenticeshipscheme & skills qualificationsstructure
This component consistsofareview ofthe existing apprenticeshiparrangements anddeveloping
proposalsfor the introduction of an industry-led apprenticeship scheme (for the formal sector), review of
the current qualifications, examinations andcurricula arrangementsfor trade testingand
recommendationsfor establishinga national industrial training qualifications structure (inthe context of
proposalsto establishaNational TVET Qualifications Framework under a new National Skills Authority)

Subcomponent C -GlobalBusiness SchoolNetwork: ImprovingOpportunitiesandTrainingfor
EntrepreneursandMSMEs
Issues: Economic development inAfrica remains stymiedby, among other things, lack o f innovation,
productdevelopment andgrowth-focusedentrepreneurship. Moreover,entrepreneursfrequently are cut
out from supportingnetworks. Universities,polytechnicsandtechnical institutes inKenyahave limited
coursesonentrepreneurship andMSMEmanagement. Ofthe 2 millioncurrentlyunemployed,youth
account for 45 percent ofthe total. The projectwill help trainthe nextgenerationofentrepreneursand
business managersby developingthe potentialandcapacity ofKenya's managementeducation
institutionsandcatalyzinginnovation.

The GlobalBusiness SchoolNetwork (GBSN) is developinganumber o fpilot programsto strengthen
businessschools insub-SaharanAfrica. By linking globalbusinessschools with leadingbusiness schools
inAfricancountries,these pilot programswill provideAfricanbusinessschools andfaculty with
expertiseandknowledgethey can use to trainandsupport Africa's new entrepreneursandmanagers.

Activities:
The activitiesare basedontwo concrete goals: (1) launchingabusinesspladinnovationcompetitionand
(2) the development of locally relevantcase studies andtheir integrationintothe curriculum.
Activity One: BusinessPlaflnnovation Competition
This subcomponent will build uponprovenmodels ofbusinessplancompetitions/entrepreneur mentoring
that encourage innovativebusiness models. Additionally, the processofthe competitionwill result inthe
entrepreneursreceivingincreasingamounts o ftrainingdependingontheir involvementinthe
competition. The processwill catalyze a communityo f entrepreneurs, bankers, advisors, investors,
educators andorganizers to improvethe business environment for entrepreneurs inKenya.

The processwill includevariousphases:(1) screeningfor dynamic and innovativeentrepreneurs; (2)
entrepreneurship andMSMEtrainingprograms, workshops onbusinessplandevelopment, individual
mentoringto buildtheir businessplans, conferences ontopics relatedto entrepreneurshipandbusiness
plandevelopment, andexpert pro bono assistance inthe areasofmarketing,finance, and law; (3) After
each competition(with cashprize awards providedby private sector donations), linkages are madeto help
qualifiedentrepreneurs access financingandmarkets. An AlumniNetworkhelpstrack progress and
results followingthe competition, andkeeps graduatesup-to-dateon programdevelopments, newsof
interestandupcomingevents.

The implementingagency for the Business PlanCompetition(BPC) will be contracted out to a
competitivelyselectedfirm or consortiumoffirdinstitutions. The BPCwill havethe following features:

     Training of relatedskills via existing partnershipswith training institutions, extensioncampuses, a
     large pool of potential trainers (such as business school students) etc.
     Private Sector Engagement. One ofthe positive externalitiesof aBPC is the many ways inwhich
     the private sector become involved. Participantsgainaccessto investorsandbusinessadvisorsthat
     they would not have otherwiseenjoyed. While the interest andinvolvement ofthe private sector
     naturally increases as the BPC evolves, they needto be engaged and invited from the beginning. At a
     minimumthe private sector shouldberepresentedthroughjudgindevaluation andthrough donations
     for prizes.
     PublicRelations. The nameof aBPC becomes a powerful brandthat is often associated with
     entrepreneurship, creativity, success, and especially indeveloping countries, youth. The name and
     brand ofthe competition shouldbethoughtfully designedand strongly promotedthrough all forms of
     available media.
     Alumni Tracking. Maintaining the contact information andprogresso feveryonewho submits a
     business planto the competition is essential bothto monitor the societalimpact ofthe competition
     andto invite past participantsto be involved infuture competitions. Pastparticipants, regardless of if
     they won or not, often go onto start businessesand supportthe BPC asjudges or donors. People
     shouldalso be encouragedto participateagaininsubsequent competitions.

The Business PlanCompetition inKenya is expectedto attract at least200 eligible entrantsannually,
leadingto 100beingtrained and 50 business plans developedannually. The competition will be
consciouso f a number ofconstituenciesand opportunities. Eachofthe following twin groups will be
given a chance to competeby increasingthe numberofprivate sector donationsfor prizes, allowing
"parallel competitions" to runalongthe same timeline but serving different groups or goals.

0    Formalvs. Informal. There will be parallel tracks for those working in, or intendingto work in, the
     formal sector andthose who are working inthe vibrant informal sector known as the Jua Kali.
0    Urban vs. Rural. The contest will start inNairobi, butby the thirdyear, it is expectedto have a
     competition ineach of the sevenprovinces andNairobi, with aNational FinalRound inNairobi.
     There will be prized at both the provincial andnational levels.
a    New Venture vs. Innovation. Inaddition to supportingand encouragingthe creation of new
     companiesthat are so critical for economic growth, the competition will also promotenew and
     innovative approaches among social entrepreneurs andMSMEs. Ideascanbe generated from both
     non-profit and for-profit organizations. It will be modeledon DevelopmentMarketplaceand usedto
     expose innovative approaches to nurturing growth ofthe private sector.

Activity Two: Developmentof locally relevant cases integratedinto the businesseducation curriculum
The primary objective for this activity is to train Kenyan faculty to enable them to prepareandteach
locally relevantcase studies and curricula on an ongoing basis. This project will follow a multi-step
approach-involving      international training programs and Global Business Schoolmentorsto developing
the capacity of Kenyan faculty to write case studies anddevelop curriculato beused intheir business
educationprograms as well as others inAfrica.

1. International Training Programs -Participating faculty memberswho will leadthe case writing
initiative will attend international case teachingtraining courses to learn the pedagogicalprinciples
behind case teachingand case writing. Such exposureis also expectedto assist inthe institutional
integrationof case-methodteachingpractices.

2. Case ProposalDevelopment-Prior to the international training program, the participating faculty will
develop case synopses intheir respectivesubject areas.




                                                       37

3, In-Person Mentoring -Ina few subject areas, mentors will be identified to conduct a local workshop
on case writing and provide in-person mentoringto Kenyan faculty.

4. Local Workshop with Business Leaders -To generate better understanding among the localbusiness
community o fthe role o f cases inbusiness education, the programwill co-host one-day workshops, with
the Kenyanhost school inNairobi.

5. Electronic Mentoring- The mentors will continue to work with their Kenyan partners to develop the
cases. Kenyan faculty will be responsible for the remainingdata gathering and writing buttheir mentors
will review drafts ofthe cases and electronically andor telephonically make suggestions for improving
the cases.

6. Teaching and Distribution-The success ofthe project will dependultimately on how often these
cases get used inthe classroom as teaching materials for African business school students. Once the cases
have beenrefinedinthe classroom, they will then be disseminated through personal and school-to-school
distribution channels to business schools inKenya and the rest of East Africa. The faculty will be given
incentives to keep track o fthe usage of their cases and to get feedback on their cases.

7. Distribution Planfor Africa -Appropriate distribution mechanisms will be identifiedto ensure that
case studies will be easily accessible to business schools throughout Africa, andthe GBSNC will assist
the Kenyan schools inthis effort.

Additionally, the African Virtual University (AVU) is initiating a program to develop the capacity for
case writing at four institutions inEast Africa. This project will coordinate with the AVU by inviting
each other to training sessions by technical assistants, collaborating electronically andhaving an annual
meeting.

COMPONENTTHREE- IMPROVING THE BUSINESSENVIRONMENT
This component will contributeto the overall improvement ofthe business environment inKenya.
Specifically, it will reduce cost o f compliance with business regulations for formal sector firms and create
incentives for informal MSMEsto graduate to higher levels o f formality. This component will assist the
Government insimplifying the taxation regime and reducingthe cost of starting a business through a one-
stop shop approach,

Issues: The informal sector has played an important role in employment generation inKenya. However,
the transition from informal to formal is critical both for the enterprise (for increased access to markets,
financial services, contract enforcement and security) and enterprise growth, as well as for the

business environment -- formal and informal cost andtime o f compliance with business start-up
Government (through increased tax revenueand environmentalhafety compliance). A prohibitive

regulations and discouraging taxation regime -- are among the mainreasons why entrepreneurs preferto
operate informally. In 1999-2000, IFC conducted a private sector survey covering 80 countries and
10,000 firms to find out ifbusiness obstacles are relatedto firm size. Itfound that size matters: the
smaller the firm, the greater the negative impacts. Globally, small firms face more problems with
financing, taxes, regulation, inflation, corruption, street crime, and anti-competitive practices than large
firms.

To date, there have beenfew successful attempts to reformthe business environment inKenya; most
notably, the Government o fKenya with technical assistance and funding from DFID, introduced in2000
the single business permit, which combined 16 individuallocally issued business licenses into one.
However, the process o f formalization remains complex, regulatedby different procedures, and requires

 multipletrips to Nairobi. Inmost cases, SMEs also needto deal with local authorities -municipalities -
 to obtain different types o fpermitsto start their businesses. The complexity and costs pose barriers
 especially for micro and small informal businesses to become legitimate.

  Non-compliance with the full legalizationand tax liabilities causes rent-seekingbehavior inpublic
  officials. ICA results show that when firms were faced with inspectors asking for informalpayments - 30
  percent of firms reportedthat an informal payment was expected from the tax authorities, 27 percent
  claimed that health inspectorates requested bribes, and22 percent claimed that municipal authorities and
  labor and social security (22 percent).

  All Kenyanbusinesses are subject to income tax. The range of income tax for individual businesses and
  partnerships range from 10 percent to 30 percent. Companies are taxed at a standard 30 percent, with no
  differentiation basedon size. Tax rates are competitive with neighboring countries. However, ICA
  survey cites that tax rates are the highestobstacle for microenterprises andrank amongthe top three

obstacles for small firms. Incontrast, taxes are rated only as fourth and fifth highest inthe large and
medium firms.

It is apparent that microenterprises are unable to comply with current tax regulations. Various existing
studies and assessments2o,findings of the Bank missions and focus group meeting show that the most
important motivating factor for businesses inKenya to remain informal i s the system o f taxation. It is
designed for larger and more sophisticated businessesthat can afford to either employ accountants or
outsource tax accountancy and reporting. A simplified, flat tax for microenterprises has beensuccessful
inanumberofdevelopingandtransition countries. The maincharacteristics ofthese simplifiedsystems
include:


     0   Introduction of a unified or single tax schedule instead o f numerous national and local taxes for
         SMEs, formulation of simple and clear rules for calculating tax liability;
     0   Significant reduction of the requirements and simplification o f the procedures for the obligatory
         reporting on business operations by SMEs subjects o f simplifiedtaxation; and
     0   Simplicity infiling tax returns.

The target group for this component would be: i)the current "informal" sector comprised ofbusinesses
that do not pay taxes and frequently do not comply with the full range of registrationrequirements; ii)
entrepreneurs, who are planningto start their business.The proposed system will mostly target the more
established side of the spectrum. Reform efforts will concentrate not on minimizing the importance of the
informal sector, but rather to create an enabling environment for the formalization and growth o f MSMEs.

Activities: Simplified taxation and start-up system should be introduced as simultaneous unifiedreform
initiative. The objective will be to buildand expand onthe successful single business license project
financed by DFID, which combined 16 individual locally issued business licenses into one. The project
will take reforms a step further, by combining business name registration from the Registrar General
Office o f the Attorney General, Kenya RevenueAuthority PINregistration, MOT1trade licenses, and the
local authorities permits(including the single business permit) into one interface. The component will
benefit from the work planned underthe World Bank financed FLSTAC, which includes capacity
buildingo fthe Registrar General. A more effective Registrar General would make operation o fthe one-
stop shops for business start-up more efficient.

The component will also assist the KenyaRevenue Authority indeveloping and launching a simplified
taxation system for MSEs. Existing tax and accounting requirements inKenya are the same for both
small and largerbusinesses. Small businesseshave neither appropriate in-house skills to comply with
these requirements nor the resourcesto out-source this work. The activities under this project will apply

identifying the right approach for such a regime - eligibility criteria, appropriate rates, collection and
international best practice o f simplifiedtaxation to the specific conditions inKenya. Itwill include

administration mechanisms, revenue assessment, etc. Additionally, amendments to the current legislative
and normative acts will be drafted and presentedto the Government. It will also include training o f K R A
officials and an information campaign for targeted businesses. A simplifiedflat tax regime, which has
proven to be quite a successful vehicle for the SME growth inother countries, would be one of the
incentives for small businesses to move to the formal sector of economy. This system is supposedto be in

the form ofthe unifiedtax (UT). The maincharacteristicsofthe recommendedUT approachare
presentedbelow:
    1. Criteria to be subject ofthe UnifiedTax for businesses should include only one variable, namely
       annualturnover. This turnover thresholdshouldbe establishedat the level of the VAT threshold.
       The number of employeesshouldbe not used as qualification criteria for UnifiedTax due to the
       high unemploymentrate inKenya andnecessityto keep incentives for hiring additional
       workforce andtherefore individual business growth.

    2. UnifiedTax will replacefor businesses below the VAT thresholdsuch current taxes and fees as
       Incometax, Single Business Permit, payroll taxes, fees for registration.The revenues will be
       shared betweencentraland local governments.A more in-depthsurvey and discussionshould
       also address the issue of inclusion of other taxes and fees into UT.

    3. Due to the different profitability of operations indifferent sectors on the one hand, and necessity
       for businessesto be dynamic andmove from one sector to another on another hand, it is proposed
       to introducethree schedules ofthe UnifiedTax. The first schedule will cover leastprofitable,
       albeit, socially important sectors; the second, more expensive schedule will cover these sectors
       plusthose that are more profitable, while the third, most expensiveschedulewill cover all the
       sectors including the most profitable. The follow-up schedules should includethe previous ones.
       The rationalefor this is to encourage businessesto legalizetheir involvement inmore profitable
       activities, thus not punishingthem by withdrawing an operationalability to operate in low-profit
       sectors. Upondecisionofthe Government of Kenya there canbe some sectors, evenwithin the
       threshold, excluded from the UnifiedTax system.

    4. Like sectors, operations indifferent localities ofKenya also will be reflected inthe UnifiedTax
       schedules. The issue of defining domicile of business andto avoiding double taxation incases
       when abusiness has multi-regional operations must be addressed basedonthe feasibility study
       findings. The option of different UT rate for country-wide operationversus limited to specific
       locality operation can be proposedbasedon the study.

    5. Regressiveadd-on systemfor the UnifiedTax basedon the number of employees should be
       evaluated.Dueto the phenomenonof the wide usageof the sales representatives(hokas) and
       coverageby the unifiedTax ofthe payroll taxes, it is proposedto charge businesses add-ons to
       the UnifiedTax for hired labor. This add-onsystem shouldberegressiveto motivate employment
       growth.

    6. Basedon the study data, it can be recommendedthat businesses will be subjects of keeping
       simplified recordsfor auditing purposesand inorder to be able to prove their eligibility to apply
       or to remainunderthe UnifiedTax system. The simplified form for records shall be developedby
       KRA andprovidedto apersonadmittedto aUTsystem.

    7. All UnifiedTax collection should be undertakenby KRA through its regional offices and/or One
       Stop Shop (OSS). Businesses can select monthly, quarterly or annual installment plans. Option of
       the more frequentpaymentswill enable businesses to pay less at the beginning oftheir activities
       andtherefore invest more into their businesses, while less frequent option will enable businesses
       to minimize necessity to visit government offices. Distribution of collected revenueswill include
       local government budgets, national budget andrespectivesocial funds.

               Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
                             KENYA: MSME CompetitivenessProject

A.      FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS

Countryissues

The results ofthe latest Kenya Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) dated April, 2001
indicatedthat "...fiduciary risk inpublic spending is assessedas high. Whilea lack of compliancewith
establishedfinancial andprocurement regulations have completely renderedmany initiatives aimed at
strengthening the control environmentineffective, issues of limited execution, inadequatemonitoring,
insuficient capacity and lack of enforcement also need to be resolved."

The assessment observed highlevels o ffinancial management risk due to a weak control and low capacity
environment. Government accounts were regularly late and incomplete. Inter-agency reporting was slow
and sometimes difficult to achieve, where hierarchicallines were blurredor foreign to the day-to-day
structures and management o f the institution. Accountability chains were weak, andpenalties for non-
compliance extremely light or nonexistent.

Mitigatingmeasures

A new government is now inplace with a commitment to ensuringcompliancewith legislation,
strengthening regulatory institutions and fightingcorruption.

With the support o f a number of donor assistedinitiatives, including the IDA-fundedPublic Sector
Management Technical Assistance Project (PSMTAP), the Government is enhancing the financial
accountability framework inorder to:

0   mitigate fiduciary risk inpublic expenditure management;
0   achieve economy, efficiency and effectiveness inthe use of public funds;
0   enhance transparency and accountability; and
0   enhance staff capacity inpublic financial management.

ProjectRisks
Specific areas that needto be addressedinclude:

    a) Successful institution of a sustainable private-public sector partnershipthat draws private sector
        professionalisminto Government project management.

    b) Implementationo fa financial budgetary control system, accountingand internal control systems
        and reportingmechanisms considered acceptable to IDA and Government; and sustainable
        following completion o f project implementation.

    c) The multiplicity o f implementingagenciesresultingincomplicated financial management and
        reporting arrangements.




                                                     47

Mitigatingmeasures


A number of riskmitigation arrangements have beenproposedto address identified concerns:

    a) A proposed independentPublic-PrivateSteeringCommitteeestablishedwith membership
        comprising stakeholdersand interestedpartiesfrom boththe public and private sectors. The
        Committee will be responsible for overall project policy direction and guidance, as well as
        approval of annualworkplan and budget.

    b) The proposedsubcontractingo ffinancial management to a competitively procuredprivate sector
        Project ManagementContractor (PMC) whose qualification andterms of reference will be subject
        to IDA approval.

    c) The proposedappointmentof independentauditors for the project's annual financial statements.

    d) The project will be subjectto regular IDA supervisionmissions aimedat closely monitoring
        performanceand the timely resolutionof issues.

Financialmanagementsystem

The project proposesthe outsourcingofthe financial management function to aPMC, a competitively
procuredprofessionalprivate sector firm who will be responsiblefor all the financial management
includingthe budgeting, accountingandreporting functions ofthe project. The objectives ofthe project's
financial managementsystem are:

0   to ensure that funds are usedonly for their intendedpurposesinan efficient and economicalmanner;
0   to ensure that funds are properly managed and flow smoothly, adequately, regularly and predictably
    inorderto meetthe objectives ofthe project;
0   to enable the preparationofaccurate and timely financial reports;
0   to enable project management to monitor the efficient implementation ofthe project; and
0   to safeguardthe project assets and resources.

Furthermore, the following are necessary features of a strongfinancial management system:

    the project implementing agencies shouldhave anadequate number andmix ofskilledand
    experiencedstaff;
    the internal control systemshouldensure the conductofan orderly andefficient paymentand
    procurementprocess, and proper recording and safeguardingof assets and resources;
    the accountingsystemshould support the project's requests for funding andmeet its reporting
    obligations to the GOK andIDA;
    the systemshouldbe capable ofproviding financial datato measure performancewhen linkedto the
    output o fthe project; and
    an independent, qualified auditor should be appointedto periodically review the Project's financial
    statements and internal controls.

Institutionaland implementationarrangements

The SteeringCommittee throughthe Project Secretariatwill be responsible for the oversight of the special
account as well as those financial management responsibilitieswhich have been delegatedto the PMC
(i.e., managemento fproject accounts, preparationof FMR, annualfinancial statements, IDA credit
withdrawal applications), inaccordance with soundand standard guidelines acceptableto IDA. They will
be responsiblefor the statutory audits of project's financial statements, ensuringthat the process is
carried out efficiently and in line with the terms of funding andproject agreements. They will also be
responsiblefor ensuringthat matters arising from audits are dealt with expeditiously.

The project will be fully integratedinto the activities of Ministryof Trade andIndustry (MOTI),
including compatibility with Government budgetingandaccountingsystems.

0   IDA will make an initialadvance disbursementfrom the proceeds ofthe Credit by depositinginto the
    Borrower-operated Special Accounts.
0   Actual expenditurewill be reimbursedthrough submission of Withdrawal Applications together with
    Financial MonitoringReports (FMR).
0   Transfers from the Special Accounts (for payment of transactions inlocal currency) will be deposited
    inthe MOTIPaymaster General(PMG) Account at the CentralBank ofKenya. Suchremittances
    will normally be inlocal currency inaccordance with GOK exchequer control and funding
    arrangements. Immediately upon receipt of proceeds, MOTIwill transfer funds to the project account
    maintained by the PMC.
0   Counterpart funds will be allocated through the normal central government budgetary process, and
    deposited inthe project account inaccordance with DCA requirements.
0   PMC will be responsible for all payments out o f the project account, including remittances on behalf
    o f implementingagencies. Itwill also be responsible for requisitioning foreign currency payments out
    o f the special account and from the IDA credit account usingthe Direct Payment method.

Accountability -PMC will coordinate with implementingagencies the utilization o f funds to meet the
eligible expenditures basedon approved budget andwork plans, following the accounting procedures to
be outlined inthe FinancialManagement Manual. Quarterly accountabilities to IDA will be made inthe
form of FMRs, including projectedprocurement plans and funding requirements for the ensuing6
months. Monthly statements will be madeto MOTIto enable monthly reporting and maintenance of data
for the Government IntegratedFinancial Management Information System (IFMIS).

Staffing

PMC will assign a Finance Managerto be responsible for project financial management. The Finance

  B       DISBURSEMENTARRANGEMENTS
 Requests for disbursement from IDA will initially be made on the basis o f approved work plans cash flow
 projections for eligible expenditures (report-based disbursements). IDA will make advance disbursement
 from the proceeds o fthe Credit by depositing into borrower-operated special accounts to expedite project
 implementation. The advance to the special accounts will be usedby the borrower to finance IDA's share
 o f project expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable method o f withdrawing funds
 from the Credit is the direct payment method, involving direct payments from the Credit to a thirdparty
 for works, goods and services uponthe borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial
 bank for expenditures against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit.
 IDA's Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimumapplication value for direct payment and special
 commitment procedures.



                                                        53

Alternatively, uponcrediteffectiveness, PMCwill berequiredto submit awithdrawalapplicationfor an
initialdeposit to the specialaccount, drawn from the IDA Credit, inan amountto be agreedto inthe
DevelopmentCreditAgreement. Replenishmentof funds from IDAto the specialaccount will be made
uponevidence of satisfactoryutilizationofthe advance, reflectedinSOEs and/or on full documentation
for paymentsabove SOEthresholds.Replenishmentapplications wouldberequiredto be submitted
regularlyon amonthlybasis.

Ifineligibleexpendituresare found to havebeenmadefromthe specialaccount, the borrowerwillbe
obligatedto refundthe same. Ifthe special account remains inactivefor morethansix months,the
borrowermay be requestedto refund to IDA amounts advancedto the specialaccount.

IDA will havethe right, as to be reflectedinthe Development CreditAgreement, to suspenddisbursement
of the funds ifreportingrequirementsare not compliedwith.

                             KENYA: MSMECompetitivenessProject

General
1. Procurementfor the project would be carriedout inaccordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:
ProcurementUnder IBRDLoansand IDA Credits'' dated May 2004; and "Guidelines: Selectionand
Employment of Consultantsby World Bank Borrowers" datedMay 2004, andthe provisions stipulated in
the LegalAgreement. The generaldescriptionofvarious items under differentexpenditurecategoryare
described below. For eachcontract to be financedby the Credit, the differentprocurementmethods or
consultantselectionmethods,the need for prequalification, estimatedcosts, prior review requirements,
andtime frame are agreedbetweenthe Borrower andthe Bank project team inthe ProcurementPlan. The
ProcurementPlan will be updatedat least annually or as requiredto reflectthe actualproject
implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity. To the extent practicableBank's
standardbidding documents for goods and StandardRequests for Proposalsfor consultantsas well as all
standardevaluation forms would be usedthroughout project implementation.

Advertising

2. A General ProcurementNotice (GPN) is mandatory and would be published before Board
presentationinthe DevelopmentGateway, UNDevelopment Business and ina national newspaper as
provided under the Guidelines.Inaddition, a Specific ProcurementNotice (SPN) is requiredfor all
Expressionsof Interest (EOI) for consulting services with an estimatedvalue inexcess of US$200,000.
There are no ICB procurementfor goods andworks underthisProject.

Assessmentof Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement

3. The Ministryof Trade and Industry (MOTI) has a Supplies ManagementDivision (SMD)runby a
team of Supplies Officers and Supplies clerical staff under the direction of a Principal Procurement
Officer (PPO). Hierarchically the PPOreportsto the PermanentSecretary (PS) of MOTI. The SMD staff
ofthe Ministryare, like their counterpartsinother centralgovernment ministriesand departments, civil
servants who are organizationally employeesof and have been seconded by Ministry ofFinanceto MOTI.
Supplies Officers postedto central government agencies are transferredfrom one institution to another
once every few years.

4. Supplies Officers inthe civil service have beentrained insupplies chain managementwhich is
confined to procurementand store-keepingof common user items. With the exceptionof those who may
have worked with Bank-funded projects, Supplies Officers have little or no experience inadministering
procurementprocess of works, specializedgoods or consultancy services. The Supplies staff, including
the PPO, currently working with MOTIhave not beenexposedto the Bank procurementprocedures. The
overall project risk for procurement is therefore high.

5.  Because ofthe limited experienceof the SMD staff ofMOTI inthe selectionof consultants, MOTI
has agreedto hire aprocurement consultant on a fixed-term contract under the PPF. The procurement
consultant will assist the SMDinadministering the processes of the selectionof some ofthe initial major
consulting servicesenvisagedunder this Project (including the selectionofthe Project Management
Contactor (PMC)). MOTI will, inconsultation with IDA, draft the Terms ofReferenceofthe procurement
consultant, and select a shortlist of six individuals with proven experienceinthe preparationof Request
for Proposals(RFPs) and evaluation o f proposalsbasedon the Bank standardformats. Before starting
negotiations with the recommendedprocurement consultant, MOTIwill seek IDA'Sconcurrenceofthe
CVs of the shortlistedindividuals, andterms and conditions ofthe draft contract.

ProcurementImplementationArrangements

6. The overall coordination and implementationof the project activities would be the Project Secretariat
inMOTI. Initialprocurement activitieswill be handledby aprocurement consultant to be appointed.
However, once the PMC has beencontracted, the day to day monitoringwill be entrustedto the PMC,
which will also be responsible for coordinating all outstanding and futureprocurement under the project.
The appointment o fthe PMC is a condition of effectiveness.

ProcurementCategoriesand Methods

General

7. Component 1-Access to Finance is aimed at increasing access and availability o f financial services
to MSMEsthrough the introductionof new risk capital instruments, products and tools, and capacity
building. For subcomponent A, "Financial Sector Deepening", the Trust will be cofinancedby DFID.
The arrangements for establishment ofthe Trust, the Technical Manager, the Deputy Technical Manager
and the Financial Administrator would not be subject to IDA procurement guidelines as the IDA funds
would not be used to pay for any o fthe services to be provided by the Trust. This understanding will be
formalized ina letter from DFIDto the Government and would be clearly outlined inthe grant agreement
to be entered into between the Trust and the Government o f Kenya (the donor for the IDA portion of the
funds). The Trustwill submit quarterly work-plans to the PMC. The quarterly work-plan will beusedto
disburse funds to the Trust account by the PMC. Itwill bethe responsibility o f the Financial Manager of
the Trustto provide monthly financial statements to the PMC. The PMC inturnwould reconcilethe
Project's financial statementsby consideringthe use o f the IDA funds advancedto the Trust.

8. For subcomponent B, "SME risk capital fund", selection o f SME risk capital fund investors and
technical partners will be basedon pre-specified criteria that respect best practice. Expressions o f interest
will be called for from interested institutions through an open advertisement which will state the criteria
to determine the eligibility of interested applicants. Expressions o f Interest (EOI) will be called for from
the interested SME risk capital investors and technical partners, and the EOIswill explicitly state the
criteria to determinethe eligibility o f interested applicants. The eligible applicants will submit detailed
business plans which will include their portion of the contribution (Le, matching grants) towards the

 Summary ofBenefitsand Costs:

 Base CaseResults
 The cost-benefits analysis of this project faces the same limitation inall economic analyses of projects in
 developing countries, namely, lack of reliable time series data requirefor an appropriate calibration,
 difficulty infindingthe appropriate shadow prices, and difficulty inprecisely quantifying the economic
 benefits and welfare gains or losses especially resulting from capacity buildingand institutional
 development. It requires the use o f proxies suitable for the project basedon market assessments and,
 when available, quantifieddevelopment impacts from similar projects incomparable countries.

 Nevertheless, a simple model has been built to calculate the Net PresentValue (NPV) andthe Internal
 Rate of Return(IRR)24based on a 12-year forecast timeframe. The project impact is expectedto start
 materializing duringproject implementation. It i s important to note that the maximum impact will be
 reached after project completion once the relevant capacity, institutions andthe investmentclimate are
 strengthened.To test the robustness ofthe project, the sensitivities oftheNPV andthe IRRto
 assumptions and uncertainfuture values are diagnosed under worst-case, best-case, and intermediate-case
 scenarios. A counterfactual case was used to derive the net effect o f the project.

  The cost-benefit analysis was carried out for the following components: (i)          riskcapitalfund, (ii)    value
 chaidmatching grant, (iii)  Entrepreneurship and business plan competition (BPC), and (iv) Investment
 climate. For the purpose of the analysis, the latter component also includedthe "Commercial Products
 and Outreach to MSMEProviders", "Restructuring Industrial Training Levy Scheme" and "Capacity
 BuildingofBusiness Schools" components which are assumedto have the same incidenceonthe
 numeraire usedto estimate the development impacts. The numeraires are output and employment income,
 which are positively affected by the project as the result o f (i)  increased access to finance, (ii)       higher
 productive investments, and (iii) synchronizedvalue chains and access to markets.
                                    better

 Inthe basecasescenario, the project generates aNPVvalue estimated at aboutUS$19.8 million
 corresponding to an IRRof 26.7%. The project is expected to contribute to directjob creation drivenby
 increased production. However, it i s important to note thatjob creation could be limitedby the relatively
 low capacity utilization rate o f 63 percent. That said, duringthe lifetime o f the project a minimumof 2750



 24NPV is positivewhen IRRis greater thanthe assumed discount rate. The NPV is the decisioncriteria.

direct jobs are expected to be created. This number is derived mainly from the Risk Capital Fund25for
which, giventhe more straightforwardand direct relationsh.ip between investments andjob creation
compared to the other project components, employment impact can be more reasonably quantified ex
ante. This number i s below the project's potentialjob creationnot only because it does not account for
jobs generated as the result o f institutional development (microfinance, investment climate, etc) but also,
because it excludes indirectjobs to be created. The difficulty inestimatingthe number of indirectjobs
created results from the lack of information on the size o f the relevantjob multipliers.Ifindirectjob
creation was considered inthe analysis, the NPV would have beenhigher.Finally, with the expected
sustainability o f the project activities, jobs will likelycontinue to be created beyondthe project lifetime.
Insum, overall, and giventhe innovativeapproachfor some ofthe project components, the results are
conservative.

The government fiscal position is also positively affected. Indeed, for the 12-year forecast time frame, the
project would generate $US13.5 million as the result of incremental personal income taxes, and corporate
income taxes.

For all the projects components, as shown intable 1below, the NPVs are positive.

Main Assumptions and key parameters used (base case):

     1. It is assumedthat a minimumo f 100 companies will have access to the risk capital fund (RKF)
         with an average amount o f $150,000 per investee. It is assumedthat, on average, at the endo fthe
         five year project implementation period, the investees would expandtheir outputhales at a
         multipleo f3 times the amount of initial investment, consistent with a creation o f 24jobs for each
         $150,000 invested. This assumption is made based on empirical evidence from the RKFscheme
         in South Africa, where $150,000 directly facilitated 24 employment opportunities in2002. It is
         expectedthat the selection criteria, interms o f growth potential o f the investees, will be similar to


 25The average yearly salary is consideredto be $3 120 inthe RKF-supportedinvestees.


                                                            61

       that in South Africa; for that reason, the rate ofjob creation inKenya is not discounted to take
       into account the relatively smaller size ofthe economy and level of demand.

   2. Four entire value chains will be supported by the matching grant fund for an average amount o f
        $750,000. For the purpose o f the cost benefitanalysis, we assume that the total amount of the
       matching grant fund will go to the coffee sector. We assume that the strategy that would be
       proposed and implementedby the representatives ofthe coffee chain would allow an increaseof
       the averageyield ofthe partner farmer cooperatives to the level ofthe bestfarmer, i.e from 0.4 to
        0.7 todha. This is equivalent to an increaseof average revenue by $462/hectare from $616 to
       $1078 givena price o f $1542 per ton. Finally, we assume that the partner farmer cooperative has
       2085 farms with an average size o f land of 1hectare. The increase inrevenue for the farmers will
       not lead to job creation giventhe very low capacity utilizationrate o f 20% at the farm level.
       Finally, it is also assumedthat the institutionalframework (set o f externalfactors that the
       different players o fthe value chain cannot control such as infrastructure quality, law enforcement,
       etc) required to enhancethe relationship between small and larger enterprises and enhance their
        integration inthe value chain remains unchanged ifnot improved.

   3. For thejob creatingproductive activities, the rates o fjob creation have been calculated taking
        into account a yearly value added per worker o f U S $2439 for small enterprises and $4000 for
       mediumenterprisesz6.The rate is discounted to take into account the relatively low average
       capacity utilization rate and low level o f demand.

   4. The average yearly salary inthe private sector is $3 120, and $1149 inparticular inthe agriculture
        sector27.

   5. The average yearly minimumwage i s $US1188throughout the lifetime o f the project.


   6. Inthe base case, the increase infirms' output is discounted by a conservative two-third to take
        into account the economic costs o f other resources inthe economy that are divertedinto the
        project from other activities not directly supported by the project.

   7. The investmentclimate, financial products and Business Development Services are responsive to
       the MSMEsneeds.

    8. Macroeconomic stability (inflation, interest and exchange rates); government sustained

SensitivityAnalysis /Switching values of criticalparameters:
Seven sensitivity tests were carried out by switching values o f critical parameters. The results are
presented intable 3 below.

    1. The first test decreases the shadow discount rate from 14to 10 percent: the NPV increased to
       US$27.7 million with a correspondingIRRo f 24.1 percent. About 2750jobs are expected to be
        created duringthe 5-year lifetime o fthe project. Thejob creation rate is linkedto the RKF's
        investmentor matching grant from the project; it is therefore not affectedby the shadow discount
        rate.

                                                     62

  2. The second test increasesthe shadow discount rate from 14 to 20 percent, the NPV considerably
       decreased to US$11.9 million while the IRRincreasedto 30.5 percent. Thejob creation rate is not
       affected by the shadow discount rate.
  3.   The thirdtest assumes a higher increaseinoutput for each investee benefitingfrom the RKF from
       5 to 10; the results showed a NPV of US$33.1 million and IRRof 33.6%. About 4060 jobs are
       expected to be created duringthe 5-year lifetimeo fthe project.
  4. The fourth test assumes a lower increase inoutput for each investee (benefiting from the RKF) of
       2 compared to 5 inthe basecase; the results showed aNPV o f US$10.4 million and IRRof
       21.1%. 1810jobs are created duringthe 5-year lifetimeo fthe project.
  5.   The fifth test assumes a decrease inrevenueper ton of coffee by 50% for each value chain
       benefiting; the results showed a NPV of US$16.0 million and IRRof 24.8%. Job creation is not
       affected giventhe very low capacity utilizationrate which i s assumedto be at its lowest natural
       level.
  6. The sixth test assumes an increase inrevenue per ton of coffee by 50% for eachvalue chain; the
       results showed a NPV of US$23.6 million andIRRo f 28.5%. Job creation is not affected given
       the very low capacity utilization rate.
  7. The seventh test elongates the disbursement period by three years, the NPV decreasedto US$13.2
       million while the IRRcame down to 23.0%. Although the rate ofjob creation is slower than in
       the base case, the same number o fjobs is created at the end o f the delayed project.
The fiscal impact is positive inall the scenarios.
