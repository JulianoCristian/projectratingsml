                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project aims to increase productivity and employment in participating micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). This objective will be achieved by
                         strengthening financial and non-financial markets to meet the demand of MSMEs, strengthening support for employable skills and business management, and
                         reducing critical investment climate constraints in MSMEs. The project will focus on key value chains and on both formal small and medium enterprises and
                         informal microenterprises that have high potential for dynamic growth, including "graduation" from informal to formal status.

                         Since the last ISR period, further progress has been made towards achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDOs). The summary below highlights the main progress towards
                         each of the elements through which the project is expected to achieve the PDO.

                         **Strengthening financial markets to meet the demand of MSMEs and reducing some of the critical investment climate constraints in MSMEs: This is being addressed through the
                         support to (i) the Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT) and (ii) the SME risk investment TA funds, covering a) Business Partner International (BPI) and b) other TA providers.

                           (i) The renewal of the grant agreement was signed in January 2011 and pending payments were done; a new disbursement request for accrued amount as of September was
                         submitted in December 2011 after a long delay partly affected by FSDTs focus on developing a new strategy and a multi year plan approved in September 2011. Since FSDT is a
                         pool of funds, it can continue its good performance pending actual flow of funds from the MSME project for a while, but eventually needs to get the funds to be able to adjust its
                         accounts. FSDT continued to perform well as reported in their quarterly reports, including, for instance, 25 new products launched such as weather insurance and revamped value
                         chain financing and 82 financial institutions supported. At the project restructuring, one need highlighted for the project overall was to strengthen the interlinkages across sub-
                         components, as feasible. In line with this recommendation, FSDT and the matching grant component have been discussing options to support the development of products by
                         financial institutions supported under FSDT for the value chains supported by the matching grant component, following the successful development of a product for the coffee value
                         chain by a leading bank. This will be heightened under the revamped value chain financing project of FSDT.

                          (ii) a) BPI has continued to provide TA reaching 68 smes (88 projects) for US$334,095 inTA funding supporting total investments that have reached US$9.4 million as of end
                         September 2011; also, per the restructuring document, an officer was hired in August 2011 to promote the uptake of TA funds among SMEs. The IFCs SME solution center (SSC)
                         has continued to provide outstanding support to the project in its engagement with SMEs.

                          (ii) b) following the original project design, the TA provided to SMEs was expected to be extended to beneficiaries of SME risk capital funds other than BPI. After a delay of several
                         years, two new risk capital funds are assessing provision of TA for SMEs after having signed MOUs; one fund already presented two projects. The other funds are likely to present
                         requests shortly, while 1-2 more funds are expected to engage as well. This is also being supported by SSC.

                         **Strengthening support for employable skills and business management and reducing other critical investment constraints in MSMES (particularly on the 4 value chains covered): All
                         four sub-components of Component 2 have experienced progress:

                           (i) the Value Chain Based Matching Grant, an early and sustained implementation success, has continued to deliver highly satisfactory performance and enabled key market
                         linkages in the coffee, leather and cotton value chains. The pyrethrum sector continues to face challenges as a result of delays in the liberalization of the sector, but at least 2
                         projects have been supported. Over the period, there have been several noticeable achievements, in particular for the coffee value chain (first one to start under the project) and the
                         cotton value chain, but also for the leather value chain and to a lesser extent, the pyrethrum value chain. Notably, the Pyrethrum Bill 2011 was gazetted on 7th December 2011, which
                         is broadly in agreement with the Pyrethrum Apex. The Apex is now planning lobby efforts to fast track approval of the Bill. In accordance with the project restructuring
                         recommendations, non-matching support has been provided to training institutes, but through a simpler mechanism than originally anticipated (originally thought using industrial
                         training levy, but fast tracked through the non-matching grant). Importantly, the sub-component identified quick wins for interventions using the additional funds of USD$300,000 that
                         were added at project restructuring with 8 new projects being implemented. For details of the progress made please refer to a presentation prepared at a recent inter-apex committee
                         meeting with all the value chains (attached).

                           (ii) Industrial Training Levy Scheme. After a long hiatus of several years for the initiation of the contract, preparation of the work, and review by the task force, the report on the
Public Disclosure Copy




                         restructuring of the scheme has been delivered and reviewed. The report contains recommendations to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the current levy scheme for public
                         training. The task force met recently and approved the report with minor comments that are expected to be delivered shortly to the consultants for finalization.

                          (iii) Business Plan Competition. the second phase is well underway building on success of the first round (completed last year, after delays of several years) with applications
                         received and being vetted. Activities under this sub-component have provided high visibility to the project. As a result, more private entities have expressed interest in providing
                         additional support to SME beneficiaries and the Bank team has facilitated some of these engagements, in line with the restructuring document.

                           (iv) Global Business School Network. Following the successful completion of this subcomponent at the time of restructuring, a new phase was included to further support universities
                         beyond the original four. The success of the first phase largely hinged on the extended support of the IFC GBSN unit, no longer part of the IFC (now an NGO). For the second stage,
                         the ministry requested the support of a consultant to enable achievement of similar results, which has been hired and a plan for implementation has been designed, being
                         implemented. Proposals were submitted for NOB and comments provided. These will be resubmitted shortly.

                         Disbursements of the IDA credit proceeds have reached 57%, which are not yet at the level expected for this ISR period according to the restructuring paper. Notwithstanding, further
                         expenditures were incurred per the latest FMR, with pending payments expected to be finalized shortly. Once the pending payments are made, the disbursement rate is expected to
                         rise to about 67%.

                         Other implementation issues: As noted in previous ISRs, the implementation delays after project restructuring mainly occurred last year due to the lengthy procurement process to
                         renew the contracts for the project implementation consultants. The related procurement issues were resolved and all but one contracts were renewed. The renewal of the
                         consultant contract for communication support (under the revised Component 3 that combined project management, communications, and M&E under one component) is ongoing.
                         The Bank has provided technical comments that are being incorporated to be resubmitted shortly. Project management and the governance arrangement have improved significantly,
                         with stronger efforts addressing lingering aspects (i.e. more expeditious processing of request for NOB, closer supervision of activities). The Project Steering Committee now holds
                         regular meetings and through those meetings has provided strategic oversight to project implementation most recently regarding the proposal for reallocation and/or cancellation of
                         Funds being revised to be resubmitted to the Bank.

                         Since the implementation of the planned activities have improved substantially, progress towards development objectives is now on track, with further gains expected during the last 6
                         months of the project, in particular with regard to PDO Indicator 1 (54% of the targeted value achieved as of September 2011). The baseline data for PDO Indicator 2 was collected
                         in 2008 and a follow-up survey is scheduled for March 2012. All the ratings remain unchanged for this ISR period. Discussions will be held with the Client regarding the impact
                         evaluation arrangement in early 2012.
