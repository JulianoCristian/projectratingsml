(HCWM), and recommends mitigations. The report recommends\n            the following priorities: 1) developing an integrated\n            strategy for infection control that will include the safe\n            management of health-care waste; 2) set up Committees for\n            Hospital Hygiene and Infection Control at all levels of the\n            hospital services; 3) consolidation of the legal framework\n            and reinforcement of existing rules and guidelines; 4)\n            standardization of current health-care waste management\n            practices with application of management and monitoring\n            procedures; 5) designation of a health-care Waste Management\n            Officer in larger health-care facilities who will monitor\n            the health-care waste management system; and 6) development\n            of awareness and training programs, and review the curricula\n            of medical and paramedical staff. Improving the HCWM\n            practices through the implementation of all recommendations\n            in this report remains a difficult exercise in the absence\n            of an integrated solid waste management system for the\n            country. Emergence, also recommends that local authorities\n            of large municipalities to develop integrated solid waste\n            management systems and build sanitary landfills."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
