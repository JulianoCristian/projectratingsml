Enterprise\n            Sector Adjustment Loan Credit Project will support the\n            Government's sector reform program, to accelerate\n            private sector growth, by strengthening the banking system,\n            and improving the quality of bank inter-mediation. In\n            addition, the project will enable an environment for private\n            sector growth, and, resolve, through privatization/financial\n            restructuring, or closure, the losses that preclude\n            enterprises to succeed within the private sector. The\n            project will foster job creation within the private sector,\n            supported by a strong financial system, and, it is expected\n            that the program would lead to a decline in the current\n            levels of nominal, and real interest rates, and to a\n            concomitant increase in domestic savings, and financial\n            sector inter-mediation, which would generate working\n            capital, and investment finance needed for private sector\n            modernization, and expansion. However, there is the\n            potential risk of an eventual weakening of political\n            commitment to resolve large loss-making enterprises; but,\n            the Social Support Project would partially mitigate this\n            risk, by financing severance payments among such\n            enterprises. Weak institutional capacity is another risk\n            which is to be mitigated by accompanying donor funded\n            technical assistance projects, and, the risk of renewed\n            regional instability is reduced by the recent political\n            events in the Former Yugoslavia."}, "docdt": "2000-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
