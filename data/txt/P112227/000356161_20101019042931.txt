  FIRST SUSTAINABLE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATION 1

                               SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                         Meeting of the Board of Executive Directors

                                      September 30, 2010


       Executive Directors approved the Sustainable Employment Development Policy
Operation 1 to the Republic of Kosovo (IDA/R2010-0280) in the amount of SDR 4.3 million in
IDA credit, associated with a trust fund-financed grant of EUR 11 million, and also to be
co-financed by donor funded grants. The minutes will reflect that Mr. Kvasov wished to be
recorded as abstaining.

        Directors supported the development objectives of the operation, noting its central role in
the Interim Strategy for Kosovo. They noted medium term risks on the fiscal front, and thus
welcomed the specific objectives to support macroeconomic stability through public financial
management and lay the institutional foundations for private sector growth to generate growth
and employment were seen as appropriate. Close donor collaboration and targeted capacity
building were seen as key to effective implementation.
       Directors wished the authorities well in pursuing the program's objectives.
