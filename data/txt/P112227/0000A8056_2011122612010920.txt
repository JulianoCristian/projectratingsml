                         SEDPO 1 was approved by the World Bank Board on September 30, 2010, but the governing coalition in Kosovo fell apart before the financing agreements were signed. New
                         elections were held on December 12, 2010, followed by some delay in forming a new governing coalition. The new government was formed and the financing agreements signed on

                         March 11, 2011. Two remaining steps remained before effectiveness and disbursement: (i) ratification by 2/3 of the Assembly of Kosovo of the financing agreements since they
                         require the country's taking on debt, and (ii) improvement in the macroeconomic framework. The ratification of the operation by the Assembly of Kosovo took place in May 2011. The
                         IMF Stand-By Arrangement which had been established in 2010 went off track during the election period. Subsequently, a Staff-Monitored Program was put in place and the
                         Government has complied with the recommendations of the Staff-Monitored Program to date. As such, the World Bank macro team judges the macroeconomic framework in Kosovo
                         to now be satisfactory. Regarding the reforms that the program supports, the Government has not remained idle while waiting for the improvements in the macroeconomic
                         framework, but has made steady and sustained progress in the areas of public financial management and sustainable employment. As a result, most of the actions considered
                         indicative triggers for SEDPO 2 and SEDPO 3 have already been completed.

                         effective and then to disburse soon after upon the Government's request.
