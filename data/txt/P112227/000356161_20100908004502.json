   Government of Kosovo in (a) maintaining a stable\n            macroeconomic framework while increasing the transparency,\n            accountability, and management of public expenditures, and\n            (b) laying the institutional and legislative foundations\n            Kosovo needs for sustainable employment and growth. At the\n            heart of Kosovo's ability to achieve inclusive\n            development and social stability lies the attainment of\n            employment-generating economic growth. Today, only three out\n            of ten Kosovo's of working age are employed-by far the\n            lowest employment rate in Europe. This is a result of\n            extremely low levels of labor force participation at 53\n            percent of the working age population, the lowest in Europe,\n            coupled with an extremely high rate of unemployment,\n            estimated at about 45 percent. The program would support\n            core structural reforms in Kosovo but with substantial\n            associated risks. There are substantial risks associated\n            with the implementation of the program as there would be in\n            any post conflict, fragile state, including (1) the dangers\n            of falling into macroeconomic instability, (2) spillover\n            effects of the global financial crisis, (3) fragility of\n            Kosovo's governance and political structures as\n            institutions of government are being developed, (4) limited\n            capacity in program implementation given the limited\n            experience, (5) delays in implementation of pay and grading\n            reform of core civil servants, and (6) difficulties in\n            maintaining a conducive framework for employment generation\n            given political demands for increased benefits. Improved\n            public financial management would help mitigate the\n            macroeconomic risks, including those related to the\n            financial crisis, as well as contribute to improving the\n            overall governance of public policies."}, "docdt": "2010-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
