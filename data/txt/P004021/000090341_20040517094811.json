The lessons learned indicate that the\n            project's objectives for restructuring of the power\n            sector for competition and private sector participation\n            along with major investments in physical infrastructure\n            would have been challenging under favorable circumstances\n            and could have been jeopardized by the economic crisis that\n            affected Indonesia and other Asian countries during 1997-98.\n            The restructuring of a power sector from a government-owned\n            monopoly to a competitive market system is likely to require\n            a long time, depending on the preparatory work to create the\n            necessary legal framework. Bank called attention to delays\n            due to extended procurement cycles and problems with land\n            acquisition for transmission projects. In addition, the SAR\n            cited the use of outdated cost estimates by Perusahaan\n            Listrik Negara (The State Electricity Corporation) PLN and\n            shortcomings in the performance of technical assistance\n            components due to limited absorptive capacity. The\n            mitigation measures the SAR proposed to deal with these\n            problems were the implementing agency's agreement to\n            use standardized procurement documents; the fostering of\n            \"ownership\" of the technical assistance by the\n            implementing units within PLN; and PLN's use of updated\n            prices in preparing cost estimates. Nevertheless, the\n            project experienced all of the implementation problems that\n            were supposed to be mitigated."}, "docdt": "2004-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
