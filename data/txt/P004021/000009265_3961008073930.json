reliability of the Java-Bali transmission\n            system and distribution network; and (2) promoting sector\n            efficiency, competition, and private sector participation by\n            implementing functional decentralization of State\n            Electricity Corporation (PLN) operations in Java-Bali and\n            developing effective regulatory oversight and institutions.\n            The project has two principal components: (1) the\n            restructuring of and investment in PLN's operations;\n            and (2) the development of regulatory oversight."}, "docdt":
