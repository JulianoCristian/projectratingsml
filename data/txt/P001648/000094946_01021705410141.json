 satisfactory. Key lessons learned include the following: The\n            project demonstrates the synergy betwee macroeconomic\n            stabilization and structural reforms: reaping the full\n            benefits of structural reform depends heavily on fiscal\n            discipline and avoidance of inflationary pressures. Careful\n            and extensive preparation, including a dtrong background of\n            economic and sector work, extensive collaboration with\n            government, consultation with stakeholders and coordination\n            with other suppliers of external assistance, and is a\n            necessary but not sufficient condition for execution of\n            complex adjustment. Restructuring of the government, the\n            civil service and the budget must have political leadership\n            and be based on decisions about the future role of the\n            public sector. Attempting to introduce a new system of\n            expenditure prioritization and budget allocation by\n            superimposing it on an existing, inadequate budgeting system\n            is not likely to be successful. Including technical\n            assistance components in adjustment operations invariably\n            results in closing well after disbursement of\n            performancerelated tranches, and delays ICR preparation,\n            thus reducing the ICR's influence on shaping future\n            operations. This can be remedied by making the technical\n            assistance a separate credit."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
