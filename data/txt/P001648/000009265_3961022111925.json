assist Malawi to attain its economic\n            objectives and succeed in alleviating the country's\n            pervasive poverty problem, the Fiscal Restructuring and\n            Deregulation Program Project will aim to: 1) prioritize,\n            protect and, where necessary, expand inter-sectoral and\n            intra-sectoral allocations to the social sectors on a\n            sustainable basis while staying within the overall fiscal\n            framework now being monitored under the IMF's Enhanced\n            Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program; and 2)\n            accelerate the consolidation of structural measures already\n            initiated by the government of Malawi under previous\n            adjustment operations. This will include complete removal of\n            remaining pricing and marketing constraints on smallholder\n            agriculture, and removal of the biding constraints to\n            broad-based private sector entry and development. The\n            project will have the following components: 1) fiscal\n            restructuring which involves public spending reorientation,\n            restoring of fiscal discipline, civil service reform, and\n            tax and tariff reforms; 2) deregulation of agricultural\n            policies including access to land, access to cash crops,\n            access to inputs, access to markets, and access to economic\n            transport; and 3) deregulation of private sector development\n            policies comprising investment promotion, deconcentration\n            and privatization."}, "docdt": "1996-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
