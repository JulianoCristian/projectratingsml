                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is progressing well and it is likely that its development objectives will be achieved with the establishment of a modern SCADA/EMS system. Procurement on the project is
                         advanced with key equipment delivered and most installation completed. It should be noted that the benefits of the SCADA/EMS system only start when the system is fully installed
                         and into operation. In this case, it will be after the project is completed.
