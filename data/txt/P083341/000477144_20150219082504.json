received a satisfactory outcome rating with\n            moderate risk to development outcome. The Bank received a\n            satisfactory performance rating while the Borrower received\n            a moderately satisfactory outcome rating. One restructuring\n            took place during this project. The closing date was\n            extended by one year. While significant progress had been\n            made, with implementation of the Supervisory Control and\n            Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, additional time was\n            required for completion of the remaining tasks to enable to\n            system to become fully operational. Four key lessons were\n            taken from this project and they are as follows: (1)\n            Government commitment to reform is essential and needs to be\n            maintained to ensure sustainability of the Project outcomes.\n            The Government\u0092s stance on financial reforms was crucial to\n            achieving PDOs. (2) The difficulty of introducing modern\n            SCADA/ Energy Management System (EMS) must not be\n            underestimated with respect to complexity, unexpected\n            developments during installation and implementation time.\n            (3) Commitment and strong Project ownership by an\n            implementing agency is critical. During the life of the\n            Project, Azerenerji went through a process of a dramatic\n            transformation: from a Soviet-type state-owned utility to a\n            corporatized public entity. (4) Close bank supervision and\n            continuity of staff is essential for a successful project\n            implementation. Introduction of SCADA/ EMS, in parallel with\n            energy sector reforms, is a complex, multifaceted\n            undertaking and requires more than normal Bank supervision."}, "docdt": "2012-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
