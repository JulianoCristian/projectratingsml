"The project is intended to address many\n            of the basic issues now facing Korean agriculture including\n            the need to increase (i) production of high-value fruits and\n            vegetables, (ii) farm productivity, and (iii) off-season\n            employment. Over a four-year period, the project would\n            provide credit for a wide range of activities, notably:\n            greenhouses, sprinkler irrigation, on-farm storage, chilled\n            storage, spraying equipment, small-scale agroprocessing, and\n            backyard livestock. The project activities would cover the\n            whole country and directly benefit about 13,700 farmers and\n            124 cooperatives."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
