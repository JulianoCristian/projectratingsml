SUBJECTs    Project Completion Report on Ethiopia
Sixth Telecamwunicatio&s Project (Crredit 1509-ET1
Attached  is  the  "Project  Completion  Report  on  Ethiopia  -  Sixth
Telecommunications Project (Credit 1509-ET)" prepared by the Africa Regional
Office. No Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
The project, which was co-financed by Italy, Sweden and A£DB, was
essentially successful in supporting (i) the rehabilitation and expansion of the
country's telecommunication network (albeit with some delay due to the civil war)
and (ii) the consolidation of the institutional gains supported by the Bank since
the 1950's, making ETA one of the best-run telecommunication entities in Sub-
Saharan Africa. The experience under this project points to both the benefits
and the limits of the traditional public utility model (in as far as the sector
remained unable to meet a growing demand), and the need to consider alternative
(particularly private) funding sources for future sector development.
The project is rated satisfactory overall, its institutional impact
substantial and its sustainability likely. The Project Completion Report is
thorough and informative but no comments from cofinanciers were sought. No audit
is planned.

(CREDIT 1509-EI)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sixth Telecommunications Project in
Ethiopia supported by Credit 1509-ET. 'he Credit was approved by the Board on July 19, 1984.
Ibe Credit will be closed on June 30, 1993, after making two extensions at the request of the
Government of Edtiopia. lbe final Credit amount is projected at US$50.6 million and the final
disbursement Is expected to be made by October 31, 1993.
Parts I and m of the Report were prepared by the Public and Private Enterprise Division of
the Easern Africa Department, Africa Region based on information available in the project fles and
information supplied by the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority. A draft of this PCR was sent
for comment to the Borrower (the Government of Ethiopia) and the implementing agency (Ethiopian
Telecommunications Authority).

SIXTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIr 1509-El-)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
PRtWo r ORjErvEs
1.    This project was implemented by the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority (ETA) which
had previously implemented five Bank/IDA lending operations. The major objectives of the project
were to : overhaul and upgrade existing plant as needed for adequate service level and optmm
usefilness; expand the national network with particular emphasis on traffic handling capacity and
support of rural development; improve international lInks; and automate the services at, and between,
all 14 regional capitals and about 10 of the economically most important other cities.
PRWECt IMPLEMENTATION
2.    The project was to have been completed by the end of FY91. However, during pioject
implementation period, Ethiopia was undergoing a long and devastating civil war. Ihe adverse
countty conditions resulted in delays directly, through loss/misplacement of project materia being
delivered from the port of Assab, and indirectly, through the scarcity of raw materias, fuel and
foreign exchange which in turn disrupted construction of buildings housing exchanges and microwave
repeater statons, access roads and other civil works associat(4 with cable laying. Considering the
adverse country cinditions that existed, overall implementation of the physical components of the
project has been satisfactory.
PIiWECr RESULS
3.    Physical implementation, though delayed, was otherwise largely successful as shown below.
Financial performance was good; projected financial and economic rates of return were achieved.

4.    Three technical assistance studies were implemnented under the project (i.e. a tariff study, an
asset revaluatlon study and an Electronic Data Processing study); the recommendations of these
studies were not completely implemented and- consequently insttutional strengthening was not
completely achieved.
PROJECr SUSTAINABILirY
S.    The project has resulted in the installation of assets which have accommodated a customer
base expansion of about 50%. With proper management, these assets are expected to generate
enough revenues, given the current tariff levels, for reinvestment in the maintenance of the network
with some resources left over for moderate expansion. The project was instrumental in the
establishment of systems which would facilitate appropriate review of tariffs and valuation of assets.
Much progress has also been made in the introduction of computerized Management Information
Systems which are used for timely managerial decision making. The training program undertaken
during the project has resulted in the availability of trained technicians to operate and main  the
assets. The long-term performance of the assets wfll depend on the assured availability of spare parts,
which have to be procured using foreign currency. Thus, as in some other core mfrastructure
activities, the sustainability of the benefits accrued from the project wil depend on the macro
economic performance of the country as a whole.
CONCLSONS
6.    The following are the major points useful for consideration in odier Bank projects:
(a)    When the project started, supply lagged demand by a factor of two and when the
project ended, despite the large increase in telephone lines, the shortall was still of a
similar magnitude. The telecommunications sector has large investment requirements
and it is unlikely that by themselves, multilateral institutons, bilateral donors and the
Government would be able to meet the growth in demand in Ethiopia. Serious
consideration should now be given to increasing private participation in service
provision and in encouraging the commercialization of ETA. IMA has commenced a
dialogue in this context as a necessary condition for participating in the next
telecommunications lending operation in Ethiopia.
(b)    Project covenants should be designed in the light of institutional structures, systems
and procedures. Where the institutional capacity is lacking, institutional stregthening
either prior to or in the early stages of the project should be important requirements
and should itself be a monitorable activity or covenant. In this project, IDA correctly
identified the areas requiring Institutional strengthening (e.g. computization, tariff
policy development). However, the project did not incorporate specific monitorabae
actions that would be required as part of the covenants. Consequently, non-
implementation of institutional strengthening measures resulted in non-compliance
with project covenants. For example, there were explicit linkages between the state of
computerization of the Management Information System of ETA and its ability to
meet the covenants regarding (i) preparation of draft financial statements within three
months and (ii) conducting periodic asset revaluation either for inclasion in finmcial
statements or for memorandum purposes. Ihe delay in computerization was largely
responsible for ETA's inability to meet the above covenants.

2.    BACKGROUND
2.1         The Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority (ETA) is the sole provider of public
telecommunications services in Ethiopia including national and international telephone, telegraph and
telex. It also provides various special services including leasing of circuits for specific non-public
usage. It is a share company fully owned by the Government and established by Proclamation No.
131 of 1952. ' ETA is headed by a General Manager who is the Chief Executive and a member of
the Board of Directors. He is responsible for carrying out the directives of the Board, whose ex-
officio Chairman is the Minister of Transport and Communications. In addition to operating
finctions, ETA undertakes regulatory functions (including frequency management) and represents
Ethiopia in its dealings with international telecommunications organlza:ons.
2.2         The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector in Ethiopia for over
forty years and has funded five earlier projects (Table 1). At the commencement of the Bank's
involvement in 1951, there was no separate telecommunications entity and no sufficiently
experienced nationals were available to set up and run it effectively. The first loan assisted in the
establishment of a telecommunications entity, the establishment (with UN assistance) of a permanent
training institution and the rehabilitation and expansion of the physical network. Ihe second loan
provided technical assistance for strengthening the organization and administration of ETA and
training of sufficient nationals to phase out expatriate staff and in the construction of a modern
telecommunications networlk The third and fourth loans and the fifth credit funded the foreign
exchange requirements of time slices of ETA's capital investment program and continued with the
strengthening of ETA's technical capacity. By the sixth project, ETA had become one of the best
run telecommunications entities in Sub-Saharan Africa with the manpower capacity to plan and
implement a large investmnent program.
At the time of its establishment, ETA was called the "Imperial Board of Telecommunications
of Ethiopia".

3.    PRozET OuEcrim  AND DESCRIPTION
3.1         Sector Development Objectives. In the country's development objeives, the
tlecommunicatlons sector had been assigned two objectives. First, to suppor national economic
development by providing required service to agriculture, industry, trade, urism and other sectrs.
Second, to asist In Implementing national soeW goals, particularly in the fields of health and
education. The Govemment of Ethiopia set growth rate targets of 10% per annum for
telecommunications services so as to enable a rapid expansion of the network over the whole national
territory. The plan was for aI important administrative centers in the country and imporant centers
for agriultural and Industrial development to be able to communicate with Addis Ababa and with
regional and district centers.
3.2          Project Objectives. The project funded a portion of the Investment ptogram which
formed a part of ETA's Sixth Development Program. The project objectives were to:
(a)    overhaul and upgrade existing plant as needed for adequate service level and optimum
usefulness;
(b)    expand the national network with particular emphasis on traffic bandling capacity and
support of rural development;
(c)   improve intemational links;
(d)    automate the services at, and between, all 14 regional capitals and about 10 of the
economically most important other cities;
(e)    use modern technology in its new Installations;
(t)    draw the technical and cost advantages of international competitive bidding In its
procurement;
(g)    expand the application of ETA's in-house computer for management and
administration;
Oh)   fiuther develop and train staff, with emphasis on existing staff; and
(t) institutionalize measures for service grade improvements and for studies to evaluate
cost-aving features.
3.3         Project Description.
The main components of the project were:
(a)    extension of the national telecommunications network, with regular services to about
100 unserved locations, as well as connection of about 40 new remote places with
radio call service;



3
(b)   construction of about 14 new broadband long-distance transmission finks and
increasing the capacity of the existing ones;
(c)   addition of about 62,000 automatic and 5,000 manual switching lines and about 5,300
inter-office junctions;
(d)   expansion of the local cable networks by about 180,000 pair kcm and connection of
about 45,000 new telephone subscribers;
(e)   expansion of international services by installing a standard B earth satellite station for
direct links with countries served by the Indian Ocea region satellite, increasing
satellite circuits on the existing standard A earth satellite station and installation of a
600 line international digital SPC exchange with toll ticketing facilities;
(f)   addition of various auxiliaries for improved operation and maintenance of existing and
new Installations; and
(g)   provision of consultancy services for institutional development and of staff training in
managerial, operationad, administrative and engineering disciplines.
Some changes were made during project implementation primarily on account of increased traffic
on specific routes and the need to change from analog to digital technologies (Table 5).
4.    PROjECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
4.1         In 1980, ETA prepared the Sixth Telecommuniatons Development Program for the
period FY82-86; this program was approved by Government in 1981. Implementation was to
commence in FY82 and, in June 1981, the Minister of Finance requested IIDA to fund the foreip
currency portion. Due to funding constraints, IDA was not at the time in a position to respond
favorably to the request. In view of IDA's non-involvement, other multi-lateral and bilateral sources
were reluctant to provide funding. Hence, implementation was delayed. In January 1983, at the
time of project appraisal by IDA, ETA updated the sixth program by making minor revisions to the
program primnarily in demand and capital cost estimates.
4.2          The design of the physical components of the program were fully endorsed by the
Bank, reflecting the long experience ETA has had with the design of Bank financed projects. The
program was prepared at a time when the industry was rapidly phasing out the old analog technology
in favor of the new digital technology. In hindsight, more attention should have been given during
the initial planning to the viability of expanding systems using the old technology which would be
subject to a rapid phasing out. Such changes were eventually required during implementation
(Table 5).
4.3         ETA's proposed Technical Assistance Component consisted mainly of training of
technical staff, This underwent substantial modification as studies and management systems
strengthening were added on by the Bank. The changes made by the Bank were well understood by
ETA; the earlier exclusion of such studies by ETA merely reflected the lower priority accorded to
investments in institutional development as compared to investments in the mainstream technological
training.

4.4         Negotiations between the Government of Ethiopia and IDA were concluded in
February 1984, the project was approved by IDA's Board in July 1984, and the Credit was signed in
December 1984 (Table 2).
5.    PROJEcr IMPLEMErrATION
5.1         Project Start-up. ITere were two conditions of credit effectiveness:
(a)    ETA and the Government were to sign a subsidiary loan agreement specifying the
terms for onlending of the credit from the Goverment to ETA (12% Interest rae and
period of 20 years including 5 year of grace); and
(b)   Conditions precedent to loan effectiveness from the co-financiers (i.e African
Development Bank, Italy and Sweden) were to be fulfilled.
These conditions were fulfilled by March 1985 which is when the credit became effective.
5.2         Initial tender documents for switching and transmission equipment were issued In
April 1984; the plan was for contracts to be signed in early 1985 although they would not become
effective until after the effective date of the credit. In fact, since bid evaluation and contracting took
longer than esdmated at appraial, contracts became effective in August/September 1985. Better
preparation prior to project commencement (e.g. engineering analysis, preparation of tender
packages) could have provided substantial time savings in the implementation schedule.
5.3         For the first time, the project implementation was coordinated by a special project
coordinating group which consisted of staff from Engineering, Operations and Finance and Supply
Departments. This arrangement worked well and resulted in considerable improvement in project
implementation over earlier projects. It also assisted in pinpointing institutional weaklesses In the
planning, procurement and project management prcsses; this led to subsequent strengthening and
restructuring of the Engineering and Operations Department and the Planning Office.
5.4         Implementation Schedule. The project was to have been completed by the end of
FY91. However, during the project implementation period, Ethiopia was undergoing a long and
devastating civil war. The adverse country conditions resulted in delays directly, through
loss/misplacement of project material being delivered from the port of Assab, and indirectly, through
the scarcity of rawn materials, fuel and foreign exchange which in turn disrupted construction of
buildings housing exchanges and microwave repeater stations, access roads and other civil works
associated with cable laying. Considering the adverse country conditions that existed, overall
implementation of the physical components of the project has been satisfactory.
5.5         The only item under the project not eventually contracted was procurement of the
main frame computer which was delayed for various reasons. Initialy, ETA wanted to procure the
equipment through direct negotiations; this was not acceptable under IMA procurement guidelines.
Subsequently, an international tender was evenalaly issued but on evaluation, ETA concluded that
none of the suppliers had fully complied with the software requirements and ETA re-bid after
obtaining IDA's clearance. The revised bid documents were re-issued in October 1990; ETA
evaluated the revised bids but did not submit the evaluation report to IDA because the remaining
funds were not adequate to cover the cost of the computer (hardware and software). The urgency



S
for the ompur has now been reduced by the upgrading of the exitng old IBM system 34 to
system 36 using ETA's own funds.
5.6         Project Costs. The total estimated cost of the project at the time of appraisal was
about US$151.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$104.5 million. All
local costs and US$2.1 million of the foreign exchange component were to be met by ETA. The
remaining foreign exchange component was financed from the following sources:
(a)   credit of SDR38.7 million (US$40 million equivalent at the then conversion rate of 1
SDR   1.03409 US$) from IDA;
(b)   loan of US$25 million from the Republic of Italy;
(c)   loan of UA24.03 million (US$25.4 million equivalent) from the African Development
Bank (AfDB); and
(d)   loan of US$12 million from the Government of Sweden.
At completion of the project, the projected costs are expected to amount to US$174.8 million (15%
over the estimated costs). Of this, US$:O.6 million (6%) is due to the appreciation of the SDR
relative to the dollar wbich Increased the SDR 38.7 million IDA credit from about US$40 million at
the start of the project to an estmated $50.6 million. Except for the computer, more equipment was
procured than planned originaly. Equipment costs for the Bank financed portior -ere very
competitdve due to the use of Internaional Competitve Bidding procedures. Tabte 3 compares
original estimates and actual project expenses.
5.7         Commitments. As of December 31, 1991, the original closing date, the loan from
taly, AfDB and Sweden were all fully committed. By December 1992, the IDA Credit was 99%
committed with about US$383,135 remaining for the purchase of spare parts, network accessories,
and personal computers. The IDA Credit is expected to be fully committed by the end of June 30,
1993.
5.8         Disbursements. As of October 31, 1992, the loan from Sweden was 100%
disbursed, and the loans from the Italy and the AfDB were over 99% disbursed. All the above loans
are expected to be filly disbursed by June 30, 1993. The IDA credit is 96% disbursed and
disbursements are expected to be completed by October 31, 1993 (Table 4).
5.9         Project Risks. The project risks evaluated at the time of appraisal were:
(a)   possible delays In acquiring inputs to various project elements. This was not
considered serious since ETA had adequately planned the project, prepared project
and tender documents, had sufficient institutional capacity to implement it and the
availability of local counterpart funds was one of the financial covenants. The SAR
states that civil works were either already available or were at an advanced stage of
construction which is not borne out by the implementation experience;



6
(b)   foreigl exchange risks had been adequately provided for in the price contingencies.
This is borne out by the actual project costs being within estmates; and
(c)   consequences of any possible damage to equipment was m"nsidered small given wide
dispersal of equipment throughout the country; fiuerd  Insurmce coverage was
considered satisfactory.
It would have been difficult to foresee the magnitude of the civil war at the time of project
appras.

a/    Includes lines in Eritrea. For comparison of financial results, from FY92 onwards, lines in
Eritrea are excluded since no revenues are eamed nor operating costs incurred for them.
Major variances from projections are on account of factors described below:
(a)    Direct Exchange Lines (DELS) were 6% above appraisal estimates as better use of
installed capacity was made over the original plan. Commencing in FY92, the lines
in Eritrea do not generate any revenues for ETA and no operating costs are incurred
for their maintenance. Hence, for financial forecasting purposes, only 131,000 lines
have been used.
(b)    The target for fault rates has not been achieved due to: lack of foreign exchange for
purchasing spare parts and chronic damage to underground cables by other utilities.
(c)    Local and interurban call completion performance is considered to be good although
lower than appraisal estimates which appear to be too ambitious. The good

performance has resulted from the installat;.on of new telephone exchanges.
International call completion rates have also improved from the installation and
retrofiting of satellite earti stations which has also enabled ETA to introduce
International Subscriber Dialing.
Technical Assistance Studies (Table 6, page 2)
6.2         Tariff Study:  Ihe consultants made a broad range of recommendations including
change in the structure and level of domestic tariffs and reduction in international tariffs. ETA
agreed with the recommendations of the consultants but emphasized the need to bring about the
changes gradually taking into account existing country conditions. Implementation of tariff changes
has been slow (para 6.11).
6.3         Asset Revaluation: The consultants developed an econometric model for stimating
the value of assets for future revaluation, trained ETA staff in the use of the model, identified
shortcomings in the property records and inventory policies and contol and made recommendadons
including reconciling the inventories. ETA then formed a project team to take a complete physical
inventory. The task was completed for the Central Region; work in the other regions was
interrupted by country conditions but has now been resumed. Lack of revaluation data has impacted
the ability to monitor compliance with financial covenants (refer para 6.8(a)).
6.4         Electroic Data Processing (EDP): The consultants reviewed ETA's needs for EDP
and idendfied areas that needed to be computerized. Ihe consultants recommended that the existing
accountng and EDP systems needed to be revised and up-graded before any computerization and this
would need a total of 204 man-months, which was far higher than the 22 man-months estimated at
appraisal. ETA decided to carry out the task by itself with taining from the consultants. Ihe
consultant spent 4 man-months to evaluate ETA's training needs and the equivalent of the remaiing
18 man-months was, with IDA approval, spent on training 11 staff members in Sweden. ETA
prepared a project document for the design and implementation of a new computerized analytical
accounting and supply system. Application programs for accounts receivable, accounts payabia,
bank reconciliation, staff accounts, stock control (for selected stores) and customer services (for
selected branches) are under implementation and projected to be completed by the end of FY93.
The programs are being implemented on personal computers; per the current schedule, the modules
in the current system will be integrated beginning in 1994. The slower pace of computerization has
impacted ETA's ability to meet covenants regarding production of annua financial statements (refer
para 6.14).
Filnandal Performance (Table 7 pages 1 to 3, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10)
6.5         The financial performance had been forecast at two levels : the financial return on the
project and the financial performance of the implementing agency i.e. ETA. At the time of
appraisal, the project's financial rate of return had been calculated at 13.0%. As can be seen in
Table 9, the program costs were largely in the same range as had been projected. The revenues
would be significantly lower over the twenty year horizon (over 300 million Birr) due to slower
implementation of the project and, starting in FY92, the lines in Eritrea which in turn led to lower
than expected growth in traffic. However, ETA was successful in containing costs (almost 265
million Birr less than original projections) and, consequently, the actual financial rate of return at
12.7% was very close to that projected.



8
6.6          The economic rate of return had been projected at over 34% with the difference over
the financial rate of return coming largely from an assumption that the benek to users would be
measured by their willingness to pay the same real level of tariffs as were charged In FY84.
Consequendy, the economic benefits (i.e. revenue streams) were estimated to increase at
approximately 90% of the projected annual price increases (10% lower than the general CPI
ineases, attributed to Improvements in technology). The acul economic rate of return at 31.6%
was within a close range of the projection.
6.7         The economic and financial benefits generated by the project are sustnable. Based
on the benefits generated to-date and the possible changes in benefit streams fom FY93 unti the end
of the project (as noted in Table 8), It would continue to generate positive benefit streams even with
a 10% increase in costs or a 10% decrease in revenues from FY93 onwards:
(a)    A 10% increase in operaming costs from FY93 onwards would reduce the fnaial
rate of return from 12.7% to 10.5%. The probability of increased operaig cot
without commensurate revenue increases Is low since ETA has demonstated Its ability
to contain costs in line with revenue growth.
(b)    A 10% decrease in the revenue strems from FY93 onwards would reduce the
projected financial rate of return to 5%. In fact, such a large nominal decrease is
unlikely to occur since ETA has requested increases In international tariffs to partialy
compensate for the recent devaluation of the Dirr.
6.8         ETA's financial performance had been appraised from the perspective of generadng
sufficient cash flow to meet two major requirements (which were incorporated as finmcial
covenants):
(a)    Rate of Return of at least I1I% on net revalued fixed assets. It is difficult to judge if
the covenant was actually met since ETA has not revalued the fixed assets in its
annial fmancial statements nor maintained any memoradum records to assist such
calculations (see para 6.3). ETA's rate of return on the historical value of net fixed
assets ranged between 20-30% per annum.
(b)    Government and ETA would take all necessary measures to ensure that local find
requirements of the next fiscal year's investment progrm would be made available in
the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Part of the requirements were to come from
internal cash generation which was projected to vary from between 30 to 245% (as a
percentage of the construction program). In fact, due to delays in project
implementation, internal cash generation ratios were better than expected in fte earlier
FYs and worse in the later FYs. There were no implementation delays due to lack of
counterpart funding.
6.9         A major financial constraint which had not been identified at appraisal was the
availability of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts. Despite earning substantial foreign
exchange for the country, ETA was subject to the same foreign exchange controls and shortages as
all other enterprises.



9
6.10        In general, ETA has eamned a somewhat lower revenue than projected at appraisal. It
has, however, managed to control the growth in its operating costs to match the slower than
projected growth in revenues as shown in the Table below:
Indicator                           At Project         Projected at   Acta
Commencement       completion
Average Telephone Revenue Per DEL     905                1393         1343

Average Cost Per DEL (in Birr)        398                565          423
Oprating Ratio                                           70%          66%
6.11        Two key financial ratios have diverged from projections : first, the current ratio has
been affected by the requirement, up to FY92, that ETA should irn over a substantial portion of its
surplus to Government and, second, because ETA bears the foreign exchange risk on its debt, the
debt service ratio would be seriously affected by the recent large (140%) devaluation of the Birr if
the requested tariff increases are not approved.
(a)    Under the law existing up to FY92, ETA (and all other state owned enterprises) had
to turn over all retained earnings in excess of 30% of capital to Government. Ihere
was a slight modification in that, per the covenant for the project, ETA was allowed
to retain profits needed to fund local fund requirements for the investment program
for the next fiscal year. 21 As a result of the sum payable to Government, by
FY87, the current ratio had deteriorat.ed to 0.92 and continued to deteriorate with a
slight improvement in FY92 but it still remained below the critical level of 1. This is
well below the projected value of 1.5 to 2.3.
(b)   Debt service coverage was estimated at appraisal between 3.3 in FY84 declining to
2.2 in FY89 as the long-term debt on account of the investment program increased.
The ratio was met in the earlier FYs as debt load increased slower than expected due
to slower implementation. By FY89, it had dropped below 2 and remained at about
1.9 subsequently. By FY92, this improved to 2.01. In FY93, the devaluation of the
Birr led to a substantial increase in the Birr value of the long-term debt which is
denominated in dollars. The debt service coverage would have deteriorated had ETA
not moved quickly to restore the internal cash generation by requesting tariff increases
which will, if approved by Government, restore the debt service coverage ratio to
about 2.8.
2 Due to this covenant, the actual sum payable had to be determined by ETA in consultation
with Government. During this period of negotiation, which lasted several years, this liability
was not recognized in the financial statements. Finally, in FY91, the amounts were
determined and a current liability recognized for funds payable to Government (some 84
million Birr); ETA's lack of liquidity precluded any actual payments to Government. The
numbers presented in this PCR are restated from FY87 onwards to take into account the
liability recognized in FY91.



10
6.12        Tariffs. Since the commencement of the project, tariffs have been increased only
once, effective August 1, 1990, when the call dharges for both local and Interurban calls were
increased by about 17% to off-set payments of new sales tax levied on ETA for all goods and
services obtained locally. Recently, ETA has submitted a proposal for revising tariff to the
Government. Ihe proposal recommends an increase in the metered telephone call charges from 0.14
Birr to 0.17 Birr and an Increase in outgoig intemnational call rates by 50% to adjust for the
devaluaion of thte Birt (by some 140%). Together with proposals for a general increase in levels,
ETA is proposing to reduce international telephone and telex tariff zones from 35 to 11 and 8 to 7,
respectively.
6.13        Billing and Collection. At appraisal, it was esimated that accounts due from
subscribers would improve from 33% of gross revenue to 20% by FY89. This estmate was largely
achieved by FY89 and continued in FY90. However, in FY91 and FY92, it deterioratd to over
30% or 110 days of receivables largely due to the prevailing country conditions.
Accounts and Audits
6.14        Actounts: Ihe finmcial accounts were to be closed in three months and audited
satements sent to DDA within six months of the close of the fiscal year. There have been continued
delays in preparation of draft accounts. These have been partly due to circ es outside ETA's
control i.e. country condidons. However, the main contributing factor has beena compon
of ETA's financial accounting and management information systems has not progressed as far as had
been assumed at the time of appraisal (refer para 6.4). Given the existing state of compu n,
ETA's performance has been commendable.
6.15        Audits: Further to delays in the preparation of accounts, audits have been delayed by
the Audit Services Corporation (ASC) which is a state owned corporation vested with the
responsibility of auditing all accounts of state owned enteprises. ETA has expressed its concerns on
the delays by ASC and ASC has promised to expedite the auditing in future. Recently, a
proclamation by the Govermment allows the Auditor General to employ private auditors for the
audits. However, all the accounts have still got to pass through his office and it is for him to decide
whether a private auditor should be employed.
7.    PROJO cr SUSTAINDUATY
7.1         The project has resulted in the installation of assets which have accommodated a
customer base expansion of about 50%. With proper management, these assets are expected to
generate enough revenues, given the current tariff levels, for reinvestment in the maintenance of the
network with some resources left over for moderate expansion.
7.2         The project was instrumental In the establishment of systems which would faciitate
appropriate review of tariffs and valuation of assets. Much progress has also been made in the
introduction of computerized Management Information Systems which are used for timely managerial
decision making. The taining program undertaken during the project has resuted in the availability
of trained technicians to operate and maiitain the assets.
7.3         The long-term performance of the assets will depend on the constant availability of
spare parts which have to be procured using foreign currency. Thus, as in some other core



11
infrastructure sectors, the sustainability of the benefits accrued from the project will depend on th
macro economic performance of the country as a whole.
8.    BANK PERFORMANCE
8.1         The overal Bank performance In the telecommunications sector In geral and
specificaly In this project has been good and the Bank worked closdy with ETA to resolve
Implemention problems. The Bank identified basic instituional weaknesses In ETA (ornization
structure, tariff policy and lack of computerization) during preparation and appraisal and targeted
these areas to be included under te project. The Bank supervised the project at least once a year
with a total of 10 supervision missions.
9.    BORROWER PERFORMANCE
9.1         ETA is one of the best run telecommunications authorities In Sub-Saharan Africa.
Despite trying country conditions, it has maintained its network at a reasonable level of performance.
It also prepared a comprehensive Investment program for consideration by all interested donors.
There was good project implementation and coDntuous monitoring of project comonents was
undertaken with suitable modifications made in the project design e.g. where traffic was higher than
initial projections, digital circuits were introduced sooner than programmed. ETA's weaknesses lie
in Its institutional capacity In the peripheral functions (i.e. business planning, financial management,
purchasing and inventory, etc.) where not enough management attention has been focused in the
past.
10.   PROJECT RELATIONSI
10.1        The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower was maintined at an excellent
level. The commonality of objectives (i.e. to strengthen the provision of telecommunications
services) was well understood and, given the Bank's long involvement in the sector, its advice was
always well received. The Bank also maintained good relationships with the Government and other
donors.
11.   CONSULTING SERVICES
11.1        Consultancy Services under the project included Tariff Study, Revaluation of Fixed
Assets and Electronic Data Processing (EDP). All the tasks were undertaken by SWEDTEL of
Sweden and have been completed satiscorily as described in pam 6.1(c), 6.2, para 6.3 and para
6.4 and Table 6, page 2.
12.   PRoJECr DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
12.1        The Staff Appraisal Report and the Legal Agreements for the project provided a good
framework for monitoring project implementation (see Table 10 for project covenants). Targets set
were generally realistic based on the assumptions at appraisal and variances therefrom were
explainable. The supervision missions were well documented and data relevant to PCR preparation
was readily available. The Borrower also provided thorough status reports.

13.   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The following are the major points that are useful for consideration in other Bank projects:
(a)    When the project started, supply lagged demand by a factor of two and when the
project ended, despite the large increase in telephone lines, the shortfal was still of a
similar magnitude. The telecommunications sector has large Investment requirements
and it is unlikely that by themselves, nmltilaterd institutions, bilateral donors and the
Government would be able to meet the growth in demand in Ethiopia. Serious
consideration should now be given to increasing private participation in service
provision and in encouraging the commercialization of ETA. IDA has commenced a
dialogue In this context as a necessary condition for partidcpating In the next
telecommunications lending operation in Ethiopia.
(b)   Project covenas should be designed in the light of institltional strucures, systems
and procedures. Where the institutional capacity is lacklug, instltutional strengthening
either prior to or In the early stages of the project should be important requirements
and should itself be a monitorable activity or covenant. In this project, IDA correctly
identified the areas requiring institutlonal strengthening (e.g. computization. tadff
policy development). However, the project did not Incorporate specific monitorable
actions that would be required as part of the covenants. Consequently, non-
implementation of institutional strengthening measures resulted in non-compliance
with project covenants. For example, there were explicit linkages between the state of
computerization of the Management Information System of ETA and its ability to
meet the covenants regarding (i) preparation of draft financial statements within three
months and (ii) conductng periodic asset revaluation either for inclusion in financial
statements or for memorandum purposes. The delay in computerization was largely
responsible for ETA's inability to meet the above covenants.

The following changes occurTed durng project Implemeto:
(a)    number of automatic subscriber lines to be Installed was Increased to 75,648 from
62,000 and junction circuits were increased by 1000 lines;
O)    routes origInly planed to be served by anague radio transmission systems were
changed to digtal systems and some low capacity routes provided with higher capacity
systems In order to cater to increra  In traffic forcass;
(c)    new telecommncatons service access points raised from 100 to 131 as a result of
itroduction of Digital Radio Multiaccess Subscriber System (DRMASS) to
supplement VHF and UHF links;
(d)    with its owt fimds, ETA upgaded the Addis Ababa-Nazareth-Dire Dawa-Harar
analogue microwave route (which was subject to frequent inrrpos with
consequent decline in service stndards) to a digital microwave system;
(e)    existg telex network was upgraded by installing 600 telex subscrber ines and trunk
ines;
(t)    with its own fuids, ETA itroduced a domestic satelite network and routes to Godle,
Humera and Mekele were included instead of the origia plan to Include them under
a low capacity radio system utilizing troposcater systems; and
(g)    a digital transmission system using circuit multiplication equipment (IDR/DCME) was
contracted in international satellite services to take advantage of possible space
segment savings.

3. Organizational Design Study    Completed      New organization structure developed and
implemented.
4. EDP Study                      Completed      Consultants recommended that existing acco
and EDP systems needed to be revised and upgraded
prior to computerization. Their estimate of 204
macmonths was much higher than 22 manmoots
estimated at appraisal. Consequently, the study
scope was changed and the consultants spent 4
months to evaluate ETA's training needs and the
equivalent of 18 maumonths was, with IDA
approval, spent an training 11 staff mnembers in
Sweden. This enabled ETA to prepare a project
document for design and implementation of a new
computerized aalytical accounting and supply
system.
