designed to increase the\n            availability of telecommunications services and improve\n            service quality to support economic growth in agriculture,\n            industry, trade and the social sectors.  In particular, the\n            proposed project will:  (a) extend the national\n            telecommunications network, with regular service to about\n            100 administrative and business centers not served at\n            present, as well as connect about 40 new remote communities\n            with radio call systems; (b) construct about 14 new\n            broadband long-distance transmission links and increase the\n            capacity of existing ones; and (c) add about 62,000\n            automatic and 5,000 manual switching lines and about 5,300\n            inter-office junctions.  The project will also; (d) expand\n            the local cable networks by about 180,000 pair-km and\n            connect about 45,000 new telephone and 250 new telex\n            subscribers'; (e) expand international exchange and\n            satellite transmission facilities; (f) provide equipment and\n            facilities to improve operation and maintenance of existing\n            and new installations; and (g) provide project-related\n            technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
