INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CCRPCRATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF THE BANK AND THE BOARD OF THE IFC ON A
PROPOSED LOAN BY THE BANK TO, AND INVESTMENT BY THE IFC IN,
THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF TURKEY (TSKB)
1.        I submit the following report and recamnmendations on (a) a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$25 million
to the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB), and (b) a proposed IFC
investment of LT 3,755,000 million (US$417,222) in the same company.
PART I. HISTCRICAL
2.        The Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) came into being
in June 1950 and is one of the oldest and largest development finance
companies to be assisted by the World Bank Group.    The Bank and IDA have
made the following loans and credits to, and IFC the following equity
investments in, TSKB since its inception:

3.        When TSKB's capital was doubled from Turkish lire 25 million to
50 million in the lattez part of 1963, IFC subscribed at 110 per cent of
par to 15,020 shares with a total par value of LT 7.5 million, or 15 per cent
cf TSKI3's share capital.  In 1967 TSKB increased its share capital from
LT 50 million to LT 65 million by a rights issue at a 35 per cent premium,
to which IFOC subscribed to 4,50O shares.  In September 1967 IFC sold 4,480
shares reducing its holdings to 11.6 per cent of the total.
4.        TSKB and the Turkish Government have requested Bank financing for
the next two years of TSKBTs lending.   The demand for funds from TSKB is
increasingly heavy, and, subject to the availability of funds, TSKB expects
to be able to increase its lending steadily.   It has been and continues to
be a profitable institution operated by competent management in accordance
with sound policies.   It has also made a contribution towiards the
development of a capital market by investing in equities and by revolving
its equity portfolio.   It has recently begun issuing and guaranteeing
industrial bond issues for some of its clients, and this represents a step
towards an increased investment banking role.   The Government wishes to
increase the level of private financing for industry and strongly supports
TSKB's expanded program of lending and its request for a Bank loan.   A
mission to appraise the project was in Turkey in July 1968.
5.        The pre-negotiating discussions and the negotiations on the
proposed loan took place in Washington from February 6 to 11, 1969, with
Mr. Bulent Yazici, Chairman of the Board, Mr. Resid Egeli, General Manager,
Mr. Ozhan froguz, Assistant General Manager, and Mr. Ibrahim Ongut, Economic
Adviser, representing TSKB, and with Mr. Ahmet Gul, Economic Counselor, and
Mr. Bedrettin Sarp, Technical Adviser, of the Turkish Embassy, representing
the Turkish Government.   Mr. Yilmaz Ergenekon of the State Planning
Organization of the Turkish Government also participated as an observer.

credits to Turkey as at January 31, 1969:

7.        Execution of most of the projects has been satisfactory.    Two
changes in the construction plans of the Second Cukurova Project were agreed
in 1966 and 1968, and the project is now scheduled for completion in 1971.
Progress with on-farm development under the Seyhan Irrigation Project, which
had been disappointing until 1967, is now satisfactory.    An improvement in
the administration for implementing the project and an increase in agricult-:;:-
credit for the project area have recently been agreed with the Government.
8.        The Seyhan Irrigation Project - Stage II, consisting of a
$12 million Bank Loan and a $12 million IDA Credit, has been submitted
for consideration by the Exec,utive Directors on February 25, 1969.



9.        One more project is under consideration for FY 1969.   The
Cukurova Electric Company's Kadincik II hydroelectric station was appraised
in November/December 1968 with a view to a Bank loan or IDA credit of about
$11.5 million.
10.       IFC has made and has under consideration other investments in Turkey.
In July 1966 IFC invested nearly $1.L million, jointly with TSKB, in a loan
and shares for the expansion of a synthetic yarn factory (SIFAS).   Proposals
now under consideration include a paper project and a supplementary investment
in SIFAS.

PART III. THE PROJECT
12.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S."
(DB-44a dated February 17, 1969) on the proposed project is attached.
TSKB
13.       The establishment of a modern manufacturing sector is one of the
prime targets of the Second Five-Year Plan.    Industrial production is planned
to grow by about 11 per cent a year compared with a GNP growth rate of
7 per cent.   Total investment in the Second Five Year Plan in industry is
expected almost to double.   Priority will be given to industries with a high
input of technology, which is likely to involve investments with high
capital/output ratios and a large foreign exchange content.    During the
First Five-Year Plan, private sources accounted for 61 per cent of all
investments in manufacturing.   The Second Plan assumes a doubling of
industrial investment, with the same percentages for the private and public
sectors.
14.       TS.KB's objectives are to assist in the creation, expansion, and
modernization of private industrial enterprises through the provision of long-
term capital, to encourage local and foreign private capital participation
in its financing, and to assist in the development of a Turkish capital
market.   During the First Five Year Plan TSKB investments accounted for
about 12 per cent of total private investment and are expected to maintain
the same proportion of increased investment under the Second Five Year Plan.
15.       Of TSKB's share capital of LT 65 million ($7.2 million),
11.6 per cent is now held by IFC as stated in paragraph 3 above.    The
remainder is held almost entirely by Turkish shareholders, among them
commercial banks, insurance companies, and individuals.    The largest single
shareholder (20.8 per cent) is the Ig Bank, a commercial bank in which the
Government has a minority interest.   At a meeting held on December 26, 1968,
TSKB's Board decided to call an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on
February 24, 1969, to authorize an increase in TSKB's share capital by
LT 45.5 million through a one for two rights offering and a 20 per cent
stock dividend on the current holdings, bringing it to a total of LT 110.5
million.
16.       In the past, TSKB's earning performance has been good and has
further improved in the past two years.    In 1967 its net profit, after tax
and a sizeable allocation for possible losses, was equivalent to about
20 per cent of average net worth.   In 1968 its net profits reached about
22 per cent of average net worth, equivalent to about 42 per cent on its
share capital.   Since 1954 TSKB has paid a 12 per cent dividend yearly.



-6-
17.       Although TSKB has been sufficiently profitable to attract equity
capital, it remains dependent upon loan funds from either the Government or
foreign agencies.   In addition to the Bank Group financing referred to
above, it has borrowed abroad from the U.S. Development Loan Fund and AID,
the European Investment Bank, and from Kreditanstalt fIr Wiederaufbau.   As
of December 31, 1968, the resources available to TSKB, consisting of both
its own and borrowed funds, amounted to LT 5L8 million in local currency and
$88.6 million in foreign exchange.
18.       TSKB estimates its total needs for foreign currency in 1969 and
1970 to be about $70 million.   After taking into account the loans it expects
to obtain from other foreign lenders, TSKB anticipates that it could use the
proposed $25 million Bank loan to cover commitments for about one and one half
to two years.
19.       The main problem relating to a loan to TSKB at the present time
lies in the isolation of Turkish industry from outside competition behind
high protective barriers and with an overvalued exchange rate, with the result
that the long term economic viability of industrial investments is hard to
evaluate.   To deal with the obvious distortions in Turkish prices, TSKB is
making a special effort to evaluate the economic aspects of proposed projects
to assure the rational use of its resources, and to apply its funds to those
industrial enterprises which have the best prospects for long-term viability
in terms of international economic competitiveness.
20.       To this end, TSKB has reaffirmed its policy of financing economically
justified projects in industries having export potential.    It will submit to
the Bank its economic analyses and justifications not merely on projects above
the proposed free limit of $750,000 but also on all projects above $150,000
to which it intends to lend funds.   For smaller loans of under $150,000 a
summary of TSKB's economic justifications will be provided.    The Bank has
reviewed and reached an understanding with the Government and TSKB on the
principles and methods to be applied in the economic evaluation of project
proposals.
21.       Like TSKB, the State Planning Organization (SPO) is also interested
in ensuring the most economic application of investment funds and in
particular, scarce foreign exchange.   After some discussion, TSKB and SPO have
recently reached agreement that SP0 will approve projects under which
enterprises propose to borrow over $200,000 equivalent in foreign exchange
from TSKB, or which intend to seek the benefits of the Foreign Investment Law.
TSKB will exercise its own judgment wihether to lend thereafter.
22.       In view of the improvement in appraisal and follow-up activities,
and the understanding reached on the method of economic appraisal of all
projects, TSKB's free limit would be raised from $200,000 to $750,000 provided
that at least $17.5 million or 70 per cent of the value of sub-projects under
the proposed loan are submitted to the Bank for approval.



- 7 -
23.       In recent years TSIB has not pushed the collection of outstanding
claims very seriously, with the result that loans in arrears increased.
However, TSKB is now making a serious attempt to improve its collections.
The amount which has had to be written off is not serious, even if other
items are added which may appear troublesome in the future.    Moreover,
adequate provisions to cover possible losses have been created.
2h.       Under the present circumstances, we consider it appropriate to
lend to TSKB for a number of reasons.   There is both a sizeable need for
foreign exchange for industrial development and a number of suitable projects.
The Bank and IFC have had a long and close relationship with TSKB, and this
has strengthened TSKB's steadily improving efforts in a number of different
areas.   In general, management capabilities have increased substantially,
as have efforts at appraising and evaluating industrial projects.
25.       The proposed loan would be a conventional development finance
company loan to be repaid in conformity with the repayments received by
TSKB from its borrowers.   TSKB normally lends for periods averaging eight
to ten years and on occasion twelve years or more.    The proposed loan has
an initial amortization of fifteen years after the last disbursement.    The
other terms and conditions would be similar to those of recent Bank loans
to development finance companies, including a fixed interest rate and the
standard commitment charge.
26.       TSKB has a record of profitable operation, a sound financial
structure, and good prospects for continuing future growth.    It fulfills
an important role in the provision of long-term capital to private industry
in Turkey and can make good use of the additional resources which the Bank
loan would provide.
The IFC Investment
27.       The proposed IFC investment results from the exercise by the
Corporation of rights to subscribe to 7,510 shares of TSKB at a cost of
approximately $b17,222.   The subscription period is expected to be the
four weeks beginning February 24, 1969 when TSKB's shareholders are to
approve the capital increase.   The result of this investment and of the
receipt of the 20 per cent stock bonus referred to in paragraph 11 above
would be as follows:
No. of shares    Par value
Present Investment                            15,020       LT 7,510,000
Exercise of rights to subscribe to new
shares at par in the ratio of one new
share for each two held (LT 938,750 would       7,510       LT 3,755,000
be payable on subscription and the balance
as called)
20 per cent stock dividend                      3,004       LT 1,502,000
25,534       LT12,767,000



- 8 -
28.       In view of TS1KB's record of effective and profitable operations,
IFC in ordinary circumstances would have begun by now, in accordance with
its general policy, to dispose of at least part of its original holdings of
TSKB shares.   The original investment was made by IFC in 1963, following
Board approval on September 18, 1963.   A proposal to this effect was, in
fact, discussed with the Chairman of TSIK in the first half of 1966. Since
TSKB felt that the level of its operations warranted additional share
capital and in fact was planning for an increase during 1967, IFC was asked
not to reduce its holdings prior to the new issue and to exercise its rights
to the issue as a mark of support to TSKB.    In May 1967 IFC did subscribe
to 4,500 shares, at a price of 135 per cent of par, for a total cost of
$337,500 equivalent.   (The investment was approved by the IFC Board of
Directors on March 28, 1967.)    In September 1967, IFC was successful in
selling in Turkey 4,480 shares at a price of LT 950 per share (190 per cent
of par) for a total price of $472,889 equivalent.
29.       As on the previous occasion in 1967, the Corporation has considered
whether it should sell its rights prior to the offering.    However, TSKB
again requested that IFC exercise all of its rights as a demonstration of
IFC's continued confidence, and TSKB's Chairman has agreed to help IFC to
sell, after the increase, an appropriate portion of its holdings when market
conditions were suitable.   I conclude that the proposed exercise of rights
would contribute to the success of the new issue, would be a profitable
investment for IFC, and would be in the best interests of IFC and TSKB.
PART IV. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIORITY
30.       The Draft Loan Agreement (Fifth Industrial Development Bank Project)
between the Bank and Turkiye Sinai Kalkimna Bankasi A.S., the Draft Guarantee
Agreement betwieen the Republic of Turkey and the Bank, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors of the Bank separately.    The
Agreements incorporate the new General Conditions of the Bank.    The Resol-
ution approving the proposed investment by IFC is attached.
PART V. THE ECONOMY
31.       The report of the 1968 economic mission to Turkey entitled "The
Economy of Turkey" (No. EMA-4a) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on February 18, 1969.   It reappraises the country's economic situation in
the light of its performance under the First Five-Year Plan (1963-67) and
the problems and prospects faced in the period of the Second Five-Year Plan
(1968-1972).
32.       Turkey is clearly in need of large amounts of foreign assistarce
over the next few years if a serious interruption of economic development is
to be avoided.   However, the economic report points out that the provision



- 9 -
of foreign aid alone camnot bring about a lasting solution.    Although
economic progress has been substantial in recent years, Turkey seems to
have reached a juncture where major changes in basic policies are required
to bring about improvements of decisive importance for the longer term. In
these circumstances Turkey should continue for the next few years to receive
part of its aid on concessionary terms, including IDA credits.    However,
part of Turkey's needs for external capital can prudently be provided on
conventional terms and I consider Turkey creditworthy for the proposed loan.
PART VI. C014PLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed Bank loan would comply with the
requirements of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and that the proposed
IFC investment would comply with the requirements of the Articles of
Agreement of the Corporation.   In accordance with Article III, Section 3 (ii)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation, the Government of Turkey
has been notified of the proposed investment.
PART VII. RECOMIENDATIONS
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directiors of the Bank approve the
proposed loan.
35.       I recommend to the Board of Directors of the Corporation:
(a) That the proposed increase in the Corporation's investment
in TSKB be approved, conditional upon completion of the
necessary legal formalities.
(b) That the Board of Directors adopt a resolution in the form
attached.
