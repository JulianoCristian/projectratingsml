         managed health system, through the delivery of effective\n            services, stemming from policy reform, institutional, and\n            human resources development, in addition to investments in\n            health services. The two main components call for: 1)\n            developing a strategic management capacity, through\n            formulation, and review of health systems performance, and\n            the establishment of a drug policy, public-private\n            partnerships, and manpower activities, as well as pursuing\n            policy reform analysis, and research in the health sector.\n            In addition, accurate health management information systems\n            will be developed, and, managerial appraisal systems\n            implemented to improve actions concerning individual\n            performance, in addition to conducting management training\n            to enable critical project interventions in changing\n            management practices. The project management unit capacity\n            will be strengthened to coordinate and implement project\n            issues; and, 2) improving the quality of clinical practice\n            in public health services, and of access to health services.\n            Quality assurance systems will be introduced in an effort to\n            improve skills, and monitoring practices will ensure\n            adoption of best clinical practices through systematic\n            review of medical, and technical records. Programs and\n            services will focus on disease prevention, and health needs.\n            Both components include the financing of civil works,\n            equipment, and medical supplies, as well as training, and\n            consulting work as needed."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
