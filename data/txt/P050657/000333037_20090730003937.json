NAOKO OHNO", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) and\n            Uttarakhand (UK) Health Systems Development Project for\n            India were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: project design should confine\n            itself to interventions that can be controlled and\n            implemented by project authorities. Political decisions like\n            government financing of the health sector and transfer and\n            postings of staff should either be avoided or have stringent\n            monitoring mechanisms in place tied to disbursements in\n            order to be effective. In a project that has a large volume\n            of procurement of goods and equipment, this means that all\n            drawings, technical specifications, procurement plans and,\n            if necessary, a Procurement Agent with adequate experience,\n            are ready and in place before effectiveness. In the absence\n            of this, initial delays are inevitable. Developing systems\n            that provide quality care to the poorest involves a\n            multi-dimensional approach. There needs to be investment in\n            strategic planning, human resources, partnerships with all\n            available resources in the health sector, technical capacity\n            and other socio-economic and cultural factors that impact\n            demand for services. The approach taken during the\n            preparation of the follow-on operation is encouraging in\n            that it has brought all donor partners to the table, to have\n            a coordinated response to the needs of the states of UP and\n            UK. In addition, due to increased funding by National Rural\n            Health Mission (NRHM) to Indian states, new projects need to\n            take a holistic approach instead of a piecemeal one, looking\n            at the entire set of interventions focused on improving\n            health indicators in the state and funded by multiple\n            sources, to attain the biggest benefits. On the\n            institutional side, the Project Management Units (PMUs)\n            created for Bank projects get dissolved at the end of the\n            projects; thus rendering the expertise built through the\n            year's unusable post-closure. A long-term involvement\n            through appropriate lending instruments is imperative to\n            ensure stability and sustainability of institutions and\n            capacities built during the project period."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
