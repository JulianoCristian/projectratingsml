It reviews recent economic\n            developments, and progress of the project against the\n            release criteria, i.e., a satisfactory macroeconomic\n            framework, and substantial agriculture sector reform,\n            namely, reducing the fiscal outlays on agricultural\n            subsidies, facilitated by greater market deregulation\n            through reduction, and phasing out of state-set prices, and\n            reduced intervention purchases financed by the budget, while\n            in the grains sector, the Turkish Grain Board (TMO) reduced\n            its volume of intervention purchases. In the area of reform,\n            and privatization of SEES, the Government transferred all\n            state-owned sugar factories (SEKER) under the scope of the\n            privatization program, and the state tobacco company (TEKEL)\n            was included in the Privatization Administration's\n            portfolio. A substantial number of farmers in the 2003\n            Direct Income Support (DIS) Program, have been registered in\n            the National Registry of Farmers (NRF), meeting the tranche\n            release condition by a wide margin. In view of the overall\n            performance and progress described above, and in compliance\n            with the specific conditions of release of the second\n            tranche, availability of the adjustment portion of the Loan\n            has been informed, in the amount o f US$ lOO million."}, "docdt": "2004-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
