the General Conditions [in respect of expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds 
of the Loan allocated to said Categories], shall equal the equivalent of twice the 
amount of the Authorized Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of 
the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only
