In pursuing this objective, the Bank\n            and the Government agreed on an Agricultural Policy Paper in\n            April 2004. The principles and specific agricultural\n            policies agreed in this Agricultural Policy Paper have\n            recently been incorporated into the Government's draft\n            Framework Agricultural Law, which mandates their\n            implementation through a refined set of agricultural policy\n            instruments and investments over the period 2006-2010. The\n            restructuring of the ARIP's components directly\n            supports the implementation of a number of the agricultural\n            policy instruments and investments laid out in the Framework\n            Agricultural Law. To date, the investment support activities\n            offered farmers under the Farmers Transition component, have\n            been limited to tobacco and hazelnut farmers who choose to\n            switch out of these formerly supported crops. However, with\n            weak uptake of these ARIP-supported programs (for reasons\n            described below), the Government has requested that the\n            Farmers Transition component be broadened to include\n            activities aimed at supporting land consolidation of highly\n            fragmented farm holdings, village-based participatory\n            investments, greater capacity building for farmers\n            organizations, and farmers in environmentally fragile areas\n            who wish to switch out of crops in oversupply. The proposed\n            restructuring of the ARIP also extends the scope of the\n            Agricultural Sales Cooperative Unions (ASCU) component to\n            the participation by ASCUs in the emerging practice of\n            warehouse receipts-based financing. The revised procurement\n            plan has been reviewed and approved by the Bank project\n            team's procurement staff. The amendment to the loan\n            agreement is in compliance with the Articles of the Bank,\n            and it is thus recommended to approve same on no objection basis."}, "docdt": "2005-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
