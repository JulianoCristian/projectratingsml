                     ProposedAmendmentof the LoanAgreement



 1.      This is to seek approval of the Board to amend the scope o f Agricultural Reform
 Implementation Project (ARIP)in Turkey, resulting from the need to provide Turkish farmers
 with a wider set of investment support activities inthe transition period after the introduction o f
 agricultural policy reforms in 2001-2002. To date the investment support activities offered
 farmers under the Farmers Transition component have been limited to tobacco and hazelnut
 farmers who choose to switch out o f these formerly supported crops. However, with weak
 uptake o f these ARIP-supported programs (for reasons described below), the Government o f
 Turkey (GOT) has requested that the Farmers Transition component be broadened to include
 activities aimed at supporting land consolidation o f highly fragmented farm holdings, village-
based participatoryinvestments, greater capacity buildingfor farmers organizations, and farmers
 in environmentally fragile areas who wish to switch out of crops inoversupply. The proposed
restructuring o f the ARIP also extends the scope o f the Agricultural Sales Cooperative Unions
 (ASCU) component to the participation by ASCUs in the emerging practice o f warehouse
receipts-based financing.

I.ARIPImplementationResultstoDate

2.       Progress inthe area o f agricultural reforms supported by the ARIP has beensignificant as
the reforms targeted under the ARP have gone forward solidly and been maintained over time.
These reforms have generated large budgetary savings for Turkey and set the course for further
future savings as privatization of state-owned agricultural enterprises progresses. At the same
time, consumers have seen food costs come down significantly as the reforms have allowed
agricultural prices to become more aligned with generally lower intemational agricultural prices.
Farmers have clearly seen an erosion in agricultural income, but the impact o f this erosion has
beencushioned by over halfby a Direct Income Support (DIS)Program available to all farmers.
Compared to the earlier output and input subsidy programs, the DIS Program i s both a more
efficient income transfer instrument as well as more accessible to Turkey's smaller and poorer
farmers since the new program i s delinked from a farmer's output levels or volume o f input
usage. Inaddition, growth o f agriculture in2002-2004 has brought agricultural value added back
up to about 95% o fits pre-reform level.

3.       By the end of 2003, the reform program reduced the fiscal outlays on agricultural
subsidiesby about U S $5.4 billionto U S $0.7 billionannually. Roughly 70% of the subsidycuts
were associated with measures aimed at reducing agricultural commodity price subsidies. The
changes to agricultural output subsidization took the form o f greater market deregulation through
the phasing out o f state-set prices and reduced intervention purchases financed by the budget.
Reforms also imposed hard budget constraints on state marketingand processing enterprises and
the quasi-state Agriculture Sales Cooperative Unions (ASCUs). The remaining 30 percent o f the
cuts were aimed at reducing agricultural input subsidies, notably credit and fertilizer.

                                                             -2-

 4.       Most ASCUs have now beentransformed from parastatal organizations, controlledby the
 Ministry of Industry and Trade and supported financially by the Treasury, into financially
 autonomous and sustainable cooperatives that can compete with private traders while operating
 for the benefit o f the farmers who own them. The ARIP has assisted this process by financing
 over US $84 million in severance payments for the ASCUs and extending teclmcal assistance
 andtrainingto them duringtheir restructuringprocesses. The ASCUwhich was the most market
 distorting inthe past, the hazelnut ASCU - Fiskobirlik, has ceased supporting prices through the
 practice o f buying and holding the 20% o f the hazelnut crop which it typically procured in the
 1990s and now operates in the market by buying and selling much like private firms.                                 By
 promoting this change o f Fiskobirlik's business model, the GOT has eliminated the annual U S
 $200-400 million subsidy bill which it bore in the past. With regard to agricultural state
 economic enterprises, the Government has pursued the same path, particularly in the sugar and
 tobacco sectors by placing all state-owned sugar factories (SEKER) and the state tobacco
 company (TEKEL) under the scope o f the privatizationprogram.

 5.       Implementation o f the Direct Income Support (DIS) Program has proceeded in a
 satisfactory manner. During the first registration season in Summer-Fall 2001, 2.2 million
 farmers were registered for the DIS Program, ,representingalmost 60% o f Turkey's roughly 3.7
million' farmers. Payments under the 2001 Program were initiated in November 2001 and
extended through June 2002, by which time all o f the registered beneficiaries were paid in full.
Insuccessive years, the share of farming households registeredhas risen to almost 90% of the
total, covering almost 80% o f Turkey's agricultural cropland. DIS payments now account for
about 8% o f rural household income and replace over half o f the net income loss which farmers
have experienced as a result o f the agricultural subsidy reforms. Though payments on the 2004
DIS Program are experiencing delays and the DIS program in future will be reduced to
accommodate the funding o f agricultural investment support programs, the GOT'S draft
Framework Agricultural Law maintains DIS as the predominant agricultural transfer instrument.

6.       Despite the ARP's successful support o f reform process through the DIS and ASCU
components and the release o f the two U S $100 million tranches o f structural adjustment
support, the ARIP has been less successful in promoting the adjustment o f farmers out o f
previously supported crops as targeted under the Farmers Transition (FT) component. In the
tobacco sub-sector, Turkish farmers responded to tobacco price reforms by switching almost
60,000 hectares out o f tobacco in the areas targeted by the ARIP. However, this took place in
2000-2001 just prior to the support offered under the ARIP's FT component becoming available.
As a result, farmers switching out of only about 3,000 hectares of tobacco into other crops have
benefitedunder the FT component, whereas the ARIP was designed to fund farmers switching
out o f 36,000 hectares of tobacco.

7.       Inthe area ofhazelnut, farmers have uprooted only 475 hectares of the 100,000 hectares
targeted under the FT component. Unliketobacco, there has beenno hazelnut uprooting outside
o f the ARIP component. Since hazelnut i s a perennial crop, farmers hesitated in 2001-2003 to
switch out o f hazelnut as they waited to see the introduction o f the reform o f Fiskobirlik (which
occurred in 2002-2003) and the impact on prices. Over 2001-2003, hazelnut prices did indeed
fall by almost 40%, but severe frost in 2004 reduced the crop significantly and prices have risen
to above the level supported by Fiskobirlik prior to its change o fbusiness model.

 3.698 million farmer households were identified inthe 2001 Census of Village Heads, down from 4.092 million in 1991.

                                                 -3-


 8.     For these reasons the proposed restructuring o f the FT component foresees significantly
 reduced participationinthe tobacco and hazelnut uprootingprograms (9000 and 15,000 hectares,
 respectively) over the period 2005-2007. Consequently, the expected usage o f loan funds under
 the original scope o f the FT component would fall by roughly U S $105 million. Rather than
 canceling these funds, the GOT has prepared additional sub-components under the FT
 component to hrther assist farmers inmeetingthe objective o f increasing productivity.

 II.Objective

 9.     The objective o f the ARIP remains, to support the implementation of the GOT's
 agricultural reform program, and specifically to reduce artificial incentives and govemment
 subsidies, with an appropriate social and economic safety net, and to implement a new
 agricultural support system that will increase productivity inthe agricultural sector. Inpursuing
 this objective further, the Bank and the GOT agreed on an Agricultural Policy Paper in April
 2004. The principles and specific agricultural policies agreed in this Agricultural Policy Paper
have recently been incorporated into the GOT's draft Framework Agricultural Law which
mandates their implementation through a refined set o f agricultural policy instruments and
investments over the period 2006-2010. The restructuring of the ARIP's components directly
 supports the implementation o f a number o f the agricultural policy instruments and investments
laid out inthe FrameworkAgricultural Law.

III.ComponentRestructuring

 10.    ExpansionofLandRegistrationActivities Under Part A of the Project The existing
sub-component for Support to the General Directorate o f Land Registration and Cadastre
(TKGM), under ARIP Component A for Direct Income Support, is proposed to be expanded to
enable T K G M to supply to the Ministry o f Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) up-to-date
digitized cadastral maps (for both previously surveyed and un-surveyed areas), parcel
information and land ownership details for rural land parcels in 20 selected provinces. This will
allow MARA to improve its national registry o f farmers but also to secure property rights o f
landowners within the most unsurveyed rural areas o f Turkey (mainly in the more remote
sections o f Anatolia).

11,     The expansion o f this sub-component covers the purchase o f survey equipment, computer
equipment and software, and high resolution satellite images, and technical services for
establishment o f permanent GPS stations, geodetic network densification, base mapping,
execution o f field survey and cadastral mapping in unsurveyed areas ("first cadastre works"),
data entry and cadastral map digitization, and integration o f cadastre and landregistry databases.
Executiono f cadastreworks inunsurveyedvillages will be mainly carried out by contracted field
survey specialists with the support o f TKGM teams in its district offices. The result o f the
cadastral surveying process will be the production o f cadastral maps and issuance of titles to the
documented owners. Computer systems are also to be established to keep the cadastral records
electronically. The cadastral data will be integrated with the National Registry o f Farmers (NRF)
to provide more comprehensive documentation for and smoother functioning o f the DISprogram
administered by MARA through the NRF.

 12.     Implementation arrangements. Technical implementation responsibility will rest with
 TKGM, with additional support as neededto beprovidedbythe ARIP Project CoordinationUnit
 (PCU). TKGM will sign a protocol with MARA delineating the rights and obligations o f TKGM
 and MARA inthe implementation o f the sub-component. TKGM has set up a small Component
 ImplementationUnit (CIU) which will support TKGM by carrying out implementation activities
 (component and technical planning, budget mobilization and accounting, preparation o f technical
 specifications, procurement, training, quality control, monitoring and evaluation fimctions) in
 coordination with the ARIP PCU.

13.     New Sub-ComDonents under Part B of the Project Under ARIP Component B for
Farmers Transition (FT), new sub-components are to be funded using just over half o f the
savings from the reduced size o f the hazelnut uprooting activities. Sub-components are proposed
to be introduced for land consolidation o f highly fragmented farm holdings, village-based
participatory investments, expanded capacity building for farmers' organization; and farmers in
environmentally fragile areas who wish to switch out o f crops in oversupply. All these sub-
components are pilot in nature, given Turkey's size, but it i s anticipated that as success or
otherwise definitive experience i s gained, they will be scaled up nationwide. A Rural
Development Central Execution Unit (CEU) has been set up in MARA to coordinate the
preparation and implementation o f the sub-components for land consolidation, village-based
participatory investments, and institutional reinforcement for farmers' organizations.                 The
existing FT CTU has coordinated the preparation o f the sub-component for support to farmers in
environmentally fragile areas, and it will continue to handle the implementation o f the original
(tobacco and hazelnut) activities.

                                                                 -5-

 14.       Land Consolidation Sub-Component. Turkey's agricultural lands are characterized by a
 highlyfragmented parcel structure resultingfrom the division o fland amongheirs over anumber
 o f generations2.           The current distribution o f parcels limits the efficiency o f agricultural
 production significantly for a number o f reasons: excessive movement o f labor and agricultural
 equipment across plots, reduced accessibility to roads, inefficient use o f agricultural machinery
 and irrigation infrastructure, and limited crop rotations and technology choice given the
 constraining factor of many neighboring plots. Thus, this sub-component aims to improve
 agricultural productivity by enabling farmers to have fewer, larger and better-shaped parcels.
 Consolidation o f land i s planned via a demand driven approach in selected villages o f seven
 provinces. (Other provinces could later be includedbyjoint decision o fMARA and the Bank.)

 15.       The Land Consolidation (LC) sub-component would target the creation o f reformed
 parcels for land owners and the construction o f new inter-farm roads within the redesigned
 layout o f parcels. There will be no actual physical relocation o f residences o f farmers, nor will
 other built assets o f farmers be removed. All L C activities supported by ARIP will be
 implementedaccording to the principle of obtaining consent from no less than two-thirds of the
 population who own more than 51% o f the land to be consolidated, as per existing Turkish law.
 The ARIP supported project activities as enumerated in the table below would be initiated in
 early 2005. Feasibility studies are underway, following the applications which have been made
 byvillages basedon the demand o ftheir farmers.

 16.      Implementation o f the L C sub-component will be handled by the existing two agencies
(or their successors in the MARA reorganization process) which currently execute land
consolidation investments, the General Directorate o f Agricultural Reform (GDAR) and the
General Directorate o f Rural Services (GDRS), both o f which operate under the Ministry o f
Agricultural and Rural Affairs                                The CEU will assist both GDAR and GDRS in
arranging the procurement process for the L C activities supported under ARIP.



 The 1991 Agricultural Census showed that 57% of farming families cultivated more than four plots, and inpracticemany of
these are further sub-dividedunofficially for separatecultivation amongheirs. Fragmentationhas continued inthe past fifteen
years: arecent field survey ineight sets of villages in Thrace, CentralAnatolia andthe Black Searegions indicatedthat the
averagenumber of plots cultivated per farmer rangedfrom 8-30.
 GDAR carriesout the LC processinareas that are declaredbythe Cabinet of Ministers as "Agricultural Reform
ImplementationAreas", whereas GDRS operates in other agricultural areas inthe country.

                                                                 -6-

  17.      As a matter o f due diligence, an in-depth Social Assessment was commissioned in 12
 villages to understandthe participatorynature of the consultation and implementationprocedures
 used in the past and ongoing L C process, the perceived and real impacts on the different
 categories o f farmers, the risks o f marginalization o f vulnerable groups, approaches to
 reconciling competing claims o f stakeholder interests, and rules for determining valuation and
 allocation o fproperty. The full report i s available inofficial files.

  18.      The study has concluded that a sound consultative process i s followed by GDAR and
 GDRS to ensure landowners participation in the L C process. Technical criteria including soil,
 location, fertility, and sometimes market price indices are used in the valuation o f land by a
 committee that includes local representatives, and the resulting land grading equivalency table i s
 displayed publicly for review and comment. Objections are considered and an iterative process
 follows. Conflicts and competing requests are resolved through the consideration o f several key
 issues included in determining new plot locations: an equivalency principle4, direct access to
 roads, kinship and adversarial relationships, etc. The study revealed near unanimous agreement
 that small-scale farmers, who are most likely to cultivate fragmented pieces o f land, benefit the
 most from the L C process. Transparency and social accountability mechanisms, including an
 appeals and grievance redress mechanism with GDAR and GDRS, are inplace.

 19.       Findingsfrom the study have beenincorporated into the project design. Inparticular, the
 study has thrown light on the approach to participationinland consolidation and identifiedissues
 and information that will need to be made available through the communications campaign
 which the government agencies execute throughout the L C process. The study also highlighted
 the need to earmark increased budget for the communications campaign exercises and
 underscored the need to build the skills and capacity o f concerned staff in the implementing
 agencies in public communication and information dissemination, enlisting participation o f
beneficiaries, improved social surveying, and basic monitoring and evaluation.                                      These are
 includedinthe set o f technical services to be fundedunder the sub-component.

20.        Village Based Participatory Investments Sub-component The objective o f the Village
Based Participatory Investments (VBPI) Sub-component i s to support community-based
demand-driven activities in small-scale agricultural processing, marketing and other off-farm
businesses as well as the rehabilitation o f infrastructure used in the provision o f public services
in remote rural areas. The sub-component also aims to strengthen capacity at provincial and
community levels in executing the design, implementation, and impact monitoring o f demand
driven investment programs in anticipation o f the future wider availability of funds for such
programs from the European Unionduringthe pre-accession period inTurkey.

21.       The sub-component is dividedinto bothprivate and public sector programs and would be
implemented in 16 provinces that have been selected according to a set o f criteria prepared
jointly by the Government o f Turkey and the World Bank. Under the private sector focused
program, individual farmers and other rural private individuals engaged in small rural businesses
would be eligible to participate, as well as groups o f farmers, cooperatives, and other farmers'
organizations. The first round o f the private sector program (to be initiated in early 2005) would
be limitedto investment proposals inpre-identifiedstrategic investments in maize drying, fruit
and vegetable packaging, milk cooling, and greenhouses making use o f alternative local energy

  All land owners participating in the LC process will receive replacement agricultural land of equivalent productivepotential.

 sources (e.g. hot springs). Later rounds would be open to a wider set o f activities (e.g., in crop
 production, grazing land improvement, animal husbandry, aquaculture products, forestry,
 handicrafts and other off-farm rural SMEs). A 50 % grant element for private sector investment
 proposals has been set. The maximum project size as a basis for the loan financing would be
 US$35,000 for individuals and US$250,000 for private enterprises, groups o f farmers, and non-
 profit organizations.

 22.     Investments by the public sector would focus on rehabilitation of existing public
 infrastructure related to the provision o f public services. This part o f the sub-component would
 start duringthe second round o f calls for proposals (mid-2005), and the grant element would not
 exceed 75 %. Public beneficiaries o f the project would be the district administrations and the
 unions for village services supply5. Their applications will have been based on consultations
 regarding co-financing with the provincial administration. The maximum project size o f public
 sector investments as a basis o f loan financing would be US$ 300,000. The capacities o f local
 organizations that will take responsibility for project preparation, management and
 implementationwould be strengthenedthrough training and technical assistance.

23.      Implementation arrangements. In each o f the 16 provinces which have been selected for
participation in the sub-component, a Provincial Evaluation Council (PEC) will be set up. The
PECs are to chaired by the Deputy Governor o f the province, and include a representative from
the Provincial Directorate o f Agriculture, a representative o f the Provincial Directorate o f Public
Works, a representative o f the Special Provincial Administration, and a representative o f the
composite unions which participate in the National Union o f Agricultural Cooperatives (or
another non-governmental organization in cases when the PECs are considering public sector
infrastructure rehabilitation proposals).      The MARA CEU will review the evaluation reports
which each o f the PECs will produce to summarize the selections made from among the
proposals received from the applicants in the province. The purpose o f this review will be to
ascertain whether eligibility criteria are adhered to andconfirm the availability o f co-financing to
be provided by the project beneficiaries. Once the CEU review has been concluded, the CEU
will convey authorization,to provincial governors for conclusion o f grant agreements with the
beneficiaries whose applications have been approved.

24.     Under these grant agreements, Project Technical Assistance Teams (PTATs) formed
within the Provincial Directorates o f Agriculture shall be responsible for monitoring the
achievements realized during the project implementation phase o f each o f the supported

 investments. Each investment under the sub-component would be expected to be completed in
 less than 12 months following the signature o f the grant agreement. The PTATs shall also serve
 to coordinate the participation o f project beneficiaries inthe technical assistance available under
 the sub-component which will be organized and contracted out bythe MAR4CEU.

 25.     InstitutionalReinforcement o f Farmers' Organizations (IRFO) The original design o f the
 FT component made provisions for institutional reinforcement training and technical assistance
 for farmers participating in the Alternative Crops sub-component. Owing to lack o f demand for
the investment activities under the Alternative Crops sub-component, these funds for training
 and technical assistance have understandably been accessed to a low degree. As a result, the
 Institutional Reinforcement sub-component has been reoriented to focus on the objective o f
 supporting the development o f independent and efficient farmers' organizations (FOs) mainly
through working with the existing agricultural development cooperatives, farmers unions,
livestock associations, water user associations, etc. Stronger FOs are needed throughout Turkey
 at all levels (village, regional and national) to provide the services to farmers and the rural
populationat large inareas from which state agencieshave withdrawn or are not active. The aim
o f the ARIP activities for Institutional Reinforcement o f Farmers' Organizations (IRFO) i s to
provide a conducive environment for the development o f FOs through much expanded training
andtechnical assistance.

26.      The subcomponent will provide comprehensive management and organizational support
to about 400 o f the FOs operating in Turkey in different sub-sectors and training and education
services to members, elected officials, managers and staff o f another 2,100 village-based FOs. In
addition, IRFO activities will support capacity building at selected regional and national service
and apex organizations. This capacity buildingis keyto sustainabilityo f IRFO activities since, at
the endo f support providedby ARIP, these secondary and tertiary FOs will have to continue and
expand support services for village-based FOs.




27.     Implementation Arrangements. Services for IRFO will be provided through the newly
established National Union o f Agricultural Cooperatives (NUAC) andor selected regional
cooperative unions, including subcontracting o f a substantial part o f these services to existing
Turkish training institutions or consultancy companies. W A C i s an independent organization
with its board composed exclusively of farmers' representatives elected by member FOs. The
recruitment o f IRFO specialists and subcontractors, as well as the procurement o f office and
training equipment, etc. will be managed by the MARA CEU but then placed at the disposal o f
W A C for the implementation o f IRFO.

 28.     EnvironmentallyBased Amicultural LandUtilization Sub - Component The objective o f
 the Environmentally Based Agricultural LandUtilization sub-component (known as CATAK in
 Turkish) is to protect sensitive regions of Turkey in terms of water, soil, landscape and bio-
 diversity by setting aside agricultural areas formerly planted to crops in excess production or
 subject to severe erosion and replacing harmful agricultural techniques with more
 environmentally friendly practices. To achieve this, farmers and farmer unions will be supported
 through transition grants and also with a variety o f extension activities.

 29.     The CATAK sub-component would be implemented in four pilot provinces totaling
 approximately five thousand hectares: Kirsehir - Seyfe Lake area, Isparta - Kovada Lake area,
 Konya - Eregli marshes area, and Kayseri - Sultan marshes area. Farmers in these areas would
 be offered participation inthree types o f activities with annual transition payments o f U S $400-
 900 per hectare. The first type o f activity would compensate farmers for ceasing cultivation o f
 annual crops andplanting perennial grasses and other perennial crops which form buffer zones to
 prevent water pollution and which allow reduced usage o f irrigation water. The second type o f
 activity would involve compensation to farmers for switching to environmentally sustainable
 agricultural techniques (contour tillage, reduced flow irrigation, organic agriculture, etc.). The
 third activity would involve those switching from intensive grazing to production o f fodder and
 adoption o fpasture rehabilitation measures.

30.     The activities supported by the sub-component are designed under the Framework
Agricultural Law to last five to ten years, with the first three years funded by the ARIP loan
funds and the remaining years financed by the state budget for agricultural transfers. Fieldwork
for 2005 and identification o f field implementationpersonnel commenced inlate 2004.

31.     Implementation Arrangements. The MARA FT CIU will manage the sub-component
through provincial implementationteams to be set up at the Provincial Directorateo f Agriculture
ineachofthe four provinces which havebeenselected for participation. These provincial teams
will coordinate with the Provincial Directorate of Environment and Forestry and farmers
organizations involved inbiodiversity activities (e.g., inthe Sultan marshes area). The CATAK
provincial teams will also coordinate with the PTATs for the VBPI sub-component inprovinces
(e.g. Konya) where the VBPI sub-component is expected to support investments in grazing land
improvement, animal husbandry, and micro-watershed rehabilitation.

                                                -10-

 32.       Each CATAK provincial implementationteam will include representatives o f the districts
 covered, and these district representatives will serve as local coordinators o f the "lead farmer
 representatives" in each o f the villages from which farmers participate. These lead farmer
 representatives will carry out the training and advocacy works as well as monitoring o f the
 activities o f the farmers participating in CATAK. They will also be responsible for data
 collection and compilation o f summary reports on their villages CATAK activities. These lead
 farmer representatives will be hired on contract using public information campaign funds
 available under Part D o f the ARIP. Producers that benefit from the CATAK compensation
 payments will not be able to benefit from other agricultural support payments, includingDIS.

 33.      New Sub-component under Part C of the Proiect The restructuringo f ARIP extends
 to AFUP Component C for Agricultural Sales Cooperative Unions (ASCUs), under which most
 of the remaining loan funds available for severance payments to retrenched ASCU employees
 are to be reallocated to supporting the participation by ASCUs in the emerging practice o f
 licensed warehouse receipts-based financing. The new Warehouse Receipts Sub-component
would focus on enabling ASCUs, as well as the Turkish Grain Board (TMO), to set up licensed
warehouses to store products o f their member farmers or third parties and issue product receipts,
These receipts will be used by farmers to sell products without physical exchange, for trade in
the commodity markets, and to obtain loans from financial intermediaries. As a result, the sub-
component would help both development o f commodity markets and also development o f
financial intermediationinthe countryside,

34.       The subcomponent consists o f purchasing information and communication technology
(ICT) systems that will enable electronic information transfer between licensed warehouses and
their laboratories which assess product quality attributes and commodity exchange markets. It
would also cover the purchase o f laboratory equipment, warehouse modernization and
expansion, and training services for the selected ASCUs that operate viably in marketing o f
cotton, raisin, olive, olive oil, sunflower, hazelnut and dried apricot, as well as 18 TMO
enterprises handlinggrains. ASCUs will contribute at least 50% o f the value o f each investment.
The elaboration o f businesses plans is currently underway, and their consideration and approval
would proceed in2005 as notedbelow.

  35,     Implementation Arrangements. Approval o f specific investments under the Warehouse
 Receipts sub-component will not take place before the passage o f the draft Law on Licensed
 Warehouses for Agricultural Products, which specifies the legal arrangements for the issuance
 and use o f warehouse receipts. This draft Law i s currently under consideration in the Turkish
 Parliament. After passage o f the Law, each o f the participating ASCUs will present detailed
 financial plans, and the evaluation o f these proposals' validity and their conformance with the
 ASCUs' overall restructuring plan will be made by the ASCU Restructuring Board's Executive
 Unit. The Restructuring Board would then take decisions on the approval of specific
 investments under the sub-component. The C l U which coordinated the implementation o f the
 recent Commodity Markets Development Project has been reactivated at the Ministryo f Industry
 and Trade. This C I U will accompany the preparation o f the financial plans and monitor the
 tendering and implementation o f the contracts. The Restructuring Board's Executive Unit will
 monitor the impact o f the warehouse receipts investments.

 I K Financial management, accounts, and audit arrangements

 36.      The current financial management arrangements for the ARIP include a centralized
 structure where all budgeting, payments, recording and reporting are done by the
 Undersecretariat o f Treasury, General Directorate o f State Economic Entities (SEE) through the
 P C U established there.

 37.     Within the scope o f restructuring o f the ARIP, through discussions with the
 implementing agencies it has been agreed that they will be responsible for all management and
 implementation functions o f their related components. Hence the budget allocations for their
 activities are to be included in the annual government budgets o f the implementing agencies
 starting from January 1, 2005.

38.      However, in order to ensure that financial controls are still centralized at the
Undersecretariat o f Treasury - General Directorate o f SEE through the PCU, the current structure
o f one Special Account (SA) will be retained. The General Directorate o f SEE will continue to
be responsible for withdrawing funds from the Bank either through the S A or from the Loan
Account.     However for withdrawals from the S A at the Central Bank o f Turkey four sub-
accounts will be opened under the main SA, one for each implementing entity. The authorized
signatories o f these sub-accounts will be submitted to the Central Bank by the Undersecretariat
o f Treasury - General Directorate o f Foreign Economic Relations. The details o f the sub-
accounts are as follows:

     1) MARAfor Parts A.1, B.l,B.3, B.4. andB.5 o fthe Project;
    2) TKGM for Part A.2 o f the Project;
    3) MARA-General Directorate o f Agricultural Reform for Part B.2 o f the Project; and,
    4) MARA-General Directorate o f Rural Services for its activities under Part B.2 o f the
         Project.

39.      The General Directorate o f SEE shall still be the authorized body to make disbursements
from S A and the Loan Account for the Parts C and D o f the Project.

40.      The implementing agencies will send the payment orders to the Central Bank with the
letter o f the PCU certifying that the expenditure is within the scope o f the project and complies

                                                 -12-

 with the related project documentation. The implementing agency will seek this certification
 through submitting all documentation to the PCUbefore it authorizes the payment from the sub-
 account. The Central Bank will release payment only with the presence o f the accompanying
 certification letter by the PCU and will send a copy o f all payment documents and SA statements
 to the PCU. As set forth above, the sub-accounts will be used only for individual transactions
 related to the expenditures o f different implementing agencies, and no additional funds will be
 retained insuch sub-accounts inadditionto the main SA.

 41.     Following the payments from the SA as detailed above, documentation, recording,
 accounting and reporting for the project will be done by the PCU. The PCU will continue to be
 responsible for compliance with the World Bank procedures. The implementing entities will
 provide the requiredsupport to the PCU for ensuring this.

 42.     These procedures will be detailed and sample documentation will be included in the
 revisedProject ImplementationPlan.

 V. Environmental and Social Aspects

 43.     The addition of sub-components for land consolidation, village-based participatory
 investments, expanded capacity building for farmers organization, set-aside payments for
 farmers in environmentally fragile areas, and introduction o f warehouse receipts by ASCUSand
 TMO have not changed the Environmental Category "B" rating o f ARIP. The environmental
management plan prepared by the Borrower for the original scope o f ARIP will be updated (by
the end o f May 2005) to cover the repositioning of inter-farm roads under the Land
Consolidation component, the review o f the small scale investments for income generation and
rehabilitation o f public service infrastructure under the Village Based Participatory Investments
sub-component, andthe expansion o fwarehouses under the Warehouse Receipts sub-component.
The activities supported under the Institutional Reinforcement sub-component do not pose any
environmental risks, while those activities supported under the CATAK sub-component are
designed to generate localizedenvironmental benefits.

44.      Consideration was made o f the application o f the social safeguard policy on Resettlement
(0.P 4.12) to the L C sub-component, but the supplemental Social Assessment demonstrated that
this policy is not triggered since the LC process does not involve any land taking, and entails
only transferring the location o fpeoples' holdings. All land owners invillages participating inthe
land consolidation process will receive replacement agricultural land of equivalent productive
potential. There will be no physical displacement o f people, physical relocation o f residences or
other permanent assets o f those affected by the sub-component. Further, the L C process, while
clarifying the rights o f use and access and identifying current encroachments, would not
adversely impact the livelihoods o f marginal and vulnerable sections o f the population as
Treasury lands would be allocated for a nominal charge for persons deemed eligible by national
legislation.

VI.Disbursement and Procurement

45.     Summary tables for the reallocationo f funds across the full set o f existing and new sub-
components and for the projected disbursement o f funds through the proposed extended Loan
Closing Date o f December 31, 2007 are attached in Annexes 2 and 3. The Borrower's revised

Disbursements under the Warehouse Receipts sub-component will be subject to passage o f the
draft Law on Warehouses for Agricultural Products.
