Some lessons\n            learned included: a macro-scale lesson may be derived from\n            the wide range of good effects, in cadastre, land\n            consolidation, environmental land use, village industries\n            and works including water-saving irrigation - which came\n            because both the Government and the Bank restructured the\n            project. Both remained alert to the possibilities of using\n            this vehicle to try new and innovative programs, rather than\n            the easy road of simply closing down an operation, and their\n            courage was rewarded. One reason for the relatively high\n            degree of success of the diverse investment program\n            introduced at the restructuring in 2005 was that the new\n            subcomponents were generally delegated to regular line\n            agencies rather than stand-alone project management units,\n            thus building ownership and expertise ready and able to\n            carry on after project closing. A final general lesson is\n            that one of the best forms of monitoring and evaluation,\n            particularly of new, dispersed programs, is to conduct\n            windscreen surveys or rural appraisals by proven,\n            experienced and independent experts. In a couple of weeks,\n            very large samples of participants across as many as 15\n            provinces can be interviewed in depth, near their homes,\n            workshops and fields, with possibly more candid results and\n            fuller understanding than produced through formal\n            statistical surveys."}, "docdt": "2009-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
