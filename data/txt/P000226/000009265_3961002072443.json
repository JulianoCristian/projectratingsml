promote growth by supporting the establishment of an\n            incentive framework for export-oriented private sector\n            investment.  The project consists of a line of credit for\n            productive investments, support to industrial\n            infrastructure, improvements in the business environment and\n            in financial intermediation, and technical assistance in\n            support of private sector development.  Eligible projects to\n            be included under the line of credit (subproject investment\n            financing) include : i) investment projects in all\n            productive sectors, with particular emphasis on\n            export-oriented manufacturing, small-scale mining, and\n            agro-industrial projects; and ii) modernization of\n            equipment.  An additional US$3.5 million will be used for an\n            investment program in sites and services in the undeveloped\n            industrial zone of Bujumbura, the capital city.  There will\n            also be a technical assistance component which will be\n            passed on as a grant by the government to implementing\n            institutions.  The grant will be given to : a) participating\n            intermediaries; b) private entrepreneurs; c) the Central\n            Bank and banks to implement staff training and capacity\n            building programs, to improve banking supervision, economic\n            and monetary analyses as well as credit evaluation; d)\n            Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a Policy Coordinating\n            Unit (PCU); and e) Ministry of Energy and Mining to assist\n            in reforming mining investment and regulatory policies."}, "docdt": "1992-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
