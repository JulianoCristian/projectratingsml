the first step in a\n            long-term program of land and water development in the\n            Panlaung and Samon River Valleys in the central dry zone of\n            Burma. It would provide year-round irrigation for about\n            200,000 acres in the Mandalay Division in Upper Burma. About\n            88,000 acres of this area are under an existing irrigation\n            system which is only capable of providing irrigation for one\n            crop during the monsoon season. With the construction of the\n            proposed Nyaunggyat Dam, and the flood control works, the\n            project area would receive assured water supplies for\n            irrigation, allowing double cropping. To help achieve this,\n            the project provides for the rehabilitation of the existing\n            inefficient and silted-up irrigation system and construction\n            of new irrigation and drainage facilities in the new areas.\n            Complementary measures include on-farm development, improved\n            water management, agriculture extension and research, farm\n            mechanization, technical assistance, and training. The\n            project would also provide for hydroelectric power\n            generation with a maximum generating capacity of 56 MW and\n            an average annual energy production of 165 GWh. The project\n            would benefit about 33,000 farm families, double the\n            utilization of family labor and increase hired labor\n            requirements by about 38%."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
