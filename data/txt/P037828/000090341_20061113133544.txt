6. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

6.1 Context at Appraisal

In Brazil, by the late 1980s, the combination of high public spending and intense protectionism over
the preceding two decades had led to economic disarray and one of the world's highest inflation rates.
In 1994, with the "Plano Real", most of the inappropriate policies were removed and inflation was
brought under control. Investment increased and the annual growth rate reached 5%, the highest
growth rate in eight years.

The economy of Paraná represented 7% of Brazilian GDP in 1993 and was strongly oriented towards
agriculture, which accounted for more than 40% of the State GDP. Between 1986 and 1993 the State's
economy grew by almost 33%, twice that of the national economy. In 1995 the State administration
focused on financial and fiscal reforms and from then on achieved a sustained annual growth rate of
6%. They also increased rural investment programs in order to alleviate rural poverty, improve rural
social infrastructure and diminish natural resources degradation.

Paraná is the second largest of the southern Brazilian States with a humid subtropical climate which
allows for subtropical and tropical agricultural crops. The expansion of the agricultural frontier for
over six decades had dramatically reduced the native vegetation. Poor management of fragile soils
had led to their degradation and reduced farm productivity. Natural resources, especially soils and
water, were severely deteriorated. Despite the positive impact that the World Bank-financed Paraná
Land Management I (LM1) Project (Loan 3018-BR) had had on natural resources, more than 40% of
agricultural land remained in need of improved soil management to reduce erosion and sustain
agricultural productivity, especially in those pockets with a high concentration of small farmers where
there were the most severe soil constraints.

In 1994 the State of Paraná had the largest number of poor among Brazil 's southern states. Poverty
was concentrated in the rural areas where 25% of the State's 8.6 million inhabitants lived. Although
poverty was widespread throughout the entire state, rural poverty was concentrated mainly in the
central portion of the territory. Of all agricultural producers 65% were small farmers with incomes
below three minimum monthly salaries (SMMs). Their living conditions were largely unsatisfactory.
Half of the rural homes were constructed with non-durable materials and had dirt floors. Housing for
seasonal agricultural laborers had an average of 1.6 rooms and overcrowding was a serious problem.
Half the rural households and 70% and of rural poor households had no electricity. About 80% of
these households had no water supply and more than 92% of them lacked proper sanitation facilities.

There were some structural factors that severely constrained the development of the agricultural
sector and inadequate rural social services and facilities were depressing rural living standards. Many
rural poor houses were poorly constructed and lacked running water and basic sanitation. These
conditions were motivating many rural families to leave the rural areas and seek improved living
conditions in urban areas. The steady deterioration of natural resources caused by continuous
cultivation on soils with steep slopes, no acidity corrections nor nutrient replacement, had
considerable negative environmental effects. As a result of this, viability of agriculture as a sustained
means of supporting rural households was threatened. The lack of access by small farmers to technical
expertise and financial resources affected their ability to modernize and diversify production which
could open opportunities for vertical integration with agro-industries. The limited opportunities for
rural employment was another of the major reasons why rural youth were migrating to the urban
centers. Thus, greater economic diversification, agro-industrial expansion, improved rural services
and better work-skills training could contribute to growth, increase productivity and alleviate rural
poverty.

The support requested by the State Government to the Bank was closely aligned with the Brazilian
Government's strategy for poverty alleviation and decentralization of project administration to the
states, as well as with the anti-poverty orientation of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of
June 1995.

The State Government initiative was originally conceptualized around the successful experience of
the Bank-financed LMI project, although its objectives, scope and coverage were substantially
broader with the incorporation of a strong focus on rural poverty alleviation. The rationale of the
Bank's technical and financial assistance to the project was based on its extensive experience acquired
in rural poverty alleviation and natural resource management. Many relevant lessons learned by the
Bank earlier were incorporated to project design such as those relevant to decentralization, beneficiary
participation, targeting criteria, accessibility of weaker communities, subproject standardization and
supervision, sustainability, cost sharing, and project performance monitoring.


6.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objectives of the Paraná Rural Poverty Alleviation and Natural Resources Management Project
(referred to in this report as Paraná 12 Meses- the local name given to it by the State Government)
were to increase the incomes and improve the living conditions of approximately 255,000 rural poor
and small farmer households by supporting the implementation of community-demanded investment
subprojects. The project also aimed to protect the State's natural resources by promoting sustainable
practices for improved land management and soil and water quality conservation in an area of
approximately 8.1 million ha.

6.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification

The Project Development Objectives remained unchanged throughout implementation.

Various financial indicators were changed during the implementation period as a result of project
amendments. The only physical indicator that was changed was the number of kilometers of feeder
roads to be rehabilitated which was reduced from 8,000 to 6,000. This was due to the fact that in 2003
the strategy was changed and rural feeder roads rehabilitation was partly substituted by the
rehabilitation of 661 km of paved roads and the reconstruction of 190 km of state roads. Both types of
works were more expensive per km than works on rural feeder roads.

The total amount of funds invested by the project was changed from US$ 353.5 million to US$ 290.9
million (US$ 165 million by the Bank and US$ 125.9 million by the State). In the fifth amendment to
the loan agreement of September 2004 there was a cancellation of US$ 10 million of the loan amount
as a consequence of some difficulties in the application of funds to CODAPAR subprojects.
Modification of the amount of funds to be provided by the State Government was caused by recurrent
shortages experienced in several annual budgets.

CODAPAR target figures were reduced from US$ 157.2 million to US$ 153.5 million, COHAPAR
target figures were reduced from US$ 90 million to US$ 82 million and DER target figures were
reduced from US$ 37 million to US$ 22.5 million. Target figures for goods acquisition were reduced
to US$ 4.4 million, for consulting services to US$ 23 million and for recurrent costs to US$ 3 million.

6.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

Priority Mesoregions

Targeting mechanisms were such that the project was able to focus on beneficiaries regardless of
geographical areas and all qualifying poor communities and microcatchments were eligible for
project assistance. However, given the high concentration of potential beneficiaries in certain areas of
the State, the project initially prioritized implementation efforts in three mesoregions in which
60% of Paraná's 300,000 poor small farmers were concentrated and soil deterioration was substantial.
This strategic approach allowed a more concentrated effort towards decentralized institutional
strengthening, staff training, project promotion and implementation of monitoring systems.
The identification of the priority mesoregions was based on: (i) the proportion of subsistence, small-
farm households; (ii) the importance of soil deterioration problems; and (iii) the degree of coverage
provided by the previous World Bank LMI project. It was expected that approximately 68% of
project beneficiaries would be located in these mesoregions.
Approximately 70% of the rural population of the priority mesoregions were small farm households
with farm land, covering more than 11 million ha primarily dedicated to traditional crops including
wheat, maize and soybeans. Most of the soils in these mesoregions had low natural fertility and were
susceptible to erosion, while the majority of small farmers did not apply sustainable natural resources
management practices.

Microcatchment Eligibility Criteria

For the implementation of Natural Resources Management Subprojects, priority was given to those
microcatchments where the LMI project initiated soil and water conservation activities, so that the
package of recommended practices could be completed and consolidated. Identification of "new"
microcatchments was based on demand. Requests for support in new microcatchments were designed
to be prioritized according to: (i) concentration of small farmers; (ii) beneficiary interest,
organization and participation, including commitment to maintain infrastructure; (iii) erosion
potential or intensity of soil degradation; (iv) downstream water use or urban water demand; and (v)
location, with preference given to microcatchments in a priority mesoregion which received less
support from the LMI project. All three categories of beneficiaries were eligible for natural resources
management subproject financing.

Beneficiaries Eligibility Criteria

Project activities were targeted to those households classified as Subsistence Farm Households (PS)
and Small Market-Oriented Households (PSM). The following table explains how these beneficiaries
were targeted. In 2000, modifications to the targeting were made, and reflected in amendments to the
loan agreement. These modifications were made following significant changes in the exchange rate
and practical experience in applying the criteria in project implementation. The modifications are
explained in the following table.

Social Infrastructure Subprojects were aimed at improving quality of life including water supply,
sanitation, electrification, household infrastructure, community buildings and basic social services for
poor subsistence and small farmers and the construction of Vilas Rurais for poor seasonal agricultural
workers. Income Generating Subprojects financed on and off-farm income generating activities to
increase rural household income and stimulate the local economy.

6.6 Revised Components

The first version of the Project Implementation Manual (PIM) that was adopted by the Borrower on
December 1996 and accepted by the Bank, proposed adjustments to the original components. This
was mainly due to the need to have a better grouping of activities taking into consideration that there
were four main implementing agencies for the Project, CODAPAR, COHAPAR, EMATER and DER
and one minor implementing agency DERAL. These were coordinated by the UGP, SEAB.

The original two components were basically split into four components, with subcomponents and
major activities rearranged to a certain degree, but with all major project activities maintained in the
project scope. The final budget allocations of these components and sub-components are presented in
the table below.

6.7 Other significant changes

A significant change took place in year 2003 and was reflected in the fourth amendment to the Loan
Agreement. Considering the slow disbursements being experienced in several activities, US$ 58.8
million (US$ 31.8 million from the Loan) were reallocated to the Rural Feeder Road Rehabilitation
activities in the Productive Development component to finance the rehabilitation of paved roads
located in high priority areas attended by the Project. The estimate was that 661 km of paved roads
would be rehabilitated and that 190 km of paved roads would be restored.
Another significant change took place in year 2004 when US$ 10 million of the Loan was cancelled
due to the difficulties experienced with disbursement and the short period of time available before the
closing date of the Project.

A detailed description of the most important changes in implementation arrangements, schedule and
funding allocations is included in Annex 2.

7. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

7.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Rural poverty and inadequate natural resources management has been an endemic problem in
Southern Brazil and the State of Paraná since shortly after colonization. Land ownership systems and
lack of land rights had produced a limiting fragmentation of agricultural land that kept rural areas
impoverished and posed a threat to natural resources. Small farms with less than 20 hectares were
unable to produce at competitive prices.

This was the second loan after the Rio Grande do Sul Project to address rural poverty and natural
resources management in Brazil and given the project's highly decentralized nature, a detailed
comprehensive project manual to coordinate and guide the project's work was developed. The manual
was revised on an on-going basis and two formal amendments to the manual were produced on
March 2002 and May 2003. This type of strategy was very important in adjusting the Project
implementation every time a potential risk was envisaged.

One important factor affecting the project has been the rate of exchange of the domestic currency
against the U.S. dollar which was impossible to predict as from the formulation stage. After the crisis
of January 1999 the exchange rate suddenly rocketed from 1 to more than 2 Brazilian Reais per U.S.
dollar. All financial calculations were distorted as a consequence of the new rate of exchange and the
State administration had to finance greater amounts of domestic money than what was initially
estimated. This fact had implications on delays in making counterpart money available, partial
cancellation of the loan and affected the performance of the project.

There were some important limitations in the gathering of price offers for inputs and capital goods for
beneficiaries residing in small municipalities. This fact in many cases affected the speed of the
subproject cycle at the beginning but was resolved later on.

The design of the Project and the operational manual gave special consideration to assistance
mechanism through decentralized institutions, ample beneficiaries participation throughout the
subproject's cycle, standardization of subproject documents and cost-sharing arrangements between
the Project, beneficiaries and Municipal institutions.

Vilas Rurais

The project also had a specific, innovative, subcomponent called Vilas Rurais, aimed at beneficiaries
defined as landless seasonal farm laborers who regularly migrate with their families from region to
region. According to the Operation Manual, there were about 300,000 such people in the State of
Paraná at the time of project preparation. The Vilas Rurais subcomponent aimed to provide better
living conditions and income generation alternatives for people living in such situations.

The Project created an innovative housing program for such people complemented by the following
interventions financed by the project: production activities close to the housing; community
development; joint activities including capacity building and training. Each unit has a 0.5ha,
cultivatable area of land sufficient for enabling subsistence farming and a small surpluss and
including a 44m2 house with energy and water supply, relatively good access to an urban center to
facilitate access to basic social services such as health and education and access to a transportation
system to facilitate access to job opportunities and market centers.



                                                  11

The project ultimately supported 15,609 families to settle in 403 Vilas Rurais (equivalent to about
80,000 people. Studies conducted by IPARDER have shown that 72% of the 98% of families
performing productive agricultural activities had a production surplus in 2005. The income generated
by the surplus production represented, on average, 10% of families' income. Based on this
information, the Vilas Rurais objectives can be considered to have been fully achieved.

7.2 Implementation

Implementation was slowed down by the changes in administration that occurred twice during the life
of the project. The first occurred in January 1999 almost one year after the beginning of the project
execution. The second one was in January 2003 shortly after the mid term review and not far from the
project initial closing date of September 2003. Each of the three administrations had their own views
on how to organize and manage the project. There were delays in the execution of some components
and sub-components because of changing strategies. That was the case of the rural feeder roads
subcomponent which started in year 2000. Also project's acquisition of goods was delayed and only
started in 2002. The computerized project management system (SAFF) which has been vital for
recording data and supporting project decisions also got off to a late start, becoming operational in
1999.

Given the financial constraints faced by the borrower, the flow of counterpart funds was irregular and
this was exacerbated by the devaluation of the currency in January 1999. Ultimately this led to the
loan's closing date being extended twice by more than three years and to the cancellation of US$ 10
million of the Loan. Budgetary restrictions and delays in transferring counterpart funds to the project
and the failure to maintain a reasonable balance of funds available, affected the timing of almost
every project component. Additionally, certain slow bureaucratic routines were not synchronized with
crop-production cycles and thus produced further delays in the implementation of some subprojects.
The Mid Term Review took place in 2001 and recommended a suite of actions to be undertaken in
order to improve Project performance. The most important ones referred to the need of better
articulation of municipal and regional councils with the UGP, the improvement of communication
between those institutions, the revision of parameters of eligibility criteria and maximum amounts per
beneficiary, the inclusion of rural youth as beneficiaries and the need to better disseminate the results
of research findings to the rural communities.

7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

A very comprehensive M&E was been established by the UGP. A Management Information System
(SMG) called SAFF was developed by a private firm under a five year contract in the early days of
project implementation. SAFF was designed to cover the monitoring of physical and financial
progress of the project. There has always been technical staff maintaining the system and adapting
new requirements faced by the different institutions responsible for project implementation. The
system provided an adequate definition of input and output indicators and the responsibility of each
participating institution in the transferring of required information in an accurate and timely manner.

CODAPAR, in its role of financial agent managing FUNPARANA, was responsible for collecting,
analyzing and verifying at the field level all data related to the assistance provided to beneficiaries.
As part of the M&E system, CODAPAR conducted annual in-depth field monitoring of a sample of
10% of subprojects. The main aspects monitored by CODAPAR at subproject level were:
         a) the extent to which the borrowers took advantage of the goods, materials and other inputs
         provided by the project;



                                                   12

        b) the timely provision of the goods, materials and other inputs of the project;
        c) the level of cooperation between beneficiaries in subprojects involving collective activities
        such as utilization of communal equipment; and
        d) the support of communities and municipalities in cases where there was a lack of family
        labor available at the beneficiary level.

During the life of the Project, CODAPAR carried out 25,883 control procedures and when problems
were detected, the UGP, Municipal Councils and Regional Commissions were informed and
attempted to find the best possible solution. Control procedures by year is shown in the following
table:

Table 5. Number of subprojects carried out each year

The CCPG within the Secretariat of Planning created the UAP as an advisory unit responsible for
Project evaluation activities. In this role, the UAP contracted and supervised the Mid Term Review
which was performed by a consortium comprised of CEPEA, ESALQ and the USP between October
and November 2001. The UAP also contracted and supervised the Instituto Paranaense de
Desenvolvimiento Economico e Social (Paraná Institute of economic and social development or
IPARDES) which was responsible for the final evaluation of the social and economic impact of the
Project on Institutional Strengthening, Poor Communities, Natural Resources Management (phases 1
and 2) and Vilas Rurais. They produced five final reports which included ex-ante and ex-post
assessments on each subject.

7.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Project has complied well with environmental safeguards, as monitored by the borrower's
management team. The watershed-based approach of the natural resources management component
complemented increasing agricultural production with soil and water conservation, the expansion of
the area under forest cover and the rational utilization and disposal of agrochemicals. Most
subprojects supported by FUNPARANA have been small in scale and posed minor threats, if any, to
the environment. The Project ensured proper environmental screening of subprojects along the project
cycle. Specialists from the Environmental Institute of Paraná (IAP) had been active in the screening
process at municipal, regional and UGP level. The Implementation Manual of the Project included
clear procedures for the way environmental screening was to be performed and defined subprojects
that would not be eligible for project financing.

Adequate coordination with the GEF funded Paraná Biodiversity Project has been articulated from
August 2002 when the GEF grant became effective. An estimated 700 subprojects were implemented
in microcatchments included in the biodiversity corridors supported by the GEF project. Those
subprojects benefited 10,675 small farmers which were also supported by Paraná Biodiversity Project
with specific activities. The total amount of funds disbursed to these complementary subprojects was
US$ 427,000 representing about US$ 40 per beneficiary.

Works on road rehabilitation and restoration, mainly for existing paved roads were all carefully
screened for any negative effect on the environment.




                                                  13

There were also high levels of compliance of the planned assistance to rural poor communities,
women's organizations, young members of farm families and indigenous communities. Very poor
rural families accounted for 83% of the total number of beneficiaries supported by the Project, as can
be seen in the table 6 below.

7.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

EMATER and Municipal Institutions have both been strengthened by the Project. They have gained
experience in managing rural poor community issues, in dealing with natural resources management
practices and in coordinating activities of existing institutions at local level. This ensures adequate
post-completion attention of major issues affecting poor small farmers in the future. Institutional
organization at local level is now well prepared to make the best use of potential assistance provided
by the various existing state and federal programs related to rural poor and natural resources
management.

The State of Paraná, through the joint efforts of SEAB and CCPP is preparing a new project aimed at
the development of the poorest regions of the State. This potential project would benefit 9 territories,
7.7 million ha and 1.7 million inhabitants where there is less relative development of social and
economic indicators. Many of these territories have been supported by the Paraná 12 Meses Project
but in a lesser extent than other territories in the state.

8. Assessment of Outcomes

8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project's objectives were highly relevant and consistent both with the priorities of the State
Government of Paraná and the Federal Government and also with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) as stated in the report discussed at the Board on June 29, 1995 and in the progress
report of June 27, 1996. The objectives were highly compatible with the Bank's strategies regarding
the provision of loans to the Brazilian states. It was built on the existing policy and institutional
framework and did not pursue key policy and institutional reforms, but rather focused on
strengthening the decentralization process and progressive delegation of decision-making
responsibilities at the state and local levels. It based its operational approach on the main elements
raised by previous Bank experience in other Brazilian states in order to alleviate rural poverty and
improve natural resources management. It also focused on demand-driven and participatory
approaches as the core of a capacity building process in which beneficiaries would become
responsible for the definition of priorities.




                                                    14

8.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The principal objective of the project was to improve natural resources management and
sustainability, promote sound soil and water management practices and to improve incomes in the
poor rural communities. It is considered that this was achieved satisfactorily. In particular,
substantial progress was made towards achieving the principal and subsidiary objectives defined in
the SAR.

The effect of the Project on the socio-economic characteristics of beneficiaries as a result of poverty
alleviation activities was evaluated by IPARDES and their ex-ante and ex-post evaluation (2000-
2005) shows that the impact on quality of life of beneficiaries has been very significant, especially
regarding family social infrastructure. More than 90% of families evaluated had been attended by the
various support lines on poverty alleviation. The evaluation of income generation and communal
entrepreneurial activities by IPARDES showed lower levels of coverage but was nevertheless
considered to have had a positive impact.

The project also directly contributed to improving soil condition and water quality. The ex-ante and
ex-post socio-economic evaluation (1999-2005) which was also conducted by IPARDES, determined
a 97.4% of beneficiaries of the Project correctly implemented the recommended techniques on
increasing vegetable protection of soils and on water infiltration. The percentage of beneficiaries that
correctly implemented techniques on control of surface water damages was 59%. On the other hand,
techniques on improved pasture management were effectively implemented by a low level of
beneficiaries (less than 10%).

The promotion of poverty alleviation activities and sound soil and water management practices was
made possible through the participative sub-project formulation scheme that was implemented at
local level. In municipal councils, where a great number of institutions representative of the major
components of the local communities could discuss priorities altogether with technical specialists
from EMATER, a sense of a communal approach to the problems faced by individual farmers was
developed. This also contributed to the development of social organization of rural communities and
increased confidence in their role in the development process.

8.3 Efficiency


Rating: Satisfactory

Despite the fact that it is too early to fully measure the benefits of the project's long-term impact
(especially the impacts of the Institutional Building, Training and Research components), an ex-post
cost benefit analysis and economic rate of return calculation have been conducted, for the investments
made by FUNPARANA that include activities under components I and II. The ERR is estimated to be
25.3%. This value is consistent with the analysis provided by the SAR of 23.5%, based on the
application of a sample of possible project-supported actions.

Further Information on models, level of investments, costs, outputs, net income and internal financial
and economic rate of return is included in Annex 5.

8.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating


Rating: Satisfactory

The Project was very well formulated. The main objective has proved to be relevant on the basis of
social, economic, natural resources, environmental and biodiversity considerations. The overall
strategy was well designed taking into account former experiences in Paraná and other Brazilian
States. Institutional design was appropriate to conditions prevailing at the State and local levels.

The project had a major impact on improving living conditions of rural and not rural poor
communities which had previously been unattended by public policies. There was also a clear
positive impact on natural resources management complementing what had been done by the
previous LM1 Project in Paraná. A very significant proportion of all microcatchments in the State
received support which substantially diminished the risk of deterioration of natural resources in the
State.

8.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As mentioned above, the project was considered to have had a profound impact on poverty and social
development. Further assessment of this will be possible in the future, but and initial analysis shown
in Annex 5 demonstrates significant increases in incomes following project interventions.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project has been institutionalized within the UGP (which will remain in place following project
closure) and implementing agencies and, particularly with the demonstration of the project's success,
this has led to sustainable improvements in approaches to natural resources management and poverty
alleviation. Institutional strengthening was also a key aspect of the project, particularly as the UGP
had to coordinate the work of four main implementing agencies. Through the project, these agencies
have been both strengthened individually and better integrated to increase the efficiency of their
continuing activities.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)


No significant unintended outcomes or impacts were noted.

9. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Sustainability of project benefits is considered likely and the risk to the development outcome in the
future is correspondingly moderate . The project has become institutionalized and jointly with the
former LMI Project is considered a model in respect of natural resources management and rural
poverty alleviation. SEAB has decided to maintain the UGP in the SEAB with the Coordinator and
Sub-coordinator working full time and some technical staff working part time in order to provide
support to some activities related to rural poor communities and institutions at local level. A GEF
project is currently under implementation since 2002. With actions on biodiversity conservation in 3
biodiversity corridors following the technical and methodological strategy used in the project.

The positive influence of income generating subprojects will probably make it possible for PSM2,
PSM3 and small family enterprises to continue the process of technological change, giving special
consideration to sound natural resources management practices. Many natural resources management,
income generation and social infrastructure practices that have been applied by Paraná 12 Meses will
continue to be applied by means of extension work provided by EMATER. It is almost certain that
EMATER, both on its own and with partner institutions, will continue promoting the application of
new technologies which have been developed during the execution of Paraná 12 Meses in the fields
of small-scale production systems, community development, agroecological practices, environmental
monitoring and beneficiary training.

Activities carried out under the project were aimed at improving natural resources management and
income generation and promoting better integration of sound water and soil management practices.
However, there is still room for improvement and this will be necessary in order to consolidate what
has been done through Paraná Rural and Paraná 12 Meses. It is therefore highly desirable that a
follow-on project be implemented in order to consolidate strategies and practices all over the state
and especially in those regions which fall below the average level of development. New projects
should address development inequalities through an integrated approach providing financing,
technical assistance and training to poor communities of less developed regions.

10. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

10.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry


Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance is considered to have been satisfactory throughout the entire project cycle.
The project was identified in 1995 as a result of the Bank's former experience in the State of Paraná
and in other southern states in Brazil regarding natural resources and poverty alleviation. Throughout
the processing of the loan, from identification to approval, there was a strong dialogue within the
Bank and between the Bank and with the government of Paraná concerning key aspects of project
design. The Bank preparation team managed to get involved and find the means to contribute its vast
experience gained in Paraná and other Brazilian states in the design of objectives, components,
strategies and operational practices. The Bank has continuously provided its considerable experience
on policy dialogue and operations dealing with rural investment funds and facilitated access to
information and advisory capacity on design issues and lessons learned with comparable projects.


                                                 17

During preparation, the highly-qualified local team was supported by an experienced interdisciplinary
team of Bank and FAO/CP specialists. Attention was paid during preparation (as shown n the SAR) to
issues of appropriate technology, to the need to balance increased production, income generation,
quality of life and natural resources conservation and to the need for institutional strengthening,
coordination and development at the state, regional and local levels.


(b) Quality of Supervision


Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's supervision performance is considered to have been satisfactory. An intensive
supervision strategy was implemented, which included 50 supervision missions in addition to the
MTR mission in October 2001 and the ICR mission in January 2006.This intensive effort was also
characterized by continuity, as the project had the same Task Manager from identification to ICR and
the supervising team had very few modifications. The Bank was flexible and supportive, adjusting
quickly to the Borrower when new state administrations took office. The Bank's approach provided a
combination of fiduciary monitoring and technical assistance and resulted in the development of a
strong relationship with the UGP and with authorities of SEAB, CCPG, EMATER, CODAPAR and
other relevant institutions in Paraná. The Bank supervision missions, responsiveness and client
oriented approach helped to address the various issues and constraints that arose during the life of the
project. The MTR was carried out in October-November 2001 and the mission defined a series of
actions necessary to improve the implementation of the project.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance


Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is considered to have been satisfactory. The project was identified as
a result of a thorough and timely analysis of Paraná's agricultural problems and its preparation was an
inter-active exercise involving the State administration, FAO/CP and the Bank in which the latter
played a key role. The Bank was committed to producing work of a high standard during preparation
and implementation and assigned top expertise, adequate resources, intensive supervision and
proactive dialogue. Project supervision focused on key aspects and Bank management showed a
pragmatic flexibility in the face of changing circumstances, particularly regarding the difficulties in
budgetary allocations. This flexibility resulted in six amendments, two extensions of the closing date
and the necessary adjustments to allow for the financing of specific activities to alleviate the impact of
the various problems experienced by Paraná during this time.

The Bank was also instrumental in disseminating project experiences through a series of actions
including three study tours, two presentations at Rural Week and the promotion of regional
workshops jointly with WBI, with the objective of sharing experiences with other NRM projects in
the region (Southern Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay).

10.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower was fully committed to the project and to its aim of developing improved natural
resources management practices, to improve poverty alleviation in the rural sector and to develop a
strategy of sound water and soil management practices, all of it favoring decentralized and
participatory planning and demand driven strategies. There was ample scope for the interchange of
freely expressed opinions and there was a highly participative approach involving public institutions
at central and local levels, private institutions and beneficiaries associations and organizations. An
extremely detailed Project Implementation Manuals was timely prepared and two amendments to the
Manual were made each of them with specific adjustments to target beneficiary criteria, financial
limits per family and other operational considerations.

Project management was satisfactory. The project implementing agencies were coordinated by a
well-staffed UGP comprised exclusively of government officials and its performance was satisfactory
for most of implementation period, although occasionally counterpart funds were not assigned in a
timely manner. There were also some delays in the acquisition of certain project inputs that
subsequently created problems with the adjustments of investments to the proper biological timing
needs at the farm level. The municipalities that participated in the project had an important role in its
promotion and implementation. They participated as partners providing technical staff, machinery and
equipment and made it possible to accomplish certain tasks. The contribution of municipalities to the
project has contributed additional financing to the total project figures. Beneficiaries have also
contributed to the success of the project by providing family labor, inputs and some financial
resources which also added to project figures.

Rating: Satisfactory

Implementing agencies were coordinated and guided by the UGP in a satisfactory way. Given the
project's structure, interagency coordination was a major challenge, which was adequately achieved
mainly due to the strong involvement of the government office. The UGP was integrated at a central
level and was responsible for procurement, audits, monitoring and evaluation and supervision of the
decentralized operations. The integration of UGP was slightly disturbed each time administration
changed but throughout, the quality of the technical staff was very good.

11. Lessons Learned

The project generated considerable set of important lessons that will be important for the definition of
NRM and Rural Poverty programs and government policies in the future. The lessons will also be
particularly useful for the design and implementation of future Bank projects. Particular lessons
learned include:

Project Management. Project experience showed that a skillful and dedicated Project Management
Unit, with appropriate political support and capable of establishing and maintaining a dialogue with
the various executing agencies, is essential to successful implementation. In this case, considering the
challenges often inherent in inter-institutional coordination in complex and highly decentralized
projects, the smooth implementation ­ often under difficult institutional and funding conditions ­
reflects well on the performance of the UGP.

Technical Strategy. Pre-existing knowledge of the state's potential and land management problems,
resulting from studies and accumulated experience from the previous Bank-financed LM1 project,
coupled with the existence of relevant technologies developed by research, permitted the formulation
of a clear and challenging technical strategy that was vital for this project's success. The decision to
establish a fund to provide financial incentives for NRM and social activities proved to be a key
instrument for the implementation of the technical strategy.

Implementation Planning. The use of microcatchments as planning units was a key to success. This
planning approach, expanded from the model used in Land Management to incorporate integrated
rural poverty alleviation strategies, showed the inter-dependence of all farm units within a
microcatchment and contributed to being able to consider small and medium farmers as
complementary elements of a single expanded farming system.

Project Manual. For a project such as this, a high quality comprehensive project manual is essential
in order to guide and coordinate activities.

Buy-in From Beneficiaries. It was very important for poor beneficiaries to buy-in to the
implementation of subprojects through family labor or other contributions as it serves to create a
sense of ownership.

Budgetary Issues. On-time provision of counterpart funds with strict compliance with the amounts
included in annual budgets has proved to be vital for effective implementation of this type of project
where agronomic practices are involved which cannot be postponed as a result of bureaucratic delays.

Bank Support and Agroecological Cycles. When a project is faced with frequent changes in
administration, it is important for the Bank to conduct an intense schedule of supervision missions.
It is also important to maintain a flexible attitude towards changes and to facilitate adjustments such
as those involving types of beneficiaries, limits in the provision of funds to individual beneficiaries
and emergency situations.

Participation. Natural resources management, rural poverty alleviation and income generation in
very poor communities should always include an effective process of participatory and decentralized
planning.




                                                  20

Subproject Flow. A highly decentralized structure, including regional commissions working closely
with municipal councils, acting like their advisors and articulating activities with project management
units are very important to create an efficient flow of subprojects.

Management Tools. The availability of sound project management tools like SAFF and highly
skilled professional services backing this information system has been very important in terms of the
performance of the Project Implementation Unit.

Financial Agent. The designation of a separate institution or agent to deal with the financial aspects
of subprojects has proved to be very important in terms of agility in the process of evaluating
technical aspects and paying providers of inputs and capital goods involved.

Training. Project implementation benefited greatly from training technical and administrative staff of
partner institutions and members of municipal and regional councils, on technical, administrative and
managerial tools.

12. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

In addition to the comments provided in the attached letter in Annex 15, during the ICR mission the
Borrower suggested that there should be a pre-implementation period which would permit all
institutions involved in a new project to gain experience and make the necessary arrangements in
their internal coordinating structure before engaging with potential beneficiaries. They also raised the
issue of having a high-level deliberative commission involving various influential, decision-making
public agencies which would assure the provision of adequate public policies on issues related to the
project. Another issue raised by the UGP deals with the problems frequently faced at local level for
the acquisition of certain goods and services. In this respect, the passing of new legislation could
improve the role of local providers of goods and services in bidding processes and would decrease
acquisition costs for many items.

The CCPG raised an issue related to institutional coordination. They consider that the Project
Deliberative Commission (CODEPRO) should have been better organized and implemented as a
means for solving inter-institutional confrontation during project implementation period.


(b) Cofinanciers


N/A - all co-financing was provided by the Borrower.


(c) Other partners and stakeholders

Beneficiary organizations and local governments raised the issue of the important lag between the
moment subprojects are approved by the different institutions participating in the project cycle and
the final reception of funds to implement subprojects investments. In certain periods of the year or in
certain moments of the political cycle there can be important time lags which are very disappointing
for potential beneficiaries.

Annex 1. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The objectives of the Paraná Rural Poverty Alleviation and Natural Resources Management Project
(referred to in this report as Paraná 12 Meses- the local name given to it by the State Government)
were to increase the incomes and improve the living conditions of approximately 255,000 rural poor
and small farmer households by supporting the implementation of community-demanded investment
subprojects. The project also aimed to protect the State's natural resources by promoting sustainable
practices for improved land management and soil and water quality conservation in an area of
approximately 8.1 million ha.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The Project Development Objectives remained unchanged throughout implementation.

Various financial indicators were changed during the implementation period as a result of project
amendments. The only physical indicator that was changed was the number of kilometers of feeder
roads to be rehabilitated which was reduced from 8,000 to 6,000. This was due to the fact that in 2003
the strategy was changed and rural feeder roads rehabilitation was partly substituted by the
rehabilitation of 661 km of paved roads and the reconstruction of 190 km of state roads. Both types of
works were more expensive per km than works on rural feeder roads.




                                                 22

The total amount of funds invested by the project was changed from US$ 353.5 million to US$ 290.9
million (US$ 165 million by the Bank and US$ 125.9 million by the State). In the fifth amendment to
the loan agreement of September 2004 there was a cancellation of US$ 10 million of the loan amount
as a consequence of some difficulties in the application of funds to CODAPAR subprojects.
Modification of the amount of funds to be provided by the State Government was caused by recurrent
shortages experienced in several annual budgets.

CODAPAR target figures were reduced from US$ 157.2 million to US$ 153.5 million, COHAPAR
target figures were reduced from US$ 90 million to US$ 82 million and DER target figures were
reduced from US$ 37 million to US$ 22.5 million. Target figures for goods acquisition were reduced
to US$ 4.4 million, for consulting services to US$ 23 million and for recurrent costs to US$ 3 million.

Annex 4. Outputs by Component

Component I. Social Area Development - Poverty Alleviation

Through FUNPARANA (managed by CODAPAR) the Project disbursed US$ 47.6 million to
support practices and activities related to this component in 4,467 subprojects including poor
communities and 1,067 subprojects including Vilas Rurais This figure represents 54.3% of the
amount of money estimated in the SAR. There were 37,520 beneficiaries living in poor
communities and 16,031 beneficiaries living in new Vilas Rurais that received support by the
Project which represents 148.7% more beneficiaries than the estimate of 36,000 in the SAR
(18,000 in poor communities and 18,000 in Vilas Rurais). The amount of money received
through FUNPARANA by beneficiaries was US$ 987 in the case of poor communities and
US$ 658 in the case of Vilas Rurais which is very low compared with the amounts of US$ 3,633
and US$ 1,237 per beneficiary estimated in the SAR. The devaluation of the Real on January
1999 had a very important effect on the amount of money disbursed per beneficiary. This fact
explains the low level of achievement of the estimated amount of money to be disbursed in this
component.

Through COHAPAR, the Project disbursed US$ 70.3 million for construction of houses in Vilas
Rurais. This figure represents 86.7% of the amount of money estimated in the SAR. There were
15,609 houses built in 405 Vilas Rurais while the SAR estimated 18,000 houses would be built
which represent a level of compliance of 86.7%. The final cost of each house in Vilas Rurais
was US$ 4,506 a figure almost equal to the estimated SAR figure of US$ 4,555.

Component II. Productive Area Development - Natural Resources

Subcomponent I. Natural Resources Management and Conservation - Phase 1

Soil and Water Management

The total amount of money disbursed in activities related to soil and water management was
US$ 28.4 million which is 69.4% of the US$ 40.9 million estimated in the SAR. The number of
beneficiaries attended through FUNPARANA was 61,649 rural poor families. This accounts for
61.7% of the 100,000 estimated as potential beneficiaries in the SAR. There were 6,479 technical
subprojects submitted and the average investment per beneficiary was US$ 460.

Environmental degradation reduction activities have been supported by the Project with US$ 10.1
million which is 90.6% over the estimated value of US$ 5.3 million. This substantial difference is
explained by the great amount of money disbursed for supplying water supply facilities to poor
communities. The estimated cost of those facilities was US$ 2,028 while their actual cost was
US$ 8,208. Soil fertility improvement activities were also very demanded in subprojects,
especially lime application which was estimated with a figure of 15,459 tons while the actual
figure was 619,000 tons - 40 times the estimate.

Rural Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Paved Roads Rehabilitation and Restoration

This group of activities to be performed by DER was considered ex-ante very important as a
strategy for rural poor community integration and development. In the SAR it was estimated a
figure of 10.2% of the Loan to be disbursed in feeder road rehabilitation. Due to a change of
strategy in 2003 a high priority was given to the rehabilitation and restoration of paved roads in
regions where their bad maintenance conditions was affecting the potential development of poor
communities. As a result there was a disbursement of US$ 44.4 million from the Loan instead of



                                                33

US$ 12,500 million and a disbursement of US$ 25 million of State funds instead of US$ 9.9
million. Total disbursement on road rehabilitation activities accounted for 27% of the Loan and
for 27.1% of total project disbursement.

Physical performance in the case of feeder roads was an accomplishment of 36% of the estimated
figure in the SAR (2,169 km against 6,000 km) while in the case of rehabilitation and restoration
of paved roads there was an accomplishment of 77.8% in the rehabilitation figures (514 km
against 661 km) and 100% in the restoration figures (189 km against 190 km) that were estimated
in 2003.

The CCPG analyzed the socio-economic consequences of the improvement of rural roads on the
reduction of losses throughout transportation and on human health, education and agricultural
diversification of backward regions. Taking into consideration studies by IPEA and the World
Bank (Technical Paper 409- 1998) they estimated a reduction of transportation losses from 10%
to 7% and an increase of the same order in rural incomes. Information from various sources and
in particular from a study performed by the World Bank in 1993 consider essential to have a
good net of roads in rural developing regions in order to facilitate the expansion of good public
services in education and health care.

Subcomponent II. Natural Resources Management and Conservation - Phase II

There were 26,103 beneficiaries supported by activities included in this subcomponent
representing 88.9% of the estimated figure of 29,360 beneficiaries. The amount of money
disbursed was US$ 19.5 million which is 78.4% of the estimated amount of US$ 24.9 million.
There were 2,751 subprojects presented to FUNPARANA involving beneficiaries which received
on average US$ 748.

Fruit production activities were not highly demanded by project beneficiaries. Only 22.9% of the
estimated figure of US$ 8.4 million was disbursed. On the other hand horticulture production
activities were heavily demanded. There was an accomplishment of 183.2% of the estimated
financial figure for these activities (US$ 0.7 million) in the SAR. Milk production activities were
given priority by small farmers. There were 16,439 farmers attended by the Project which
represents 63% of all beneficiaries supported in this subcomponent. There were 6,321 milking
equipment demanded by subprojects which is a very large amount compared with the estimated
figure of 320 considered in the SAR.

Milk production was strongly demanded by small farmers basically because it generates income
throughout the whole year and there is a demanding market for milk as a consequence of the
special program developed by SAA of Paraná that was called " Milk for Young Boys".

Component III. Institutional Strengthening

Subcomponent 1. Logistic Support

At the beginning of the implementation period there was a provision of US$ 4 million from the
Loan and US$ 4.9 million from State funds to buy cars, computer material and furniture basically
for SEAB and EMATER. There were various budget revisions and finally US$ 2 million from
the Loan and US$ 2.5 million from State funds were allocated to this subcomponent. There was a
total disbursement of US$ 3.4 million, US$ 1.5 million from the Loan and US$ 1.9 million from
the State, which represents 76% of the estimated figure of US$ 4.5 million.

The UGP bought for itself and for the Project Regional Commissions 51 cars, 20 computers, 12
printers, 12 stabilizers and a series of different furniture. EMATER acquired 454 cars, 101
computers and 118 printers.

It took a long time to the UGP and EMATER to complete acquisition procedures and only in the
fifth year of the Project most of them could be finished. There was only one international bidding
procedure to buy cars for EMATER. All the rest of acquisitions were national bidding procedures
including the buying of cars by SEAB. The distribution of disbursement within this
subcomponent is shown in the following table:

 Others                          US$      93,062

Subcomponent 2. Training Technical Staff

There was a prevision of implementing 358 training events until the first closing date of
September 2002. Instead there were 905 events and 35.588 technical staff (with repetition) was
trained in 8 years of the Project. The major part of the events took place from year 2000 to year
2004. Technical staff training has been essential for the efficient development of activities related
to poverty alleviation and natural resources management phase I and II.

Subcomponent 3. Agricultural Prices Information System

With the support given by the Project the DERAL office of the SEAB could perform in a much
efficient way their role as providers of accurate price information over time to the rural poor
farmers and so improve their decision making process. Total investment in this subcomponent
was US$ 1 million. Currently the SAA through DERAL maintain a home page in internet in
order to keep farmers well and easily informed.

Subcomponent 4. Advisory Services to the Project

It has been very important the role of the CCPG of the State Planning and Coordination
Secretariat as an advisory group to the UGP in the SEAB. They were supported by the Project
and gave a very efficient backing in activities such as project formulation, supervising missions,
results evaluation and provision of solutions to the implementing problems envisaged. They also
played a very important role in coordinating activities with the State Finance Secretariat and
SEAIN in federal government.

Component IV. Technological Development

There was a prevision of US$ 23 million to be disbursed by this component. The final figure for
disbursements has been US$ 14.3 million representing 62.1% of the estimated figure.

Subcomponent 1. Research, Extension and Studies

Disbursement in this subcomponent has been US$ 3 million while the estimated figure was US$
5 million. Accomplishment of target figure has been 60.4%. There were four groups of activities
in this subcomponent: a) research by IAPAR; b) research by demand; c) network of reference
farms and d) studies.

IAPAR was responsible for 40 research projects on a series of different subjects covering from
basic research to validation and communication projects. All projects have a final report and their
more relevant information has been included in the internet address of the Project. There have
been more projects than the original estimate. In the SAR there was a prevision of 37 projects
(IAPAR plus demand driven research projects) while IAPAR alone implemented more than that
figure.

The Competitive Research Fund finally included a series of 17 research projects. There were 6
research institutions involved with these projects, including state universities, federal universities,
foundations and societies.


                                                 36

The organization of the network of reference farms disbursed US$ 0.7 million during
implementation period. A total of 178 small farms and 2 agro-industrial units have been involved
in the application of 60 production systems related to 23 agricultural products. Included in that
figure there were 13 units for testing and validation and 65 technological reference units of which
22 tackled ecological rehabilitation, 6 were part of legal reserve units and 37 were related to
forest-pasture systems.

The agro-economic set of studies included 12 subjects on different aspects of agricultural and
fishing issues. There was a prevision of 14 studies in the SAR but some of them could not be
concluded. Many institutions were involved with these studies including universities,
associations, foundations and other services. All 12 studies have their final report and their
relevant findings were included in the project website page.

Subcomponent 2. Evaluation Reports

There have been 11 evaluation reports produced for the Project. There were 10 of them under the
responsibility of IAPAR and were related to ex-ante and ex-post evaluation of the most important
components of the Project. Evaluation reports included rural poor communities, Vilas Rurais,
natural resources management phases 1 and 2, and institutional organization.

On 2001 the Mid Term Review was carried out by the Agricultural Studies Foundation " Luiz de
Queiroz" -Piracicaba -Sao Paulo.

Subcomponent 3. Technical Assistance and Training to Beneficiaries

The total amount of money disbursed by the Project in this subcomponent was US$ 11.3 million
which compared with the estimated prevision of US$ 18 million makes an accomplishment of
62.5%.

Technical assistance to beneficiaries was provided by EMATER and private firms. EMATER
was technically responsible for 14,761 subprojects which involved 121,338 beneficiaries while
private firms attended 4,830 beneficiaries. There were 1,476 communities with 46,694 poor
farmers and fishermen beneficiaries, 405 Vilas Rurais with 15,609 beneficiaries, 1,244
microcatchments with 55,574 beneficiaries and 834 specialized groups with 20,778 beneficiaries
that were supported with technical assistance provided by EMATER and private firms. Total
disbursements amounted to US$ 3.3 million which represented 32.6% of the prevision in the
SAR. Additionally to EMATER and private firms COHAPAR also provided technical assistance
to beneficiaries in the Vilas Rurais through social assistants that were temporarily contracted for
that purpose.

Training activities with beneficiaries included seminars, field days, courses, meetings and
symposiums. A total of 8,529 events took place on training activities and there were 680,726
beneficiaries (with repetition) participating in those events. The estimate of money to be used in
training in the SAR was US$ 8 million. The final disbursement figure was US$ 7.99 million -
almost 100% of the original estimate.

Annex 5. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

Economic Analysis

Overall, the project aimed to improve the living conditions and levels of income of Paraná's poor rural
households by supporting the implementation of community-demanded investment subprojects that would
increase the productivity of small-scale farming by modernizing and diversifying traditional production
systems and integrating them vertically within the agricultural industry. The project improved natural
resources management on 1,060,805 hectares with nearly 65,000 small farmer beneficiaries and supported
the development of sustainable production systems consistent with sustainable land use.

The analysis of the project's economic impact is not simple, particularly due to the difficulties of
measuring the returns on social investments such as sanitation, housing as well as research and training.
Investment in these activities totals around US$ 124.8 million, corresponding to 48.7 % of the project's
investments.

The unit cost of various project components compare favorably with the cost-effectiveness benchmark set
by the SAR, as shown in the following table.

As table 5.1 shows, the project invested US$ 47.6 million in the Social Development component, which
has been implemented through FUNPARANA. There were 37,520 beneficiaries living in poor
communities and 16,031 beneficiaries living in new Vilas Rurais that were supported by the Project
corresponding to an average investment per beneficiary of US$ 994 for poor communities and US$ 658
for Vilas Rurais. This is lower than the levels estimated in the SAR of US$ 3,633 and US$ 1,237
respectively. In addition, the project disbursed US$ 70.3 million through COHAPAR for improving
housing for 15,609 families in Vilas Rurais. The final investment per family in Vilas Rurais was US$
4,506 ­ a figure almost equal to the estimated SAR figure of US$ 4,555.



                                                 38

Studies conducted by IPARDES concluded that investments under Component I have had a very positive
impact on small-farmers' living conditions. In the case of Vilas Rurais, in addition to the improvements to
sanitation and housing, studies have shown that 72% of the 98% of families performing productive
agricultural activities had a production surplus in 2005. The income generated by the surplus production
represented, on average, 10% of families' income.

As a result of the Component II (Productive Development), a total of US$38.5 million was invested in
reducing environmental degradation. The project has supported 6,479 technical subprojects benefiting
61,649 rural poor families with, on average, US$ 460 being invested per family. Soil fertility
improvement activities and water supply facility subprojects were in particular demand.

Studies conducted by IPARDES compared production increases with and without project support. Results
achieved shown that: (i) the higher the level of implementation of project activities, the higher are the
increases in productivity in principal agricultural products; and (ii) the producers who receive project
support achieve higher productivity that those that were not supported. However, due to the price
variation of agriculture commodities (see chart 5.1), the research was only able to demonstrate economic
gains related to productivity increases for PS (subsistence farmer) and PSM1 (Small Market-Oriented
Farmer). This was partly because economic returns from soya and corn have decreased since 2003. (See
figure 5.1 in Annex 13.1).

In addition to soil and water conservation improvements under Component II, financial support was also
provided to increase the productivity of small-scale farming communities through modernizing and
diversifying traditional production systems and integrating them vertically within the agricultural industry.
A total of 2,751 subprojects was supported by FUNPARANA involving 26,103 beneficiaries who on
average received US$ 748, totaling US$ 19.5 million of investments.

Gains in productivity had several indirect impacts on the economy. In order to evaluate these impacts, an
econometric model was used on a sample of the 200 municipalities that received the most project
resources compared to their income level, from the total of 399 state municipalities. Data limitations
necessitated using a model which explains GDP 2003 as a function of variables that represent the general
level of economic development (GDP 1999, rural credit stock) and investments made during the period
(FUNPARANA and DER resources, transport and sanitation expenditures). The econometric results show
that FUNPARANA investment was highly significantly correlated with income growth. Table 5.2 in
Annex 13.1 shows the information generated with the econometric evaluation and further information
about this analysis can be found in additional project documentation.

From this analysis, it is possible to estimate that, on average, each Brazilian Real invested in a
municipality generated an increase of R$ 2.6 in the municipality's GDP. Under this estimation,
FUNPARANA's investment of US$ 95.5 million during project implementation has been shown to be
associated with US$ 256.9 million in income generation.

Another activity supported under Component II was Rural Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Paved Roads
Rehabilitation and Restoration. A total of US$ 69.4 million of the loan was invested in these activities.
The CCPG analyzed the socio-economic outcomes of the improvement of rural roads on the reduction of
costs throughout transportation and on human health, education and agricultural diversification of
backward regions. Taking into consideration studies by IPEA and the World Bank (Technical Paper 409-
1998) they estimated a reduction of transportation costs from between 10 and 7 % and an increase of the
same order in rural incomes. Information from various sources and in particular from a study performed
by the World Bank in 1993 considered a good network of roads in rural developing regions to be essential
for facilitating expansion of public services in education and health care. However, in the econometric
model noted above, DER investments were shown to be correlated with GDP Growth only at an 86%

confidence level. Part of the reason for this result is considered to be that data limitations mean the
analysis can be done from only 1999 to 2003, while 90% of the resources of this activity were invested
between 2003 and 2005.

Activities supported under the component III (Institutional Strengthening) and component IV (Technical
Development) were not able to be analyzed for the following reasons:

Training: although this activity was intended to strengthen beneficiaries' skills to successfully implement
on-farm and off-farm activities, benefits are very difficult to quantify in monetary terms.
Technical assistance and institutional strengthening: given the difficulties involved in estimating with
accuracy the off-farm poverty alleviation alternatives that would be undertaken in the counterfactual
scenario, the costs and benefits of technical assistance would be equally difficult to estimate. It has
therefore been excluded from the economic analysis. Similarly, project institutional strengthening
activities were not included in the economic analysis.
Research: with this, the combination of difficulties in quantifying expected benefits and the fact that most
benefits were available not only to the targeted project beneficiaries but to the farming community at
large, has made it excessively difficult to analyze the economic returns.

Economic Rate of Return

Despite the fact that it is too early to fully measure the benefits of the project's long-term impact
(especially the impacts of the Institutional Building, Training and Research components), an ex-post cost
benefit analysis and economic rate of return calculation have been conducted, for the investments made by
FUNPARANA that include activities under components I and II.

The total amounts disbursed by FUNPARANA per year are provided in table 5.3 in Annex 13.1. For this
ERR analysis, returns have been estimated as accruing on a lagged basis and equal to the total invested
multiplied by the coefficient estimated in the econometric analysis presented above. The ERR that results
is 25.3%.

This value is consistent with the analysis provided by the SAR. The total ERR for activities related to
natural resources management was estimated in the SAR at 23.5 %, based on the application of a sample
of possible project-supported actions. It is important to highlight that the estimated benefits were very
conservative in the SAR as neither long-term benefits accruing from reduced soil run-off, nor from
erosion, were considered.

Annex 10. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The UGP of Paraná 12 Meses has prepared a Final Report on Project Activities dated August
2006 where there is a detailed analysis of the main performance of the Project. Most quantitative
information is based on the Project Information System SAFF which has proved to be very
comprehensive and a very useful tool for project administration, evaluation and monitoring.
Further information can be found in the letter in annex 13.2, a translation of which is given
below:


Translation of letter from the borrower regarding the draft ICR

Mr. Director,


With this letter we would like to thank you for sending the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) for the Paraná 12 Meses Project (Loan 4060-BR), implemented through cooperation
between the Government of Paraná and the IBRD.

From a careful analysis of the document we consider that it is fully consistent with the Report
prepared by the Project Management Unit of Paraná's State Secretariat for Agriculture. Equally,
we express our complete agreement in reference to the evaluations contained in the document in
relation to the general implementation of the project, the execution of the components and the
sustainability and impact of the investments carried out.

The State considers that the project was an essential element for the sustainable rural
development policy of the Government and certainly the lessons learned in the implementation
process should help lay the groundwork for the new rural project that we plan to develop in
partnership with the World Bank.

Finally, we would like to note the inestimable collaboration with the World Bank team, managed
by the task manager Mr. Michael Carroll, who played the role of coordinating the executing
teams at all times during implementation of activities, consequently ensuring significant
economic, social and environmental results.

We would like to take this opportunity to again express our regards.

Yours truly,




Newton Pohl Ribas
