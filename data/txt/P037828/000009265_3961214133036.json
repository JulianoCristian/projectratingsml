The project will\n            comprise two main components: 1) poverty alleviation\n            investment component, which will finance social and\n            income-generating investment; and 2) natural resource\n            management and agricultural modernization investments; and\n            2) technical support services component involving\n            institutional strengthening, technical assistance, training,\n            adaptive research and studies."}, "docdt": "1996-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
