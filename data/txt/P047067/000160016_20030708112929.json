The overall performances\n            of both the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory.\n            Following are some of the most significant lessons learnt\n            from the project: 1) The engagement of a wide range of\n            stakeholders in the project's conception, design and\n            implementation has created a sense of national ownership\n            that was critical for its success and sustainability. 2) The\n            success of the project in promoting improved dialogue\n            between the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the\n            Palestinian Authority(PA) is an evidence of the importance\n            of the Bank's role in supporting an environment for\n            civic engagement. 3) The complicated procedures employed by\n            the project placed a huge processing workload on the\n            implementing agency. Although the competitive nature of the\n            project had its benefits, providing incentives for NGOs to\n            submit sound proposals, it excluded weaker NGOs. These\n            shortcomings were partly addressed by reducing the number of\n            grant awarding cycles (in the Second PNGO Project, the\n            cycles were reduced to one per scheme), introducing a\n            shortlisting step in proposal submission, and reallocating\n            more funds to the Block Grant Scheme. 4) To ensure efficient\n            implementation, it is necessary that all procedural aspects\n            of the project be fully elaborated by the time of appraisal.\n            5) This project emphasized the delivery of inputs, in the\n            form of financing to sub-projects, at the expense of\n            defining clear output performance indicators. This made it\n            difficult to monitor the quality of sub-projects, and it\n            also meant that there was no basis for measuring the\n            aggregate impact of the project as a whole. Drawing on the\n            recommendations of a study conducted on Monitoring and\n            Evaluation, PNGO II now employs a system of output-based\n            monitoring linking the transfer of funds to NGOs to the\n            achievement of time-bound benchmarks. The project's MIS\n            system was also further developed to include indicators that\n            allow for tracking of a wide range of project implementation\n            aspects leading to a more comprehensive evaluation of the\n            aggregate impact of the project. 6) One of the important\n            findings of the project reviews pointed to the limitation\n            imposed on the potential impact and sustainability of\n            project outcomes due to the dispersion of funds across a\n            very wide range of projects whose duration was limited.\n            Project experience also pointed to the need to maintain\n            flexibility with respect to the amount of individual grants\n            and to determine grant amounts based on an assessment of the\n            absorptive capacity of individual NGOs and the nature of the\n            service to be financed. The dispersion of funds across many\n            sectors/locations also meant that the impact realized\n            through these projects in any one sector or location was\n            limited and unlikely to be sustained. Therefore, the\n            adoption of a programmatic approach to grant awarding\n            schemes is recommended for such future projects."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
