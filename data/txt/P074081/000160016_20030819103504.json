CREDIT (PRSC3)", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The third annual Poverty Reduction\n            Support Operation (PRSC3) supports the implementation o f\n            Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) as\n            summarized in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),\n            emphasizing enhanced service delivery and rural development.\n            Uganda's reform program under PRSC3 would improve\n            service delivery and rural development through: 1) Efficient\n            and equitable use of public resource, essential for\n            improving public resource allocation, and strengthened\n            financial sector performance. This includes reforms aimed at\n            improving public expenditure management and strengthening\n            monitoring and evaluation. 2) Improved governance through\n            cross-cutting public sector reforms, such as the reform o f\n            public service and pay, public procurement, financial\n            management, strengthening monitoring and evaluation, and\n            measures to increase transparency, civil society\n            participation, and fight against corruption. The revision o\n            f the current public pay structure and human resource\n            management practices will help the Government recruit and\n            retain high-quality staff. Improvements in public\n            procurement and financial management will promote\n            accountability for public resources, and enhanced\n            transparency, participation, and anti- corruption efforts\n            will help citizens hold their leaders and public officials\n            more accountable for the quantity and quality of services.\n            3) Promotion of enabling environment for rural development,\n            including steps to improve the effectiveness of agricultural\n            marketing, research and advisory services, and the promotion\n            of rural finance, rural roads, and sustainable natural\n            resource management. Stimulating agricultural and rural\n            growth rates is essential for sustained poverty reduction,\n            since 96 percent of the poor live in rural areas and most of\n            them earn their living from agriculture. 4) Improved access\n            to and quality of education, health care, and water and\n            sanitation services. Delivery of basic services will not\n            improve unless binding sector-specific constraints are\n            addressed. However, many problems in basic service sectors\n            are beyond the mandate of a particular sector and require\n            collaboration across agencies and departments."}, "docdt": "2003-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
