  REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC3)", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "This document presents an analysis of\n            environmental and resettlement issues for the third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit (PRSC3) Project for Uganda. This EA\n            repeats the previous impact and mitigation considerations of\n            the previous EA for PRSC2, and adds more details regarding\n            resettlement and pesticides. Degradation of environmental\n            and natural resources is anticipated in the form of\n            deforestation, loss of natural habitats, loss of top soil,\n            uncontrolled growth of water hyacinths, pollution of water\n            bodies, and brush land burning. Environmental regulations\n            recommend for ecologically sensitive areas that the\n            following measures be taken: use of appropriate farming\n            methods, curbing of soil erosion, and protection of water\n            catchments. The National Environmental Statute of 1995\n            (NEMA) prohibits activities that will reclaim and drain the\n            wetlands; and limits other human activities in the wetlands.\n            In the same manner it also prohibits activities that will\n            lead to destruction of forest and hillsides areas. Measures\n            to mitigate potential adverse impacts of pesticide use will\n            be taken through the ongoing National Agriculture Advisory\n            Services Project (NAADS) and include training of input\n            suppliers, and farmers and service providers as well as the\n            promotion of alternative pest management methods, including\n            best mix of biological or cultural controls. Health care\n            waste management considerations related to the health care\n            facilities include: raising awareness , developing an\n            integrated management plan, ensuring segregation of special\n            HCW from other waste, determining appropriate treatment\n            technology and disposal site for facility, ensuring proper\n            packaging, storage, and transport of special HCW, training\n            health care workers, and addressing scavenging issues.\n            Checklists identify other potential environmental issues\n            such as borehole drilling for water supply, expanding and\n            improving the existing water supply, latrine, other\n            sanitation facilities, and wastewater treatment."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
