The lessons learned indicate that\n            the most vital element in poverty reduction is arguably the\n            improvement of incomes of the poor. While many efforts have\n            been made to ensure civic involvement and participation,\n            especially in the preparation of the Poverty Eradication\n            Action Plan (PEAP) and in carrying out participatory poverty\n            assessments, work remains to be done at the district level.\n            Future Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) should\n            avoid being over-reaching, stating goals and results that\n            cannot be achieved rapidly. Future PRSCs need to state\n            results and outcomes in more concrete and measurable terms,\n            although this is much easier said than done. Because of the\n            learning-from-experience potential of the PRSC, and because\n            of its lack of formal implementation beyond the agreement\n            and enactment of Prior Actions, As the PRSC instrument\n            evolved, there has been a clear improvement in the\n            understanding of what needs to be done and of the most\n            effective ways of doing it. Because Uganda is highly\n            dependent on donor aid for its poverty reduction efforts,\n            and because the more efficient delivery of aid through the\n            PRSC has resulted in absorption problems, it is essential\n            that the Bank, donors, and government develop and agree on a\n            long-term financing strategy which should govern and\n            coordinate future levels of donor aid. The two most\n            problematic aspects of the PRSC, namely corruption and\n            defense spending, need to be translated more effectively\n            into essential requirements and pre-requisites for the\n            entire Bank program of support, and not left to the PRSC as\n            a burden to carry."}, "docdt": "2005-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
