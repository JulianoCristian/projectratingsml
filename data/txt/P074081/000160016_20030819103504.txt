            THIRD POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION


                     GRANTAND PROGRAMSUMMARY


Borrower:          The Republic o f Uganda

Amount:            SDR 106 million (US$150 million equivalent)

Terms:             IDA grant for debt vulnerable countries

Description:       The proposed Grant of SDR 106 million (US$l50 million equivalent)
                   i s the third annual Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSC3) that
                   would support the implementation o f Uganda's Poverty Eradication
                   Action Plan (PEAP) as summarized in the Poverty Reduction Strategy
                   Paper (PRSP), emphasizing enhanced service delivery and rural
                   development.

                   Uganda's reform program under PRSC3 would improve service
                   delivery and rural development through:
                   Efjcient and equitable use of public resources, which is essential for
                    improving public resource allocation, and strengthenedjnancial sector
                   performance.      This includes reforms aimed at improving public
                   expenditure management and strengthening monitoring and evaluation.

                   Improved governance through cross-cutting public sector reforms,
                   such as the reform o f public service and pay, public procurement,
                   financial management, strengthening monitoring and evaluation, and
                   measures to increase transparency, civil society participation, and fight
                   against corruption. The revision o f the current public pay structure and
                   human resource management practices will help the Government
                   recruit and retain high-quality staff.        Improvements in public
                   procurement and financial management will promote accountability for
                   public resources, and enhanced transparency, participation, and anti-
                   corruption efforts will help citizens hold their leaders and public
                   officials more accountable for the quantity and quality o f services.

                0  Promotion of enabling environment for rural development, including
                   steps to improve the effectiveness o f agricultural marketing, research
                   and advisory services, and the promotion o f rural finance, rural roads,
                   and sustainable natural resource management. Stimulating agricultural
                   and rural growth rates i s essential for sustained poverty reduction,
                   since 96 percent o f the poor live in rural areas and most o f them earn
                   their livingfrom agriculture.

                0  Improved access to and quality of education, health care, and water
                   and sanitation services. Delivery o f basic services will not improve
                                        ...
                                        111

                  unless binding sector-specific constraints are addressed. However,
                  many problems in basic service sectors are beyond the mandate o f a
                  particular sector and require collaboration across agencies and
                  departments.

Benefits:         The proposed series o f PRSCs will help the Government to implement
                  the PEAPPRSP and reach the goals set in the strategy. The reforms
                  supported will strengthen the institutional infrastructure needed to
                  improve the public sector's capacity to carry out its role more
                  effectively, as envisioned inPEAPPRSP. Improved delivery o f public
                  services is essential if the Government i s to reach its goals for poverty
                  reduction and improve the quality o f life inUganda.

Risks:            Several risksattend the reformprogram under PRSC3:

                0 There are pervasive institutional and human capacity weaknesses.
                  They are especially acute at the district level. Given the ongoing
                  decentralization process, there i s a risk that these constraints could
                  impede the improvements in service delivery. However, in addition to
                  ongoing investment projects and non-lending services, the reform
                  program is geared to addressing institutional deficiencies at all levels
                  o f Government and hence will help mitigate these risks.

                0 Corruption remains a problem. If not checked, it could inhibit private
                  sector confidence and investment and hamper improvements in service
                  delivery.    However, the top leadership in Uganda has stressed its
                  commitment to rebuilding Uganda's ethics and integrity.              Key
                  challenges facing the Government are the implementation o f its anti-
                  corruption action plan and building an effective incentive system
                  needed to improve service delivery. The reform program supports both
                  o f these efforts.

                0 Fiduciary risks, which are spelled out in detail in the Country Financial
                  Accountability Assessment (CFAA)            and Country Procurement
                  Assessment Report (CPAR), are high. Efforts to mitigate these risks
                  are at the center o fthe reform program.
Estimated
Disbursements:    SDR 106 million (US$lSO million equivalent) will be disbursed upon
                  Grant effectiveness.

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.       This Program Document presents a third single-tranche Poverty Reduction Support
Operation (PRSC3) to the Republic o f Uganda in the amount o f SDR 106 million (US$lSO
million equivalent).    The proposed Grant builds on the first and second PRSC (PRSC1 and
PRSC2) that were approved by the Board inMay 2001 and July 2002, respectively, and continues
to support the implementation o f Uganda's poverty reduction strategy, as set out in the Poverty
Eradication Action PladPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PEAPPRSP). As spelled out in the
World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board in November
2000, the proposed Grant, as part o f the series o f PRSCs, is the Bank's principal instrument to
assist the Government o f Uganda in implementing PEAPDRSP.

2.       The implementation o f the reform program supported by PRSC2 has been satisfactory,
and all, except one, PRSC3 prior actions have been met. Owingto a non-programmed increase in
defense spending, the PRSC3 prior action on budget execution was not met. As a compensatory
action, the Government agreed with donors on a revised budget allocation, and IDA monitored
budget execution through the fiscal year 2002/03 to ensure budget execution was consistent with
the revised agreement. Satisfactory progress since the approval o f PRSC2 warrants a move to
PRSC3.

3.       The proposed PRSC3 supports the reform program prepared under PRSCl and PRSC2,
further developing it and deepening the rural agenda that was added to the program during
PRSC2 preparation. Also, the financial sector component has been expanded to cover financial
sector development issues beyond rural finance, in particular the pension reform.           Further
developing the rural component is important since Uganda has a comparative advantage in
agricultural products and exports, and improved market access and marketing arrangements are
essential for the transformation from subsistence to commercial agriculture.        Reforming the
pension sector i s critical, since civil service pension obligations are consuming an increasing
portion o f budget resources and thereby underminingpublic service delivery.

4.       The reform program aims to improve weaknesses in service delivery, which are among
the key constraints to equitable economic growth, development, and poverty reduction inUganda.
Basic services critical to development are inadequate.        In addition, services delivered, in
particular by the public sector, are o f poor quality due to various governance problems and
capacity constraints. Also, the enabling environment for the private sector and civil society
involvement i s inadequate, thus further constraining service delivery and growth. The PRSC3
reform program aims to improve service delivery through: (i)   efficient and equitable use o f public
resources and strengthened financial sector performance; (ii) improved governance through cross-
cutting public sector reforms; (iii)promotion o f an enabling environment for rural development;
and (iv) improved access to and quality o f education, health care, and water and sanitation
services.

5.        The proposed reform program has been developed jointly with the Government and
other donors to Uganda. Also, the Government and donors as a group have agreed on PRSC3
prior actions. The African Development Bank (AfDB), Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and
United Kingdom intend to provide parallel external financing to support the implementation o f
the proposed reform program. The proposed Grant is also consistent with the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) second Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) that was
presented to Board o fthe Fundin September 2002.


                         11.     RECENT ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

6.      Growth       and     inflation:    I
Uganda's economy has performed                                 Figure 1: GDPgrowth 1997/98-2002/03
solidly     since     1999/00.       In
2001/02,     real     GDP       growth            10

registered at 6.6 percent, owing to                8
an    increase      in    agricultural
production     and      a     rise   in      $    6

construction activity. The annual            80  - 4
consumer price inflation declined
to negative 2.0 as food prices                     2


dropped.    Exports grew by 12.8                   0
percent, owing primarily to an 1                        97/98      98/99      99/00      OO/Ol      01/02   02103     1
                                                                                                                   1
increase in non-traditional exports.

7.      The macroeconomic program i s broadly on track, though GDP growth moderated to 5.4
percent in 2002/03 and the annual average inflation increased to 5.9 percent as, owing to adverse
weather conditions, food prices rose. The GDP growth is projected to pick up to 6.0 percent in
2003/04, and inflation to remain at 5.9 percent. Key macroeconomic indicators for 1998/99-
2004/06 are presented in Table 1.

8.      Domestic revenues:            Domestic revenue performance, though slightly improved,
continues to be a concern. Domestic revenues as a share o f GDP increased from 10.8 percent in
2000/01 to 12.2 percent in 2001/02 and further to 12.3 percent in 2002/03, and are projected to
rise to 13.1 percent o f GDP over the mediumterm.' This is low by the standards o f many other
Sub-Saharan African countries that are raising on average about 18 percent o f GDP intaxes.

9.      To    increase      domestic
revenues, the Government has                                Figure 2: Domestic Revenueas a share of GDP

been       strengthening           tax         15

management       o f   the    Uganda           10

Revenue Authority (URA), and
enhanced the collection o f non-           Ik

tax revenues through an eleven-
point program. In addition to a
narrow tax base, deficiencies in               0
                                                    98/99     99/00     00/01     01/02     02/03    03/04   04/05
tax   administration,     and non-
compliance are the key reasons for weak performance. Measures to strengthen tax administration



 Over 90 percent of revenues are generated from taxes, excise taxes and taxes on goods and revenues being the main
sources.

include computerization, and reorganization o f URA's collection department. In addition, to
weed out corrupt URA staff, a judicial investigation into activities o f URA staff is being
conducted. IMF and the Department for International Development (DfID) are supporting the
Government inthese efforts.

10.      At the beginning o f 2003104, to improve revenue performance, the Government
introduced an excise duty on beer, partly removed the value-added tax exemption that hotels have
enjoyed, and increased the vehicle licensing fee and duties on fuel and cellular airtime. These
measures, together with efforts to improve tax administration, are expected to increase
Government revenues by the equivalent o f 0.5 percent o f GDP. Further tax policy measures, in
particular at the local government level, are, however, needed to raise revenues to a higher level
in the medium term. The Government has undertaken studies to identify constraints to local
revenue mobilization, and the Second Local Government Development Program supported by
IDA addressestaxation at the local government level.

11.     Public expenditure management: A rapid increase in public expenditure has also
emerged as an issue. Public
expenditure as a share o f                    Figure3: Government Expenditure and Deficit (as a share of GDP)

GDP has increased from 16.4
percent in 1997/98 to 24.9
percent in 2001/02.       Since
domestic revenues have not
increased at the same pace,
the   overall   fiscal   deficit
excluding grants has widened                     97/98        98/99

from 5.8 percent o f GDP in                -20 `                                                                                I

GDP in 2002/03 (fiscal deficit including grants has increased from 0.5 percent to 5.6 percent o f
GDP over the same period), and increased public expenditure has been funded through increased
external assistance. Concerned about the trend and its potential adverse impacts on the real
exchange rate and financial markets and, as a result, on private sector activity, the Government
began gradual fiscal consolidation in the last fiscal year, public expenditures as a share o f GDP
slightly moderating to 23.6 percent and fiscal deficit excluding grants decliningto 11.3 percent in
2002/03.

12.     The share o f total budgeted public spending allocated to poverty-related activities
through the Poverty Action Fund (PAF) has continued to increase and reached 35 percent in
2001/02. As Table 1 indicates, the shares o f health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and roads in
total public expenditure have been rising inthe past few years.

13.     The Budget Act 2001, by clearly outlining the budget process timetable, has provided
new tools to strengthen budget management and involved Parliament in the budget preparation
process. Under the Budget Act, among other things, supplementary expenditures2 cannot exceed
three percent o f the total approved budget without prior approval by Parliament. The objective o f
this provision is to align more closely actual expenditures with those budgeted by minimizing
reallocations within the fiscal year.

14.     The Government's decision to increase defense expenditures in 2002/03 raised concerns
about the integrity o f the budget process, however. In May 2002, the Government had indicated
that defense spending for 2002/03 would be Ush 238.3 billion. However, in October 2002, the
Government indicated that defense spending in 2002/03 would need to be increased to meet
additional needs arising out o f the Government's effort to address security problems inthe North.
To meet the needs, the Government originally proposed that defense spending for the fiscal year
2002/03 be increased by US$26 million above the budgeted levels, but subsequently, after


'Supplementary expendituresrefer to expenditures for individual line items above those appropriatedby Parliament.

                                                         4

discussions with donors, revisedthe figure down to US$17.5 million. The latter figure implied a
14 percent increase in defense over budgeted amount^.^ The increase was accommodated within
the overall spending ceilingby cutting expenditures innon-PAF areas. As a result, the budget as
executed differed significantly from that endorsed by donors in May 2002, raising questions
about the integrity o f the budget process, and some donors reduced levels o f budget support
programmed for 2002/03. An additional factor influencing the donors was the belief that the
rationale provided for the increase (that is, insecurity inthe North) was not sufficient tojustify it.

15.      Sustainability of external debt: The updated debt sustainability analysis carried out in
the summer 2002 and presented to the Boardjointly with PRSC2 indicated that Uganda's external
debt sustainability indicators have deteriorated, but only one o f the indicators, namely the net-
present-value (NPV) o f debt to exports ratio, has exceeded HIPC guidelines. The flow debt
service indicators remain well within the HIPC boundaries. The deterioration o f indicators was
primarily caused by a sharp decline in international coffee prices that substantially lowered
Uganda's export earnings. According to the analysis, the NPV o f debt to exports ratio peaked at
209 percent in 2002/03, after which it will gradually decline, and fall below the 150 percent target
in2012/13.4

16.      The rolling out of IDA grants since the completion o fupdated debt sustainability analysis
has improved Uganda's debt sustainability projections. As a "debt vulnerable" country, up to 40
percent o f IDA allocation to Uganda will be provided as pure grants under IDA13 arrangements.
Assuming 40 percent o f IDA allocation will be delivered on a pure grant basis in 2002/03-
2004/05, the period covered by IDA13, the NPV o f debt to exports ratio will fall more rapidly
than projected, falling below the 200 percent mark in 2003/04 and reach the 150 percent target
two years earlier, in 2010/11, than without grants. If 30 percent was provided as IDA grants
under IDA13, the debt-to-exports ratio would fall below 150 percent one year later in 2011/12.
Considering a hypothetical case, where future IDA arrangements also include the pure 40 percent
grant element, the NPV o f debt to exports ratio would fall below the 150 percent target by
2008/09. If the grant element were 30 percent, the reaching o f the 150 percent would again be
delayed by one year.

17.      The Government has continued to have difficulties securing debt relief from some
creditors, primarily non-Paris Club and commercial creditors, contrary to the principle o f
comparable burden sharing. Since the updated debt sustainability analysis was conducted, o f
these creditors, India, Libya, South Korea, and the OPEC Fundhave agreed to provide debt relief,
but no agreements have been signed yet. At the same time, however, some creditors (Iraq and
commercial creditors from Spain, the UnitedKingdom, and Yugoslavia') have sought repayment
through Ugandan courts, which have ruled in their favor and granted them awards totaling
US$33.7 million. Other creditors have also threatened to take legal action.

18.      Diversification of exports: Exports as a share o f GDP have steadily increased since
1999/00, and registered at 8.9 percent in 2002/03. The growth has been largely driven by an
increase in non-coffee exports.

19.      The share o f coffee in Uganda's export earnings declined from 53 percent in 1996/97 to
18 percent in 2001/02, but, thanks to higher coffee prices, increased to about 20 percent in



 The increase was in addition to the programmed increase in defense spending in 2002103 of 20.1 percent over the
previous year's level.
 These figures assume full delivery o f HIPC debt relief.
 The commercial creditors are as follows: Banka Arabe Espaniola, Spain; Transroads Ltd, United Kingdom; 14`h
October andFap Famos, Yugoslavia).

2002/03. While part o f the decline in coffee's export share i s due to weak international coffee
prices, it also reflects the steady increase in non-coffee exports.             The key non-coffee export
commodities include fish products, tobacco, cotton, flowers, hides and skins, and tea. The growth
o f export earnings from fish products has been particularly significant. In the medium term,
international coffee prices are projected to recover further, but export earnings from non-coffee
commodities will continue to dominate.

20.     Poverty:     The living standards o f the poor significantly increased during the high
economic growth period o f the 1990s. Since 1992, the Government has been monitoring living
standards through bi-annual household surveys.                These surveys indicate that the poverty
headcount declined from 56 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in 2000. The first PRSP progress
report (21903-UG) submitted to the Board together with PRSCl in May 2001 includes a
discussion o f the 1999/00 household survey results and incidence o f poverty. The Government
recently completed the 2002/03 household survey, and updated poverty headcount figures are
expected to become available inthe fall 2003.

21.     To better understand what poverty means in Uganda, the Government has supplemented
household surveys with Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPA). The second PPA (PPA2) that
was carried out in 2002 highlights the non-income dimensions o f poverty: lack o f access to basic
services and lack o f voice in decision-making. 111-health and disease, often caused by HN/AIDS
and malaria, were the most frequently cited causes o f poverty, followed by limited access to land
and markets, alcoholism, and large families.              For women, lack o f control over productive
resources remains one o fthe key factors.

22.     PPA2 results also indicate that, according to communities, access to social services-
particularly education, health, and water-has           dramatically improved in the past decade, but the
quality o f these services remains an issue. By contrast, the productive sectors (crop, livestock)
are perceived to be faring badly.

23.      Governance and corruption: The second National Integrity Survey conducted in 2002
indicates that there has been some reduction in the reported incidence o f bribery since the last
survey in 1998.6 However, the perceived level o f corruption is still high, and no institution is
perceived to be completely free o f corruption. Households consider the police and health service
providers to be most corrupt, followed by magistrates courts, URA, and local governments. In
particular, dissatisfaction was expressed by local government tendering procedures and contract
management. While corruption in police and in other areas is perceived to have declined since
1998, it is viewed to have increased in health care, which i s a cause for concern.                         The
participatory community appraisal that was part o f the survey suggests that there i s a climate o f
tolerance towards corruption that is very difficult to combat.                Survey respondents attributed
corruption to low salaries and the need for politiciansto recoup election expenses.

24.     External financing requirements:                Uganda's external financing requirements for
2003/04-2005/06 are estimated at US$2,109 million, including grants and loans. Based on
indicated donor commitments, project disbursements are expected to reach at US$1,135 million,
o f which US$741 million is projected to be in grants and US$394 million in loans. Program
disbursements are projected at US$l, 190 million, o f which US$768 million are expected to be in
the form o f grants. The proposed Grant would constitute part o f IDA'S contributionto filling the
external financing gap, and i s included in the estimates. Therefore, the residual financing gap for

the next three years i s projected to be zero, provided all donors fulfill their commitments. The
medium-term financing framework will be reviewed in light o f the actual availability o f external
financing.

                     111. UGANDA'S POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

25.      The Government's strategy for economic transformation is spelled out in the Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP).            PEAP i s a home-grown medium-term development plan to
guide government policy and development o f detailed sector and district plans. The initial PEAP,
which was a result o f an 18-month long participatory process involving all key stakeholders, was
prepared in 1997. Its first revision was finalized in 2000. The Government intends to revise the
PEAP every three years, and its next revision is currently ongoing and expected to be completed
in 2003/04. Because PEAP's objectives are fully consistent with those o f the PRSP process, a
summary o f the revised PEAP was used as a basis for the Uganda PRSP presented to the Boards
o f the World Bank and IMF in May 2000.

26.      In the years PEAP is not revised, the Government prepares a PRSP progress report that
documents the progress inthe implementation o f PEAP. The PRSP progress report is one o f the
key Government's instruments to monitor the implementation o f overall PEAPPRSP, analyze
trends, and highlight problem areas. Their preparation is aligned with the Government's budget
cycle. The first PRSP progress report (21903-UG) was presented to the Bank's Boardjointly with
PRSCl in May 2001, the second report (24254-UG) accompanied PRSC2 to the Board in July
2002, and the third report is presented jointly with the proposed PRSC3. Broad stakeholder
participation remains an essential feature o f these processes.

27.      The overarching goal o f PEAP policies and resource allocations is to reduce the
incidence o f poverty in Uganda (based on the headcount index) from 44 percent in 1997 to ten

                                                      7

percent or less by the year 2017. Between 1992 and 2000, the poverty headcount in Uganda
declined by 38 percent, from 56 percent to 35 percent. According to the PRSP analysis, the
Government can reduce poverty to ten percent by 2017, if real GDP grows at seven percent per
annum and growth is equally distributed. Recent simulations, however, indicate that the poverty
target can be achieved even with a GDP growth rate o f six percent. PEAP also sets forth the
specific goals o f achieving universal access to primary education, primary health care, safe
drinking water, guaranteeing political freedom and human rights, and establishing an effective
disaster relief system targeted at the poor.

28.      Government's strategy for economic transformation and poverty eradication are based on
four pillars:

       0   a framework for economic growth and transformation;

       0   ensuringgood governance and security;

       0   directly increasing the ability o f the poor to raise their incomes; and
           directly increasing the quality o f life o fthe poor.


                              PV. WORLD BANKGROUP STRATEGY

29.      The Bank Group's strategy for 2000/01-2002/03 is to support Uganda's economic
transformation and poverty reduction strategy as spelled out in PEAPPRSP. A full Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uganda was presented to the Board, jointly with IFC, on
November 16, 2000 (Report 20886-UG).'                    To support Uganda's economic transformation and
poverty reduction strategy, as stated in CAS, work to maintain macroeconomic stability
continues, but the focus is increasingly shiftingto the sector-level and cross-cutting public sector
management issues.           The key challenge is to replicate at the sector level the excellent
macroeconomic policy and implementation record to facilitate economic transformation and
poverty eradication. PRSC is the Bank's key instrumentin delivering this.

30.      Consistent with the strategy, the Bank has been increasingly shifting to programmatic
lending through a series o f PRSCs. A shift in lendingmodalities was considered necessary, since
sector interventions through investment projects were characterized by variable local ownership,
had not always been well-integrated with other sectoral activities, and their sustainability was
low. Also, development o f government systems had received limited support as most donors
tended to focus on their own aid delivery mechanisms. The shift to programmatic lending was
also precipitated by the Government's call for a change in donors' lending modalities. It was
justified on five grounds: (i)progress on the macroeconomic front had lessened the need for
traditional adjustment lending; (ii)progress in planning and budget management provided
confidence that public resource allocations are consistent with PEAPPRSP priorities; and a series
o f PRSCs can be an effective mechanism to (iii)                 address comprehensively sector-level reforms;
(iv) address system-wide reforms; and (v) facilitate donor support and coordinationfor a country-
owned program. The shift to the PRSC was also attractive in that it is consistent with the
Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) approach and directly links PEAPPRSP and
Bank Group's assistance program inUganda.

31.      As a result o f the shift to programmatic lending, the relative weight o f investment
projects in the overall portfolio for Uganda i s declining. Investment projects will continue in
selected areas, such as capacity building and infrastructure (main roads and power).



'The nextCAS will be preparedin2003/04, and will tentatively bepresentedto the BoardinMarch2004

                                           A.      General ObjectivesofPRSC

32.       The first single-tranche PRSC (PRSCl) for Uganda was approved by the Board in May
2001 and PRSC2 in July 2002. PRSCl and PRSC2 established a rolling medium-term policy
framework that sets out a three-year reform program with performance benchmarks, policy
measures, and outcome targets to be supported by annual PRSCs. Subsequent PRSCs refine and
expand the program, building on previous PRSCs and each adding a new year to the three-year
rolling program. The rolling nature o f the policy framework enhances predictability o f resource
flows which support the reform program and improves the Bank's ability to carry out continuous
policy dialogue with the Government on a key set o f issues, and to monitor progress towards
meeting agreed outcomes.

33.       The objective o f PRSCs is to support the implementation o f Uganda's PEAPPRSP. The
reform program selectively focuses on policy and institutional reforms in PEAPPRSP with the
highest poverty impact. Also, giventhe comprehensiveness o f PEAPPRSP and the high cost of
its implementation, prioritization o f reforms i s required and PRSCs will assist the Government in
that task. The specific objective o f the reform program supported by PRSCs i s to improve public
service delivery, given that poor public sector performance is one o f the key constraints to
economic development and poverty reduction.

34.       The reform program established under PRSCl and PRSC2 supports activities that
improve access to and quality o f education, health, water and sanitation, and rural services,
aiming to raise the quality o f life and incomes o fthe poor. Since increasing access to and quality
o f these services requires a more broad-based action than only addressing sector-specific
constraints to their delivery, the program focuses heavily on activities enhancing efficient and
equitable use o f public resources and promoting good governance.                         Improving planning and
budgeting arrangements is the critical first step for improving public resource allocation and
raising productivity o f public expenditures.                   Strengthening governance i s in turn essential to
ensure that public funds allocated are used as planned and the needed services provided. This
requires improvements in government-wide systems such as public procurement, financial, and
human resource management that will promote accountability for public resources across all
sectors.

35.       PRSC3 and subsequent PRSCs build on the reform program established under PRSCl
and PRSC2, further deepening and developing ita8The proposed PRSC3 continues to deepen the
rural agenda that was added to the program duringPRSC2 preparation. Also, the financial sector
component has been expanded to cover broader financial sector development issues beyond rural
finance. PRSC4 will slowly and carefully start introducing selected aspects o f decentralized
service delivery, such as district government procurement. Main emphasis will, however, be on
consolidation o f the reform program.


                                      B.        Analytic UnderpinningsofPRSC

36.       The PRSC approach has been underpinned by broad economic and sector work on
Uganda since mid-1990s.                 This includes analysis o f a series o f regular surveys (including
household survey, National Service Delivery Survey, National Integrity Survey, Enterprise
Survey, Demographic and Health Survey, value for money and tracking surveys) and other
analysis. Preparation o f each PRSC involves significant analytic work to further refine the



* ThePRSC reform programwill focus on improvementsin policy and institutional arrangements. Ongoing IDA-funded investment
projectsfocus on the basic infrastructure, such as power andnational roads.

                                                                 9

reform program. To support the preparation o f the proposed PRSC3, the following analytic work
was conducted:

37.      Poverty assessment: The Government carries out biannual household surveys to analyze,
among other things, poverty trends and dynamics. The latest survey was completed in 2002/03,
and new poverty figures are expected to become available in the fall 2003. In addition to
household surveys, the Government has pioneered the use o f PPAs to provide qualitative non-
income dimensions o f poverty. As mentioned earlier, PPA2 was carried out in 2002 and its
results disseminated in2002/03 and taken into account inprogram design.

38.      Public expenditure management:        IDA carries out annually a Public Expenditure
Review (PER) jointly with the Government and other donors. A HIPC tracking update was
conducted in 2002103, and value for money and tracking surveys have become regular annual
exercises in basic service sectors. The results o f these analyses and surveys have shaped the
reform program.

39.   . Public procurement andfinancial management:          A Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), conducted in
2000/01, have continued to inform the reforms inpublic procurement and financial management.
CFAA and CPAR updates are scheduled to be prepared in2003/04.

40.      Rural development: Several studies were undertakento support operationalization o fthe
Plan for Modernization o f Agriculture (PMA). This included work on land issues, monitoring
and evaluation (M&E), and public expenditure plans and allocations. The work on land focused
on gender and common property issues, identifying the constraints women face accessing land
and ways to improve access, and exploring roles of communal land associations and traditional
governance systems. The results o f this work has shaped the Government's land tenure policies
and the reform program. Further, the public expenditure analysis has helped the Government to
realign the ongoing projects and expenditures with P M A priorities, and the M&E work has
contributed to the establishment o f quantitative monitoring indicators to measure progress with
P M A implementation.

41.      M&E: The M&E work related to PMA complemented the sectoral M&E study that
analyzed M&E practices in education, health, and water and sanitation sectors.         The study
reviewed the sectoral monitoring and data collection systems, and utilization o f data collected.
The M&E component o fthe reform program has been adjusted based on the results o f the study.

42.      Private sector development: As part o f the work on private sector development,
transaction costs analysis and a review o f the legal and regulatory framework governing the
production and marketing o f a range o f agricultural commodities were conducted. These studies
highlighted a series o f regulatory constraints inhibiting growth and competition. Their results
have been incorporated into the Government's Marketing and Agro-processing Strategy.           A
second enterprise survey was conducted in2002/03. The results o fthe survey will be available in
the fall 2003 and inform PRSC4 preparation.

43.      Financial sector development: The staffs o f the Bank and Fund conducted in 2001 a
Financial Sector Assessment. The results o f the assessmenthave guided the work on the financial
sector.

44.      Corruption: The Government has carried out the second National Integrity Survey to
assess the prevalence o f corruption and disseminated the results in April 2003, The findings will
inform PRSC4 preparation.

                                                 10

45.     Education: Jointly with the Government and other donors, a series o f studies were
carried out on post-primary education focusing on teacher utilization, coverage, equity, and
efficiency, unit cost analysis, school quality, firm demand, management, and options for
expansion. The results o f these studies contributed to the development o f a strategy for post-
primary education.

46.     Health: The analytic work on health involved a survey o f health facilities, providing
valuable comparative data on practices in public, private, and NGO-runhealth facilities. Further
survey work on health is currently ongoing, and work on decentralization is commencing to
support the preparation o f future proposed PRSCs. The results o f the Demographic and Health
Survey 2000 (DHS2000) have also continuedto inform the reform program.

47.     Poverty and Social Impact Assessment: While ex post poverty and social impact
assessments o f policy reforms have been carried out in Uganda, capabilities for systematic ex
ante poverty and social impact assessment (PSIA) o f proposed reforms are currently being
developed. DflDhas beentaking the lead on this work, and prepared a paper outlining the way to
conduct these assessments in 2002. The Government conducted a workshop to discuss the way
forward with the PSIA work in February 2003.          In general, most reforms supported have
relatively minimal distributional effects.   However, in the context o f selected reforms, the
Government, with support from donors (inparticular, the Bank and DflD), is planning to analyze
ex ante effects o f the policy changes on various income groups in 2003/04.           Areas being
considered for PSIA include the revision o f urban water tariff, land tenure reform, and tax policy
reforms.

48.     Figure 4 summarizes the proposed PRSC schedule, the CAS and PRSP timetable, and
provides examples o f analytic work underpinningthe proposed credits and strategies.

                             C.    CoordinationWith OtherDonors

49.     Coordination with IMF: IMF will continue concentrating on macroeconomic and
financial sector issues in Uganda, focusing specifically on short- and medium-term
macroeconomic      stability, financial sector regulation and supervision,           and long-term
sustainability. As before, IDA will closely collaborate and coordinate activities with the IMF
staff.  In particular, the staffs o f the two institutions will continue preparing updated debt
sustainability analysis for Uganda and annual joint assessments o f the PRSP and PRSP Progress
Reports. Also, the staffs are coordinating their efforts on fiscal decentralization, financial sector,
and governance issues.

50.     A new three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement was
approved by the IMF Board in September 2002. The staff o f IDA and IMF are coordinating the
contents o f PRSC and PRGF to ensure that the instruments complement one another. In general,
the social and much o fthe structural and governance benchmarks will be covered by PRSC, while
the PRGF structural program will focus on monetary and exchange rate policy, expenditure
management, near-term steps to improve monitoring and accountability o f local government
operations, financial sector regulations and supervision, and tax administration issues.

5 1.    Cooperation with AJDB: Consistent with the memorandum o f understanding between
AfDB and the World Bank, the staffs of these organizations increasingly conduct joint missions,
share information and documents more systematically, and coordinate their respective activities
in Uganda. AfDB has designed, in collaboration with the Government and donors, a Poverty
Reduction Support Loan (PRSL) that is consistent with and supports aspects o f PRSC. In
addition, the project modality, particularly at the sector level, remains an important vehicle that
AfDB will use to channel financial aid to Uganda inthe medium term. This notwithstanding, the
priority sectors in the PRSC are the same as those that would underpin the strategic focus o f
AfDB in Uganda over the period of 2002-2004, namely, agriculture and rural development, and
human resource development focusing on improving the quality and equitable access to basic
public services in education, health, and water and sanitation. AfDB also intends to place
increased emphasis on cross-cutting public sector reforms and to strengthen institutions as well as
human capacity. This strategy will help ensure that AfDB's project lending i s consistent with the
objectives o f PRSC.

52.     Partnership with Other Multilateral and Bilateral Donors:             The reform program
supported by PRSC has beenjointly updated by other donors to Uganda, and donors as a group
have agreed on PRSC3 prior actions. A number o f other donors (DflD, Ireland Aid, KfW,
Netherlands) are currently supporting PEAPPRSP using the programmatic approach.                These
donors use the PRSC policy matrix as the framework to disburse their support, while monitoring
PEAPPRSP implementation through MTEF and PEAPPRSP processes. Several other donors
also remain closely associated with the process (European Union, DANIDA, Norway, SIDA).
The Government has welcomed the fact that donors will have shared and hence compatible
benchmarks, as this approach will free up time for officials to performtheir other duties.

53.     In 2002/03, the Government and donors jointly revised and updated the Partnership
Principles that outline the Government-donor relations. In addition to these general principles,
the group o f donors supporting PEAPPRSP implementation through external finance to the
budget developed Operational Principles for Budget Support Donors. These principles aim to
harmonize donor behavior, strengthen government systems, reduce transaction costs for both the
Government and donors, and increase predictability o f provision o f budget support.

                           D.     LessonsLearnedSo Far from UgandaPRSC

54.      A stocktaking exercise o fUganda PRSC1-3 is currently being conducted. Since PRSC is
a relatively new instrument, it is important to reflect on experience so far with PRSC in Uganda
and explore how the first three operations have performed, recognizingthat the PRSC objectives
are o f longer term nature. The objective o f the stocktaking exercise is to study what has worked,
what has not worked, and what could be further improved in the Uganda PRSC process in the
future. The exercise aims to strengthen the consensus among the Government and donors on the
way forward.

55.       Stocktaking was launched with a workshop held on June 20, 2003 in Kampala. The
purpose o f the workshop was to gather Government's and donors' perceptions o f the PRSC
process so far, and brainstorm about the way forward.                     About 80 Government officials and
representatives o f donor agencies attended the event, in addition to IDA staff. Also in June 2003,
a series o f interviews (about 30) were conducted with various Ministries, agencies, and donor
representatives. IDA staff was interviewed as well. Preliminary results o f the workshop and
interviewsare reported inBox 1.

                      Box 1. PreliminaryResultsofUgandaPRSC Stocktaking

The results ofthe stocktaking workshop and interviews conducted suggest that: (i) is so far broadly achievingits
                                                                                   PRSC
Jbjectives; and (ii) benefits ofPRSC outweigh the costs.
                   the
Performance vis-a-vis PRSC Objectives:
         Poverty: There was unanimousagreement that it is too early to assess the impact of PRSC on poverty.
          Servicedelivery: The objective of PRSChas beento improve the delivery of basic services. Access to
          education, health, and water services has improved and quality of some services risen. Stagnant infant and
          matemal mortality rates and incidenceof malariawere noted as concems, however.
          Governmentownership ofthe reform agenda: Government ownership of the reform agendawas considered
          to have improved and is rising. The Government notedthat "for the first time a set of reforms and conditions
          were not brought from outside, but developedtogether." Awareness is high at the technical level, althoughit
          varies across sectoralministries.
          Predictability of resourceflows: Predictabilityof donor resourceflows has improved. Internalflow of funds
          remains variable, though.
Other Objectives that Emerged along the Way:
          Governmentcoordination: Govemment cross-sectoralcoordination, dialogue, prioritizationof reforms, and
          transparency of resource allocations were viewed to have improved.
          Donor coordination and harmonization ofdonor practices: Donor coordination was also perceivedto have
          improved, andthere are ongoing efforts to further harmonizedonor practices. There are regular donor
          meetings andthe PRSC process is opento all.
          Transaction costs: InGovemment's view, transaction costs for aid coordination have declined, asjoint
          donor PRSC missionshave replaceda series of missionseach donor usedto have for their different
          investmentprojects. At the same time, the resulting increase inthe size of missions was noted as an issue.
Issues for the Way Forward:
          PEAPpolicy matrix: A number of Govemmentofficials thought that ownership of the reform agenda could
          be further enhanced, ifthe GovemmentpreparedaPEAPpolicy matrix, of which the existing PRSC matrix
          would form an important part, butthat was expandedto cover other areas included inPEAPPRSP, suchas
          energy, national roads, andpolitical govemancereforms.
          Annual vs. multi-year operation: A questionwas raisedwhether the PRSC instrumentcould be made multi-
          year, while retainingthe flexibility of adjusting the program and settingprior actions annually.
          Capacity weaknesses: There is a concemthat capacity constraintsat both central and local government
          levelsmight hinder the reform process and improvements in service delivery. Increased attentionneedsto be
          paidto building Govemment capacities through instruments complementaryto PRSC.



56.       The stocktaking exercise is expected to be completed by the end o f the calendar year
2003. Further interviews will be conducted, and documents and data relevant to Uganda PRSC
reviewedand analyzed. The results will inform preparation o f the next CAS, and will be shared
with the Boardat the time o f CAS presentation.

                                                             14

               V.        OVERALLPROGRESSWITHREFORMSSINCE PRSC2

                                   A.       OverallAssessment of Progress

57.     The Government has made satisfactory progress in implementing the PRSC reform
program and all, except one, PRSC3 prior actions have been met. Owing to a non-programmed
increase in defense spending, the PRSC3 prior action on budget execution was not met. As a
compensatory action, the Government agreed with donors on a revised budget allocation, and
accommodated the increase by cutting expenditures in non-PAF areas. IDA monitored budget
execution through the fiscal year 2002/03 to ensure budget execution was consistent with the
revised agreement.

58.     Since PRSC3 prior actions are completed and compensatory action taken, it is proposed
to proceed with the presentation o f the proposed PRSC3 to the Board.            Table 3 lists the
anticipated PRSC3 prior actionsg in PRSC2 Board documentation and final PRSC3 prior actions.
Taking into account information and developments since PRSC2, final prior actions focused on
the most critical actions to move forward the reforms in each area where anticipated prior actions
were set.

           B.      OverallProgressand Outcomesin Sectorsand Cross-cutting Areas

59.     The Government has made significant progress in sectors and cross-cutting areas.
Annexes 1 and 2 contain matrices that document progress in implementing the planned reform
program in each area, highlighting the adjustments in benchmarks and achievement o f
quantitative targets, respectively. The quantitative target matrix (Schedule 3) has been expanded
to include targets for financial sector development, public procurement, justice, law and order,
agricultural advisory services, land tenure, environment, and district roads. Work i s ongoing to
develop quantitative monitoring indicators for the remaining areas. The matrices indicate that the
reform program has proceededas planned inmost areas.

60.     OverallProgress in Basic Service Sectors and Rural Development: Implementation o f
reforms in basic service sectors-education, health, water and sanitation-and     rural development
has proceeded broadly as planned. Thejoint Government-donor reviews o f education, health, and
water and sanitation were completed satisfactorily, and efforts are underway to establish a similar
review process for PMA. Given the breadth o f PMA, this is a significant challenge.             The
outcomes o f reforms inbasic service sectors and rural development are as follows:

61.     Education: The Government has made steady progress in implementing the Universal
Primary Education (UPE), and expanding the access to and improving the quality o f primary
education.     The Government is committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDG) on universal completion of primary schooling by 2015, and elimination of gender
disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005. The primary school gross enrollment
stands currently at about 140 percent, and the net enrollment o f the poorest quintile has increased
to about 83 percent, with equal numbers of boys and girls. While the Government has already
established gender equality in primary education, the drop out rates are still high and need to be
addressedto achieve universal completion o f primary schooling.



 Triggers are called anticipated prior actions.

62.      To improve quality o f primary education, the Government has continued increasing the
number of teachers, classrooms, and textbooks.       The pupil-teacher ratio remained at 54:1 in
2002/03, since enrollment increased faster than the number o f teachers in the past year. The
pupil-classroom ratio, however, improved from 98:l in 2001/02 to 94:l in 2002/03.              The
introduction o f the new curriculum invalidated all textbooks in 2002, but the concurrent changes
in textbook procurement has allowed the Government to reach since then 3:l pupil-textbook
ratios in P3-4.    Textbooks for P5-7 are currently being procured. A framework for regular
monitoring o f learning achievement was reviewed by the education sector review in May 2003,
and monitoring indicators agreed.

63.      The Government has also completed a policy and costed framework for the expansion o f
post-primary education and training. UPE is exertinga significant pressure on the existing post-
primary education system, and hence it has been critical for the Government to map out a way
forward on post-primary education that is sustainable and consistent with the sector's resource
envelope.

64.      Health: The Government has made progress in terms o f health outcomes, though the
performance o f the sector continues to be mixed. Several health indicators have significantly
improved and exceeded the targets in the past year. The immunization coverage (DPT3) o f
children below one year o f age increased from 46 percent in 2001 to 63 percent in 2002. The
utilization o f outpatient services climbed duringthe same period from 0.43 to 0.60, and the share
o f posts in government and private-not-for-profit health units filled by qualified health workers
rose from 40 to about 47 percent. However, over the same period, HTV prevalence rates have not
improved, but slightly increased, and facility-based deliveries decreased.         Given the high
maternal mortality and teenage pregnancy rates, the fall in facility-based deliveries is a cause for
concern, The Government is also concerned o f the slight increase in HIV prevalence, and
recognizes that further investigation o f the underlying causes and intensification o f prevention
efforts is needed.

65.      A notable development in the past year was the launch o f an inter-ministerial effort to
lower the stagnated infant and maternal mortality rates. Factors affecting infant and maternal
mortality rates are multi-sectoral in nature and hence a coordinated approach o f different
ministries and agencies is needed to effectively tackle the issue. The Government has formed a
task force to identify actions required by different ministries and agencies, and propose an
integrated strategy for the way forward.

66.      Water and sanitation: Safe water coverage has increased from 46 percent in 1999 to 55
percent in 2002. Uganda i s on track on achieving MDG on access to safe water. It i s projected
that 100 percent o f the urban population will have access to safe water by 2010, and 100 percent
of the rural populationby 2015.

67.      Uganda's rural water program has become one o f the largest in Africa. Inthe past year,
the Government delivered 2,464 water points in rural areas, extending the rural safe water
coverage to additional 628,000 people. While high, the number of new water systems was lower
than the target, since increasing attention was paid to the quality and sustainability o f systems
constructed. In urban areas, 10,500 new connections-3,500       above the target-were     delivered,
o f which about 3,000 serve poor households. Uganda's urban water delivery system is today
viewed as a model by African countries, which is remarkable since still at the end o f 1990s the
performance indicators o f the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), which handles
urban water delivery, were below African utility standards. The turnaround o f NWSC operations
has been notable. Further improvements in its efficiency are still expected, though.

68.     Rural development: The Government has also made progress with structural reforms in
the area o f rural development. Preparations for a comprehensive reform o f agricultural research
delivery have been made, and a new strategy promoting more demand-driven agricultural
research has been developed. A comprehensive reform o f agricultural extension services is also
ongoing through the multi-donor supported National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS)
program. NAADS i s a demand-driven program where public funds are channeled to farmer fora
at the sub-county level for them to contract the services o f farm advisors. Arrangements to
implement land reforms have also been established.

69,      Overall Progress in Cross-cutting Areas: The implementation o f the cross-cutting
reform agenda i s broadly on track. Progress has been made with reforms in public service and
financial management, public procurement, and anti-corruption.

70.     Public service management: The Government has started gradual implementation o f
public sector pay reform, and completed a strategy for the next phase o f public service reform.
Efforts to identify ways to control the rapid expansion o f public service are underway, but
progress has been slow.

71.     Financial management: The legal and regulatory framework governing financial
management has been updated, and timeliness of financial reporting has improved. Though
progress has been made with the preparation o f annual accounts and the audit o f these at the
higher local government level, the audit o f lower level local government accounts, and the quality
and follow-up to audit results and recommendationsremain challenges.

72.     Public procurement: The new public procurement law has been enacted, and the legal
and regulatory framework for public procurement has been established. Also, procurement units
are operational in all central government procuring ministries, departments, and agencies. The
next step will be to extend the reforms to district governments, and increase transparency and
strengthen enforcement of procurement rules and regulations to reduce corruption in
procurement. There is an urgent need to strengthen capacity in public procurement as well. A
number o f donors have shown keen interest in assisting the Government with capacity building
and expanding the existing efforts inthat area.

73,     Anti-corruption: The Government has proceeded with the implementation o f the new
Leadership Code since its assent to a law in July 2002. Given the wide coverage of the new code
(about 16,000 people) and limited capacity o f the Inspectorate o f Government (IG), the
Government has decided to proceed with the enforcement o f the code in phases, and pay most
attention to key groups o f leaders (Ministers, Presidential Advisors, Permanent Secretaries,
Directors, and Uganda Revenue Authority officials) in each phase. All leaders were asked to
declare their income, assets, and liabilities within three months o f the assent o f the code. Key
groups o f leaders fully complied, except six Presidential Advisors (83 percent o f Presidential
Advisors declared) and seven URA officials (99 percent o f URA officials declared).              As
stipulated by the code, the Inspector General o f Government (IGG) issued letters to appointing
authorities requesting them to take disciplinary action4ismissalor person vacating the office in
case o f non-declaration-against    leaders who failed to declare.    Appointing authorities have
dismissed the seven URA officials and six Presidential Advisors who did not declare assets to
enforce this part o f the code. In parallel, the IG has started to verify the contents o f submitted
asset declarations.

                        C.     Linkto MillenniumDevelopmentGoals

74.     PEAPPRSP goals significantly overlap with MDGs, and the Government has signed up
to MDGs under the UN Millennium Declaration. Like MDGs, PEAPPRSP has broad national
goals for poverty eradication, universal primary education, gender equality, infant and maternal
mortality, HIV/AIDS, and environmental sustainability.             As Table 4 below indicates,
PEAPPRSP targets in some areas (poverty reduction, access to universal primary education,
HIV/AIDS, and water) are more ambitious than MDGs, while in others (infant and maternal
mortality, gender balance insecondary education) they are laggingbehind.

75.     The Government is on track for achieving MDGs related to poverty reduction, gender
equality, HIV/AIDS, and access to safe water. MDGs call for reducing headcount poverty to 28
percent by 2015, whereas the headcount poverty rate in Uganda was 35 percent in 1999/00 and
projected to decline to 14 percent by 2015. As mentioned earlier, gender equality has been
achieved in primary education, and the new strategy for post-primary education will aim to close
the remaining gap in secondary education, though not necessarily by 2005. MDG on HIV/AIDS
has already been achieved, though further efforts are needed to bring further down the prevalence
rate. In Uganda, the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate peaked in 1992/93, and thereafter steadily
dropped until 2000/01. Also, as mentioned earlier, the Government i s projected to reach 100
percent access to safe water in rural areas by 2015, and in urban areas by 2010. While the
Government i s on track to achieve 100percent net enrollment rates inprimary education by 2015,
achieving universal completion o f primary school by that time is uncertain, since drop-out rates
are high.

76.     MDGs for infant and maternal mortality are more ambitious than PEAPPRSP targets,
and the Government has made less progress in these areas. The integrated strategy being
prepared by the inter-ministerial task force is expected to address this concern.

                    VI.    THE PROPOSEDPRSC3REFORMPROGRAM

                            A.    Overview and Objectives of PRSC3

77.      Objectives: The proposed PRSC3 continues supporting and further developing the
reform program developed under PRSCl and PRSC2, with the aim to improve service delivery
and promote rural development. As mentioned earlier, it deepens the rural agenda that was added
to the program under PRSC2. Also, the financial sector component has been slightly expanded to
cover broader financial sector development issues beyond rural finance, in particular the pension
reform. Given the need to further expand and diversify exports, further developing the rural
development component is important since Uganda has a comparative advantage in agricultural
products and exports, and improved market access and marketing arrangements are essential for
the transformation from subsistence to commercial agriculture. Reforming the pension sector is
critical, since civil service pension obligations are consuming an increasing portion o f budget
resources and thereby underminingpublic service delivery.

78.      Results-orientation: The reform program is gradually, but systematically, made more
focused on quantitative, measurable results on the ground. The program has been extended to
include quantitative targets for further areas. PRSC1 contained quantitative targets for basic
service sectors (education, health, and water and sanitation), and quantitative targets for financial
management were introduced in PRSC2. The proposed PRSC3 expands the set o f indicators by
incorporating quantitative targets for financial sector development, public procurement, justice,
law and order, agricultural advisory services, land tenure, environment, and district roads.
Further work on quantitative targets will be carried out during PRSC4 preparation.              The
Government i s currently developing quantitative indicators and targets to monitor anti-corruption
and financial management efforts, and monitoring and evaluation arrangements for P M A are also
being further developed. The introduction o f quantitative indicators and targets has been gradual
since establishment o f M&E systems is a complex and time-consuming task, and readiness o f
different sectordareas to monitor quantitative indicators on a regular basis varies. In the context
o f the ongoing PEAPFRSP revision, the Government is expected to explicitly link the strategy to
MDGs and establish interim outcome targets where not yet available. These will be reflected in
future PRSCs.

79.      Link to PER: The proposed PRSC3 is also tightly linked to the PER process to ensure
the reform program i s fully costed and reflected in the Government budget. To ensure this, the
work on the proposed PRSC3 has proceededintandem with the public expenditure work.

80.      Roadmap for reform:      The specific reforms to be supported by the proposed PRSC3
under each PEAPPRSP pillar are detailed in the policy matrix (Schedule 1) that provides a
roadmap for reform, and in the matrix listing quantitative monitoring indicators and outcome
targets (Schedule 2). The two matrices should be read together to link the actions to quantitative
measures o f progress. Table 5 summarizes the objectives, reform areas, and issues in each area.
Proposedreforms ineach area will be discussed in more detail next

     B.      PEAPFRSPPillar I:Frameworkfor EconomicGrowthand Transformation

81.      Continued high economic growth in Uganda requires a framework within which the
private sector can expand and services can be delivered. Under the first PEAPPRSP pillar, the
Government addresses three elements o f the framework: (i)           macroeconomic stability; (ii)       removal
o f constraints on private sector competitiveness as guided by the Medium-Term Competitiveness
Strategy (MTCS) for the Private Sector (2000-2004); and (iii)equitable and efficient collection
and use o f public resources.

82.      PRSC3 continues focusing on strengthening public expenditure and budgetary
management, but carefully expanding the program to cover selected financial sector development
issues. Other elements o f the framework, such as the collection o f domestic revenue, continue to
be covered primarily by the second PRGF arrangement. In the interest o f selectivity and to
ensure PRSC and PRGF have no cross-conditionality, it has been agreed that IMF will focus on
domestic revenue mobilization, inparticular at the central government level. With IMFand DfID
assistance, the Government is currently implementing a tax administration reform that focuses on
modernization o f URA, improvements intax collection, and reductiono f smuggling. The Second
Local Government Development Program supported by IDA addresses taxation at the local
government level. Actions related to private sector competitiveness beyond financial sector
issues are supported under several infrastructure, deregulation, and financial sector projects
funded by IDA and other donors.

83.     Issues:      Strengthening public expenditure management is the critical first step in
improving the efficiency o f public service delivery.            In this context, allocations and actual
spending need to remain consistent with priorities o f the PEAPPRSP. While the aggregate
spending control and strategic allocations are strengths o f fiscal management in Uganda, the
budget is not yet comprehensive. Specifically, donor-funded projects are not yet reflected in all
expenditure ceilings, and links between the wage bill and staffing plans are weak. The fund
transfers to districts need improvement, as there are still considerable delays in fund releases.
Further, to ensure that public funds are used effectively, sector expenditure programs need to be
made results-oriented, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems strengthened.                            Sector
programs are still predominantlyfocused on inputs and implementation processes rather than end-
results o f policies, programs, and projects.

84.      The performance o f the financial sector has improved inthe past few years, but access to
financial services remains a problem, especially in rural areas, and the range o f financial products
limited. The insurance sector has been liberalized and new companies and brokers have entered
the market, but supervision o f the sector is still weak. The pension sector needs to be urgently
reformed. Without changes, unfundedcivil service pension obligations are projected to consume
an increasing proportion o f government expenditure, rising from about 10 percent in 1999/00 to
20 percent o f total government expenditure by 2009/10, and to 35 percent by 2019/20, thereby
creating severe stress on public resources. The National Social Security Fund (NSSF), the
compulsory scheme for all formal employees outside the civil service, i s suffering from high
administrative costs and negative real returns on investments.                   A forensic audit o f NSSF
conducted in September 2002 raised serious concerns about records management, investments,
procurement procedures, and management o f contracts. As the largest single source o f funds for
investment in the country", its efficiency and investment choices have a major bearing on both
the country's economic growth and the protection available to members. Its poor choice of



loAs of June 2002, the National Social Security Fund had Ush 145.5 billion in assets and net annual contributions of
Ush33.2 billion.

                                                      23

investments, and conversion o f long-term funds into short-term assets, such as Treasury Bills and
bank deposits, represents a major drag on both economic growth and contributors' welfare.

85.        Overall Progress: The new Budget Act, by clearly outlining the budget process
timetable, has provided new tools to strengthen budget management. For example, under the
Budget Act supplementary expenditures (that is, expenditures for individual line items above
those appropriated by Parliament) cannot exceed three percent o f the total approved budget
without prior approval by Parliament. The objective o f this provision is to align more closely
actual expenditures with those budgetedby minimizing reallocations within the financial year. In
2001/02 supplementaries (other than technical supplementaries involving reallocations within a
Ministry's budget) totaled Ush 88.5 billion", o f which supplementaries to finance overspending
in security and public administration accounted for the bulk (Ush72.1 billion). Overspending by
public administration has been a particular problem: in 1997/98-2000/0 1 public administration
overspent its budgeted amount on average by 8.9 percent a year. To rectify this situation, the
Government appointed a Commission to make recommendations on reducing the cost o f public
administration, and specific measures to address this problem have been identified (see paragraph
89 under Public Service Management). Work on this area will continue under PRSC4.

86.       Expenditures on defense and public administration have been areas o f concern for
budgetary management. After a number o fyears duringwhich defense spending was constrained
to be no more than two percent o f forecast GDP, in 2001/02 donors and the Government agreed
that defense spending that year and next could increase by Ush 10 billion per year to meet certain
one-off expenditures, while awaiting the conclusions o f a defense review which was expected to
provide the basis for determining future levels o f defense spending. In 2002/03, spending for
defense (security) was budgeted at Ush 238.3 billion, consistent with this understanding, and
public administration (excluding pensions and unconditional grants) at Ush 23 1.68 billion.
However, the Government increased spending on defense in 2002/03 by US$17.5 million (Ush
32.4 billion) to meet additional needs arising out o f the Government's effort to address the
security problems in the North, and a result the prior action on budget execution was not met.
The increase raised concerns among donors, some o f whom in response reduced levels o f budget
support programmed for 2002/03. From a budgetary point o f view, the impact o f this increase on
other programs, that had to be cut to offset the rise in defense spending, was a concern. In
addition, there was a concern that additional cuts may result from overspending in public
administration.

87.       In order to re-establish the integrity and predictability o f the budget process and
compensate for the unmet prior action, the Government agreed to limit in 2002/03 the total
overspending on defense and public administration to a level slightly below that o f the preceding
year. IDA monitored actual budget execution through 2002/03 to ensure compliance with this
understanding. The objective o f monitoring was to ensure that budget execution, in particular
defense and public administration spending, was in line with the agreement, PAF was
implemented consistent with allocations agreed in May 2002, and overspending was
accommodated by cutting expenditures innon-PAF areas.

88.       The M&E component o f the reform program has been significantly revised to focus on
rationalization o f multiple M&E arrangements and systems based on the results o f the sectoral



I'This total includes supplementariesto finance statutory expenditures (that is, expendituresthat MoFPEDis required
by law to fund regardless of the budgeted amount), emergencies, taxes, and arrears payments, which are funded by
separate line items and do not require offsetting expenditure reductions. When the amount of supplementariesin
2001/02 is adjustedto take these into account, the amount is reducedto Ush47 billion, equivalent to 2.9 percent of the
total budget.

                                                        24

M&E study carried out in 2001/02, and reassessment o f M&E priorities. There are multiple
M&E systems runby different ministries and agencies, collecting partly overlapping data. The
sectoral M&E study reveals, for example, that education, health, and water and sanitation sectors
together collect information on about 1,000 indicators, and annually about 300,000 data entries
are made at the district level. At the same time, each sector has a heavy inspection schedule. For
example, if inspection and support visits are carried out according to the health sector national
supervision guidelines, 150,000 man days (equivalent to 700 full-time posts) are spent annually
on inspections inthe health sector alone. As the first step to address this situation, ministries and
agencies have come together and agreed on M&E responsibilities o f different ministries for
PEAPPRSP coordination, and also agreed on an approach to consolidate inspections. Inaddition
to rationalization o f data collection, the Government has started developing a more systematic
approach to evaluations, value-for-money, and tracking studies, and taken steps to increase the
use o f beneficiary assessments to promote public accountability. To coordinate implementation
o f M&E reforms, the Government has formed an M&E working group, and i s making
preparations for an integrated M&E system.

89.     The Government is also preparing for a launch o f a pension reform, and has appointed a
task force to develop policy recommendations and a roadmap for the reform that covers pensions
and social security issues inthe public service, armed forces, and the private sector; establishment
o f regulatory and supervisory arrangements; and orderly opening up o f the market to pension
providers. A demographic and actuarial model is being developed for Uganda to analyze the
costs, benefits, and affordability o f different pension policy options. In parallel, NSSF has begun
restructuring its operations, including appointment o f a new board. The intention is to move
towards a more competitive, liberalized pension system with effective and prudential regulation.

90.      The Government has approved new regulations for the insurance industry that will
provide the necessary prudential and supervisory framework, but since approval some
weaknesses have been discovered (for example, on required frequency o f reporting) and
amendments to regulations are being prepared. Capital requirements o f insurance companies
have recently significantly increased, and companies have been given four years to reach full
compliance.

91,     Reform Strategy: Key areas for enhancing efficient and equitable use o f public resources
and strengthening financial sector include the following:

        Agree with stakeholders, including IDA, annually on strategic expenditure allocations in
        W E F and execute budgets consistent with agreed allocations. This was done under
        PRSCl and PRSC2, and since then the practice has continued. The Government agreed
        with donors on MTEF for 2002/03-2004/05 in the annual public expenditure review in
        May 2002. As described above, expenditure allocation was adjusted in mid-year owing
        to increased defense spending, and IDA monitored budget execution through the fiscal
        year.
        Improve timeliness andpredictability of resourceflows to districts. The Government has
        taken remedial measures to improve timeliness and predictability o f resource flows to
         finance agricultural advisory services in districts.
        Implement regular expenditure tracking survey. In order to obtain information on actual
         spending, the Government carried out expenditure tracking studies in health and
         education sectors under PRSC2. Also, the Government decided to make the expenditure
        tracking studies an annual exercise in basic service sectors. Since then the Government
        has carried out tracking studies and taken follow-up actions inthe health, education, and
        water and sanitation sectors as planned.

                                                   25

0 Integrate donor-financed projects, staflng plans, and wage bill in sector expenditure
  programs in MTEF. Under PRSC1, the Government included indicative expenditure
  levels for donor-financed projects in the MTEF, and, under PRSC2, integrated donor-
  financed projects in MTEF for the education, health, and water and sanitation sectors.
  Since then, because integration has raised a number o f questions, the Government paused
  to develop an approach to integrate donor projects in MTEF. Also, as a pilot under
  PRSC1, Ministries o f Education (MoES) and Health (MoH) reflected staffing plans
  consistent with the wage bill in their expenditure programs. During PRSC2, MoFPED
  and MOPS started consultations on a general approach for staffing pladwage bill
  integration. Since then the Government has agreed on an approach for the way forward.
  Publish budgetperformance reports. Inorder to reduce deviations between budgetedand
  actual annual expenditures, the Government launched under PRSC1 an annual Budget
  Performance Report that analyzes discrepancies between budgeted and actual
  expenditure. The Government made the reports semi-annual under PRSC2, and has since
  then published semi-annual reports, and made quarterly reports available on request.
  Streamline and improve the timeliness of inter-governmental transfers. Under PRSC1,
  the Government completed a study on rationalization o f fiscal transfer systems, which
  recommends merging current transfers into two systems: development, and recurrent.
  The Government decided to proceed with the recommended merger, and, as the first step,
  developed a strategy for streamlining the transfers under PRSC2.             Since then the
  Government has developed operational manuals and guidelines for implementing the
  fiscal decentralization strategy, and started implementation inpilot districts.

  Enhance results-orientation of sector expenditure program, and streamline and
  strengthen M&E arrangements. To ensure that managers focus on real progress towards
  PEAPPRSP targets, the Government is continuing efforts to introduce output and
  outcome goals and targets.       Under PRSC1, roads, education, health, and water and
  sanitation sectors introduced output targets in their Budget Framework Papers (BFP).
  The practice was extended to the justice, law and order sector under PRSC2, and since
  then to roads and agriculture.
  Inparallel, under PRSC2, the Government prepared a national M&E strategy, which lays
  out the framework for poverty monitoring and evaluation. Since then the Government
  has prepared a Cabinet paper on M&E responsibilities o f different ministries and
  agencies for PEAPPRSP coordination, and i s inthe process o f establishing an integrated
  M&Esystem to support coordination arrangements.
  To identify ways to strengthen and streamline sectoral M&E, the Government carried out
  a review o f M&E in education, health and water and sanitation under PRSC2. Since
  then, based on the results ofthe study, the M&Ecomponent has been adjusted to address
  the need for rationalization of multiple M&E arrangements, a systematic approach to
  evaluations, and increased use o f beneficiary assessments. To move ahead the agenda on
  these areas, the Government has agreed on an approach to consolidate Government
  inspections in different sectors; and agreed on common results management concepts and
  definitions. Also, an agenda o f ongoing and planned evaluations, value-for-money, and
  tracking studies has been compiled. To increase the use o f beneficiary assessments, the
  Government disseminated the results o f national service delivery survey under PRSC2,
  and has since redesigned the survey instrument for the next round.
  Strengthen financial sector performance in terms of soundness, eflciency, and access:
  Financial sector work focuses on the pension reform and strengthening o f the insurance
   sector and is based on the results and recommendations o f the Financial Sector
  Assessment conducted in 2001. The Government has appointed a pension reform task

                                            26

        force to develop policy recommendations and a roadmap for pension reform.                A
        demographic and actuarial model o f the national pension system i s being prepared to
        assess the costs, benefits, and affordability o f the proposed pension reform. In addition,
        the Government has gazetted new insurance regulations and is expected to revise
        reporting requirements and begin on-site inspection o f insurance companies and brokers
        to ensure regulatory compliance.

92.     Expected Results: Over the course of the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:

        0   An increase in the directly poverty reducing expenditures as a share of total
            allocations and actual expenditures from 24 percent in 199912000to about 36 percent
             in2003104.

        0   A more comprehensive MTEF, incorporating donor projects and staffing plans
            consistent with the wage bill.

        0   Budgetexecution closer to the approved appropriations.

        0    Streamlined and efficient system o f inter-governmental fiscal transfers.

        0    Sector plans and expenditure programs are outputloutcome-oriented.

        0   M&Earrangements streamlinedand linkedto goals andperformance.

        0   Improvedperformance o f the pension system and insurance industry.


             C.    PEAPPRSP Pillar 11: EnsuringGoodGovernanceand Security

93.     Good governance is essential for effective public service delivery.            The second
PEAPPRSP pillar addresses this concern. The Government actions detailed under the pillar
focus on improving public service delivery in the context o f decentralization; reducing
corruption; ensuring law and order and security; and providing disaster management.            The
proposed PRSC3 will provide support to these actions ina selective manner.

94.     To improve service delivery on the ground, the Government has decentralized the
delivery o f health, education, and water services to local governments, and restructured to
enhance private sector and community participation in service delivery. The key challenge facing
this effort is improving the capacities of local governments for effective planning, management,
and implementation o f related policies and programs. The Government plans to address these
concerns through public service, procurement, and financial management reforms, and by
strengthening bottom-up accountability and anti-corruption measures.


                                   PublicServiceManagement

95.     Issues: A prerequisite for effective public service delivery is that managers are skilled,
committed, and motivated professionals. It i s important for the Government to put in place a pay
regime which is sufficiently attractive to recruit, retain, and motivate key categories of civil
servants.    The current pay structure is inconsistent with efforts to improve capacity and
performance.     In the same manner, human resources management, particularly payroll and
personnel management systems and practices need to be strengthened if the Government is to
have a better control o f its human resources.        At present, the growth in public service is
threatening to derail the reform efforts, including making it more difficult for the Government to
implement its pay reform strategy.


                                                  27

96.      Overall Progress: The Government has started implementing the pay reform strategy,
which it has chosen to be a key priority, and consistent with the strategy increased salaries o f
government employees in middle and senior management by about 20 percent in 2002/03.
However, rapid expansion o f establishments in public administration and social sectors, and
pressure from various groups to make pay reform more egalitarian are posing risks for
implementation. To mitigate the risk o f pay reform getting derailed, the Government has agreed
on target salary adjustments for the medium-term.

97.     The growth in public administration and social sector employment, by exerting pressure
on the wage bill, continues to threaten the implementation o f pay reform and the overall public
service reform. The Government has prepared a report on public administration budgeting that
identifies a set o f measures-such   as reducing the number o f Presidential Advisors and Ministers,
placing a moratorium on new district creation under the current Parliament, closing o f three
embassies, and tightening supplementaries-to      control the bulge. Implementation o f some these
measures is supported under PRGF arrangements. To identify appropriate measures to control
the rapid growth in social sector employment, the Government i s in the process o f completing a
analysis on cost effectiveness and efficiency o f staff utilization in social sectors, taking into
account the development goals these sectors are aiming to achieve.                  The results and
recommendations o f the analysis will be discussed in social sector reviews in the fall 2003 and
form the basis for identificationo f appropriate measures to control the size o fthe public service.

98.      The Government has finalized the new public service reform strategy that consolidates
different reform initiatives. The strategy covers, among other things, pay reform, personnel and
performance management, rationalization o f public service structures, and capacity building.
Further work on prioritizing key aspects o f reform and coordination o f different initiatives is,
however, still required.

99.     Reform Strategy: Under PRSC, key areas for improving public service management
include the following:

         0   Implement a government pay reform strategy that is consistent with MTEF and
             improved service delivery. Under PRSC1, the Government agreed on objectives and
             principles for a pay reform strategy that i s consistent with MTEF and aims to
             improve public service delivery. The pay reform strategy was prepared and approved
             by Cabinet under PRSC2. The aim o f the strategy is to improve pay for the entire
             public service, but focusing initially on groups where better service delivery is being
             severely constrained because the Government cannot attract and retain adequately
             qualified professional, technical, and managerial staff. Since then the Government
             has started the implementation o f the strategy, and increased salaries o f government
             employees inmiddle to senior job grades by about 20 percent. Also, it has agreed on
             target salary adjustments over the medium-run in line with the pay reform strategy,
             and the associated wage bill is reflected in MTEF.

         0   Improve payroll and personnel management.            Under PRSC1, the Government
             prepared an action plan to expedite access to government payroll, since a pressing
             concern at that time was the delay in getting new staff onto government payroll, in
             particular teachers and health care workers (the average delay in accessing payroll
             was 6 to 16 months for teachers and 3 to 7 months for health workers).             Under
             PRSC2, the Government started implementing the plan, which to a large extent
             eliminated the delays to get newly recruited teachers onto the payroll. However,
             further analysis o f the payroll system showed that it i s lacking basic internal controls
             that serve to ensure that only bona fide employees are on it and paid what is properly
             due. To rectify the problem, the Government prepared another plan to strengthen

                                                  28

             internal payroll controls. In addition, since then, the Government has embarked on a
             more comprehensive exercise to integrate and improve its personnel and payroll
             management systems through a computerized Integrated Pay and Personnel System
             (IPPS). It has prepared a roadmap for the design and implementation o f IPPS.

        0    Control the expansion of public service. Mandates and structures o f the Government
             have grown considerably in recent times. For example, the number o f districts has
             increased from 45 to 56, which has expanded the size o f public administration by
             increasing the number o f local officials and enlarging Parliament. Also, the number
             o f Commissions has grown. As a result and owing to increased number o f employees
             in social sectors (teachers and health workers), public service payroll has increased
             from about 160,000 people in 1997 to about 218,549 in May 2003.                If the
             Government does not take action, the number will reach about 250,000 in the next
             few years.     This bulge is exerting pressure on the wage bill, threatening the
             implementation o f the public service reform, including efforts to improve pay, and
             jeopardizing the gains made from the restructuring and downsizing o f public
             administration in the mid-1990s. To identify appropriate measures to control public
             service, the Government is carrying out analysis on cost effectiveness and efficiency
             o f increased employment in social sectors, and preparing a position paper on the
             issue.

        0    Launch a new phase of the public service reform program. Under PRSC2, the
             Government developed a draft strategic framework, reflecting lessons learned, for the
             new phase o f public service reform. Since then the Government has finalized the
             strategy and i s awaiting Cabinet approval to proceedwith full implementation. Inthe
             meantime, implementation o f ongoing reforms continues.

100.    Expected Results: Over the course o f the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:

        0   Government better able to recruit, motivate and retain skilled staff, particularly
            managerial, technical, and professional staff.

        0   The growth o f public administration contained.

        0  New staff entered in 30 days on the Government payroll, which contains only bona
            fide employees, and integrated personnel and payroll system developed.

        0   Better managed public service.


                                        PublicProcurement

101.    Issues: The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), that was prepared under
PRSC1, indicated that the public procurement system presents a major risk to effective public
sector management in general, and a constraint to effective service delivery in particular. The
legal and regulatory framework governing procurement was found to be diffused and poorly
enforced, and overall management o f public procurement inefficient and non-transparent.
Procurement planningwas found to be virtually non-existent.

102.    Since then the Government has launched a major reform o f the public procurement
system. A complete overhaul o fprocurement systems at the central Government level is ongoing,
with plans to next extend the reforms to districts.         The reform program is based on the
recommendations o f CPAR, following its recommended actions and sequencing.              A CPAR
update is planned to be carried out in 2003/04.


                                                  29

103.    OverallProgress: The Government is committed to reforming public procurement. The
new procurement law, that provides the legal basis for procurement reforms, has been enacted.
Also, in all central government procuring ministries, departments, and agencies, procurement
unitshave beenestablished and are operational. The next step will be to extendthe reforms to the
district government level.     To determine the best way to proceed with local government
procurement reforms, the Government has conducted an assessment o f district government
procurement and is gathering systematic data on volume and recipients o f district procurement
contracts.

104.    With the legal and regulatory framework established for public procurement, the focus
has shifted to strengthening the enforcement o f procurement rules and regulations. To increase
transparency and reduce corruption inprocurement, the Reformed Central Tender Board (RCTB),
after enactment of the new law called the Public Procurement and Disposal o f Public Asset
Authority (PPDA), has started carrying out independent procurement audits in line ministries.
Also, with a slight delay, it has started publishingquarterly reports on contract awards exceeding
us$200,000.

105.    There is an urgent need to strengthen the capacity in public procurement. A number of
donors have shown keen interest in assisting the Government with capacity building and
expanding the existing efforts. Netherlands has agreed to continue its supporting for capacity
building, and UNDP, USAID, and Danida have agreed to join in this endeavor. A committee of
donors is helping the Government to coordinate the multi-donor effort.

106.    Reform Strategy: Under PRSC, key areas for improving public procurement include the
following:

    0   Implement public procurement reform, including updating the legal and regulatory
        framework.     Under PRSC1, the Government issued new procurement regulations,
        dismantled the old Central Tender Board (CTB), established a new Reformed Central
        Tender Board (RCTB), and created contract committees in all procuring entities. Under
        PRSC2, the Government tabled the new Procurement Bill in Parliament, and issued
        instructions to procurement entities to establish procurement units. Progress in
        establishing procurement units to support contract committees and handle process aspects
        o f procurement was, however, slower than initially expected, owing to delays in creating
        the needed posts in ministries and agencies. Because the procurement function did not
        have a separate scheme o f service within the Government, the Government had to create
        the positions and map them to agencies, which delayed the establishment o f units. Since
        then the Procurement Act has been enacted, and procurement units established in all
        central government ministries, departments, and agencies. To get a better understanding
        o f procurement at the local government level before extending the reforms to that level,
        the Government has carried out an assessmentofdistrict government procurement.

    0   Strengthen enforcement of procurement rules and regulations, and planning of
        procurement. Under PRSC2, to promote transparency in procurement, RCTB was to
        start publishing quarterly reports o f contracts costing more than US$200,000. However,
        untilthe enactment o f the Procurement Act, RCTB did not have the needed authority to
        access the required information, and hence the action had to be delayed. Since then, after
        the enactment o fthe law, PPDA has published the first quarterly report on contracts, and
        also published its first annual report.
        To improve enforcement o f procurement rules and regulations, PPDA has also started
        carrying out independent procurement audits covering at least 20 percent o f the value o f
        procurement in education, health, water and sanitation, and agriculture. Inthe next fiscal

                                                  30

           year, audits are expected to be extended to cover all sectors at central government and 30
           percent o f local government procurement.
           To improve planning o f procurement, the Government started incorporating procurement
           plans in sector expenditure programs in education, health, and water and sanitation under
           PRSC2. Since then this practice has been extended to cover agriculture.

           Strengthen capacity of procurement units. Under PRSC2, weak procurement entities
           hired procurement agents to provide support. Since then the practice has continued and
           the Government is in the process of pre-qualifying third-party procurement agents. To
           build capacity in procurement units, PPDA has prepared a strategy for capacity building
           and training in procurement. A number o f donors are assisting the Government with
           capacity buildingand expanding the existing efforts.
107.       Expected Results: Over the course o f the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:
               New public procurement legislation and arrangements inplace and fully operational at
               the center and substantial progress indistricts to produce better value for money.

           0   Increased efficiency, transparency and reduced corruption in public procurement, and
               better management o f expenditure programs.

           0   Increase inthe share o f clean audit reports for contracts post-reviewed from 50 percent
               in2003 to 90 percent in2005.


                                            FinancialManagement

108.       Issues: Only about 20 percent o f the budgeted non-wage funding actually reached
schools in Uganda in 1995. To reduce the leakage, the Government started using media and
notice boards in schools to provide the public information on resource flows. As a result, in
2000, the share o f allocation that reached school had risen to above 90 percent. This share has
since been maintained.              The current financial management reforms attempt to improve
effectiveness o f public resource use by similar means: by enhancing transparency and promoting
accountability.

109.       The Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) that was carried out under the
PRSC1 indicated that inadequate financial accounting and auditing systems both at the center and
in districts pose a major fiduciary risk. While Uganda has a relatively good budgeting system,
accounting for public expenditure usingthe present manual system was found to be weak, largely
because o f disregard for timely and regular recording o f transactions, side-stepping o f controls,
and lack o f financial discipline.          Similarly, findings o f audit reports were found not to be
regularly followed-up, and public accounts contained a number o f material non-reconciled
balances. In addition, the HIPC tracking assessment carried out in Uganda inthe fall o f 2001 and
the update o f 2002 point out a number o f weaknesses in financial management at the local
government level.12 The financial management reform program has been largely crafted based on
the results o f CFAA and HIPC tracking. A CFAA update and another HIPC tracking update are
planned to be carried out in2003/04.




'IThe rankingof Ugandawas slightly loweredfrom the first assessment. This does not, however, meanthat financial management in
Uganda has deteriorated. The reason for a lowered rating is that the latest assessment, unlike the first one, included the local
govemments, which lowered Uganda's overall rating. The performance and functioning of systems is significantly higher at the
central levelthan at the local one.

                                                            31

110.      Overall Progress: The Government has made steady progress in strengthening its
financial management arrangements, resulting in improved control o f public expenditure. The
legal and regulatory framework governing public finances has been updated. The new Public
Finance and Accountability Act has been enacted, and treasury instructions and financial
regulations have been updated. The new Act stipulates that government accounts are prepared in
accordance with international accounting standards; provides the office o f Accountant General
increased authority and responsibility for accountability; clarifies the responsibilities for
supervision, control, management, and accountability for public finances; and calls for
appropriate internal audit arrangements in each ministry, department, or agency, and
establishment o f audit committees to follow up on internal and external audit findings.

111.     Timeliness o f financial reporting has improved, though much still remains to be done.
About 40 percent o f districts and urban authorities produced annual accounts for 2001/02 within
the statutory deadline o f four months. The Accountant General's Office (AGO), formerly known
as the office o f the Director o f Accounts (DA), produced semi-annual and quarterly financial
statements on time, and the Office o f the Auditor General (OAG) audited 46 percent o f districts'
and urban authorities' accounts for 2001/02 within the statutory deadline. The Government has
also stepped up its efforts to strengthen capacities and provide continued training in these areas,
but its ability to attract and retain skilled staff remains a challenge owing to relatively low
salaries, and needs to be addressed through the ongoing pay reform.

112.     Though progress has been made with preparation o f annual accounts and audit o f these at
the higher local government level, the audit o f lower local government accounts, and the quality
and follow-up to audit results and recommendations remain challenges. There are close to 900
sub-county governments inUganda. Giventhe capacity constraints, auditing o f all their accounts
on an annual basis is not realistic, but needs to be phased. The Government i s developing an
approach for the audit o f sub-county accounts.       In addition, the new Parliamentary Local
Government Accounts Committee regularly conducts investigations o f the findings in local
government audit reports, thus strengthening the follow-up process and enhancing accountability
structures at the local government level. Further, to improve the follow-up to audit results, the
Government has stepped up its efforts to clear the backlog o f Treasury Memoranda, and has
issued Treasury Memorandafor 1997/98.

113.     The recent HIPC tracking update highlighted the need to strengthen internal audit
functions both at the central and local government levels. In response, the financial regulations
have been adjusted to clearly define the internal audit function--its role, responsibilities, and
reporting requirements. Furthermore, internal audit programs have been developed in order to
enhance the quality o f internal audits. To improve the quality o f external audits, the Government
has hired and deployed technical advisers in OAG, who are working on guidelines for planning,
quality control, and contracting out o f audit work. OAG has also prepared training programs for
staff on improved audit techniques.

114.     The work on the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) has proceeded on
schedule, after the slight delay inthe design stage in2001/02. The Government has approved the
system design, contracted the suppliers, and made preparations for its launch. Among other
things, a framework for the new Chart o f Accounts has been prepared and introduced through the
budget process. The IFMS system will next be rolled out on a pilot basis in six ministries and
four local governments.

115.    Reform Strategy: Under PRSC, key areas for improving financial management include
the following:


                                                 32

Update the legal and institutionalframework for financial management. The former
Public Finance and Accountability Act dated back to 1964.           Under PRSC1, the
Government drafted a new Public Finance and Accountability Bill and, under PRSC2,
tabled it in Parliament. Since then the Act has been enacted and the Government has
prepared financial regulations to enforce the provisions o f the Act.        Also, the
Government has established a Public Expenditure Management Committee
(PEMCOM) to steer public expenditure management reforms.
Improve accounting and reporting at the center and districts. The Government has
made significant progress with the preparation o f accounts.        Under PRSC2, the
Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) prepared 90 percent o f districts and urban
authorities' annual accounts for 2000/01, and cleared the backlog from previous years.
Since then 40 percent of districts and urban authorities produced annual accounts for
2001/02 within the statutory deadline o f four months.
In response to the CFAA findingthat public accounts contained a number of material
non-reconciled balances, AGO reconciled and started regularization o f material
brought forward items in government bank accounts and the consolidated fund under
PRSC2. Since then AGO has ensured that the accounts and financial statements for
2001/02 reflect the reconciliation and regularization, and that reconciliation includes
all Treasury Bank accounts and reflects all public expenditure.
To promote financial discipline at the central government level, AGO made
preparations for introducing consolidated interim financial statements under PRSC1.
Under PRSC2, AGO started producing semi-annual interim financial statements.
Since then the statements have been made quarterly, and AGO has established a
process to ensure a timely follow-up o f material variances reported in these reports.
Further, MoFPED has prepared the Treasury Memorandum for 1997/98. The backlog
o f Treasure Memoranda needs to be cleared, and there are ongoing efforts to
strengthen the capacity o f the Public Accounts Committee.
To promote financial accountability at the local government level, the Government set
up under PRSC2 in AGO a support team o f accounting professionals to help local
government authorities with their accounting and internal audit functions. This was
done as an interim solution in lieu o f increasing accounting staff, as new accountants
cannot be appointed unless they are included in the Government's staffing structures.
Since then AGO has developed and implemented capacity building programs for
central and local governments. Many accounting staff in local governments have also
enrolled for professional accounting courses, thus enabling local governments to
upgrade staff skills and meet accounting and financial reporting obligations.
As a longer term measure, to promote the recording o f and reporting on financial
transactions, the Government appointed consultants to design the Integrated Financial
Management System (IFMS) under PRSC2 and made other preparations for its
introduction, such as appointing additional accounting graduates to assist in
implementation. The roll out o f IFMS was slightly delayed from the original schedule
because the design process took more time than initially expected. Since then the
Government has approved the design o f IFMS, contracted the external suppliers, and
deployed accounting graduates to assist ministries and local governments. In addition,
the new Chart o f Accounts has been finalized. The next step will be to roll out the
system on a pilot basis in six ministries and four local governments.
Strengthen audit structures and practices. Under PRSC1, O A G was strengthened
through an appointment o f an internationally qualified accountant as Auditor General.
Under PRSC2, in order to ensure the independence o f OAG, the Government

                                       33

          submitted to the Cabinet a memorandum on enhancing OAG's independence with
          respect to human resource management, access to information on public expenditure,
          and indemnity o f OAG staff. OAG has since then, however, noted that granting OAG
          autonomy with respect to human resource and budgetary management would require a
          constitutional amendment. In response, the Government has prepared a proposal on
          constitutional reform to enhance independence o f OAG. Furthermore, OAG has been
          granted accessto classified accounts.
          OAG audited all annual accounts for 2000/01 that were received from districts and
          urban authorities by the end o f December 2001, in addition to clearing the audit
          backlog from previous years. Since then OAG has audited 46 percent o f districts' and
          urban authorities annual accounts for 2001/02 within the statutory deadline. OAG,
          MoFPED and M o L G have also agreed on an approach for audit o f sub-county
          governments.
          The new financial regulations set out the role, responsibilities, and reporting and
          accountability structures o f the Government's internal audit function.      The HIPC
          tracking assessment had identified the need for the internal audit function to be
          strengthened at both central and local government levels. In response to the HIPC
          findings, a training needs assessment, which included the internal audit cadre, was
          carried out, and AGO has developed internal audit programs.
          To improve the quality o f audits, under the PRSC2, OAG started recruiting quality
          assurance managers.      These managers were deployed in August/September 2002.
          Since then, OAG has developed for its staff a training program accredited by the
          Institute o f Certified Public Accountants in Uganda (ICPAU) for them to gain
          continued professional credits and strengthen their skills. It has also prepared work
          plans, regular progress reports, and capacity buildingprograms for financial audits, and
          computerized auditing and evaluation o f financial management systems. Guidelines
          for planning, quality control, contracting out o f audit work, and introduction o f value
          for money audits, as well as training programs on improved audit techniques have been
          prepared.
116.    Expected Results: Over the course o f the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:

        0   Updated legislation and regulatory environment for financial management.

        0   The share o f districts and urban authorities that have produced annual accounts
            within the statutory deadline increased from 40 percent in 2002/03 to 90 percent in
            2004/05.

        0   The share o f districts and urban authorities' annual accounts audited within the
            statutory deadline increased from 46 percent in2002/03 to 90 percent in2004/05.

        0   Reducedfiduciary risk at the central and local government level.


                       Transparency, Participation,and Anti-Corruption

117.    Issues: A number o f reforms supported by PRSC aim to control corruption. These
include the earlier discussed reforms o f the public service, particularly pay and human resources
management, the creation of a strong and transparent regulatory regime to govern public
procurement, and reforms to promote financial accountability. While essential, these are not
enough. In addition, there i s a need to improve transparency and detection, investigation, and
prosecution o f corruption cases. This includes improving the functioning o f the justice, law and

                                                34

order sector and the work o f oversight institutions. All these efforts together are geared to curb
corruption.

118.    Overall Progress: The Government has made good progress with the implementation o f
the new Leadership Code since its assent to a law inJuly 2002. Giventhe wide coverage of the
new code-it     applies to about 16,000 public employees, their spouses, and children under 18
years old-and     limited capacity o f the Inspectorate o f Government (IG), the Government has
decided to proceed with the enforcement o f the code in phases, and pay most attention to key
groups o f leaders (Ministers, Presidential Advisors, Permanent Secretaries, Directors, and Uganda
Revenue Authority officials) in each phase. Consistent with the new code, all leaders were asked
to re-declare their income, assets, and liabilities within three months o f the assent o f the code.
Duringthe first phase, IG has focused on ensuring that asset declarations are submitted by all
leaders. Each non-compliant leader was sent a reminder and given an opportunity to provide to
the Inspector General o f Government (IGG) within thirty days the asset declaration form or a
valid reason (such as, retirement from the service) for non-compliance. Full compliance has been
achieved for all key groups o f leaders, except six Presidential Advisors and seven URA officials.
IGG issued to appointing authorities/responsible officers letters requesting them to take
disciplinary action-which     is dismissal from or vacating the office in case o f non-declaration-
against leaders who had failed to declare, and appointing authorities/responsible officers have
dismissed the non-compliant URA officials and Presidential Advisors. Inparallel, IG has started
to verify the contents o f submitted asset declarations.

119.    Overall, efforts to pass, implement, and enforce the Leadership Code have catalyzed a
healthy discussion o f corruption in Uganda, and given a new momentum to anti-corruption
efforts. Among other things, non-compliance o f select leaders with the code i s today openly
discussed inthe media.

120.    Little progress, however, has been made with the proposed Whistleblower and Access to
Government Information bills. The principles o f these pieces o f legislation were to be tabled to
Cabinet in 2002/03, but, owing to a shortage o f staff, the Department o f Ethics and Integrity
(DEI) is still carrying out consultations on the proposed Whistleblower Bill. The preparation of
the Access to Government Information Bill has been handed over to MOPS. The work on the
Anticorruption Bill has by contrast proceeded as planned. The purpose o f the bill i s to provide a
more effective legal framework to combat corruptionand misappropriation o f public resources by
strengthening enforcement; increasing the capacity to recover property or other proceeds o f
corruption; prohibiting individuals found guilty o f corruption from bidding for government
contracts or otherwise doing business with the Government; making publicly known the names o f
companies that are found engaged in corrupt practices; and barring such companies from
biddingor public contracts or otherwise doing business with the Government. Presently there are
several pieces o f legislation covering these issues, and the plan is to integrate them into one
anticorruption legislation.

121.    Reform Strategy: Under PRSC, the key areas o f reform to promote transparency,
participation, and reduce corruption are:

        0   Improve citizens ' access to public information, including open access to leaders'
             income and asset declarations. Under PRSC1, the Government reviewed the Official
             Secrets Act in light o f best practice regarding access to government information, and
            produced a citizens' guide to the budget process. Under PRSC2, the Government
            carried out consultations with stakeholders on ways to improve access to government
             information, and prepared a communication strategy for fiscal policy and the budget.
             Since then the Government has not made much progress on access to government
             information legislation, and continued carrying out consultations which is an

                                                  35

important aspect o f preparingthis complex legislation. MOPSis currently leading the
effort with support o f DEI. The principles o f the new legislation are expected to be
tabled to Cabinet by April 2004.
UnderPRSC1, the Government gazetted and tabled the Leadership Code and IGBills
inParliament. These pieces of legislation are significant since they address the higher
level corruption and enable investigation o f corruption cases, respectively: the
Leadership Code calls for open citizen access to leaders' asset declarations, and the
IG Statutes provides for the powers and procedures required by IG to fight
corruption. Parliament passed both bills during PRSC2, and after President's assent
are now Acts o f Parliament.       In addition, under PRSC2, key groups of leaders
submitted to IGG their statements o f income, assets, and liabilities. Since then IG
has proceeded with the implementation and enforcement o f the new Leadership
Code. In the fall o f 2002, all leaders were requested to redeclare their assets in
accordance with the new Code within three months. To enforce the code, IGG
issued to appointing authorities letters requesting them to take disciplinary action
against leaders who failed to declare, and appropriate action, dismissal from or the
leader vacating the office, has been taken. Next IG intends to verify the correctness
o f declarations o f key categories o f leaders and take appropriate action which
includes, among other things, confiscation o f non-declared assets and property.
The Government has also agreed that select reports o fcommissions o f inquirywill be
published within six months o f work completion together with a white paper on
proposed action.

Improve detection, investigation, and prosecution of corruption cases.            Under
PRSC1, IGG published its first semi-annual report, and the Government started to
develop quantitative indicators to assess progress in the fight against corruption. As
part o f the PRSC2, the Government proposed to Parliament a stronger follow-up
mechanisms for IGG reports, and launched the second integrity survey. Since then
the Sessional Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs has discussed IGG's
latest report. Also, the survey has been completed and its results disseminated
through a nationalworkshop.
In addition, under PRSC2, the Government reviewed all anti-corruption legislation
and assembled recommendations for consolidation and amendments, and initiated
consultations on a whistleblower protection legislation. Since then the Government
has presented to Cabinet the principles o f anti-corruption legislation, but the work on
whistleblower and access to government information legislation have been delayed,
as consultations are still to be carried out. The principles o f whistleblower protection
legislationare expectedto be presented to Cabinet by April 2004.
Agree on NGO policy and harmonize the use of participatory approaches. Under
PRSC1,the Government created a computerized database o f NGOs and faith-based
organizations.   In addition, it started preparing a harmonized framework for
community participation in different aspects o f service delivery. The participatory
framework was completed and its implementation began under PRSC2. The work on
the NGO Bill was also underway. Further, under PRSC2, an NGO survey was
carried out to get a better understanding o f functions and capacities o f NGOs in
Uganda. The results o f the survey have been used to inform the design o f the NGO
Bill. Since then the Government and NGOs have together agreed on the draft NGO
Bill. Also, with some delay, local governments have started implementingthe
harmonized participatoryplanning guide.


                                      36

             Implement commercial justice reforms to enhance enforcement of commercial
             contracts. Under PRSC1, the justice, law and order sector adopted a sector-wide
              approach to criminal and commercial justice reforms, and developed a commercial
             justice reform program. This program focuses, among other things, on strengthening
             the Commercial Court to improve access and case processing; establishment o f the
              Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution consistent with international best practice;
              strengthening o f land and companies registries; and revision o f commercial laws.
             The Government started the implementation o f the program under PRSC2 and has
              since then continued the work.

122.     Expected Results: Over the course o f the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:

         0   Improved accessto public information to reduce opportunities for corruption.

         0   More effective detection, investigation, prosecution, and follow-up o f corruption
             cases.

    D.     PEAPPRSP Pillar 111:DirectlyIncreasingthe Ability ofthe Poor to Raisetheir
                                              Incomes

123.     Increasing agricultural growth rates, diversifying agricultural production, and expanding
non-farm employment are essential for poverty reduction since 85 percent o f Ugandans live in
rural areas (which includes 96 percent o f the country's poor), and 84 percent o f the rural poor
earns a living from agriculture. Non-farm activities play a particularly relevant role for women:
female-headed households engaged in both farm and non-farm work have risen out o f poverty at
greater rates than those engaged only in agriculture. Ingeneral, agriculture continues to dominate
the Ugandan economy accounting for about 40 percent o f GDP, 85 percent o f export earnings,
and 80 percent o f employment.

124.     In order to raise agricultural growth, the Government has developed the Plan for
Modernization o f Agriculture (PMA) through a broad-based consultative process.                 The
cornerstone o f P M A is the transformation o f subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture,
with accelerated growth through technological change throughout the sector. PMA identifies
seven priority areas for public action: research and technology development; agricultural advisory
services; rural finance; agro-processing and marketing; agricultural education; sustainable natural
resource utilization and management; and supportive physical infrastructure. P M A provides the
strategic and operational framework for environmentally sustainable rural development and
agricultural transformation. It does not provide a detailed plan o f action, but describes the types
o f policy interventions required to promote rural development, and defines the responsibilities of
the public sector, private sector, and civil society inthis effort. The continuing challenge facing
the Government is to operationalize the plan, which includes identifying and designing the
actions that will have the largest impact on rural development and poverty. The PRSC reform
program supports that task.


                                                 37

125.     Issues: Improving agricultural productivity through the generation and adoption o f
improved agricultural technologies is one o f PMA's priorities. Current institutionalarrangements
for agricultural research and advisory services have, however, a number o f weaknesses.
Specifically, public sector support for agricultural research is channeled almost exclusively
through the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO), and research is predominantly
supply-driven. District governments have been responsible for extension services, but with little
improvement in service delivery. Surveys indicate that extension workers are not visiting farmers
much, their advice lacks a coherent direction, and may fail to address key problems such as
animal and plant disease.

126.     Access to financial services is an important condition for rural households to improve
their livelihoods, and Ugandan farmers identify lack of access to credit as a major constraint to
their development. Although farmers tend to focus on access to credit, access to savings is
equally important. To promote rural and micro-finance, Ph4A calls for a policy o f Government
withdrawal from direct intervention inrural credit, as past programs have been unsustainable, and
for the development o f a legal and regulatory framework to better govern operations o f different
actors inthis arena.

127.     Improved market access is also essential for the transformation from subsistence to
commercial agriculture and hence for the success o f Ph4A. Both geography and institutional
impediments are constraining crop marketing, and creating disincentives for commercial
agriculture, and non-farm rural enterprises that are particularly important from the gender point o f
view. There has been progress in improving district roads, with a tripling o f maintenance
expenditures since 1997 and with pilots for labor-based maintenance methods. The White Paper
on district and urban roads sets out the new strategies and plans for maintenance o f district, urban,
and community access roads, but does not explicitly address the implementation o f the strategies.

128.     Uganda faces challenges related to: land tenure, includingtenure insecurity; resolving the
impasse between landlords and tenants inthe mailo regions; improving women's access to secure
land tenure; and greater formalization o f communal land tenure rights. The Land Act o f 1998
provides a legal basis for regularizing land tenure under mailo, freehold, and customary tenure
regimes, and by providing for decentralized land administration and conflict resolution.
Implementation o fthe Land Act has, however, proceeded slowly.

129.     Finally, it i s important that rural development i s done in an environmentally sustainable
manner. Given that agriculture is the dominant user o f land and water resources, efforts to
improve sustainability o f natural resource use focus heavily on it. Currently, environmental
sustainability concerns are not adequately integrated into government programs. Environmental
factors also influence health and other development outcomes. According to estimates, about 25
percent o f the burden o f disease in the Africa region i s associated with environmental factors,
including exposure to unsafe water, lack o f sanitation, indoor air pollution, and exposure to
chemicals.

130.     Overall Progress: The Government has made preparations for a comprehensive reform
o f agricultural research delivery. It has carried out a review o f the National Agricultural Research
System (NARS) and, based on the results o f the review and further consultation, a new strategy
for agricultural research has been developed. The new strategy calls for a more demand-driven
research system, supporting, mostly on a competitive basis, a broader range o f research providers
than before, while continuing to provide funding to basic agricultural research through NARO
that will be reformed.



                                                   38

131.     A comprehensive reform o f agricultural extension services to improve access to and
effectiveness o f these services is also ongoing through the multi-donor supported National
Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) program. NAADS is a demand-driven program where
public funds are channeled to farmer fora at the sub-county level for them to contract the services
o f farm advisors. It also attempts to empower women's groups to demand the services they need.
In addition, funds will be available at the district level to both train farmers on how to contract
these services and improve skills o f agricultural advisors. The program was launched in 2001/02
and will be gradually expanded to cover all districts. So far, the Government has expanded the
program to sub-counties in sixteen districts.

132.     The establishment o f implementation arrangements for the Land Sector Strategic Plan
(LSSP) and staffing o f the new LSSP division have taken longer than initially expected, and
hence implementation o f some LSSP related benchmarks have been delayed.             Based on the
results o f analytic work on women's access to land and common property, the Government has
prepared a plan to strengthen land rights o f women and orphaned children, and, as part o f the
plan, conducted an awareness campaign on the same.

133.    The Microfinance Deposit-taking Institutions Bill has been passed. Also, a number o f
donor agencies are supporting programs to build capacity o f rural micro-finance institutions under
the framework o f the micro-finance outreach program.

134.    A policy and strategy for the planning, construction, and maintenance o f district, urban,
and community access roads have been finalized, and preparation o f a ten-year district road
investment program i s underway.

135.     The work on integration o f environmental concerns into government programs has been
relatively slow, since work cuts across all sectors and the process o f reaching consensus on the
scope o f work has taken longer than expected. Progress has been made in some sectors and loca
governments, though. At the request o f the Government, the reform program has been expanded
to cover forest management issues.        In PEAPPRSP, forest degradation is identified as an
environmental and economic concern, and strengthening o f forest management i s called for.
Twenty-four percent o f Uganda's land area i s covered by forest, and the country's forest and tree
resources provide energy for about 90 percent o fthe population, particularly for the poor.

136.    Reform Strategy: Under PRSC, key areas o f reform to promote rural development
include:

             Improve responsivenessand impact of publicly funded agricultural research. Under
             PRSC2, as the first step, the Government completed a draft review o f the National
             Agriculture Research system.       Since then it has completed and endorsed a new
             strategy for agricultural research and initiated its implementation.

         0   Increase access and effectiveness of agricultural advisory services. The Government
             recently launched NAADS, which contracted agricultural service providers in more
             than ten sub-counties under PRSC2. Since then the program has been extended to
             over 100 sub-counties and sixteen districts. Also, the Government has completed an
             agriculture sector functional analysis o f district offices, and developed staffing
             guidelines to facilitate the downsizing o f district extension staff where NAADS is
             operating.

             Develop the legal and regulatory    framework    governing micro-finance, and improve
             operating capacity of micro-finance institutions. Under PRSC2, the Government
             tabled in Parliament a Microfinance Deposit-taking Institutions Bill that enables
             micro-finance institutions to become licensed financial intermediaries, without

                                                  39

  restricting credit-oriented NGOs and member-based savings and credit associations
  or imposinginterest rate controls. Inaddition, the Government agreed on an outreach
  program for micro-finance institutions. Since then the Microfinance Bill has been
  enacted, and its implementation has started.

  Reduce constraints to agro-processing and marketing: Currently, the Government
  has three different strategies-PMA,     Medium Term Competitiveness Strategy, and
  Strategic Exports-that      address agro-processing and marketing from different
  perspectives. To bring different issues introduced together in a coordinated matter,
  the Government together with the private sector has agreed on a Marketing and Agro-
  processing Strategy and coordination arrangements for its implementation.
  Under PRSC2, the Private Sector Foundation, inconsultation with the private sector,
  prepared a coffee strategy that, among other things, recommended redefining the role
  o f Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) to support niche market
  development and market-oriented quality standards, an action also included in the
  Government's Marketing and Agro-processing Strategy. Since then the Government
  has assigned a task team to review the recommendations and taken appropriate
  action.
  The Government has also reviewed and finalized a Warehouse Receipt System Bill
  for submission to Cabinet. The Bill will provide the legal foundations for licensing
  o f warehouses and warehouse keepers, for the system o f warehouse bonding, and for
  the issue o fwarehouse receipts.

e Implement the 1998LandAct in aprioritized manner andpromote access to land by
  women and orphans. Under PRSC2, as the first step, the Land Sector Strategic Plan
  (LSSP) to implement the 1998 Land Act was approved by Cabinet together with the
  amendments to the Land Act, and the Government finalized the financial and
  institutional arrangements for its implementation. Since then the Government has
  completed the recruitment o f staff for the LSSP division, and implementation o f
  LSSP has commenced.
  The initiationo f pilot projects on systematic demarcation, land adjudication, and land
  adjustment has been delayed, owing to delays in preparation o f guidelines for
  implementation.     The guidelines for implementation and evaluation have been
  established, and pilots are expected to start.
  The Government developed a draft proposal to strengthen land rights o f women and
  orphans under PRSC2. Since then an action plan has been prepared based on study
  recommendations, and as the first step the Government has carried out a campaign to
  increase awareness o f land rightsamong women and other vulnerable groups.
  Under PRSC2 the Government also started developing proposals for pilot schemes to
  strengthen common property management systems. The work on proposals was,
  however, delayed due to the need for wider consultations. Since then Government
  has finalized proposals and started implementation o f pilot schemes. Pilot schemes
  cover, for example, registration o f communal land associations and development o f
  model constitutions for their operation.

  Integrate environmental sustainability concerns in government programs. Under
  PRSC2, the Government agreed to undertake a review o f institutional arrangements
  for environmental governance to find out how to improve integration o f
  environmental concerns in all government programs. The review has been completed
  and recommendations for the way forward prepared.             NEMA has developed
  guidelines for strategic and sectoral environmental impact assessment (EIA). EIA

                                       40

            guidelines have been developed and implemented in the road sector, draft guidelines
            for WSS, energy, and mining prepared, and work on guidelines for agriculture,
            forestry, and wildlife has begun. New local government planning manuals promoting
            environmentally sustainable planning have been prepared, and guidelines for
            environmental screening o f sector plans and programs developed for the budget
            process. Several districts have developed district environment action plans which are
            being integrated into their development plans. The work on sector-wide planning
            (SWAP) for environment and natural resources has commenced, and environmental
            monitoring indicators have been developed.
            The Government has also begun gradually increasing funding for the National
            Environmental Management Agency (NEMA) within the budget, starting in the
            forthcoming 2003/04 MTEF. During the negotiations o f the Second Environmental
            Management Capacity Building Project, the Government agreed to provide 25
            percent o f the NEMA'Srecurrent budget through the project's mid-term review, and
            50 percent o f the recurrent budgetby the end o f the project.
            Based on the recommendation o f the P M A Steering Committee, the reform program
            has been expanded to cover forestry. Forestry is highlighted in PEAPPRSP as a
            priority, as forest resource degradation is leading to higher fuel wood collection time
            and lower forest related incomes.       The Government has launched the National
            Forestry Plan that outlines the implementation o f the 2001 Forestry Policy. The
            National Forestry and Tree Planting Act (2003) has been enacted and MoWLE is in
            process o f launching the NationalForestry Authority and district forestry services.
            Improve the network of district roads. The Government agreed on policy and
            strategy for planning, construction, and maintenance o f district roads under PRSC2.
            Since then the central and district governments have developed proposals to establish
            technical offices to assist district governments in the implementation o f the strategy.
            Also, they have started developing a 10-year district road investment program, which
            is expectedto be completed and endorsed by April 2004.

137.   Expected Results: Over the course of the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:
            Increased responsiveness and effectiveness o f publicly supported agricultural
            research.
            Agricultural advisory service providers contacted in 150 sub-counties in21districts.
            Financially sustainable micro-finance institutions, and greater access to financial
            services by the rural poor.
            Increaseddiversificationto higher value products.
            Effective use and management o f land resources through more secure tenure rights,
            reduced conflicts, and transparent land markets.
            Equitable and secure access to and control o f land by women and orphans.
            Reduced level and risk o f environmental degradation.
            Increasedaccessibility inrural areas.

        E.     PEAPPRSPPillar IV: Directly Increasingthe Quality ofLife of the Poor

138.     Public services, in particular primary education, health care and potable water and
sanitation, have a direct impact on the quality o f life o f the poor. Consequently, their delivery i s a
central element o f PEAP/PRSP and the PRSC reform program.

139.     Inthe education sector, the Government continues emphasizing the delivery of universal
primary education (UPE) and the need to improve its quality by providing the necessary
infrastructure, teachers and instructional materials, while also moving ahead with implementation
o f a sustainable strategy for post-primary education. The Government i s committed to achieving
the MDGs on universal completion o f primary education, and elimination o f gender disparities in
primary and secondary education.

140.     The Government's national health policy and health sector strategic plan (HSSP)
continues to guide the delivery o f public health care. At the heart o f this plan i s the health
package which provides prevention and treatment o f the most prevalent diseases. The plan also
attempts to strengthen health care delivery and ensure equal access to health services. The
National Strategic Framework for HIV/AIDS Activities (2000/1-2005/6) guides the work to
control the spread o f HIV/AIDS, to mitigate its effects on households and communities, and to
strengthen the national capacity to respond to it.

141.     According to the results o f PPAl and PPA2, in addition to education and health, one o f
the key development priorities ofthe poor is to increase access to safe water. Responding to this
need, the PEAPFRSP sets as a goal sustainable provision o f accessible safe water and sanitation
facilities to the entire rural population, and a large share o f the enhanced HIPC debt relief has
been allocated to water and sanitation. The Government is committed to achieving the MDG on
access to safe water.


                                  Improving Quality of Education

142.     Issues: As a result o f the Universal Primary Education (UPE) launched in 1997, primary
school net and gross enrollment rates have been steadily increasing. The analysis o f the 1999/00
household survey indicates that UPE has eliminated the wealth bias that characterized access to
primary education, and has helped to establish gender equality by increasing girls' access to
primary education. Quality o f education remains, however, a concern and dropout rates are still
high. The survival rate to P4 level is currently about 65 percent. According to the National
Service Delivery Survey (NSDS) 2000 and the Uganda DHS2000, the most common reasons for
dropping out o f school are, among others, lack o f money for direct school related expenses and
the demand for children's labor. PPA2 links UPE quality concerns to frequent absenteeism, late
attendance, and dropping-out by pupils. The Government is attempting to improve the quality
through increasing the number of teachers, availability o f textbooks, and classrooms. But given
the constrained resource envelope, actively pursuing efficiency measures in both primary and
post primary education has emerged as an urgent issue. The Government is also determined to
support post-primary education so that gains from UPE can be sustained.

143.     Overall Progress: Education, particularly UPE, remains the Government's top priority.
In 2002/03, public spending on education was 31 percent o f discretionary budget o f the
Government. Spending on primary education was about 65 percent o f this. The Government is
aiming to achieve the MDGs on universal completion o f primary schooling by 2015, and
elimination o f gender disparity in both primary and secondary education by 2005. The recently
completed policy framework for post primary education and training (PPET) demonstrates
intensified focus on this area.

                                                 42

144.     The Government has made steady progress in expanding the access and improving the
quality o f primary education. According to the 2002 school census, the primary school gross
enrollment was about 140 percent. Net enrollment o f the poorest quintile has increased to about
83 percent, with equal numbers o f boys and girls. According to PPA2, education is highly valued
by communities as a means for risingout o f poverty. While gender-disparity has been eliminated
inprimary education, drop-out rates are still high.

145.     The quality o f primary education, though still a major concern, has also slowly improved
through the increase inthe number o f teachers, textbooks, and classrooms. The recruitment drive
has increased the number o f teachers according to the plan, but since enrollment has increased
faster than expected, the pupil-teacher ratio remained at 55:l in 2002/03. The quality o f primary
school teachers has also emerged as a concern as the share o f qualified teachers in classrooms has
declined. The pupil-classroom ratio improved from 98:l in 2001/02 to 94:l in 2002/03. The
introduction o f the new curriculum invalidated all textbooks in 2002, but the concurrent changes
intextbook procurement allowed the Government to reach 3:1 pupil-textbookratios inP3 and P4
in 2002/03, and a wide range o f non-textbook materials have been distributed to all P1 and P2
classes. The procurement o f textbooks for P5-P7 i s currently ongoing.

146.     The National Examinations Board has put in place a system for National Assessment o f
Progress in Education (NAPE) to measure learning. NAPE administers standardized tests to a
sample o f pupils in P3 and P6 to measure learning in English,Mathematics, Social Studies, and
Science. Standardized tests for English and Mathematics were administered in 1996 and 1999
(the first UPE cohort), and for Social Studies and Science in 1997 and 2000. Results o f these
tests showed a declining share o f pupils attaining satisfactory grades. A follow-up NAPE test has
been piloted and administered in June 2003. The results o f the test will help to assess the trends
in learning, determine which regions and school types need additional support, and determine
whether gender-specific interventions are needed in some areas. A framework for enhanced and
more systematic monitoring o f quality o f education and learning was discussed in the education
sector review in May 2003, and indicators for regular monitoring o f learning achievement were
endorsed.

147.     Monitoring o f critical indicators has been enhanced to ensure adequate attention to
MDGs and disadvantaged districts. Further review of the Management Information System has
been undertaken to ensure more reliable statistics to monitor sector progress. In order to ensure
adequate attention to MGDs, the Government has started to monitor the share o f age-appropriate
children (disaggregated by gender) in the final year (P7) o f the primary school. The new strategy
for post primary education also aims to ensure gender equity at the post-primary level.

148.     Another notable achievement in 2002/03 was the completion o f a policy and costed
framework for the expansion o f post primary education and training. UPE is exerting significant
pressure on the existingpost primary education system. For example, about 400,000 pupilstook
Primary Leaving Examination in2002, and the post-primary schools and institutions could absorb
less than half o f these pupils. The post primary policy and framework was developed and costed
withinthe expenditure ceiling for the sector. The policy has been designed to pave the way for
reforms to increase efficiency and effectiveness, and improve quality, access, and equity o f post
primary education.      It will do that by improving teacher utilization and time on task, by
continuing to encourage private sector involvement in secondary education, by experimenting
with a small number o f community polytechnics, and by expanding general secondary education
so that the coverage o f post primary education reaches 50 percent o f the age range and each sub-
county has a secondary school. Further, it will institute a bursary scheme for the educationally
disadvantaged and review o f the curriculum, reform teacher education to include school-based

                                                 43

practice and enforcement o f minimum standards, scale up the HIV/AIDS response, and
construction and equipment o f laboratories.

149.    The Government i s also completing a new policy and strategy for tertiary education to
ensure more balanced sector development. A draft policy and strategic framework for higher
education was presented for comments to the education sector review inMay 2003. After a series
o f stakeholder consultations the final draft is expected to be presented to the education sector
reviewinOctober 2003.

150.    Reform Strategy: Government-led semiannual education sector reviews involve all
major stakeholders (the Government, donors, NGOs) to monitor progress, set targets, and
maintain a focus on the quality o f education. Education sector reviews have agreed on a set o f
monitoring indicators and quantitative targets for education. These are fully consistent with the
PEAPPRSP. The key reform areasto improve access and quality o f education are the following:
            Reduce pupil-teacher ratio. Under PRSC1, to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, the
            Government launched a national recruitment drive o f primary school teachers. Under
            PRSC2, the recruitment drive for teachers continued and there was a marked
            improvement in the recruitment o f primary school teachers by some districts. In
            addition, in-service training was providedto unqualified teachers through the Teacher
            Development and Management System (TDMS).              The Government commenced
            implementation o f Cabinet decisions aimed at attracting primary school teachers to
            remote areas, which include utilization o f 15 percent o f the classroom construction
            budget for teachers' houses and payment o f a monthly incentive allowance (20
            percent o f the monthly salary) to those teaching inhard to reach areas. Since then the
            implementation o f these measures has continued.        The number o f teachers has
            increased from 88,000 in 2000 to 123,000 in 2003, but owing to an increase in
            enrollment, the pupil-teacher ratio remained at 55: 1. A teacher tracking study has
            also been carried out, which indicates that further work on streamlining recruitment,
            deployment, and payroll management processes at the local level is needed. The
            Government is committed to implement actions aimed at addressing these issues.
            Also, the Government i s to set up mechanisms to monitor the share o f filled positions
            and step up efforts to increase the number o f teachers on payroll in ten districts with
            the largest number o f unfilledpositions.

        0   Reduce pupil-textbook ratio. Under PRSC1, the Government made progress in
            increasing the number and improving the distribution and utilization o f textbooks
            available.    The introduction o f an expanded curriculum including 11 subjects,
            however, invalidated the current textbooks. Under PRSC2, new arrangements were
            established for procurement, which resulted in an improvement in the quality o f
            learning materials and reduced the unit cost by over two-thirds. In October 2002,
            new targets for the pupil-textbook ratios were set for P3-4 and P5-7. Textbooks for
            P3-4 have been procured and distributed, and procurement for P5-7 launched. Also,
            a wide range of non-textbook materials have been procured for P1-2, and to make
            later impact assessment possible, a baseline study has been carried out. Training
            teachers inthe use o f new instructional materials and curriculum has commenced.
            Reduce pupil-classroom ratio.       The Ministry o f Education and Sports (MoES)
            established the School Facilities Development Program in 1999 and developed a
            national plan for expansion o f school facilities. Under PRSC1, in a bid to reduce
            pupil-classroom ratio, efficiency measures were initiated in the classroom
            construction program. As a result, the pupil-classroom ratio declined to 104:1, and
            under PRSC2to 98:1. Since then the ratio has further improved to 94:1.

             Increase age-appropriate children in the last year of primary school.              The
             Government has begun to monitor the share o f age-appropriate children in the final
             year o f primary school to reach the MDG o f universal primary completion. While
             substantial improvement in the ratio is likely to take some time, the Government is
             committedto working towards it.
             Monitoring and evaluation.          In order to improve collection, reliability, and
             presentation o f education data, the Education Management Information System has
             been reviewed to include private schools, an increasing proportion o f secondary
             schools, post primary education and training institutions, and information about
             complementary primary education centers. Data collection instruments have also
             been reviewed to reduce inconsistencies in interpretation o f statistical data, and
             simplify and strengthen school demographic capture. Inorder to better target quality
             improvement efforts, a framework for monitoring quality outcomes is being
             finalized, and monitoring indicators o f student progress in literacy and numeracy
             have been established.
             Strategy for post-primary education. Under PRSC2, the Government and donors
             jointly undertook a series o f studies on post-primary education to identify options for
             sustainable expansion.       Since then the results o f these studies and stakeholder
             consultations have contributed to the strategic framework for post-primary education.
             Prioritieswithin this strategy were arrived at taking into consideration the constrained
             resource envelope.

151.     Expected Results: Over the course o f the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:
             A decline inthe pupil-teacher ratio from 63: 1to 50:1.
             A decline inthe pupil-textbook ratio from 6.7:1to 3: 1.
             A decline inthe pupil-classroom ratio from 121:1to 88:1.
             An increase in the primary completion rate, measured by an increase in net
             enrollment inthe final grade o f primary school (P7).
             Net enrollment o fthe poorest and richest quintile 100 percent by 2015.
             Gender balance inprimary enrollment maintained.

             Improved learning outcomes.


                                 ImprovingQuality of HealthCare

152.     Issues: The Government has made progress in improving health care through a sector-
wide approach. There has been progress in district health planning and budgeting, improvedflow
o f funds, increased utilization o f services, and expansion o f immunization coverage. Recruitment
o f health workers has proceeded as planned, although continuing shortages o f anesthetic
assistants, laboratory assistants, and comprehensive nurses are limiting the delivery o f the
integrated package of services. Notwithstanding this progress, DHS2000 indicates continued
high level o f infant mortality, that has not improved in the past 15 years, and persistent high
fertility and child mortality. While other factors influence these indicators, health care delivery
plays a significant role in improving them.

153.     The share o f the government budget allocated to health has significantly increased in the
past few years, but HSSP financing continues to be an issue. The Government abolished user

                                                   45

fees in government health facilities in February 2001. This led to an immediate surge in the use
o f government health services., but the longer run impact o f user fee abolishment on the
utilization o f public health care will, however, be seen only over time. Also, since the user fees
financed a significant share o f activities at the facility level, their abolishment may have had an
adverse impact on the quality o f health services, which needs attention.

 154.     OverallProgress: A number o f health indicators notably improved in the past year, and
three out of five indicators exceeded the targets. The immunizationcoverage (DPT3) of children
below one year o f age increased from 46 percent in 2001 to 63 percent in 2002. The annual out-
patient department utilization, owing to the removal o f user fees, climbed duringthe same period
from 0.43 to 0.60 per capita, and posts in government and private-not-for-profit (PNFP) health
units filled by qualified health workers rose from 40 to about 47 percent.

155.      The decline in facility-based deliveries is, however, a major cause for concern, giventhe
highmaternal mortality and teenage pregnancy rates. The share o f deliveries in government and
PNFP health units dropped from 22 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2002. Further, recent data
indicates lack o f further improvement inthe HIV prevalence rate. For the first time in a decade,
the HIV prevalence rate has risen from 6.1 to 6.5 percent. The Government recognizes that
further reduction inHIV rates requires intensified, multi-sectoral prevention efforts.

 156.     The Government has launched an inter-ministerial effort to lower the stagnated infant and
maternal mortality rates. This is a significant step forward. Since factors affecting infant and
maternal mortality rates are multi-sectoral in nature, a coordinated approach o f different
ministries is needed. Factors associated with high mortality include, but are not limitedto: high
level o f malnutrition (38 percent o f children under five are stunted and five percent wasted, 30
percent o f women are anemic); inadequate maternity services (38 percent o f deliveries are
assistedby qualified professionals); and high level o f fertility (total fertility rate is 6.9, 50 percent
o f women give birth by 19 years o f age). There is a significant regional variation in mortality,
with the Northern region (especially areas affected by conflict) estimated to have mortality rates
twice the national average. A task force has beenformed to identify actions required by different
ministries and agencies, and propose an integrated strategy for the way forward.

 157.     As mentioned under public service management, the Government is analyzing the cost
effectiveness and efficiency o f social sector employment, including health, to identify ways to
address the tension between the needs o f sectors, fast growing public service, and wage bill
pressures.

 158.    Reform Strategy: The Government's HSSP lays out the vision and strategies for
achieving better health service.      To support implementation o f HSSP, the Government has
adopted a sector-wide approach in building partnership with donors, private-for-profit and
private-not-for-profit (PNFP) health providers, and non-governmental organizations. Semiannual
joint sector reviews are held to review the sector's performance, address problems, and
coordinate the use o f resources inthe sector. These sector reviews also monitor progress, and set
targets for the sector. The health sector reviews have identified 20 key indicators, including
baseline data, to monitor performance o f HSSP. These are fully consistent with PEAPRRSP.
Key areas for improving health sector performance under PRSC3 include the following:

             Rationalize health care financing.       While the financing o f the health sector has
             traditionally been donor driven, donor funds have recently been increasingly
             channeled through the government budget. To rationalize the financing o f the sector,
             the Government developed and approved a health care financing strategy under
             PRSC2. Since then implementation o f the strategy has commenced. Mobilization of

                                                  46

            further funding and in parallel improving the effectiveness and efficiency o f health
            sector spending have beenthe key issuesto address.

        0   Strengthen procurement and management of drugs and medical supplies. Special
            attention has been given to procurement in the health sector. Under PRSC1, interim
            procurement arrangements were made in the Ministry o f Health (MoH) according to
            procurement regulations, and a sector procurement plan was prepared.               Under
            PRSC2, MoH's contract committee and procurement unit became operational, and
            M o H recruited a consultantls to assist in the development o f a procurement manual
            for drugs and supplies. In addition, it approved an implementation plan for the
            National Drug Policy and Pharmaceutical Strategic Plan. The recently completed
            drug tracking study provided valuable information on how to improve drug
            management and supply, and the Government has started reforming procurement o f
            essential drugs. A fund will be established and managed at the center and provide a
            credit line for districts to procure drugs. Also, inthe context o f the overall reform o f
            the procurement system, M o H and MoFPED have explored ways to improve
            pharmaceutical procurement and reap economies o f scale in drug procurement under
            decentralized arrangements.       The work on partial privatization o f the National
            Medical Stores has continued.

        0   Increase human resources for health. Less than half o f health facilities are filled
            with qualified staff in Uganda. Under PRSC1, two training schools begun training
            comprehensive enrolled nurses.           Under PRSC2, the Government agreed on
            management and support to health training schools, including private-not-for-profit
            schools. Also, the Government prepared and approved a human resource policy for
            the health sector. Among other things, the policy addresses harmonization o f in-
            service training, with the aim to rationalize the numerous uncoordinated seminars and
            workshops.      Since then M o H and MoES have reached an agreement on the
            modalities to fund and manage the Health Training Schools and related training
            plans.

        0   Improve health infiastructure.         Many health facilities are rundown and lack
            equipment, but it is critical that their rehabilitation is based on rational use o f
            resources. Under PRSC1, the Government completed the mapping o f health facilities
            to assess their condition and capacities, and, under PRSC2, approved the National
            Health Infrastructure Development and Maintenance Plan.              The plan aims to
            rationalize the distribution o f facilities (both public and NGO), and outline the need
            for rehabilitation, minimum new construction targeted at under-served areas,
            articulate the needs for health facilities, and lay out procedures for approval o f
            construction. Since then the implementation o f the Infrastructure and Development
            and Maintenance Plan has begun. The Government has improved the flow o f funds
            for rehabilitation and expansion o f civil works and strengthen supervision o f the
            works.

159.   Expected Results: Over the course o f the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:

        0 Rationalized financing o f the health sector.

        0 A decrease instock-outs inbasic drugs and medical supplies.

        0 An increase inthe share o fhealth facilities with qualified staff to 47 percent.

        0 An increase inDPT3 vaccination coverage for infants from 63 to 75 percent.

        0 An increase inout-of-patient department utilizationper capita from 0.60 to 0.65.

                                                   47

         0 A decreaseinHIV prevalence among the adult population from 6.5 to 5 percent.

         0 28 percent o f deliveries assisted by trained health workers.

         0 Reduced infant and maternal mortality.


                     Improving Access to and Equity inWater and Sanitation

160.    Issues: The Government adopted a sector-wide approach to planning o f the delivery o f
water and sanitation (WSS) services in Uganda in 2001/02. Activities in the sector had been
fragmented and carried out on a project-by-project basis, resulting in limited and unequal access
to safe WSS, low utilization o f facilities, and low sustainability o f services. The sector-wide
approach takes a comprehensive look at the sector, puts the Government in the driver's seat, and
i s expected to improve management o f the sector and thereby service delivery. The sector work
i s based on the Government's National Water Policy (1999), and sub-sector strategies have been
formulated for both rural areas and urban areas.

161.     Overall Progress: Safe water coverage has increased from 46 percent in 1999 to 55
percent in 2002. Uganda is on track for achieving the MDG on access to safe water. All rural
population is projected to have access to safe water by 2015, and all urban populationby 2010.

162.     Inthe past couple o f years, Uganda's rural water program has become one o f the largest
in Africa. In the past year, the Government delivered about 2,464 water points in rural areas,
extending the rural safe water coverage to 628,000 people.                 In urban areas, 10,500 new
connections were delivered, o f which about 3,000 serve poor households. Uganda's urban water
delivery system is today viewed as a model by African countries, which is remarkable since still
at the end o f 1990s the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC)13 handling urban
water delivery was inefficient, with its performance indicators below African utility standards.
The turnaround o f NWSC operations has been notable.                  Some further improvements in its
efficiency and the level o funaccounted for water are still expected, though.

163,     While safe water coverage has increased, progress with institutionalreforms in a number
o f areas has been somewhat slow. The work on full privatization o f NWSC operations and the
revision o f the urban water tariff structure have been slightly delayed. This is due in part to a
delay in hiring o f a transaction advisor.               Prompt settlement o f outstanding water bills o f
government agencies was delayed owing to the tight government budget constraint, but an
agreement has been reached on settlement by the end o f 2003/04.                  Slow progress with the
reorganization o f DWD also emerged as a concern last year, as the work at the district level
moved forward.         The reorganization plan for DWD has since been approved and its
implementation initiated.

164.     The Government is concerned about the quality o f construction and cost-effectiveness o f
WSS investments, especially in rural areas. Service delivery in rural areas has been affected by
poor procurement planning and poor construction supervision at the district level. The analysis
done by the Government indicates that the unit cost o f WSS investment has increased in the past
four years. The quality o f construction and value-for-money issues have continued to be at the
forefront o f WSS policy dialogue. The Government has taken steps to address the need to
improve the quality o f investments by strengthening support to district teams, and has also carried
out a value-for-money audit and a tracking study for the sector to identify ways to improve
efficiency.

165.    Reform Strategy: The strategy arising from the WSS sector reform process is to increase
access to and reliability, affordability, and sustainability o f the provision o f services.

166.    Inthe rural WSSsector, the reform strategy aims to increase access and quality of WSS
delivery, which remains a problem. District planning, procurement management, and especially
construction supervision and monitoring remain inadequate. The strategy, and progress made in
each component, include the following:

            Strengthen decentralized planning, implementation, and management through local
            governments. Under PRSC1, to strengthen capacities for decentralized planning,
            management, and supervision, half o f the districts set up fully staffed district water
            and sanitation teams (DWST), and the rest under PRSC2. Since then, because the
            oversight o f operation and maintenance by districts has proven to be inadequate, the
            Government has reviewed the structure o f District Water Offices (DWO) to ensure a
            balance between implementation of new WSS schemes and maintenance o f existing
            systems. The Government has agreed on a revised structure and staffing o f DWOs.
            Further, under PRSC2, the Directorate o f Water Department (DWD) finalized a WSS
            operational manual and implementation guidelines for districts, and introduced
            templates     for   environmental     screening     o f sub-projects     in districts.The
            implementation o f the guidelines and templates has, however, been slightly delayed.
            Technical Support Units (TSU) have assisted districts introduce new environmental
            and gender screening o f sub-projects.

        0   Improve central Government's capacity to assist local governments. To strengthen
            the support role o f the central Government, the planning o f DWD reorganization
            commenced under PRSC1. With reorganization, the implementation o f new rural
            water projects was devolved to districts. To provide technical assistance to districts,
            DWDstarted establishing eight technical support units(TSUs) to work with districts.
            Under PRSC2, the plans for DWD reorganization moved forward, though very
            slowly, and all TSUs were established and fully staffed.                  With TSUs fully
            operational, reorganization o f DWD became urgent. Since then MOPShas approved
            the DWDreorganization plan and initiated its implementation.

            Develop and utilize the local private sectorfor engineering, construction, spareparts
            distribution and maintenance. Under PRSC1, DWD reviewed the maintenance and
            cost recovery arrangements o f WSS facilities. Under PRSC2, DWD carried out an
            operation and maintenance study and developed a National Maintenance Strategy for
            facilities. The operationalization o f the strategy has taken more time than initially
            expected. M o W L E D W D have prepared a framework paper for private sector based
            maintenance services, and private sector based services will be introduced in
            2003104.

        0  National hygiene promotion, sanitation and communication. Under PRSC1,
            MoWLE, MoES, and M o H agreed on institutional responsibilities for sanitation, and
            under PRSC2 MoWLE, M o H and MoES jointly prepared a strategy for national
            hygiene promotion, sanitation, and communication.               Since then, following the
            strategy, M o W L E D W D and MoWEHD have carried out training programs on
            hygiene promotion and sanitation for community extension workers in districts and
            sub-counties.     Next the Government intends to introduce a Community Resource
            Book for strengthening community management and utilization o f WSS services.



                                                  49

167.     In the urban WSS sector, the strategy focuses on improving the access, reliability and
sustainability o f WSS through privatization o f NWSC. The urban WSS reform strategy includes
the following:

             Introduce local or international private operators with a clear contractual
             relationship with the Government. Under PRSC1, NWSC signed a performance
             contract with the Govemment as an interim measure to improve efficiency. Under
             PRSC2, MoWLE and MoFPED initiated a process to select a transaction advisor to
             prepare the necessary documentation and handle the selection process o f a private
             operator to manage large towns water services, starting with towns currently
             managed by NWSC. The contracting o f the transaction advisor has taken longer than
             expected, delaying efforts to introduce a private sector based lease operation for large
             towns. However, NWSChas continued to carry out reforms according to the plan. A
             significant part o f NWSC operations is on an interim basis managed by a private
             operator with a management contract, which is expected to be extended when it
             expires inJanuary 2004.
             MoWLE finalized an urban WSS policy framework and investment program under
             the PRSC2. Since then preparation of detailed designs for urban water supply for
             Kampala and other large towns has commenced.
             Improve Jinancial sustainability of urban WSS delivery. To attract potential private
             investors, financial performance o f NWSC needs to be strengthened. Under PRSC1,
             Ush 5 billion o f the debt owed by government agencies to NWSC was settled.
             Another Ush 1.7 billion out o f total Ush 2.58 billion o f verified outstanding arrears
             owed to NWSC was settled under PRSC2. Since then, to resolve the problem with
             arrears, MoFPED and NWSC have agreed on a time-bound action plan to settle the
             existing arrears owed to NWSC and taken measures to prevent new ones.
             To attract new customers, NWSC simplified its connection policy under PRSC1.
             Under PRSC2, as the first step to adjust the tariff structure, NWSC adopted a formula
             for periodic tariff adjustment. Since then NWSC has started developing a simplified
             tariff structure, including pro-poor connection policy and safe water tariff for the
             poor. NWSC and the transaction advisor will next carefully assess the suitability o f
             this structure before adopting it for leaseoperations.

168.     In small towns WSS, the strategy centers on changing the management framework.
While the development o f piped water supplies in small towns was initially based on an upgraded
rural WSS approach, recent experience has shown that they should rather be treated as simplified
urban WSS. The strategy i s as follows:
             Introduce a new WSS managementfiamework for small towns. Under PRSC1, the
             Govemment adopted an interim management strategy for small town WSS and
             started preparing the long-term strategy. Since then preparation o f the strategy has
             started.

169.     Expected Results: Over the course of the PRSC program period, Uganda expects to
achieve the following:
             Fullyoperational sector-wide program inWSS services.

         0   Inrural areas, by April 2005 increase access to safe water and sanitation from 55 to
             65 percent for an average investment o f about US$50 per capita, while the
             functionality rate o f WSS systems maintained at least at 80 percent. Reduction in
             average time spent fetching water from 30 to 25 minutes.

                                                  50

            Inurban areas, by April 2005 increase access to safe water and sanitation from 55 to
            70 percent for an average investment cost o f US$l50 per capita. WSS systems o f
            NWSC placed under an asset holding authority, and operations under private sector
            management.
            In small towns, WSS systems placed under WSS authorities, and operations shifted
            to private sector management.


                                 VII. THE PROPOSEDGRANT

170.     The proposed Grant is a core operation to implement the objectives o f PEAPPRSP and
the Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy. As detailed below, Uganda has achieved, prior to
presentationto the Board, several key program benchmarks in the areas o f equitable and efficient
use o f public resources, cross-cutting public sector reforms, rural development, and education,
health, and water and sanitation.


                   A.      ReformMeasures and Actions Taken Prior to Board

171.     PRSC3 Prior Actions: As part o f its PEAPPRSP and reform program supported by the
proposed PRSC3, the Government o f Uganda has completed the following prior actions:
            Inthe annual expenditure review, the Government has agreed with donors on MTEF
            for 2002103-2004/05, and has executed the 2002/03 budget through the first two

o f the PEAPPRSP, as indicated inthe PRSP progress report.



                                                  51

173.     PRSC4 Anticipated Prior Actions: Whether IDA will proceed to the Board with the
PRSC4 will be triggered by the completion o f the following:
              Inthe annual public expenditure review, the Government has agreed with donors on
              MTEF for 2003104-2005106, and has executed the 2003104 budget through the first
              three quarters consistent with budget allocations.
              MoPS and MoFPED have effected salary adjustments consistent with the pay reform
              strategy and MTEF.
              IG has verified asset declarations o f key categories o f leaders and taken appropriate
              action.

              May 2003 and confirmed by October 2003 review.
              Satisfactory implementation o f undertakings agreed in health sector review in April
              2003 and confirmed by October 2003 review.
              Satisfactory implementation o f undertakings agreed in water and sanitation sector
              review in September 2003 and confirmed by March 2004 review.


                               B.    Implementationand Monitoring

174.     Monitoring Arrangements. Uganda has made great strides in the use of information for
policy making in recent years. The Government is placing a strong emphasis on measurable
performance indicators (input, output, outcome), and attempting to better link resources to results
by improving results-orientation o f sector plans and expenditure programs. The Government's
Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy spells out the monitoring arrangements for the
PEAPPRSP. Monitoring is increasingly a joint effort between the Government, IDA, other
donors, and civil society in the context o f the PRSC review process, PEAPPRSP, and sector
reviews. Performance monitoring is conductedboth at the sector and national level as follows:

175.     Monitoring of Sectoral Performance: Monitoring o f sectoral performance i s primarily
conducted by ministries and agencies. Ineducation, health, water and sanitation, andjustice, law
and order sectors, the Government has established a consistent set o f monitoring indicators and
time-bound quantitative input and output targets that are tracked at regular intervals. A subset o f
the key indicators are included inthe PRSC quantitative target matrix. To collect the needed data
on indicators and monitor progress in achieving the targets, education, health, and water and
sanitation sectors have established management information systems that collect information
from each service point. In addition, all these sectors conduct annual expenditure tracking
surveys to monitor the flow o f funds, and value for money studies have also become common.
Biannuallyjoint Government-donor sector reviews are held to review and assess the performance
o f the sector-the  status o fmonitoring indicators, progress inachieving the quantitative input and
output targets, progress in completing the agreed process undertakings, results o f expenditure
tracking surveys-discuss emerging issues in sector's development, and agree on new
undertakings and quantitative targets.

176.     Monitoring of Development Outcomes: In addition to sectoral performance monitoring,
the Government is monitoring at the national level the development outcomes and impact to
assess progress in achieving PEAPPRSP objectives. Key monitoring mechanisms for poverty
and sector-level outcomes include regular household, service delivery, integrity, enterprise,

                                                  52

demographic and health surveys. In addition, periodic participatory poverty assessments, and
other surveys are carried out. The results of these surveys and other evaluations conducted, and
further analysis of development trends are reflected inannual PRSP progressreports.

177.    Coordination of PEAP/PRSP Implementation: The Government has in the past year
strengthenedits PEAPPRSP-and         inthat context PRSCnoordination arrangements. Ithas set
up a three-tier coordination system to ensure progress with reforms. The first tier comprises of
the Policy Coordination Committee (PCC). PCC, chaired by the Prime Ministerandconsisting of
Ministers, is responsiblefor reviewingthe implementation of Government policy and reporting to
Cabinet and the Presidency biannually. Below PCC, on the second tier, is the Implementation
Coordination Committee (ICC). ICC, chaired by the Head of Public Service and Secretary to
Cabinet and comprising of Permanent Secretaries, reports to PCC every four months, provides
strategic direction in the implementation of Government policies and programs consistent with
Cabinet decisions, and appraises and negotiates PRSC and other operations with donors. On the
third level are sector working groups (SWG) that formulate sector strategies and investment
plans, and review policy and implementation issues. SWGs bring together sectoral stakeholders,
meet regularly (at least every two months), and report quarterly to ICC. There will also be ajoin
secretariatto service PCC and ICC.

178.    Supervision.      Supervision and preparation of PRSCs will take place in close
collaboration with other donors and be consistent with the PEAPPRSP review mechanism. The
Government will report to IDA and other donors on a quarterly basis on progress made in each
PRSC program area (see coordination of PEAPPRSP implementation above). In addition, the
achievement of PRSC targets will be assessed annually inthe context of preparation of the PRSP
progressreport that will document the progressmade inPEAPPRSP implementation and analyze
the outcomes of reforms.       The reform program sets out clear quantitative and qualitative
benchmarks and targets for three years, which are fully consistent with PEAPPRSP.               The
benchmarks for later years are guideposts to signal when progress is advancedor falling behind in
any given area. If progress is considered adequate, Uganda's reform program will be supported
through subsequent PRSCs under the programmatic lending framework, subject to the approval
ofthe Board of Executive Directors.


                                   C.    GrantAdministration

179.    Borrower and Grant Amount. The Borrower is the Republic of Uganda. A single-
tranche Grant of SDR 106 million would be made available upon Grant effectiveness, anticipated
for September 2003. The closing date of the Grant would be September 30,2004. It is envisaged
that over the next two years, there will be two further single-tranche annual PRSCs (each in the
amount of US$150 millionequivalent) to supportthe implementation of PEAPPRSP.

180.    Rationalefor IDA Grant Use: In light of its status as a debt vulnerable country with a
GNI per capita less than US$360, and the proportion of IDA grant it received in fiscal year
2002/03, Uganda is eligible in fiscal year 2003/04 for 53 percent of its projected lending, or about
US$160 million, on grant terms. O f this amount, US$l50 million is proposed to be applied to
PRSC3 for the following reasons:

181.    Impact on education, health, and water and sanitation: PRSC aims to improve public
service delivery, in particular the access to and quality of basic services-education, health, and
water and sanitation. PRSC is the Bank's key instrument to support Government's reforms in
these sectors. All Bank's assistance to education and water and sanitation sectors is currently
channeled through PRSC, while in the health sector self-standing investment projects are

                                                53

providing support in parallel. The PRSC reform program supports the overall development o f
these sectors, and will help the Government to achieve significant results inthese areas.

182.      Several other donors have increased the share o f budget support in their assistance inthe
past couple o f years, and are providing parallel financing for implementation o f the PRSC reform
program in the form o f grants. By aligning donors' support, the program has become a key
mechanism to support PEAP/PRSP implementation, and has allowed the Government to scale up
it efforts, thereby enhancingprospects for achieving selectedMDGs.

183.      Timing of IDA grant delivery: To have a positive effect on debt sustainability, IDA
grants need to be provided in at a pace and level consistent with program reforms. For Uganda,
PRSC i s the preferred operation to deliver the grant component since PRSCs are delivered
annually and linked with the Government's budget cycle; and PRSCs are disbursed in a single-
tranche.     This will improve Government's ability to influence the delivery o f the grant
component, and help the Government's debt management. As discussed earlier in the document,
the grant component, if delivered as planned, will significantly improve Uganda's debt
sustainability projections.

184.      Monitoring Results of IDA Grunt: The impact ofthe Grant will be monitoredwithin the
results o f the overall operation (see section V1I.B on implementation and monitoring for details).
Since PRSC provides non-earmarked external finance through the Government's budget, it i s not
feasible to separate the impact o f the Grant from other government spending. A number o f other
donors are providing parallel financing, so monitoring will focus on overall performance o f
sectors and achievement o f time-bound quantitative targets.


simplified disbursement procedures for adjustment operation^.'^
185,      Disbursement, Reporting and Auditing arrangement^.'^ The Grant will follow IDA's
                                                                                         In other words, the Grant
proceeds will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated single tranche release conditions.
Disbursementwill not be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will
be needed. Once the Grant is approved by the Board, the Borrower will open and maintain a
dedicated deposit account in U S Dollars for the Borrower's use. As the single tranche i s released
on Grant effectiveness, IDA will disburse the proceeds o f the Grant into the deposit account.
Thereafter, at the request o f the MoFPED, the US Dollars amount will be converted to Uganda
Shillings at the Bank o f Uganda (BoU) for the credit o f the Government account (Consolidated
Fund Account) to be used subsequently for public expenditures. If after deposit in the deposit
account the proceeds o f the Grant or any part thereof are used for ineligible purposes, as defined
in the Development Grant Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to either: (i)return that
amount to the deposit account for use for eligible purposes, or (ii)                  refund the amount directly to
IDA.

186.      Through MoFPED, the Borrower will: (i) the exact sum received into the deposit
                                                                  report
account; (ii)indicate to IDA details o f the Consolidated Fund Account to which the Uganda
Shillings equivalent o f the Grant proceeds will be credited; (iii)                ensure that all withdrawals from
the deposit account are for budgeted public expenditures except for purposes such as military
expenditures or for other items on IDA's negative list; (iv) report to IDA the equivalent in the
local currency o f the US$ amount withdrawn from the deposit account producing evidence that

the localcurrency sumwas paid into the ConsolidatedFundAccount and that disbursementsfrom
that account were for budgeted public expenditures other than those on IDA'Snegative list; and
(v) submit a report on receipts and disbursements for both the deposit account and Consolidated
Fund to enable IDA to review the consistency o f the withdrawal with the Development Grant
Agreement and the objectives o fthe Grant operation.

187.     The controls described above are intended to provide assurance that IDA funds have
arrived at their intended destination and are being used for their intended purpose o f funding
budgeted public expenditures, and are subject to the Borrowers' rules and regulations.

188.    The following summarizes the external audits:

        0    Deposit account. The deposit account will be independently audited on terms o f
             reference acceptable to IDA within six months o f credit disbursement.

        0   Audits. The capacity o f the Auditor General (AG) will be augmented by a support
             team o f technical advisors to assist in improving audits.

        0    Public (Government) accounts. The AG is requiredby law to produce histher annual
             report to Parliament on the Public Accounts within nine months o f the financial year-
             end. IDA will have accessto those Accounts.

        0   Bank of Uganda (Bow. The annual entity financial statements o f BoU, audited in
             accordance with International Auditing Standards as promulgated by the International
             Federation o f Accountants (IFAC), are publicly available.

189.    The Country Financial Accountability Report (CFAA) on Uganda concluded that the
central and local government financial management systems represent high fiduciary risk. The
major recommendations contained in that report have been reflected in the reform program
supported by PRSC. The challenge will be securing the effective implementation o f those
recommendations in practice.        In that regard, the assiduous monitoring of the financial
management reform initiativesby the Government i s critical.

190.    Environmental Assessment.         The safeguard requirement for SECACs set forth in OP
4.01 apply to the proposed PRSC3 given its deep sectoral engagement.              PRSC3 has been
classified as Category B and will continue to build on PRSCl and PRSC2 environmental analysis
conducted for health, water and sanitation, and rural development. The safeguard measures will
ensure that potential adverse impacts will be screened and provisions are in place to mitigate
impacts, if any.       The environmental analysis is included in Annex 6; no freestanding
environmental assessment is required.

191.    Environmental risks are associated with medical waste in health care, school facilities
construction in education, several environmental design and sustainability issues o f water supply
and sanitation facilities, and usage o f pesticides in agriculture. Social concerns include access to
safe drinking water and economic strategies to expand point source and network coverage to
those who cannot afford such services, and community participation in choosing water services
and associated commitments to operation and maintenance. Potential conflict and other social
issues may arise with regard to land use and common property resources. The Government and
the implementingagencies have embarked on efforts to improve environmental sustainability for
these sectors. IDA continues working with its counterparts in the Government to create a viable
framework for identifying and monitoringkey safeguard issues.



                                                   55

                                       D.    Benefitsand Risks

192.    Benefits. The proposed PRSC3 will help the Government to implement PEAP/PRSP and
reach the goals set in the strategy.       The reforms supported will strengthen the institutional
infrastructure needed to improve the public sector's capacity to carry out its role more effectively,
as envisioned in PEAP/PRSP.             Improved delivery o f public services i s essential if the
Government is to reach its goals for poverty reduction and improve the quality o f life inUganda.

193,    Risks and Efforts to Mitigate Them. The Uganda CAS highlightsthe main risks facing
Government: institutional and human capacity, security, corruption, HTV/AIDS, exogenous
shocks (weather or terms o f trade related), and political transition. While broader in scope than
the proposed Grant, these risks have a bearing on PRSC as well. Risks that attend this operation
are as follows:

        0    There are pervasive institutional and human capacity weaknesses, especially at the
             district level. There is a risk that these constraints could impede the improvement in
             public service delivery. However, in addition to ongoing projects and non-lending
             services, the PRSC3 reform agenda i s geared to addressing institutional deficiencies
             and hence helps mitigating against the risk. Also, a separate capacity buildingproject
             i s being prepared and expected to be presented to the Board in 2003/04. The project
             is designed to complement the series o f PRSCs, providing the needed technical
             assistance to implement the reform program. Until the project becomes effective,
             assistance o f other donors will continue to be solicited to support the technical
             assistance needs o f the Government.
             Many capacity building initiatives have been carried out inUganda over the years, as
             almost all donor projects have a capacity building component. A recent review o f
             these efforts indicates that the initiatives have been predominantly supply-driven and
             fragmented, since they have been linked to narrow projects and focused on building
             capacity inproject implementation units (PIU).
             The planned capacity buildingproject, building on the lessons learned, will shift the
             focus from supply- to demand-driven interventions, where ministries, agencies, and
             departments identify the need for capacity building support based on strategic plans
             to improve performance to achieve PEAP/PRSP objectives. The Government intends
             to disband PIUs and mainstream capacity buildingwithin its structures.

        0    Corruption remains a problem.          It could inhibit private sector confidence and
             investment and hamper improvements in service delivery.              However, the top
             leadership in Uganda has stressed its commitment to rebuildingUganda's ethics and
             integrity. Key challenges facing the Government are the implementation o f its anti-
             corruption action plan and building an effective incentive system needed to improve
             service delivery. The reform program supports both o f these efforts.

        0    Fiduciary risks are significant.      However, the Government is seeking to rapidly
             enhance the financial accountability framework to mitigate these risks. These efforts
             are at the center o f the reform program.

        0    Institutional reforms are complicated and take time. Progress in many areas will be
             gradual and measuring the impact o f reforms initiated will be difficult. Lack o f
             immediate, tangible results may weaken the resolve to keep the momentum going and
             raise questions about the results o f the program. However, the benchmarks will
             provide a roadmap spanning over a series o f PRSCs to assess the Government's
             commitment to the reform agenda.

RE: LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY

1. Iam writing to request, onbehalfof the Govemment of theRepublicof Uganda, aThird
Poverty ReductionSupport Operation.(PRSC3) of SDR 106million insupport of our strategy
under the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). This letter sets out the actions that
Government will undertake over the medium term to implement the strategy, focusing on
measures that will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Govemment operations,
resulting in improvedservice delivery, particularly to the poor. Inaddition, Iam attachinga
policy matrix anda matrix of quantitativemonitoring indicatorsand outcome targets we have
preparedincollaborationwith the IDA team andother donorsthat sets out the contentsof this
letter insummaryform.

2. The prioritisation process in the attachedmatrix incorporates critical time constraintson
the various actions and outputs described. Completion of the actions and outputs shown in
bold typeface inthe matrix by April 2003 i s consideredcritical to the success of our reforms.
Therefore, we propose these actions and outputs as prior actions for PRSC3. The remaining
actions and outputs representour vision of the ongoingprocess andour best current estimate
of actions and outputs that will be carried out and demonstrate the ongoing success of our
reformprocessduring the subsequent two years.

1.BackgroundandRecentDevelopments

3. The overriding objective of Governmentpolicy is the reduction of poverty in Uganda.
Uganda's first nationalcomprehensive strategy for fighting poverty, the Poverty Eradication
Action Plan (PEAP) was completedin 1997 and has guided Govemmentpolicy since then.
The PEAP has been extremely influential in guiding the preparation of sector-wide
approaches to policy reform and investment programming, and improving the focus of

4.       The PEAP was revised during 2000 in the light o f progress obtained since 1997,
including the development o f sector-wide approaches, the findings o f the Uganda Participatory
Poverty Assessment Project (UPPAP 2001), the constraints identified in the 1999 Poverty Status
Report, and the development o f costings o f public actions and monitorable indicators in key
poverty-oriented sectors. In addition, the PEAP has taken into considerationthe sector investment
plans completed so far, including the Education Sector Investment Plan (ESIP), the 10-Year
Strategic Plan for Main Roads (RSDP), the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP), the Plan for the
Modernisation o f Agriculture (PMA), and the Medium Term Competitiveness Strategy for the
Private Sector (MTCS). The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was endorsed by
the Boards o f the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in AprilMay 2000, is a
summary o f the revised PEAP. The Poverty Status Report 2001 was the basis for the first PRSP
progress report. In 2002, Government presented its second PRSP Progress Report that was also
being used as the summary o f Government's Background to the Budget document. This year,
Government is scheduled to prepare a Poverty Status Report as it i s done every second year, and
it will serve also as the PRSP Progress Report. The next revision o f the PEAP has commenced
and is due for completion by December 2003.

5.      Government wishes to improve both the efficiency o f its delivery o f public services and
the effectiveness of these services in reducing poverty. While these concepts are interlinked,
increased efficiency implies improved management systems and practices in the public sector,
including improved financial accountability. Improved effectiveness implies a closer alignment
between outcomes and policy objectives through greater focus on service outputs duringbudget
preparation and implementation. Government i s therefore requesting the Third Poverty Reduction
Support Operation from the World Bank to support Government's reforms inthese areas and help
finance implementation o f the PEAP. The reform programme outlined below will help ensure the
success o f the PEAP.

                                       2. The ReformProgram

6.       The revisedPEAP is structured around four overarching pillars:

         0   rapid and sustainable economic growth and structural transformation;
         0   good governance and security;
         0   increased ability o f the poor to raise their incomes; and
         0   enhanced quality o f life o f the poor.

The selected policy reform measures set out below are grouped under the same four headings.

       PEAPPILLAR 1:RAPIDAND SUSTAINABLEECONOMIC GROWTHAND
                             STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION

                  EFFICIENT    AND EQUITABLE USE OFPUBLIC RESOURCES

The Macro-economy

7.       Since 1987, Government has implemented macro-economic and structural reforms aimed
at restoring and maintaining macro-economic stability and improving Uganda's economic, social
and institutional infrastructure. The results have been encouraging. Real GDP growth has
averaged about six percent per annum since 1987, annual headline inflation has averaged 4.7
percent since 1993194 and international reserves have accumulated to comfortable levels o f about
six months o f imports o f goods and services. Domestic Government revenue increased from 6


                                                   58

                                                                                          Schedule 1


percent o f GDP in 1986/87 to close to 12 percent currently, though the rate o f growth has slowed
in recent years, and, while maintaining macro-economic stability, Government has been able to
increase public expenditure from 8.6 percent o f GDP in 1986/87 to 25 percent percent in 2001/02.
The rapid growth in Government expenditure, in spite o f slower revenue growth, has been made
possible through an increase in donor budget support funding. However, this has led to an
increase in the fiscal deficit excluding grant assistance, which peaked at 12.8 percent o f GDP in
2001/02. Government has consequently adopted a fiscal deficit reduction policy over the medium
term, to minimise undue pressures on the exchange rate and private sector credit arising from the
size o f the fiscal deficit, whilst maintaining its annual 5 percent inflation objective.

8.        In the 1990s Uganda established a welfare monitoring system with regular household
surveys. These show a dramatic and consistent downward trend in income poverty and suggest
that Government is on track in achieving its longer term target o f eradicating poverty. By
1999/2000, the share o f Ugandans living below the poverty line (based on the headcount index)
had fallen to 35 percent from 56 percent in 1992/93. For most o f the 1990s, poverty fell fastest for
the poorest sections o f society as evidenced by the more rapid growth in real household
consumption. This trend has, however, been reversed in the North because o f prolonged
insurgency.

9.        Government regards continued macro-economic stability as critical for a framework that
promotes economic growth. We will therefore continue with existingpolicies aimed at achieving
the following macro-economic targets:

          0    real GDP growth rate o f 7 percent per annum;
          0    annual average underlying inflation o f 5 percent or less;
          0    foreign reserves o f five months' imports o f goods and services or more;
          0    strong private sector credit growth
          0    sustainable levels o f external debt; and
          0    a competitive real exchange rate.

10.       To enable us to achieve these objectives, in addition to our pre-existing policies, we will
place particular emphasis on deficit reduction strategy over medium term.

Revenue

11.       After having roughly doubled inthe early 1990s, Government revenue as a proportion o f
GDP has stagnated at 11-12 percent since 1996/97. While, as mentioned above, the stagnation o f
domestic revenue has not significantly constrained Government expenditure, since Government
has been able to use donor funding to increase expenditure and maintain its poverty eradication
programmes, it has led to a significant increase in the fiscal deficit. By 2001/02, the fiscal deficit
excluding grant assistance had risen to 12.8 percent o f GDP. This size o f deficit cannot be
sustained over the medium term without jeopardising macro economic stability. Government has
therefore decided to initiate a deficit reduction strategy, which, by necessity, needs to be
accompanied by targeted measures to increase domestic revenue as a percentage o f GDP to
enable Government expenditure to continue to grow at the rate seen over the past five years. To
increase revenue as a percentage o f GDP requires significant efficiency improvement at the
Uganda Revenue Authority (URA), increased efforts to mobilise non-tax revenue o f Government
agencies and increased revenue-generating capacity o f local governments. To improve URA
performance, Government has taken measures including recruitment o f new top management
that is inthe process o f improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f URA operations by:



                                                     59

                                                                                         Schedule 1


             ensuring the design and implementation o f a viable business plan and human
             resource development plan; and
             ensuring the development and implementation o f a new and effective integrated
             computer system to facilitate administration o f internal taxes in a single application
             and enabling the sharing o f informationwith customs.

12.      With assistance from the IMF and DFID, Government is currently implementing the
above reforms focussing on effective computerisation, improving the professional skills o f URA
staff, removing corrupt staff and reducing smuggling.

13.      With regard to Non Tax Revenue, the outturn for 2001/02 was 2 percent above target at
Shs 41.4 bn, but this is still less than one percent o f GDP. The major constraint on non-tax
revenue collections continues to be operational difficulties encountered in collecting general
revenues from Line Ministries, due to:

             failure by some ministriesto budget adequately for Non Tax Revenue. In some cases
             it is likely that collections are better than projections, but there is a lack of
             transparency inthe submissions;
             inadequate incentive for the collecting institutions to increase their collections o fNon
             Tax Revenue.

14.      To address these constraints, Government has introduced the following measures to
increase collections:

             abolition o f Appropriation in Aid (AIA) so that all Non Tax Revenue collections are
             remitted to the Consolidated Fund bank account and no funds are used at source. In
             addition, where AIA was shown as a single line budget item, budget for former AIA
             expenditure against specific line items such as fuel;
             publicationo fthe Non Tax Revenue budget estimates;
             ministries are required to budget for revenue collections and project monthly
             collections. Failure to meet the resulting targets will lead to deductions from the
             subsequent cash release from the Treasury for the defaulting ministry;
             phased transfer o f Non Tax Revenue collections to the URA to minimise leakage o f
             funds;
             increased inspection and monitoringo f Ministries' revenue collection mechanisms;
             systematic review and update o f rates and charges, to bringthem in line with current
             costs and prices.
            Introduced new banking arrangements applyingto payments, receipts and banking, to
            minimise leakage o f cash collections.

15.      Government's pilot transfer o f the collection o f passport fees to URA in 2001/02 proved
highly successful, with an outturn o f 290 percent against target. Consequently, Government has
accelerated its transfer programme; immigration fees, court fees, land transfer fees, public service
vehicle registration, company registration, mining fees and royalties are all now being collected
by URA.

Strategic Exports

16.      Macro-economic policy i s being accompanied by a deepening o f current institutional
reforms inthe public sector and in other key areas such as public utilities, transport infrastructure,



                                                 60

                                                                                      Schedule 1


the commercial justice system and the banking and financial system, which are aimed at
removing key constraints to private sector growth. These reforms are set out inthe Government's
Medium Term Competitiveness Strategy for the Private Sector (2000-2005).

17.      Government is also committedto removing specific bottlenecks that impede the ability o f
the private sector to take advantage o f the African Growth Opportunities Act (AGOA) in the
USA, the "EverythingBut Arms" initiative in the European Union and other trade opportunities.
To this end Government i s implementing a strategic exports programme to stimulate value
addition investments in selected areas that are likely to have multiplier effects on the economy,
and to remove bottlenecks that impede the private sector's ability to take advantage o f emerging
trade opportunities.

18.      Commodities that Government identified at the start o f the programme as strategic
exports, based on Uganda's production potential and world market prospects, included coffee,
tea, livestock, fish, cotton, horticulture and Irish potatoes. In addition, in the service sector,
Information and Communications Technology (ET) has been identified as another potential
export area.

19.      The prospects for achieving rapid economic growth and structural transformation and for
value addition for commodities are high. These may not involve only processing but could take
the form o f appellations, certification o f selected brand names and packaging. However, it is
imperative that all key stakeholders (public sector, private sector and development partners) are
fully involved inthe programme, and that it is implemented inconjunction with the Plan for the
Modernisation o f Agriculture, and the Medium Term Competitiveness Strategy for the Private
Sector. Government has been working closely with local producers and marketing groups, the
donor community and other development partners to refine its strategic export strategy and to
target its interventions effectively.

Allocations and Actual Expenditure

20.      From a situation ten years ago where the majority o f public expenditure was determined
by donor priorities, considerable progress has been made in ensuring that most public
expenditure, whether Government or donor-financed, now reflects the priorities set out in the
PEAP. The development o f the MTEF and sector investment programmes in key sectors such as
education and health have strengthened the alignment o f donor funding with PEAP priorities.
Government will continue to place priority on adequate funding o f PEAP priorities inthe MTEF.
To this end, Government will continue (through its Public Expenditure Review process) to
consult with its development partners, including IDA, on the broad composition o f the MTEF as
it is updated each year. In order to monitor that budget execution is consistent with the agreed
budget, Government will continue to share relevant informationwith its development partners for
review and discussion. In the annual Public Expenditure Review in May 2002, Government
agreed with the donors, including IDA, on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework for
2002103-2005/06.      The Government executed the fiscal year 2002103 budget as agreed with
donors. In particular, public administration expenditures were no more than Ush 245.8 billion;
defense spending no more than Ush 271 billion; and PAF expenditures were in line with
allocations agreed inM a y 2002.

21.      The macro-economic achievements outlined above have been underpinned by the MTEF,
the resource envelope o f which has consisted of non-inflationary sources o f financing. In recent
years, this has been supported by the Poverty Action Fund (PAF), which was created in 1998
mainly out o f the expenditure savings arising from the highly indebted poor country (HIPC) debt


                                                 61

                                                                                          Schedule 1


relief and enhanced HIPC initiatives and additional donor funding. As a result there has been a
major shift o f resources into PAF, which has increased, from 18 percent o f the Government
budget in 1997/98 to 36 percent o f the Government budget in 2002/03. These reforms have
encouraged donors to shift their financing away from projects towards programmatic support
because they broadly share the policy priorities articulated by Government and expressed in the
MTEFand are confident that the sectors they feel are important will be funded. Government has
encouraged this shift because it strengthens the budget system, facilitates the planning of
prioritised expenditure on a coherent sectoral basis, increases Government's flexibility in
resource allocation and simplifies aid management.

22.      To improve coverage o f the MTEF, Government intends over time to integrate donor
project-financing within the MTEF process. Government has so far integrated expenditure
ceilings for donor projects in 2003/04-2005/06 MTEF for education, health, and water and
sanitation. As part o f the MTEF process, Sector Working Groups were given envelopes for
externally financed projects and asked to identify development priorities over the MTEF period
within these ceilings. The plan is to extend this to at least two additional sectors in the 2003104-
2004/05 MTEF, and thereafter to the remaining sectors. It is important to recognise the
significance o f the active involvement o f all stakeholders inthis initiative. As part o f the solution
to address this issue, Government i s seeking to move the Stockholm Partnership process forward.
The role o f the donor community in providing the necessary level o f detail o f expected
disbursements to enable the allocation o f donor projects' funding into the MTEF process was
initiatedduringa Joint Partnership Meeting heldinEntebbe during September 2001.

23.      Inthe preparationofthe MTEF, staffing and wage-level issues havebeenhandledoutside
the sector-specific expenditure programmes. This has hadthe effect of significantlyrestricting the
range o f budgetary choices available to these sectors. As a pilot effort, the sector working groups
for health and education have explicitly included staffing and wage issues in their Budget
Framework Papers for the period 2001/02-2003/04.            For the 2003/04 to 2005/06 Budget
Framework Papers, the Sector Working Group Terms o f Reference and Guidelines were revised
to address staffing and wage issues in all sectors. In addition, Government is committed to
appraising and reviewing Sector Working Group responsibilities and performance more
objectively over the medium term. For example, Government is planning to provide support to
select Sector Working Groups through the budget process to address the staffing and wage-bill
issues. The Public Expenditure Review Working Group has been spearheading this initiative.

24.      Government will also endeavour to ensure that execution o f the budget is consistent with
the MTEF objectives. As part of this process the Budget Performance Report for 2001/02, which
analyses discrepancies between budgeted and actual revenues and expenditure, was produced
published and disseminated by December 2002. The Budget Performance Report for the halfyear
from July to December 2002 has also been published and distributed and this marked the
beginningo f semi annual publishedBudget Performance Reports. Government is committed to
improve the quality and timeliness o f these publications.

IntergovernmentalTransfers

25.      During FY 2000/01, MoFPED commissioned a comprehensive study on the system of
fiscal transfers o f funds from central to local government, which culminated in the fiscal
decentralisation strategy. The results o f the study were presented to all stakeholders in a series o f
workshops in January 2001. The strategy for a modified fiscal transfer system oriented towards
both increased efficiency and effectiveness was approved by Cabinet in June 2002. Since then
studies on budgeting, planning, and financial management have ben undertaken, and operational


                                                  62

                                                                                         Schedule 1


manuals and guidelines for its implementation have been prepared.             Implementation o f the
strategy has been started duringthe consultative process to prepare the budget for FY 2003104 in
15 pilot local governments and the rollover process to all local governments and all levels will be
attained inFY 2005106.

Monitoring and Evaluation and Results-OrientedBudgetPlanning

26.         Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) processes require strengthening in order for
stakeholders to determine more easily whether the effectiveness o f public service delivery is
increasing and the pace o f poverty reduction is maintained. M&E remains at present overly
centred on compliance with government rules and regulations and with focus on inputs and
processes rather than on the end results o f policy, program and project efforts. Recurrent and
development expenditures are reviewed separately rather than for their combined contribution
towards overall goals. The collecting, organising and use o f data for M&E are compartmentalised
and fragmented between multiple government and donor planning and progress reporting
arrangements. Officials are therefore burdened with reports but they have little systematic
information about the performance and effectiveness o f actual public service delivery.

27.         Government initially established a task force from the existing Poverty Monitoring
Network to prepare an action plan that will streamline and strengthen M&E. It also prepared a
national poverty monitoring and evaluation strategy. The Office o f the Prime Minister(OPM) has
convened a multi-sectoral technical M&Eworking group. OPM has already taken steps to review
and discuss the options for consolidation and coordination o f multiple and sometimes competing
M&Einitiatives withinthe Government. The recently completedM&E study onthe three sectors
emphasised that usingM& Eto help achieve effective service delivery by sectors will involve not
simply more accurate and timely data collection, but ensuring the data collected are actually used
to improve the quality o f decision making. Thus the following are proposed as short to medium
term measures for achieving a more systematic approach to M&E:
     .......Providing incentives for contributionto real results;
            Improving clarity and results-orientation o f goals and targets;
            Operationalising bottom-up accountability;
            Developing independent evaluation functions;
            Consolidating inspections and reporting;
            Strengthening skills; and
            Clarifying the national M&E coordination responsibilities.

28.         To this end, we are enhancing transparency and consultation in the budget process, but
we need to do more in terms o f generating feedback from the public on the quality o f service
delivery. Government sees it as critical that the forthcoming National Service Delivery Survey,
to be conducted by the Uganda Bureau o f Statistics, be closely aligned to the Ministries and
agencies responsible for service delivery. This will help to ensure that the survey results will be
utilized for setting service delivery standards, which in turn will be used for assessing actual
performance inthe future.

29.         To ensure that managers focus on real progress towards PEAPPRSP objectives,
Government will undertake the following:

     0      continued efforts to establish clear output and outcome targets at the sectoral and district
            levels. Such targets will cascade through from the National Poverty Monitoring and
            Evaluation Strategy to sector and district policies, budget frameworks and work plans.


                                                    63

                                                                                       Schedule 1


         Projects like the Uganda Participatory Poverty Assessment Programme (UPPAP)
         represent a way o f bringinga bottom-up perspective to planning and spending decisions.
         So far, the roads, education, health, water and sanitation, and justice law and order
         sectors have introduced output targets and monitoring o f results in their Budget
         Framework Papers (BFP). Other sectors, such as economic services and public
         administration are working towards the identification o f suitable outputs and indicators to
         chart their progress. In addition, the Defence Review is expected to enable stakeholders
         to be more objective in assessing the value for money inherent in defence expenditure
         and in identifying a reasonable defence spending ceiling;
    0    continued alignment o f the Outcome-Oriented Budget (OOB) process being implemented
         by the Ministry o f Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) with
         Results Oriented Management (ROM) being implemented by the Ministry of Public
         Service (MoPS), to ensure consistency o f targets and accountability. ROM, launched in
         1997, is aiming to enhance performance and accountability. All Ministries, departments
         and local governments are required to prepare annual performance plans that reflect their
         performance output targets and with verifiable indicators as a basis for appraisal o f
         performance by the organisation and staff. ROM has potentially strong synergies with
         the annual budget process, and MoFPED, in consultation with MoPS, has started
         integrating it. Reconciliation o f ROM and OOB is taking longer than initially expected,
         and MoFPED and MoPS are going to prepare an action to align the two initiatives. The
         initiatives will compliment each other in the drive to facilitate the attainment o f
         efficiency and accountability in the use o f budgeted resources. These activities are
         expected to be coordinated through the Public Expenditure Management Committee
         (PEMCOM) that monitors budget and financial management initiatives.

                     PILLAR 2: GOODGOVERNANCEAND SECURITY

ImproveManagementSystems and Practicesin the Public Sector

30.      A number of cross-cutting issues have been targeted by Government in order to improve
service delivery by the public service and encourage donors to adopt program fundingas opposed
to project funding. These are:

         -    Reforming public service management, including pay and pensions;
         -    Reforming the public procurement system;
         -    Strengthening financial management inthe public service;
         -    Increasing transparency and civil society participation;
         -    Implementingthe Government Strategy and Plan o f Action to Fight Corruption and
              BuildEthicsand Integrity inPublic Office.

3 1.     Looking at each o f the above issues, Iam setting out below the progress made so far and
our intendedactions inthe next few years.

Public ServiceManagement

32.      Government has pursued and sustained a public service reform programme that was
launched in the early 1990s. The rationalisation efforts led to the streamlining o f functions and
services in the central Public Service, the local governments and divestiture o f some services to
the private sector in order to improve service delivery. The 1995 Constitution and the
decentralization policy have prompted further rationalisation o f Government structures. The
rationalisation has led to a staffing realignment to reflect the new structures. This has resulted in

the reduction o f Ministriesfrom 38 in 1991 to 17 in 1998. Through a combination o f voluntary
and compulsory retirement, and a recruitment freeze, the size o f the Public Service work force
was reduced from over 320,000 in 1990 to 160,000 in 1997. This effort was supported by control
measures, including the computerisation o f the payroll, monitoring the staff numbers and payroll
cleaning.

33.      There is a steady increase in staff numbers to meet the demands o f the expansion in
services crucial to our poverty reduction agenda. Consequently, the number o f Government
employees has risen relatively fast from 160,000 in 1997 to 218,549 as at May 2003. In order to
assess the implications o f this growth, the Ministry o f Public Service has initiated a study on the
cost effectiveness o f increased employment in the Social Sectors. MoPS, in collaboration with
line ministries, has submitted preliminary findings o f the study. The recommendations o f the
study will inform policy-making on future recruitment and deployment in the priority social
sectors (Education, Health, Water and Sanitation, Agriculture and Community Development).

34.      A programme for systematic rationalisation and restructuring underpin the right sizing
exercise. Operations that are non-core will be abolished or divested to quasi-autonomous agencies
so that ministries can focus on policy and regulatory functions.

35.      An ambitious programme o f decentralization of delivery of primary public services to
local governments has been a central thrust o f the Public Service Reform. The programme has
been supported by the transfer o f fiscal resources to Local Governments amounting to 35 percent
o f total Government funded expenditure. Meanwhile, with considerable support from the IDA
and other development partners, major initiatives to improve effectiveness and sustainability o f
the decentralisation programme, by strengthening the resource base o f the local governments,
have been launched. The local government structures have been reviewed to provide a basis for
rationalizingand developing appropriate human resource strategies.

36.      Government recognises inadequate capacity as a major constraint to effective and
sustained implementation o f the programmes for public service reform that would help enhance
the performance of the public service for improved service delivery. Therefore, capacity building
continues to receive priority attention. To this end, among other measures, Government has
approached the World Bank and other development partners to support an initiative for
comprehensive and innovative demand driven measures to enhance capacity and performance
across the public sector.

37.      Improvement of pay for Public Service managers and professionals has been a key issue
on the Government agenda. Inthis regard, a Pay Reform Strategy was adopted by Government in
March, 2002 on the basis o f which a 10 year timeframe has been agreed as the way forward in
implementing a transparent and equitable Pay Structure for the Public Service. With the
implementation of the Pay Reform Strategy, the Public Service will be in a position to recruit and
retain competent and well motivated personnel. The single spine salary structure will be
implemented in order to remove distortions inpay levels. Enhancement o f salaries for the middle
to senior level managers, with the emphasis on key professionals, i s the primary focus o f the
strategy. Preservation o f the purchasing power o f salaries for all staff is also to be considered in
the strategy. MoPS and MoFPED have agreed on target salary adjustments in line with the pay
reform strategy, and the associated wage bill has been reflected in MTEF for 2003/04-2005/06.
The implementation o f Result Oriented Management (ROM) and the provision o f the necessary
tools and facilities to public officers will support the strategy, leading to enhanced productivity
and improved service delivery. The challenge is to improve pay while sustaining employment
growth inthe priority areas that support the Poverty EradicationAction Plan (PEAP).

38.      Government has continued to sustain the improvements in payroll management that have
been introduced over the past year. In particular, following decentralisation o f the Teachers'
Payroll manual processes, newly recruited teachers are accessing the payroll within one month
from the date o f assumption o f duty. An Inter Ministerial Taskforce continues with its efforts to
ensure sustained improvements in payroll management. In the medium term, emphasis will be
placed on strengthening internal payroll controls and developing an Integrated Personnel and
Payroll Systems (IPPS) compatible with the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS)
that is currently being developed.

39.      Much remains to be done to reform the public service. In this context Government has
endorsed a strategy for the next phase o f reforms. The Public Service Reform Strategy (PSRS)
2002-2007 has been designed to ensure the provision o f quality services that meet the needs of
the people and to promote private sector development for socio-economic transformation. The
PSRS aims at creating an effective linkage with PEAP and other sector reforms by:

         0   Strengthening the capacity o f Central Ministries to effectively formulate and manage
             policy, to monitor quality and to provide technical support for the services delivered
             by Local Governments;
         0   Devising and agreeing appropriate structures and systems to facilitate efficient and
             effective service delivery;
         0   Assisting managers in central Ministries and Local Governments to specify their
             outputs and performance indicators and subsequently to monitor implementation;
         0   Enabling a more rational, efficient and output-oriented allocation and expenditure o f
             resources through linkage o f performance to the budget process and financial
             management reforms;
         0   Producing efficiencies and cost savings on a continuous basis, which will, in turn,
             contribute to pay enhancements, capacity buildingand cost effective service delivery.

PublicProcurement

40.      Government has realised that the existing public procurement system is inadequate to
address the demands o f a liberalised economy modelled on the principles o f economy, efficiency
and transparency. Inorder to address these inadequacies, Government established a Task Force in
December 1997 aimed at reviewing the procurement system and proposing a system that will
ensure transparency, economy, and efficiency in public procurement. The report o f the Task
Force identified a number o f major weaknesses. First, the legal instruments for controlling the
procurement process are not only diffused over several laws and regulations, but they also lack
enforcement and monitoring provisions. Second, the procedures in a number o f areas are
deficient: lack o f standard procurement documents, weak conflict o f interest provisions,
inadequate contract management and monitoring provisions and inadequate record keeping
systems, Third, the former Central Tender Board (CTB) was found to be inefficient, and lacking
inautonomy, while its membership didnot representthe full cross-section of stakeholders. Lastly,
there was a serious shortage o f skilled, qualified and experienced procurement staff in the
country, partly because donors have often performed the procurement function.

41.      The Task Force focused only on procurement systems at the central Government level,
but the donor community and Government, through the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR), reviewed the whole public sector procurement system, including that o f the local
governments. The CPAR exercise identified more weaknesses in the system, including
inconsistencies between the central and local government procedures, overly restrictive tendering

at local government level, lack o f provisions for procurement planning and weak management o f
the pre-shipment inspection function.

42.     Following the recommendations o f the Task Force and the CPAR, Government i s
reforming the procurement system inthe mediumterm through the following actions:
         0  a new Procurement Bill, with provisions ensuring competition in selection o f third
            party procurement agents, was passed and assented to in 2002 and gazetted in
            February 2003;
        0   new Public Finance (Procurement) Regulations and reporting forms for ministries,
            departments and agencies have been completed and signed by the Minister and await
            gazetting;
        e   procurement regulations at central and local government levels are beingharmonised;
        e   MOPShas issued instructions to procurement entities to establish procurement units
            under Circular Standing Instruction No.1 o f 2002 in May 2002. PSC has completed
            recruitment o f Principal and Senior Procurement Officers and Procurement Officers
            for central Government, including referral hospitals. The recruitment o f assistant
            procurement officers i s in progress. Recruitment in statutory bodies i s constrained in
            many cases by the needto amend the relevant legal framework for the bodies;
        0   The CTB was transformed into an autonomous regulatory institution and renamed the
            Reformed Central Tender Board (RCTB) in March 2001. After the enactment o f the
            new Procurement law, RCTB was transformed to the Public Procurement and
            Disposalo f Public Assets Authority (PPDA) on February 21,2003;
        e   Contract committees were established in 2000/01 in all ministries with full authority
            to undertake procurement;
        e   PPDA has re-emphasised the responsibility o f Accounting Officers for the
            procurement function o f their institution by re-iterating this requirement in their
            annual letters o f appointment during2001/02;
        e   Pre-qualification for hiringprocurement agents to support weak procurement entities
            i s in progress and expected to be completed by September 2003;
        0   Government has incorporated procurement plans in sector expenditure programs in
            health and education, and is in the process o f doing the same inwater and sanitation,
            and agriculture;
        0   PPDA published the report for the quarter to 31" March 2003 o f contracts awarded
            costing more than US$200,000 by end o f June 2003 in a national daily paper. The
            practicality o f the threshold o f US$ 200,000 will be reviewed in the light o f the
            number o f contracts reported;
        e   PPDA i s to carry out an ex post procurement audit o f a sample o f 20 percent o f the
            value o f the 2001/02 recurrent and capital procurement expenditures for education,
            and health by the end o f August, 2003, subject to the identification and employment
            o f a suitable procurement agent;

43.     The budget allocated to the above reforms amounted to Ush 5.3 billion during 2002/03.
Training o f contract committees and procurement units has already commenced and will be a
continuous activity. Government will continue to ensure that funds for procurement reform are
included inthe MTEF.

FinancialManagement

44.     Inrecent years, significant improvements inpublic sector accounting and reporting have
been achieved. Most notably, (1) the annual public accounts o f central Government have been



                                                 67

                                                                                      Schedule 1


produced within the statutory period, (2) the backlog o f the preparation and audit o f local
government annual accounts have beencleared and (3) tracking studies have been carried out and
follow-up actions taken in two line ministries. Still, a number o f measures are required to
strengthen and enhance financial management within government.

45.     With the support o f a number o f donor assisted initiatives, such as the Second Economic
and Financial Management Project (EFMP 11) and the Local Government Development Project
(LGDP) supported by IDA, and the Financial Accountability and Decentralisation Support
Project funded by DFID, Government i s seeking to rapidly enhance the financial accountability
framework inpursuito f the following objectives:
        e   mitigate fiduciary risk in public expenditure management for both taxpayers and
            donors;
        e   achieve economy, efficiency and effectiveness inthe use o f public funds;
            enhance transparency and accountability; and
            establish an appropriate enabling environment for private sector development and
           regulation.

46.     To achieve these ob-iectives, Government has undertakenthe following measures:
            Strengthened the legal and regulatory framework by enacting thenew Public Finance
            and Accountability Act 2003 on April 16, 2003              and revising the Financial
           Regulations and Treasury Accounting Instructions accordingly;
           Improved the quality and timeliness o f Government financial reporting, by producing
            semi-annual consolidated reports on budget execution and annual Consolidated
           Financial Statements (the annual accounts);
           Revised the reporting format for the Consolidated Financial Statements o f
            Government in accordance with international standards o f Public Sector Financial
            Reporting;
            Completed a detailed study o f the Government's Fiscal Management Systems
            providing a detailed Information Technology Architecture and Plan, a common Chart
            o f Accounts and User Requirements for an Integrated Financial Management System
            (IFMS);
            Contracted consultants to deliver and install an Integrated Financial Management
            System. The implementation i s to be phased through selected Pilot Sites in the
            2003/04 fiscal year with further rollout to selected sites commencing in the 2004/05
            fiscal year;
            Established a financial management team o f accounting professionals appointed to
            support the reforms to (a) strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for financial
           management; (b) enhance the capacity buildingactivities amongst the accounting and
           auditing cadre in government; and (c) strengthen the budgeting and accounting
            systems in government (the IFMS);
           Twenty recent graduates were recruited to assist inthe IFMS implementation;
           MOPS has authorized the recruitment o f an additional 16 graduate accountants to
            strengthen the compliment o f accounting staff. The recruitment has been completed
           and posting to the various ministries is being arranged;
           Increased the number o f professionally qualified accountants employed in
           government from 23 professional accountants in October 2001 to 50 professionally
           qualified accountants as o f March 2003 through a support program to encourage staff
           to obtain their professional qualifications;
           Introduced a common classification system (Chart o f Accounts) across government
           for budgeting and accounting commencing inthe 2003/04 fiscal year;

        0   Reconciled the Uganda Consolidated Fund account and identified an irreconcilable
            difference that is now awaiting Parliamentary approval for write off;
        0   Completed the audit o f the backlog o f previous year's annual accounts o f districts
            and urban authorities as well as those accounts submitted for the most recent
            financial year;
        0   Provided adequate information on actual public spending on frontline basic services
            usingexpenditure tracking surveys;
        0   Prepared a plan for the audit o f classified expenditures that has been approved and
            implementation commenced on 1July 2003;
        0   Submitted to the Constitutional Review Commission a memorandum approved by
            Cabinet on enhancing the independence o f the Auditor General through initiatives
            that will increase the OAG's influence on its own funding and human resource
            management;
        0   Improved the effectiveness o f the Office o f the Auditor General through recruitment
            o f Technical Advisors and capacity building initiatives. In particular, the capacity
            buildinginitiativesare designed to assist inthe Office's capability to audit IT systems
            inanticipation ofthe implementationofthe IFMS;
        0   Established a Public Expenditure Management Committee (PEMCOM) to coordinate
            reforms inthis area;
        0   The Treasury Memorandum for the fiscal year 1996197 has been released and the
            TreasuryMemorandum for the fiscal year 1997198 has been drafted and released in
            June 2003. The Treasury Memorandum for the Fiscal Years 1998199, 199912000,
            2000/01 and 2001102 will be produced when the PAC Reports for the respective
            years have been issuedby Parliament;
        0   Commenced audits o f sub-county government accounts; and
        0   Established a mechanism for monitoring the impact o f the public sector financial
            management reforms.

47.     Tabling o f the Audit Bill as envisaged under PRSC2 has been delayed until the
Constitution has been amended. The constitutional review process i s expected to end in 2003104
when the Constitutional Review Commission tables its report. After that an Audit Bill will be
prepared based on the new constitution.

     Transparency and Anti-Corruption,Participationand Legaland JudicialReform


Transparency and Anti-Corruption


48.     Government plans to improve the right o f access to public information, as one o f the
measures to improving accountability. First, we plan to revise the Official Secrets Acts, and
replace it with a modern access to government information law. Consultations with stakeholders
on access to government informationhave already started and inthe next fiscal year, the plan is to
assemble recommendations for enactment o fthe law.

49.     We have embarked on issuinga number o f publications to clarify Government processes
and the rights and responsibilities o f stakeholders in those processes. For example, "The Citizens
Guide to the Budget Process" has been issued by my Ministry in English and also in the most
commonly used Ugandan languages. My Ministry has also prepared and approved a
communication strategy for full implementation.




                                                 69

                                                                                       Schedule 1


50.     Government has increasingly continued to use public information to empower citizens to
demand greater accountability from local governments. My Ministry, together with the Ministry
of Local Government regularly disseminates information through the media on both the PEAP
and also provides details o f mandatory financial releases to primary schools. Our plan is to
extend this practice to health, water and sanitation and agriculture services so that public notices
o f financial transfers for these services will be posted at facilities, districts and sub-counties,
respectively.

5 1.    Government has singled out the following priorities to signal progress in its fight against
corruption.
        0    The Hon Minister o f State for Ethics and Integrity (MSEI) tabled and Parliament
             passed, the Inspectorateo f Government (IG) Bill, which was then assentedto by H.E
             the President in March 2002. The IG Act 2001 puts into effect the improved powers
             and procedures requiredby the Inspectorate o f Government to fight corruption more
             effectively as provided for inthe 1995 constitution;
        0    The Inspector General o f Government's report i s now regularly discussed by the
             Sessional Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs;
        0   The new Leadership Code assented to by H.E the President in July 2002. The
            Leadership Code caters for a wider group o f key leaders and closes the loopholes in
            the old one, and also provides avenues for citizen to access leaders' asset
             declarations. It provides for sanctions for non-compliance, including disqualification
             from office;
        0   The Inspector General o f Government has established a Directorate to manage the
            Leadership Code and started taking administrative action for non-compliance.
            Letters have been issued to the appointing authorities requiring disciplinary action to
            be taken against leaders who have failed to declare their assets, and appropriate
            action has beentaken inaccordance with the law;
        0   The process for whistleblower           protection legislation has already       started.
            Consultations are going on, but the process may take longer than expected because
            Government has decided to conduct broader consultations than initially planned to
            ensure broad support for the proposed bill. Experience from other countries
            demonstrates that this is an important step inthe process o f developing an appropriate
            legislation. Government plans to table the principles for the law before Cabinet by
            April 2004. Government will evaluate development o f the plan in 2003 and enhance
            it on the basis o f consultations, the results o f the second Integrity Survey and other
            relevant studies;
        0   Government has also set out the following broad areas for action: (i)strengthening
            the capacity o f law enforcement for better detection, investigation, prosecution and
            judgment o f corruption cases; (ii)strengthening the procurement systems;            (iii)
            strengthening financial accountability; (iv) implementing public sector pay reform;
            (v) ensuring effective co-ordination o f agencies on corruption issues;              (vi)
            strengthening the legal framework related to corruption; and (vii) strengtheningthe
            system o f enforcement o f codes o f conduct. Implementing this action plan has
            necessitated the participation o f several agencies under the co-ordination o f the
            Directorate for Ethics and Integrity (DEI), inthe Office o f the President.

52.     In 1996, H.E President Museveni made eradicating corruption a national priority. In
1998, the Government prepared a draft plan to combat corruption. After broad-based stakeholder
participation the plan was revised and in July 2000 and the President launched the "Government
Strategy and Plan o f Action to Fight Corruption and Rebuild Ethics and Integrity in Public Office

-FiscalYears 2000/01-2002/03". Theplanaimsatbuildingcapacityforco-ordination, planning
and monitoring anti-corruption efforts and building the ethics and integrity o f the people o f
Uganda.

53.      Inthis connection, Government is reviewing all anti-corruption laws to consolidate them
into a single comprehensive legislation and has already assembled the relevant recommendations.
The plan is to table the principles before Cabinet by July 2003 andto gazette the proposedBill by
2004.

54.      To ensure that monitoring o f corruption becomes part o f M&E, DEIhas, with the support
o f donors, been developing quantitative monitoring indicators to assess progress in the fight
against corruption. In this context, the results o f the second Integrity Survey were released at a
national stakeholders workshop as scheduled, in April 2003. Discussion o f the results showed
considerable improvement in the public perception o f corruption in Uganda. The modalities for
wider dissemination o f the results o fthe survey are beingfinalised.

Civil Society Participation

55.      Government acknowledges the contribution to development and growth made by civil
society, and recognizes that full involvement o f this sector inthe improvement o f service delivery
and good governance is both necessary and challenging. One area that has been explored to
enhance service delivery is to build stronger partnerships between government at all levels and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs),         including faith-based organisations. To this end
Government has established a computerised database o f NGOs to improve information available
on NGOs as well as accountability. In addition, Government and the NGO community have
undertaken an NGO sector survey that will provide the much needed information on the sector
and at the same time guide the preparation o f the NGO policy. The overall objective o f the NGO
survey is to identify and better understand NGO roles, the nature and quality o f services they
offer, potential areas for capacity building, opportunities, constraints and mechanisms for
improved collaboration, possible criteria for engaging NGOs in both policy debate and service
delivery, and indicators for assessingthe quality o f services provided.

56.      The first draft report o f the NGO sector survey has been reviewed and the second draft
was submitted at the end o f April 2003. The findings indicate that complexity o f the NGO sector
in Uganda, and raise critical points relating to registration, functions, location, monitoring and
oversight, and coordination o f NGOs and their activities.        This information is expected to
facilitate the revisiono fthe draft NGO bill.

57.      Government recognises the need to improve district and sector plans to adequately reflect
community perspectives and priorities. The numerous agencies apply participatory methods and
approaches in an uncoordinated fashion. Under the leadership o f the Ministry o f Local
Government a harmonised participatory planning guide for lower councils (HPPG)             has been
prepared in consultation with districts and civil society groups.          The Ministry o f Local
Government will assist local authorities in the application o f the guide to the planning and
budgeting processes, and in monitoring and evaluation o f its use. HPPG has been piloted in a
number o f local governments and the lessons learnt have been incorporated. This planning
framework is expected to lead to more effective participatory community development as services
respond to user preferences. Government will continue to adopt and review the experience in its
implementation duringthe PRSC program period.

Legal and Judicial Reform

58.     The Justice Law and Order Sector reform programme commenced full implementation in
November 2002. With regard to efficiency and effectiveness key achievements include reduction
o f the average length o f time taken to dispose o f commercial cases to 6.57 months from an
average o f 10 months as o f April 2003. The average number o f adjournments per commercial
case has beenreduced to 1.83, exceeding a target o f 2, from a higho f 2.46 inJune 2002.

59.     With regardto Criminal Justice there were 19,937 prisoners held as o fApril 2003, 12,025
of who were on remand. Whereas this number o f prisoners strains the Prison Service resources, it
is indicative o f a positive increase in efficiency o f our system from "entry to exit". The average
length of time o f capital cases on remand has been reduced from 5 years to 2 years. The Case
Backlog Clearance Project completed 417 (83.6 percent) o f cases out o f 499 scheduled for trial in
FY 2002/2003. The Prisons Farm Project has yieldedgains enabling production o f 30 percent of
the prisoner food requirements for the fiscal year.

60.     In terms of access to justice, the JLOS reform programme has "rolled out" the Case
Backlog Clearance Project to 29 magisterial areas, and commenced de-concentration o f services
through construction and posting o f staff in up country stations. Prisons and Police have recruited
and deployed 500 officedwarders, and construction has commenced or been completed for a
number o f courts and Resident State Attorney offices with a target o f 6 new courts and offices per
annum.

61,     The Sector has also made gains in monitoring and evaluation o f the Sector programme
completing two reviews (June 2002 and December 2002) at which a rating o f "satisfactory
progress" was achieved. The Sector has also completed and publishedBaseline Surveys for both
Criminal and Commercial Justice. Hence, output and outcome indicators have been developed
and reviewed by the Poverty Monitoring Unit o f the Ministryo f Finance, Planningand Economic
Development. A key activity to be completed in FY 2003/2004 is a mapping o f crime statistics
(1996 - 2001) onto the poverty profile o f Uganda to better enhance resource allocation, and
enable integration o f crime, economic growth and poverty indicators.

62.     The Sector has also addressed key quality o fjustice issues through the drafting of new
bills and amendment.

Key commercial laws reviewed include:
        Ministry of Trade, TourismandIndustry: Consumer Protection(new legislation), Sale
        o f Goods and Services (re-enactment), Competition (new legislation), Co-operatives
        (amendment), Anti-dumping(new legislation), Hire Purchase (new legislation)

 PILLAR 3: ACTIONS WHICH DIRECTLY INCREASETHE ABILITY OF THE POOR
                                  TO RAISE THEIR INCOMES

63.      Government's efforts to directly increase the ability o f the poor to raise their incomes is
premised on the fact that the majority o f Uganda's population live in rural areas, are self-
employed in farm and non-farm activities and are constrained by limited skills and knowledge,
productive assets and market opportunities. Eighty five percent o f the population live in rural
areas which, in 2000, accounted for 96 percent o f the poor and although poverty has declined
significantly over the 1990s' the overall decline in rural poverty has been slower than in urban
areas thus leading to widening urban-rural income inequality. Government actions to increase the
ability o f the poor to raise their incomes, articulated in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP), are focused on several intervention areas including: (a) increasing access to productive
assets; (b) increasing the returns to assets o f the poor through improving the delivery o f public
services; (c) improving access to markets; (d) enhancing sustainable management and use o f the
natural resource base; and (e) expanding farm and non-farm employment opportunities.

64.      The principles set out inthe PEAP have guided the formulation o f sector plans including,
inter alia the Plan for Modernisation o f Agriculture (PMA) which has been designed to address
directly PEAP's Pillar 3 issues and concerns. The core focus o f the P M A i s the transformation o f
subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture. However, the plan proposes a set o f rural
development actions that will effect development o f both farm and off-farm enterprises in rural
areas. Seven priority intervention areas are highlighted in the PMA, namely: (a) agricultural
research; (b) agricultural advisory services; (c) agro-processing and marketing; (d) rural financial
services; (e) physical infrastructure; (0 agricultural education; and (g) sustainable natural
resources use and management. Under the PMA, the roles and functions o f the private and
public sector are clearly delineated. Government interventions will focus primarily on promoting
an enabling environment for private sector led agricultural and rural growth.

AgriculturalResearch

65.      Technological change, in which agricultural research plays a pivotal role, remains a
critical element for raising agricultural productivity and competitiveness. While several notable
technologies have been developed in Uganda, there is currently no consolidated agricultural
research policy and legislation governing agricultural research. As a result the conduct o f national
agricultural research is fragmented and not adequately co-ordinated. The NARO Statute (1992)
only caters for public research institutions within MAAIF and does not cover other institutions
engaged in agricultural research, including Universities, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), and
the private sector. Although NARO has contributed significantly to technology development and
dissemination in Uganda, its' current institutional set-up and research programmes as well as
general approach towards agricultural research were developed before the formulation o f the
PMA, which focuses on ensuring that agricultural research is responsive to the needs o f poor
farmers. There are inconsistencies in the current NARO approach and the key P M A principles
and objectives.

66.      In response to the above issues a comprehensive and wide ranging national agricultural
research system review was undertaken in 2001/02. The review identified and recommended
ways to: (a) promote demand-driven and farmer responsive research; (b) decentralise the delivery
and funding o f agricultural research and outreach services; (c) promote private sector
participation in the delivery and financing o f agricultural research services; (d) introduce
competitive mechanisms for research financing; and (e) enhance the efficiency and effectiveness
o f national institutional arrangements supporting agricultural research.

67.       From the review, a National Agricultural Research Policy, which articulates a new
strategy for agricultural research has been formulated to guide the generation, dissemination, and
uptake o f improved technologies for agricultural development in Uganda. It defines vertical as
well as horizontal linkages o f national and local research bodies with other stakeholders as well
as the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS), Local Governments, private sector and
research institutions outside Uganda. Following MAAIF's endorsement, the policy was submitted
to and approved by Cabinet. A new Agricultural Research Bill i s currently under preparation and
will soon be submitted to Parliament for approval and will be used as the main instrument to
guiding future agricultural research within the PMA framework.

Agricultural Advisory Services

68.       NAADS programme has been put in place to redress the past shortcomings in the
provision o f agricultural extension services. The programme aims at promoting farming as a
business through a demand driven and farmer led agricultural service delivery system. It targets
mainly poor subsistence farmers. Under the programme, public funds are channelled to farmers'
fora at sub-county level for them to contract services o f private advisory service providers.
Additional funds are provided at district level to co-ordinate and provide back-up support to sub-
counties as well as support district-wide activities.

69.       NAADS was formed under the NAADS Act in 2001. Its' implementation started in July
2001 with 24 selected sub-counties in six districts (Tororo, Arua, Mukono, Kibaale, Soroti, and
Kabale). In 2002/03, the programme was expanded to cover 100 sub-counties in 16 districts.
Additional districts covered are Wakiso, Luwero, Iganga, Kapchorwa, Lira, Kitgum, Kabarole,
Bushenyi, Busia and Mbarara. In the first six districts, interim district and sub-county farmers'
forums have been formed, over 1,100 farmer groups have been registered, advisory service
providers have been identified and contracts signed, sub-county procurement sub-committees
have been established and local governments are being sensitised on programme operations and
implementation procedures. Plans are underway to further expand the NAADS programme to a
total o f 21 districts by 2003/04.

70.       Meanwhile, the traditional National Agricultural Extension Programme continues to
operate in most districts. The intention is to phase out traditional extension service delivery in
districts that are reached by NAADS.In the meantime, NAADS i s developing guidelines to have
the non-NAADS districts embark on usingthe NAADS principles from FY 2003104. It is planned
that to expedite the NAADS roll-out process, there will be harmonisation o f existing projects that
have extension components with NAADS principles. The Ministry o f Public Service has
completed a functional analysis o f district agricultural offices and prepared staffing guidelinesto
assist the phasing out o f existing extension program in NAADS districts and the subsequent
dismissal o f staff. These changes will be provided for in the civil service structures prior to the
next financial year to allow for the retrenchment and retraining o f district extension staffwho can
thenbecome part o fthe private sector extension service providers.

Rural Finance

71.       Access to rural finance services is an important avenue for increasing the ability o f the
poor to raise their incomes through growth o f farm and non-farm activities and promoting a
savings culture. However, the outreach o f rural financial services in Uganda is still low. It is
estimated that 43 percent of Uganda's population has no access to rural financial services, with
the unmet need being greatest inrural areas..




                                                  74

                                                                                      Schedule 1


72.     The Government is committed to promoting access to the rural poor o f financial services
through growth o f micro-finance institutions (MFIs) and village rural savings and credit programs
by provision o f appropriate policy and regulatory environment and capacity building. In
collaboration with MFIs, Government has developed within the P M A framework a Rural
Financial Services Outreach Programme to promote private sector led delivery o f rural financial
services in the country, with an institutional capacity building framework for MFIs. The
implementation o f the programme will start in 2003104. It i s planned that the programme will be
rolled out to cover the entire country within the next three years.

73.     The Deposit Taking Micro-Finance Institutions (DMFI) Act was enacted in November
2002. The law is meant to facilitate the expansion o f MFIs to poorer clients, particularly in rural
areas, thus, enabling MFIs to become licensed to take savings from the public and encourage new
investments in specialised MFIs. It will also enable deepening o f rural financial services and the
wideningo fmicrofinance products.

NaturalResourceUse and Management

Land

74.     Land i s one o f the main assets for transforming agriculture and increasing household
incomes. Currently, only one-third o f arable land is under cultivation. However, recent evidence
from the Participatory Poverty Assessment indicates that access to land i s increasingly becoming
a problem for poor people. The main causes are large family sizes, distress sales by the poor and
inadequate land use planning.

75.     In2001, the Land Sector Strategic Plan(LSSP) was developed, with a corresponding 10-
year investment plan. The LSSP aims to provide an operational, institutional and financial
framework for implementation o f the Land Act (1998) and the relevant provisions o f the
Constitution (1995). Within the overall framework o f the PMA, studies related to the design and
operationalisation o f the LandAct (1998), were undertaken in200112002 on: a) common property
resources; b) gender and family land rights issues; and c) land market consolidation and re-
adjustments. The following activities have beenundertaken to progress implementation o f LSSP:
        e    Cabinet has approved LSSP for implementation over the next ten years, beginning
             FY 2002103;
        e    Government (MOPS, MWLE and MFPED) has agreed on the staffing plan and
             institutional issues related to the implementation o f LSSP. All staff o f the LSSP
             implementation division are inplace;
        e    The guidelines for flow of funds to districts and land-boards have been agreed
             between MWLE, MOLG MFPED and districts;
        e    Cabinet has approved amendments to the Land Act arising from the above
             administrative and institutionaladjustments required for the implementation o fLSSP;
        0    MWLEhas begun pilot activities and programmes relatedto systematic demarcation,
             raising awareness o f land rights among women and vulnerable groups, and
             strengthening common property management systems.

Forestry

76.     In 2001, Government put in place a National Forestry Policy that sets out the vision and
guiding principles for the development o f the forest sector. To operationalise this policy, the
National Forestry and Tree Planting Act has been passed by Parliament and assented to by the
President. The National Forestry Plan (NFP) has also been finalized and is in its early stages o f


                                                 75

                                                                                      Schedule 1


implementation. Key activities for implementation o f the Plan, including the establishment o f the
Forestry Inspection Division (FID), a National Forestry Authority (NFA), and the District
Forestry Services (DFS) have been provided for in the current MTEF (2003/04-2005/06).
Successful implementation o f this plan will to a large extent depend on the effective integration
o f forestry into other Government policies such as the PMA, public service reform,
decentralization, National Environment Action Plan and the LSSP. Strengthening institutional
capacity o f FID, NFA, DFS, and inter-sectoral linkages between the forestry sector and other
sectors will, therefore, be priority areas o f focus inthe coming years.

Environmental Mainstreaming

77.       Population growth in the last decade, coupled with a lack o f appropriate agricultural
technologies and affordable energy alternatives has caused significant land degradation,
deforestation, and stress on the productive natural resource base in Uganda. Mismanagement o f
the natural resources and the environment has manifested itself in loss o f agricultural
productivity, loss o f forest cover, water pollution and a declining resource stock as a result o f
over fishing, overgrazing and encroachment on wetlands. Consequently the quality o f the
environment on which the poor depend is declining, limiting people's livelihood opportunities.

78.      Government i s currently trying to ensure adequate integration o f environmental
sustainability concerns in all government programs to reduce the level and risk o f environmental
degradation. The National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) is building capacity
for environmental management and ownership o f an environmental agenda at the national,
district, and local levels. Many districts have developed District Environmental Action Plans and
have integrated environmental concerns into their District Development Plans. NEMA has
developed guidelines/procedures for strategic and sectoral Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA). Sector EIA guidelines have been developed and implemented for the roads sector. In
addition, draft guidelines for water and sanitation, energy and mining sectors will soon be
published. Work on developing further guidelines for agriculture, forestry, and wildlife will soon
begin. NEMA has also engaged the P M A program to ensure that it promotes environmentally
sustainable rural development. Similar discussions with the Ministry o f Local Government have
led to the development o f new local government planning manuals, which promote
environmentally sustainable local government planning.

79.      Guidelines for integrating environmental concerns and screening o f sectoral plans and
programs for the Poverty Eradication Working Group and other budget sector working groups
were developed last year, and are now used to screen sectoral development plans. To consolidate
achievements at this level, the working group has embarked on developing a sector-wide plan for
environment and natural resources sector, in line with the new planning framework o f
Government. NEMA also worked closely with the Poverty Monitoring Unit and Uganda Bureau
o f Statistics to develop environment indicators for the Government's Poverty Monitoring and
Evaluation Strategy. The Poverty Monitoring and Analysis Unit recently tested the indicators and
integrated some, specifically those on access to safe water, forest products, and sanitation, in the
strategy. In addition, the current review o f PEAP has provided an new opportunity to integrate
environmental concerns inthis important planningframework o f Government.

Agro-Processing and Marketing

80.      Agro-processing and marketing constraints continue to inhibit domestic sales and exports
o f agricultural products thereby inhibiting income growth. Improving access to input and output

markets by reducing transportation costs and other transaction costs remains a key factor to
increase agriculture's competitiveness and incomes o f the poor.

81,       A Marketing and Agro-Processing Strategy (MAPS) has been developed under the PMA
and includes the following key intervention areas: functional analysis o f the Ministryo f Tourism,
Trade and Industry and its agencies; development o f a national trade policy, national capacity
buildingfor trade negotiations; making market informationmore accessible; strengthening farmer
organisations; enhancing export competitiveness; and infrastructural development. Within this
framework a Warehouse Receipt System Bill has been prepared for submission to Cabinet and
task teams have been formed to develop implementation plans for the Warehouse Receipt System
and Agricultural Commodity Exchange. A review o f the role o f the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority (UCDA) has been prepared to more clearly delineate private and public sector roles in
the coffee supply chain, identify institutional and regulatory functions of UCDA that pose
obstacles to value addition across the supply chain, and propose revisions to regulations and
mechanisms for product quality enhancement.

PhysicalInfrastructure

Roads

82.       The preparation o f the 10 Year-National District and Urban Roads Investment Program,
i s at an advanced stage and i s expected to be completed by September 2003. Following decision
and approval o f the Government "White Paper" on policy, strategy and implementation o f the
district, urban and community roads, the construction o f the highest prioritised 1000 km o f
district roads, presently under design, is scheduled to commence in 2004.

83.       The recently completed study on the establishment o fUganda National Road Agency has
been widely discussed with various donors. Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) in the
MoWHC has been successful and efficient, but the Unit represents only a nucleus o f the planned
National Road Agency. Transition o f RAFUto the full road agency i s expected to be completed
by June 2004. At that time, MoWHC will become a policy and regulatory authority. Maintenance
of the national roads will also be gradually transferred for implementation to RAFU/Road
Agency.

  PILLAR 4: ACTIONS WHICH DIRECTLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFEFOR
                                            THE POOR

84.       Government has a major role to play in improving the quality o f life o f the poor through
the provision o f essential social services. Following the recommendations o f the PEAP in 1997,
Government has substantially increased the proportion o f the total budget devoted to key poverty
reducing services to 36 percent in 2002103. While this has already had a significant impact on
poverty in some areas-for      example, through the enormous increase in educational enrolment-
service delivery has yet to improve in proportionto the increased funding.

85.       Government is determined to resolve the key bottlenecks which are holding back
improved service delivery. Cross-cutting issues include public service management and pay, the
fiscal transfer system, results orientation, public sector procurement, financial management and
accountability, monitoring and evaluation, and transparency and corruption, which have been
discussed above. Others are sector-specific. Iwish to highlight here three sectors: education,
health and water and sanitation o f greatest concern to the poor.




                                                 77

                                                                                         Schedule 1


Education

86.     Government's Universal Primary Education (UPE) policy has dramatically increased
primary school enrolment since 1997 and increased access to education for the children o f poor
households. UPE has thus eliminated the wealth bias that had characterised access to primary
education. The key challenges now are to improve the quality o f primary education and maintain
high enrolments. Government needs to increase the stock of classrooms, the number of qualified
teachers, the supply and utilisation o f instructional materials, the efficiency o f input use, and
improve accountability and transparency. In order to sustain UPE it i s also important to increase
access to post-primary education for primary school leavers. Government has been working
closely with all stakeholders within the institutional arrangements o f the sector-wide approach
(SWAP) in the Education sector. Government is committed to achieving the following critical
primary education targets by April 2003, compared with the outturns for 2000/01 (inparenthesis):
        0   average pupil: teacher ratio o f 54:1 (63: 1);
        0   average pupil: classroom ratio o f 95:1 (104: 1);
        0   average pupil: book ratio P3 to P4 3:l [average target ratio will be 3:l by April 2004
            for P3 to P7 and zero for P1 and P2 because only non textbook materials are
             supplied];
        0   P7 enrolment 14 percent o f the appropriate age group (10) [to be determined in the
            October 2003 sector review];
        0   Indicator on measuring learning [to be determined in the October 2003 sector
            review].

87.     The following indicates the impact o f reforms undertaken under PRSC3, sectoral
outcomes, as well as actions that will be undertaken in the short and medium term in order to
achieve these targets:

        0   According to the Participatory Poverty Assessment 2002, education is still highly
            valued by communities as a means o f rising out o f poverty. Education therefore
            remains the Government's top priority, receiving over 3 1percent o f the discretionary
            Government recurrent budget and committing at least 65 percent o f the total sector
            budgetto primary education;

        0   Ministryo f Education and Sports (MOES), MOPS, MOFPED, MOLG and districts
            are collaborating in the implementation o f a national effort to recruit, deploy and add
            new teachers to the payroll by June 2003. A mechanism for monitoring the share of
            filled positions has been strengthened and an action plan for increasingthe number of
            teachers on the payroll, with particular attention to the ten districts with the largest
            establishment gaps will be implemented. The aim i s to ensure that all districts
            achieve at least 95 percent o f their established ceilings by June 2003. As agreed
            under PRSC3, because o f the higher than anticipated increase in enrolment,
            Government maintained the pupil-teacher ratio at 54: 1'. A tracking study on primary
            teachers' recruitment, deployment and payroll management has been undertaken to
            identify areas that require improvement;

        0   Government intensified its efforts with regard to classroom construction and
            completion. These efforts have been guided by the recommendations o f an evaluation
            o f classroom construction. As agreed under PRSC3, Government reduced the ratio to

              95:l (from 104:l in 2001). Efforts to increase efficiency in classroom construction
              will continue withthe aim o freducingthe ratio further to 92:1by April 2004;
              In order to reduce class sizes, Government will investigate possible cost efficiency
              measures, including sequential teaching, and agree on a way forward to achieve the
              required targets within the available resources. MoES completed the double shift
              pilot, following which there were clear indications o f gaps that required further
              technical support to guide implementation. This support is beingsought.

88.      The introduction o f an expanded new curriculum, including eleven subjects, has
invalidated the current textbooks in classrooms and, as a consequence, the current pupil-to-
textbook ratio i s not available for the new subjects for some grades. New textbooks are being
published for the new curriculum. Procurement arrangements were reviewed and the new
arrangements have resulted in an improvement in the quality o f learning materials while, at the
same, time reducing the unit cost by over two-thirds. A wide range o f non-textbook materials
were procured and distributedfor all P I and P2 classes. Books for P3 and P4 have been procured
and distributedand the procurement process for core textbooks for P5 to P7 has been launched. It
i s projected that the pupil: textbook ratio for Primary 3 to 7 will be 3:1 (for Mathematics, English,
Integrated Science, Agriculture and Social Studies) by 2004.

89.      The EducationManagement Information System (EMIS) has been reviewedto capture an
increasing proportion o f educational institutions and enhance monitoring, to ensure an increasing
focus on more disadvantaged districts. Government is inthe process o f finalising a framework to
monitor quality, including Education For All (EFA) and Millennium DevelopmentGoals.

90.      Government is also actively pursuing policies to increase access to post-primary
education to ensure that gains made through UPE are sustained. To that end, a policy for post-
primary education and training has been finalised.

91.      The semi-annual Education Sector Reviews (ESR) in April and October, involving all
stakeholders, have been the main forum for agreeing on undertakings and monitoring progress in
achieving them. Education sector undertakings and PRSC actions and benchmarks for education
are now fully integrated. In the semi-annual sector review o f April 2002 the following
undertakings were agreed upon and their satisfactory implementation was confirmed during the
October 2002 review:

             Financial commitment: Budget and releases are in line with Government guidelines
             maintaining a minimum o f 31 percent o f recurrent discretionary expenditure for the
              education sector with at least 65 percent o f this for primary education;
             Public expenditure management: A tracking on Primary teacher recruitment,
              deployment and payroll management to be carried out by the October 2002 ESR;
              Quality enhancement: the following were achieved (targets are in italics in
             parenthesis) pupil-teacher ratio (54:l) 54: 1; pupil-classroom ratio (92:l) 94:1;pupil-
             textbook ratio @/a)) 3:1 for P3 and P4;
              Outcome (equitable quality): Share o f appropriate age range: female 10 percent,
              males 10 percent;
             Equitable access: A draft costed framework on basic education for educationally
             disadvantaged children was discussed at the October 2002 ESR and the 2003/04
             planningand budgetingcycle;

                                                                                      Schedule 1


             Teacher recruitment: Mechanisms for monitoring the share o f filled positions for
             teachers was strengthened and the action plan for increasing the number o f teachers
             on the payroll, with particular attention to the ten districts with the largest
             establishment gaps, implemented;
             Monitoring and evaluation: The 2002 EMIS data, in which a registry of private
             schools has been incorporated, had been collected, entered, analysed and verified,
             with the resulting statistics being presented at the October 2002 ESR. The School
             Census 2002 will capture an increasing proportion of secondary schools and post-
             primary education and training institutions. Information on complementary primary
             education centres will be collected and included inthe Education Statistical Abstract;
             Post-Primary Education and Training (PPET): A draft policy and costed framework
             for expansion o f PPET has been discussed with a wide range o f stakeholders and was
             presented to the October 2002 Review for comments, endorsement and future
             development.

Health

92.     The second Uganda Participatory Poverty Assessment Project (UPPAP) has again
identified poor health to be the number one cause and consequence o f poverty. The Government
of Uganda therefore remains committed to improving the health status o f the population as a
means to reduce poverty. Clearly the health sector, in providing preventive and curative health
care services, has an important role in contributing to improved health status and poverty
reduction. How this will be achieved is set out in the National Health Policy (NHP) and Health
Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP). In essence, the priorities o f the plan are to improve the coverage,
quality and equitable uptake o f a minimum package o f health services, develop partnerships with
stakeholders under the sector-wide approach (SWAP) and strengthen the delivery of health
services.

93.     The HSSP is now in its third year o f implementation and in accordance with SWAP
arrangements the Ministry o f Health and Development Partners have completed a mid term
review o f progress. As this process provided the most up to date analysis o f the sector, its
findings are being usedextensively inthis letter.

94.     The Mid-TermReviewo fthe health sector states:

        "It is the overwhelming conclusion of this review that implementingthe Uganda Health
        Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) through a Sector-Wide Approach is succeeding, and that
        with some qualification, the strategies adopted in the HSSP remain relevant and
        appropriate. Progress has been made towards achieving a number o f key HSSP output
        targets and insome areas performance has exceeded expectations".

95.     This overall positive assessment which follows on from the seventh successful joint
review o f the health sector in October 2002 shows that progress has been made in the health
sector. The review concluded that the undertakings agreed in the health sector review in April
2002 were satisfactorily implemented.

Achievements

96.     The SWAP partnership and its structures are functioning effectively. National ownership
and leadership have been well established with increasing readiness o f Government to shoulder


                                                 80

                                                                                     Schedule 1


the responsibilities that go with this. The partners have on their part continued to show trust,
patience and understanding, are appreciative o f the progress being made and moving to budget
support. The work of the Health Policy Advisory Committee and the Joint Review Missions
remain central to co-ordination and implementation of the HSSP.

97.      Funding for the sector has increased considerably. The last three years have seen an
average 9 percent annual rate o f growth in the total resource envelope. It is noteworthy that this
development is mainly attributable to increases inGovernment budget facilitated by donor budget
support. The budget development process has become even more consultative and transparent.
Most new support for the sector i s within the framework of the HSSP. The increased funding has
made it possible to increase essential inputs such as drugs, human resources, equipment, and the
expansion and upgrading of health infrastructure. The proportion of the health budget allocatedto
districts has jumped from 32 to 49 percent. The emphasis is also clearly on increasing access to
the minimum health care package at health centre level. This trend is expected to continue with
districts projected to receive 54 percent ofthe health budget in 2003/2004.

98.      There are improvements interms o f sector outputs. Progress on the five PEAP indicators
i s shown inthe table below.

99.      Total out-patient attendance, a national-level indicator for both PEAP and HSSP, has
risen dramatically-up     by 50-100 percent in many health facilities, with the highest rate o f
increase occurring over the HSSP period. The rise in Out Patient Department (OPD) attendance
can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the abolition o f user-fees, more efficient and
equitable allocation o f increasing Government budget resources (see above) and better financial
management arrangements.

100.     There are substantial improvements on earlier gains in arresting the extended period o f
decline in Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) coverage. DPT3 coverage increased from
41 percent in 1999 to 63 percent by mid 2002, with 84 percent of districts achieving levels well
above the HSSP target o f 48 percent for the period. The revitalisation o f EPI, which was being
implemented since 2000, also saw the successful introduction o f the pentavalent vaccine and safe
injection practices through the Global Action for Vaccination Initiative support. The increase in
OPD attendance also provided opportunity to improve coverage rates o f other EPI antigens.

101.     Case management o f malaria has improved with the introduction o f the new National
Anti-Malaria     Drug Policy      which    includes    the   combination     o f  chloroquine    and
sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine as first line treatment and home management o f fevers (Home Based
Management o f Fevers Strategy).

102.     Active prevention strategies have effectively sustained the downward trend in HIV sero-
prevalence that has now stabilised at around 6 percent at the antenatal clinic surveillance sites
(6.1 percent in 2000/01 and 6.5 percent in 2001/02). The increasing trend in condom use and the
rise in age at first sexual intercourse give much reason for hope. Extension o f voluntary
counselling and testing services, increasingthe number o f centres offering services for prevention
o f mother to child transmission o f HIV and improving the capacity to provide and monitor
antiretroviral treatment are important additions to the AIDS control programme.

103.     The capacity to plan for and deliver the UgandaNational MinimumHealth Care Package
i s improving at both district and central levels. Recruitment o f trained staff including
implementation o f the NursingAssistants training program has, to some extent, eased one o f the
most critical limiting factors for effective service delivery. Technical competence of service
providers is being strengthened through in-service training and improved supportlsupervision
activities.

104.     Collaboration with the private-not-for-profit (PNFP) partners i s progressing. Government
financial  support to this sub-sector jumping from USh 1.0 billion in FY 1997/98 to USh 16.5
billion in FY 2002/03. This has led to improved quality o f care and increase in preventive,
promotion and curative services providedby the PNFP. There i s a move towards reduction inthe
user fees leviedby PNFP facilities. This is consistent with the equity objective o fthe Government
subsidyto the PNFP service providers.

105.     The absence o f concrete indications o f improvement in key reproductive health outcome
indicators such as Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Total
Fertility Rate (TFR) has been a major concern to all parties. Despite the continuing highrates of
antenatal clinic attendance (92 percent attend at least once (MoH, 2000), and nearly 50% attend
four times (UNICEF, 2001), the rate o f deliveries conducted in health facilities is still declining.
Neonatal death rates have also increased. It is however worth noting that the Uganda
Demographic and Health Survey 2000-2001 incorporates a period that predates the HSSP. Given
the multi-dimensional nature o f the determinants o f these health outcomes, more coordinated
multi-sectoral efforts are needed. There are lessons to be learnt from the Rescuer Project and from



                                                 82

Kumi and Soroti Districts that have successfully reversedthe chronic stagnation in institutional
delivery rate using an effectively managed and resourced program, with strong community and
referral components.

Water and Sanitation

106.     The UPPAP showed water and sanitation services to be a high priority for the poor. In
response to this, Government has doubled the proportion o f the discretionary budget allocated to
water supply and sanitation (WSS) from 1.7 percent in 1998/99 to 3.3 percent in2001/02 and has
formulated sector strategies and drawn up investment programs for rural and urbanwater supply.

107.     Inpartnership with donors and other key stakeholders, Government has adopted a sector-
wide approach (SWAP) to the WSS sector based on community demand-orientation,
decentralised management through local governments, combined with central government
facilitation and delivery o f services by the private sector. The SWAP will be broadened to
incorporate water for production and water resources management components as soon as the
sub-sector strategies are completed. To strengthen collaboration and the SWAP for the Water and
Sanitation Sector, two joint Government-Donor Water Sector reviews were held in September
2001 and 2002, and a Technical Review in March 2003. The next review i s planned for
September 2003. MoWLE carried out a technical audit (value for money) and a tracking study in
November 2002 and March 2003, respectively, to monitor the programs. MoWLE is planning to
establish a monitoring protocol that draws on the routine returns from districts, annual household
and service delivery surveys, other surveys, and annual reports entitled "State o f the WSS
Sector."

108.     In rural WSS, Government intends to increase access to safe water and sanitation from
the present 54 percent to at least 58 percent by June 2006 withinthe indicative MTEFceilings. In
pursuance o f this objective Government has strengthened the capacity o f districts by setting up
District Water Offices and recruiting suitable staff to man them. The full compliment o f District
Water Sector staffing is being reviewed under the ongoing. Local Government restructuring
exercise, which will lead to full integration o f the District Water Office staff in the district
structures and payroll management. All districts are expected to achieve full staffing and training
o f District Water Officers by June 2006. DWD has been reorganised to support district capacity
buildingand delivery o f technical assistance to District Water Offices through the establishment
o f Technical Support Units(TSUs), which are fully operational.

109.     To enhance sustainability o f rural WSS systems, Government has reviewed existing
operation and maintenance arrangements and finalised the district WSS operational manual and
implementation guidelines. Special attention is being paid to the establishment and maintenance
of the spares supply chain to support community maintenance efforts. This strategy is based on
the utilisation o f the private sector and full community recovery for operation and maintenance.
Through this strategy, the percentage o f systems that are functional at any time i s expected to be
at least 80 percent. At the same time, Government, through the combined efforts o f the Ministry
o f Water, Lands and Environment (MWLE), MOES and MOH has agreed on institutional
responsibilities for sanitation and has prepared a National Hygiene Promotion, Sanitation and
Communication Strategy. In addition, Government introduced and pre-tested templates for
environmental screening o f sub projects in districts. Government has also taken steps to ensure
efficient use o f resources and has undertaken Value for Money technical audits and is addressing
the findings of the study with progress reportedto the Joint Government-Donor sector reviews. A
survey on the Private Sector (including NGOs) capability to support district planning and
implementation of water sector programmes is being undertaken and the results will be

                                                                                         Schedule 1


disseminated in the September 2003 review. The findings and recommendations o f these studies
will be used in the formulation of sector capacity building strategies, revision o f the Conditional
Grant Implementation Guidelines and Sector Monitoringand Evaluationprocedures.

110.    Inurban WSS, the objective is to improvesafe WSS coverage 65 percent by FY2003/04.
The urban sector consists o f 78 urban centres and district towns. Based on the recommendations
o f the recent urban WSS Reform study, Government will seek to introduce efficiency and
commercial orientation into the management o f urban WSS. Assets management for small towns
i s and will continue to be managed by the local councils with the support o f DWD. The larger
towns under a Lease Contract Asset Management and InvestmentPlanning will be transferred to
a dedicated publicly owned Asset Holding Authority. All technical, commercial and financial
operations in both regimes will be sub-contracted to independent professional private operators
undera two pronged strategy:

     0  Small urban WSS systems under local government management: Government has
        gazetted 56 Local Councils as urban WSS authorities that will have overall responsibility
        for asset management. It has also commenced the sub-contracting o f service provision
        operations to local private sector operators under management contracts to improve
        service delivery and increase sustainability. To date, 43 Local Councils have fully
        functional Water Supply systems while the rest are under construction. Ofthe existing43
        Water Supply systems, 24 are operated and managed by private service providers and the
        target i s to increase this to 35 by April 2004. To strengthen sustainability o f facilities and
        services and investments in the small towns, a tariff study and a long-term strategy for
        Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation are being undertaken and will be completed
        by June 2003. These studies will enable Government to develop Urban WSS project
        appraisal, financing and performance measuring indicators;


     0  Urban WSS systems under National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC)
        management: Government through MoWLE and MoFPED has made considerable
        progress in puttingNWSC on a firmer financial footing ahead o f the transition to Private
        Sector Participation. Over 70 percent o f NWSC operations are currently under a private
        sector management contract. The end o f June 2003 marks the end o f the three year
        Performance Contract signed between Government and NWSC. Government set up a
        Performance Contract Review Committee and its' findings in regard to the NWSC
        performance against the set targets indicated remarkable achievements for FY 2001/02,
        except for the unaccounted water targets for Kampala. Given the delay in moving
        forward with the urban water and sanitation reform implementation and in order to
        sustain the gains in NWSC performance, Government envisages a continuation o f the
        Performance Contract with the formulation o f a new contract commencing on lSt              July
        2003.
     0  In regard to water bills, Government has settled a substantial part of the outstanding
        verified bills owed. In order to settle the outstanding arrears and arrest the growth of
        arrears in some Government departments, a Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) was
        signed between the Government and NWSC on loth April 2003. Under the MoU,
        Government undertakes to settle the balance o f verified arrears o f Shs 5.732 billion in
        two instalments by December 2003 and March 2004. NWSC will take all necessary steps
        to collect what they bill to Government agencies. The issue o f NWSC long term debt
        obligations to Government will be reviewed and addressed. To ensure sustainability o f
        NWSC operations, Government approved and gazetted through Statutory Instrument,
        supplement number 13 o f April 2002, a formula for periodic tariff adjustments by
        NWSC.

    e    Government has recruited Technical Advisers for MoWLE to support the overall Urban
         Water and Sanitation Reform implementation and i s in the process o f procuring
         Transaction Advisory Services to prepare the necessary documents for establishment o f
         an Asset Holding Authority and procurement o f an independent private operator for the
         lease. Government expects that the Private Lease Operator will be inplace by June 2006.
         Government will also take steps to establish an independent regulatory framework prior
         to the engagement o f the private water operator and address all the necessary
         amendments to the current relevant legislation.

                                 Co-ordination and Implementation

111.     Government i s cognisant o fthe need to establish an effective co-ordination mechanism in
order to ensure successful implementation o f the identified actions for the achievement of the
overall objective o f improving basic service delivery. Considering the level o f resources
requested from the IDA under the PRSC3, together with the complementary resources from other
donors, it is critical to ensure effective supervision ofthe implementation o f the credit.

112.     Government has established a three-tier coordination system for PRSC to ensure progress
with reforms: Policy Coordination Committee (PCC), Implementation Coordination Committee
(ICC), and Sector Working Groups (SWG). PCC, chaired by the Prime Minister and consisting
o f Ministers, is responsible for reviewing the implementation o f Government policy and reporting
to Cabinet and the Presidency biannually. ICC, chaired by the Head o f Public Service and
Secretary to Cabinet and comprised o f Permanent Secretaries, reports to PCC every four months,
provides strategic direction in the implementation o f Government policies and programs
consistent with Cabinet decisions, and appraises and negotiates PRSC and other credits with
donors. SWGs bring together sectoral stakeholders, meet regularly (at least every two months),
and report quarterly to ICC. There will also be ajoint secretariat to service PCC and ICC.

                                       4. Conclusions

113.    IwouldliketotakethisopportunitytoreiteratethecommitmentofGovernmenttothe
implementationof the PovertyEradicationAction Plan. The actions to beundertakenoverthe
medium term under each PEAP pillar focus on measures that will improve, through greater
efficiency and effectiveness, both the quantity and quality of service delivery, particularly to
thepoor.

114.    Increased efficiency of service delivery implies improved management systems and
practices in the public sector, including improved financial accountability. Improved
effectiveness of service delivery requires closer alignment between outcomes and policy
objectives through greater focus on service outputs duringbudgetpreparation.The requested
financing i s expectedto support the critical Govemment reforms set out in this letter and to
enableachievementof thoseobjectives.



115.    On behalf of the Government of Uganda, Iwish to thank the IDA for the assistance
already providedunder the past StructuralAdjustment Credits (I-III),   the EFMPIand II,the
ICBP, the LGDP, and the PRSC 1and 2. They have been critical in achieving a dramatic
reductioninpoverty since the 1990s.Itrust that this requestfor additionalassistancethrough
theproposedPRSC3will receiveyour favourableconsideration.


                                       Yours sincerely,

1.       This annex provides background for the institutional reform areas that PRSC3 and subsequent
PRSCs focus on: (1) efficient and equitable use of public resources, (2) cross-cuttingpublic sector
reforms, (3) promotiono f enabling environment for rural development, and (4) sector-specific reforms,
initially in education, health and water and sanitation. The institutionalreform areas are presented in the
context ofthe PEAPPRSPpillars.

                              A. Efficientand EquitableUse of PublicResources

2.       The budget process in Uganda has evolved significantly over the last five years. By 1997198,
Uganda had in place a reasonablywell-articulatedrolling, three-year budgetingprocess. Since 1992 the
Government had relied on a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to set out strategic
budgeting choices over a three year horizon.' Initially, the main objective o f this process was to ensure
macroeconomic stability. MTEF, allied with a cash release mechanism, providedthe framework for the
re-establishment of fiscal discipline by keeping overall spending in line with available resources. In
subsequent years, MTEF was usedto accommodate large new spending programs within the constrained
expenditure ceiling; specifically, the main roads program in 1995 and Universal Primary Education
1997198.
3.       By 1997/98, the institutional structures o f the budgeting process were well established. The
process begins inthe fall of each year when sector working groups are given expenditure ceilingsfor the
following three years and asked to develop spending proposals for that period. The sector working
groups, roughly 15 in number, are organized according to functional groupings and involve
representatives from the relevant line ministries and the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic
Development (MoFPED). In accordance with the Budget Act 2001, the sector working groups submit
their spendingplans to the MoFPEDinDecemberlJanuary andthese proposals form the basis for the draft
national Budget Framework Paper (BFP), which is submitted to Cabinet in mid-March setting out the
main strategic choices that needto be made. After revisingthe draft based on Cabinet's comments, the
revised draft BFP is submitted to the Parliament Budget Committee by April 1. On the basis of the
Cabinet and Budget Committee decisions, MoFPED prepares the annual budget for the following
financial year. The annualbudget is submittedto Parliament in early June.
4.       In 1997/98,in a further evolutionofthe Ugandanbudgetingprocess, the Government decidedto
open up the budgeting preparation to a wider range o f stakeholders. This took the form of exposing
donors and civil society organizations to the broad fiscal choices confronted by the Government in

' InUganda, the three year spendingframework is set out in a document referredto as the BudgetFrameworkPaper.




                                                             123

October and involving them in the sector working group activities leading up to the submission of
spending plans to the MFPED. Subsequently, upon the approval by Cabinet of the three-year spending
program but prior to the submission of the annual budget to Parliament, the Government at the annual
Public Expenditure Review outlines to donors and civil society organizations the specific spending
choices made for the following three-year period. As a result of this, the Ugandanbudgeting process has
becomesubstantially more transparentand accountable.
5.       There were several objectives in involvingoutside stakeholders inthe budgeting process. First, it
was felt that outside stakeholders, particularly donors, could provide usefultechnical support to the sector
working groups. By engaging donors in the work of these groups, the quality of the sector working
groups' outputs would be enhanced, leading to better budgetary choices. Second, given the relatively
high level of donor financing of the budget, it was necessary to get a better fix on the likely level of donor
support in advance of the annual budgeta2 This was particularly important for donor budget support.
Finally, it was felt that by increasingthe general awareness of the Government's intended spending plans
post Cabinet decision, it would be more difficult for the Government to deviate from these plans in actual
budget execution. The operation of the cash release system in conjunction with MTEF had led to
substantial deviations between budgeted expenditures and actual outlays, undermining incentives for
budgetary managementat the line ministry level3 By making public the expenditurechoices, the costs of
subsequent deviations would be higher.
6.       Performance: Over the last five years, the Ugandanbudget process has beenhighly successful in
affecting a realignment of spendingpriorities, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. This has been
most evident in the rising share of poverty-related spending in total government expenditures. Spending
on programs covered by the Poverty Action Fund (PAF) roughly tripled between 1997/98 and 2000/01.4
Spending on PAF programs rose as proportion of total public spending from 16 percent in 1997/98 to
35.2 percent in2001/02. The share of PAF programs intotal expenditures is projectedto increase further
inthe next three years, risingto 37.1 percent of total expenditures in 2003/04. As a result, over the last
four years, the Ugandanbudgethas become strongly poverty focused.
7.       The process has also led to reduced variation between budgeted spending and actual outturns.
Measuring variation using the "discrepancy index", defined as the absolute percentage deviation between
budget and outturns and then taking a weighted average of the deviation, suggests that some progress has
been made (see table 1 below).            The Ugandan budget has become more predictable in execution,
providing a basis for donor finance to shift from project to budget support modalities.

8.       PRSC Agenda: There has been substantial progress over the last four years in improving
Uganda's budgetary performance, management and reporting. The Government has prepared detailed
reports on budgetary performance for 1999/00 and 2000/01, These reports measure budget execution
relative to approved levels and discuss reasons for slippages. Semi-annual budget performance reports


 In 1997/98,foreign financing (grants andloans) was equivalentto 48 percent oftotal expenditures.
 In 1994/95,the deviation betweenbudget and actual expenditureswas 27 percent.
 PAF was established in 1998/99as a "virtual fund" to identify expenditures with a high poverty reduction impact. Funding for
PAF is largely notional, although some donors ear-mark budget support for PAF expenditures, and the budgeting of PAF
expenditures occurs through normal budgeting processes. However, PAF expenditures are given larger than normal spending
increasesandPAF expenditures are protectedfrom within year spendingcuts arising from domestic revenue shortfalls.




                                                            124

                                                                                                  Annex 5




have also been prepared since 2001/02. Enactment of the Budget Act 2001 and Public Finance and
Accountability Act 2003 as well aim to increase efficiency ofthe budget process.
9.       There are, however, a number of areas that need improvement. First, the output-orientation ofthe
budget is still relatively weak. Output indicators have not been developed yet for all sectors, and the
linkage between outputs and outcomes needs strengthening. Good budgeting requires clear linksbetween
inputs, outputs and outcomes in order to make informed decisions on budget allocations andto provide an
accountability framework for spendingagencies.
 10.     Second, the rangeof budget choices is limited intwo respects. First, explicit spendingallocations
are only made for Government-funded expenditures. Donor project funding falls largely outside the
budget allocation process. While levels of donor project finance are included inthe budget by line item,
these levels are indicative only and there is no formal mechanism for the programming of donor project
funds. The Government has prepared a framework for integrating donor projects within MTEF. It was
piloted in 2002/03 and expected to be fully implemented in 2004/05. Second, the wage bill is largely
exogenous in sectoral spending decisions. Determination of the wage bill in MTEF is based on the
previous year's level, adjustedfor staffing changes and projected wage increases. These two factors limit
sector working groups' decision making. Sector working groups do not typically trade-off Government-
funded spending for donor project funding and typically can only reallocate Government-funded
expendituresbetweennon-wage recurrent and domestic development.
11.      The Government is addressing these constraints and has initiated reforms in these areas.
Successful reforms will require adjustments in budgetary institutions over the medium term. First,
capacity of sector working groups to focus on outputs and outcomes needs strengthening. This has
occurred through the development of sector-wide approaches (SWAPS), which tie together donors and
Government in a common program with agreed objectives. There are currently sector-wide approaches in
place for education, health, water and sanitation, and justice and law and order sectors.           These
arrangements exist outside the formal budgeting process, but their activities feed into the budget
preparations.
12.      Second, there is a need to increase the role of sector working groups. Budgeting institutions in
Uganda have evolved over the last five years. Some parallel systems (for example, SWAps) have
emerged. Clarifying the role of different groups is necessary if the budgetary objectives are to be
achieved.

                                      B. Monitoringand Evaluation

13.      The Government has made progress inthe M&E area. A notable achievement was the launch of
the Poverty Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy (PMES). PMES highlights the need for practical
arrangements to track PEAPPRSP poverty indicators, and points out a number of areas in which further
work is needed. In particular, linkages to the operational decision-making processes, incentives and
responsibilities within the public sector are still largely unaddressed by current M&E arrangements. Also,
there remains a proliferation of different M&E formats, routines and requirements which leads to an
unnecessary large workload, combined with overlap and redundancy indata coverage.
14.      A study on M&E in the health, education and water sectors has been completed and discussed
within the Government and with the civil society. The report identifies a number of factors that constrain
effectiveness of M&E. Sector plans are not clear on results to be achieved, with inconsistencies between
the strategy and results planning instrumentsused. The study also highlights the time and resources spent
on inspection, PAF reporting and data collection. Local governments collect data on a thousand different
indicators for separate management information systems of three ministries. Also, a large volume of




                                                       125

                                                                                                       Annex 5




inspection and supervision is taking place, which detracts managerial attention away from actual service
delivery. Both inspection and data collection tends, however, primarily to verify rulebook compliance
and state o f physical facilities, instead o f yielding information about cost effectiveness, value for money,
or client satisfaction with services delivered.
15.      To start addressing these issues, coordinate review, and follow-up on implementation o f PRSC
benchmarks, an M&E working group has been formed, comprising the Office o f the Prime Minister
(OPM), MoFPED, Ministry o f Public Service (MOPS), and Ministry o f Local Government (MoLG).
Coordination o f M&E is neededto ascertain that arrangements guide public action towards the objectives
ina cost efficient manner. It entails a continuous effort to bringconvergence and complementarity to the
existing information standards, requirements and systems that support different levels o f national
decision-making.      As a further step towards harmonization o f current M&E arrangements, the
Government has established a common framework o f results management concepts and definitions.
16,      Over the last few years, several sectors have become more results-oriented, as reflected in the
BFP's and in sector strategies and policies. However, much still remains to be done to further results-
orientation and consistency. Still too many ministries do their planning on the basis o f measures that
essentially relate to inputs, activities and processes, as opposed to the outputs and outcomes that are
meant to follow from what they do.
17.      Line ministries have parallel systems and routines for compilation and reporting of data from
districts and local governments. Under the Second Local Government Development Program (LGDP2),
the Government is planning the development of a data collection system for the district and local
governments. Originally conceived as catering to the special needs o f MoLG, and simply adding to
combined data collection efforts, it has been agreed under PRSC that the Government instead seeks to
build a common platform for local level information collection and data entry. Also, Uganda's districts
and frontline service delivery units are burdenedby excessive visits by different supervision, support and
inspection teams. Those visited perceive inspection as unnecessary policing, rather than constructive
support or quality assurance. There is poor feedback from inspection visits, and little o f the data collected
is used for any decision-making at the local level.          The Government is contemplating an option to
consolidate inspection activity into multi-disciplinary teams. Also, a number o f inspection tasks can be
undertaken by civil society organizations or communities themselves, such as verification o f classroom
construction.
18.      Lack o f coordination o f studies and reviews has resulted in overlapping evaluation exercises, and
ineffectiveness o f evaluation reports since they are not adequately linkedto the decision-making process.
To address this, the Government has established a mechanism for setting evaluation agenda.
19.      The Government is planning to conduct another National Service Delivery Survey (NSDS) in
2003/04 to measure client satisfaction and public perceptions o f service quality between different
beneficiary groups, sectors, locations, and over time. The findings o fNSDS can be used for target-setting
and performance assessment.
20.      To promote bottom-up accountability, the Government has made mandatory posting o f notices on
PAF funding allocations. However, there are indications that compliance with the rule has lately become
uneven, and there is a need to refocus on this. The Government will report on its experiences with the
posting o f such notices. To enhance bottom-up accountability, an initiative is also underway to establish
a system o f client scorecards.
21.      The M&E benchmarks in the PRSC policy matrix represent a package o f reforms which will
make a systemic improvement to national M&Earrangements. At the same time, it is clear that M&E also

is dependent on progress in other areas o f reforms addressed by the PRSC, such as budgeting and
financial management, transparency and civil society engagement.

                                         A. PublicService Reform

22.      The Government has pursuedpublic service reform since early 1990s. The public service reform
program envisions the transformation o f the public service to a results-oriented meritocracy that will
ensure efficient and effective delivery o f quality public services.        The current central thrust o f the
program's strategy is to introduce a results-oriented management culture in the public service. Towards
this end, the initial steps have been taken with introduction of output-orientation inplanning, budgeting
and evaluation by all public agencies, and objective and open performance appraisal o f personnel.
23.     However, the successes and gains made in the public service reform program in the mid-1990s
have not been sustained and in some cases, such as downsizing and enhancement o f pay, have actually
been reversed.     The Government, jointly with its development partners, conducted a review o f the
program, which was completed in 2002, and developed a strategy for a new phase o f public service
reform, which is awaiting Cabinet's approval.
24.      Furthermore, the Government and the Bank have embarked on the design o f the Capacity and
Performance Enhancement Program (CAPEP) as the vehicle through which the Bank and other
development partners would collaboratively make available resources for technical assistance and other
capacity buildingnecessary to deliver the reform agenda and medium-term outcomes targets in the PRSC
framework. The preparation o f the CAPEP is ongoing and the project is expected to be effective in2004.
25.      In addition, the reform program focuses on two areas of public service reform: pay reform and
payroll management. Distortions and inequities in the public service compensation system contribute to
low morale, indiscipline, and unethical conduct by public servants, and constrain the ability o f the
Government to recruit, retain and motivate skilled and experienced professionals and technicians in the
public service. The weak payroll management system still a couple o f years ago led to long delays inthe
recruitment o f the additional teachers that were needed to support the implementation o f the
Government's UPE program. Work continues on these critical areas.
26.     Public Service Employment and Pay Reform: The Cabinet has approved a medium-term pay
reform strategy. The central thrust o f this strategy is to evolve a pay structure, policies and practice that
will enable the Government to recruit, retain and motivate a critical mass o ftechnically and professionally
skilled Ugandans into the public service. Because o f the severity o f budgetary constraints, the medium-
term pay reform strategy has limitedpolicy objectives: (i)     restore and preserve the purchasing power o f
salary levels for all public officers; (ii)
                                          eliminate distortions arising from select pay and awards and non-
task allowances; (iii) achieve market benchmarked salary targets for critical roles and skills positions; (iv)
establish a sustainable retirement benefits scheme. To achieve these objectives the strategy stipulates that
the Government will: (i) employment growth inlow priority sectors; (ii)phase out public servants
                           curtail
paid by development partners in project implementation units (PIUS); and (iii)raise the wage bill to
support implementation o f priority medium-termpolicy targets. The Ministriesconcerned (Le. MoFPED
and MOPS) underscored the Government's commitment to the key principles underlyingthe pay reform
strategy as they adjusted salaries at the beginning o f the current fiscal year according to the strategy.
27.     Public Service Employment: Analysis o f affordable scenarios for the medium-term public
service pay reform strategy revealed that recent and anticipated political decisions to expand public
administration through, for example, the creation o f new districts and political posts, will not only




                                                     127

                                                                                                    Annex 5




significantly contribute to rapid growth in public service employment, but exacerbate the severity o f
budgetary constraints on public service pay reform. In 1997, the total number o f public servants on the
public service payroll was about 160,000 (down from 320,000 inthe early 1990s). In May 2003, the total
number was 218,549. Ifcontrol measures are not taken, the number will be about 250,000 inthe next few
years.
28.     The predominant factor in this rapid rise in numbers is the recruitment o f more teachers and
health workers, and this may bejustifiable interms o f impact on services delivery. However, it is not yet
demonstrated that there is cost-effectiveness in the planned rate o f increase. Even less likely to be cost-
effective are the significant increases in public administration employment. Therefore, the Government
needs to institute a policy and systems to control expansion o f public service. To do this, the Government
has launched a study on the strategy and modalities for controlling public sector employment and
ensuring cost-effectiveness in the growth o f employment in the social sectors.              Thereafter, the
Government intends to seek Cabinet approval for a policy to underpinthe strategy and its implementation
modalities.
29.     Payroll and Human Resources Management Systems: The survey in health, education and
water carried out in 2000/01 confirmed that payroll and human resources management were severely
constrained by: (i)   top-down establishment control; (ii) district-level personnel functions; and (iii)
                                                          weak
inefficient human resource management systems. Under PRSC1, the Government established an inter-
ministerial task force which developed a short to medium-termaction plan to address delays in payroll
access by frontline workers, especially by teachers. Since then the large backlog o f newly recruited
teachers not on the payroll has been cleared. Also, payroll change reports received from districts now
take only about 30 days to be processed, because the most procedures and controls have been
decentralized.
30.      Still, there are many weaknesses in the payroll and human resources management systems. Inthe
short to medium term, there is need for systematic efforts to streamline and simplify the procedures and
formats, and to strengthen controls in payroll and personnel management. In the medium term, the
Government also needs to adopt a strategy and appropriate policies and standards for implementation o f
computer-based integrated payroll and human resources management systems that is linked with the
Integrated Financial Management System. A consultant has been hired to prepare a roadmap towards
implementing the integrated and computerized approach to human resources management.                  In the
meantime, the Government has prepared an action plan to improve on the existing procedures and
controls, and begunits implementation.

                                         B. Public Procurement

31.     Public procurement is an area o f government activity in which the risks o f corruption are high,
given the value o f goods and services procured by the Government, the strong interest o fthe businesses in
winning government contracts, and the authority given to public officials to award contracts. Over 90
percent o f the complaints received by the Inspector General o f Government (IGG) are procurement-
related.  Uganda channels about US$700 million a year through the public procurement process.
Assuming 10 percent o f these funds are not usedfor the intendedpurpose, would imply an economic loss
o f US$70 million a year.
32.     The main problem with public procurement has been failure to observe the rules and regulations
in place, inadequate monitoring, and failure to impose sanctions for violations of the rules.           The
Government realized the need for strengthening the procurement system especially in the area of
enforcement.     To this effect, in December 1997, the Government established a Task Force aimed at




                                                    128

                                                                                                  Annex 5




reviewing the existing procurement system and proposing a system that will ensure maximum
transparency, economy and efficiency in public procurement. The Task Force consisted o f government
representatives, the private sector and the donor community, and was assisted by consultants from the
International Trade Center (ITC), under Swiss Government financing. The report o f the Task Force was
approved by the Cabinet inJanuary 2000 with minor amendments.
33.     The Task Force focused on procurement systems at the central Government level. Under PRSC1,
the donor community and the Government, inthe context ofthe Country ProcurementAssessment Report
(CPAR), reviewed the whole public sector procurement system, including local government. The CPAR
exercise revealed a number o f weaknesses in the procurement system besides those covered in the Task
Force Report. The review comprised analysis o f the country's public sector procurement structure,
including the legal framework, organizational responsibilities and capabilities, and procedures and
practices, including how these may differ from the formal rules and procedures. There were fundamental
weaknesses in the system that made it susceptible to inefficiency and corrupt practices.            These
weaknesses were inherent inthe following main areas o f the system: legal and regulatory, procedures and
practices, organisation and resources.
34.     The following text summarizes the major weaknesses identified and recommendations made by
the Task Force and CPAR, and reports on the status o f implementation o f these recommendations.
Implementation o f these reforms started officially in March 2001, with the introduction o f the new
procurement regulations.
35.     Legal and Regulatory Framework:              Several laws govern public procurement, but their
application is not coordinated. The Public Finance (Tender Board) Regulations (CTB Regulations) issued
under the Public Finance Act 1977 controlled procurement at the Central Government and the Local
Government Tender Regulations issued under the Local Government Act 1997 controlled procurement at
the Local Government level. A number of other laws also had a bearing on procurement, including: the
Government Central Purchasing Corporation Statute 1990; the NRA Statute 1992; the Leadership Code o f
Ethics 1992; the Police Statute 1994; the Local Government Financial and Accounting Regulations 1998
(Part IX); and the Prevention o f Corruption (Amendment) Act 1998.
36.     The CTB Regulations and the Local Tender Board regulations provided an internal set o f rules
for financial/economic   control o f the administration concerning composition o f Tender Boards (TB) and
the limits oftheir jurisdiction, and regulations concerning the actual procurement process. As these were
not laws, but administrative documents, they could be amended by the Ministers o f Finance and Local
Government without regard to fundamental rights o f the suppliers/contractors. In addition, these
regulations lacked enforcement and monitoring provisions. The system also lacked credible paths o f
complaints which had implications for economy, efficiency and transparency. Suppliers and contractors
were discouraged from actually lodging complaints, and therefore violation o f procurement rules and
regulations went unchecked resultingin erosion o f public confidence inthe system.
37.     Recommendations on Legal Framework: A number o f reform actions were proposed to improve
the weak legal and regulatory framework, including: enactment of a Procurement Law based on the
UNCITRAL model law with provisions for appropriate control and monitoring mechanisms; abolition o f
the Central Tender Board; establishment of an autonomous Regulatory Body with oversight and
supervisory powers over public procurement entities; establishment o f contract committees in ministries
and parastatals with full authority to undertake procurement o f goods, works and services required to
meet their operational needs with funds appropriated to them; establishment o f procurement units in
ministries and parastatals; and establishment o f an appeals body for complaints that cannot be adjudicated
by the regulator.

38.      Status of Implementation of Recommendations on Legal Framework:                A regulatory body
(Reformed Central Tender Board - RCTB) was created under new regulations that came into effect on
March 1, 2001. The Board became fully operational on September 1, 2001. Contract committees have
been established in all procuring entities to undertake the approval function originally handled by CTB.
The Procurement Act was assentedby the President on December 19, 2002 and the Act became effective
on February 21, 2003. A new regulatory authority (Public Procurement and Disposal o f Public Assets
Authority-PPDA)       replacedRCTB as o f February 21,2003,
39.      Proceduresand Practices: Five main areas needto be strengthenedto improve the transparency
and efficiency o f the procurement system: procurement planning, standard biddingdocuments, evaluation
criteria, record keeping, and contract management.        Procurement planning is a key instrument for
financial planningand should be linkedto the budgeting process. CPAR found that the system did not
provide for the need to prepare procurement plans and such plans were not generally prepared. While
inefficiency could be a contributing factor, lack o fplanning, in many cases, is deliberate in order to create
preconditions for ad hoc or unwarranted emergency procurement.             Lack o f standard procurement
documents also contributes to the non-transparency and inefficiency o f the system. Standard documents
are necessary to ensure that information contained in bidding documents and request for proposals is
known to all stakeholders in the procurement process.           This normally increases competition, and
efficiency, economy and transparency are promoted through open competition.                  CTB and local
government tender regulations lacked provisions for proper contract management and record keeping,
prescribed the use o f selective restrictive tendering methods, and merit point evaluation criterion for
goods and works which could be prone to subjectivity and hence non-transparency.
40.      Recommendations: To address weaknesses in the procedures and practices, the Government
decided to issue new procurement regulations.          In addition, the following recommendations were
proposed in CPAR: ministries, agencies and parastatals be required to prepare procurement plans as part
o f budget proposals; standard bidding documents (SBD) be prepared for goods, works and services;
limitations be imposed on the use o f restricted tendering and the short-listing process be fair when
restricted tendering is used; a handbook for monitoring services, goods and works be developed, and a
review o fthe effectiveness o f the current procurement filing system in all public entities be undertaken to
ensuretransparency and accountability according to international best practice.
41.      Status of Implementation of Recommendations on Procedures and Practices: The Government,
with assistance o f donors, introduced the new procurement regulations on March 1, 2001. Revised
regulations that are consistent with the new law are being finalized by the Attorney General. These
regulations address all concerns mentioned above.
42.      Organization: Until March 1, 2001, procurement decisions were done by user ministries,
departments, and a number o f tender boards including: Central Tender Board (CTB); Parastatal Tender
Boards; Police Tender Board; Military Tender Board; and District Tender Boards. These boards had the
responsibility for processing procurement o f goods, works and services. The regulations which set up
CTB under the 1977 Finance Act were incomplete and outdated. For instance, there were omissions
relating to procedures to handle complaints from bidders, and CTB lacked full autonomy.
ParastatalhlinisterialTender Boards were prone to conflict o f interest owing to inadequate separation of
roles in the composition o f the boards. The District Tender Boards suffered from political interference,
conflict o f interest, lack o f procurement skills and unclear coordinating mechanism with the central
government.
43.      The legal and regulatory reforms undertaken and described above address the organisational
problems o f CTB and the Local Government Tender Boards. Establishment o f RCTB, and then PPDA,
has provided the necessary oversight for public procurement in Uganda. Establishment o f contract

committees and procurement units has in turn providedthe required autonomy and accountability, and
following the enactment of the new procurement law which governs both the central and local
governments, the local government regulationsare beingstreamlinedto address the above.
44.     Resources: The procurement profession is not held in high esteem in Uganda. The profession
has been relegated and procurement functions taken over by administrative officers to satisfy their
personal pecuniary objectives.            Since the Government has hardly invested in training of public
procurement specialists, there is an acute shortage of qualified and well-trained staff in public
procurement in Ministrieshlepartments, parastatals and local governments. There are a few capable,
qualified and experienced professionals, mostly at the top level, while the rest of the staff (Le. the
majority) havebelow average levelof capabilities.
45.     Recommendations: It will take the Government sometime to build the necessary procurement
capacity inthe public sector. Inthe meantime, the Government has been advisedto employ procurement
agents to carry out procurement on its behalf. The procurement agents should also be given the
responsibility of training government employees and special incentives should be built in their contracts
to ensure that this is achieved. A number of recommendations were proposed on training, including:
undertaking a needs assessment of procurement professionals; developing professional standards for
procurement cadres through a certification system; developing training programs and training materials;
and systematic and continuous on-the-job procurement training for all civil servants since decisions on
procurement are made by multiplelayers o f administrative officers.
46.     Status of Implementation of Recommendations on Resources: With the assistance from donors,
the Government has been using procurement agents to assist those weak entities with large volume o f
procurement. The Government has also undertakena number of studies related to procurement capacity
in Ugandaandhas identifiedserious gaps. An institutionalassessment of localgovernment procurement
has also beencarried out by the Government.
47.     Despite the above reforms, public procurement in Uganda still bears a high risk factor.
Implementationof reforms is at an advanced stage, but progress has been rather slow owing to lack o f
implementingcapacity and shortageof funds. Donors are working closely with the Governmentto ensure
that the reforms are implemented systematically and funding is available.                        Given the limited
implementationcapacity in Government, donor assistance will be required for a long time to come.
Progress and impact of reforms will be monitoredclosely under PRSC. To this effect, PPDA will be
carryingout regular annual procurement audits on selected expenditures to verify that procuring entities
are adheringto the new regulations andobtainingvalue for money.

                                               C. Financial Management

48.     Although commendable improvements in public sector accounting, reporting, and auditing have
been made in Uganda, evaluations, includingthe Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA)
conductedjointly by the Government and donors, have made several recommendations for strengthening
and enhancing financial managementa5With the support o f donor-assistedinitiatives, the Government is
proceeding with its efforts to enhance the financial accountability framework. These initiatives are
achieving economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use o f public funds, and enhancing transparency
and accountability.



 For example, the annual public accounts of Govemmenthave beenproduced within the statutoryperiod of four months after the
end ofthe financial year for eachof the past four years.

                                                                                                  Annex 5




49.    The Government is undertaking the following measures to improve financial management and
accountability inthe country:

   9   The legal and regulatory framework governing public finances has beenupdated. The new Public
       Finance and Accountability Bill has been enacted, and Treasury instructions and financial
       regulations have been revised. They will be issued as the new government financial regulations
       for implementation by central government ministries and agencies.
       Also, the Government has established a sector working group to steer public expenditure
       management reforms (PEMCOM), which provides a forum for coordination and monitoring of
       public expenditure reform initiatives. The committee also provides a direct link to the PRSC
       process.
       MoFPED is launching a 24-month pilot of the accounting module of the computerized Integrated
       Financial Management System (IFMS) in five ministries and three local authorities.
       Subsequently, the system will be rolled out step-by-step throughout the public sector, taking into
       account capacity and sophistication of systems developmentineach implementing agency.
       The consolidation of monthly financial reports constitutes the basis for the preparation of semi-
       annual (July-December) and quarterly interim financial statements (last semester) by the
       Accountant General's Office (AGO). While the quality and timeliness of Government's financial
       reporting have significantly improved, AGO needs to establish a process to ensure timely follow-
       up of issues identified in the reports of the Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee
       (PAC).
       Priority will be given to: (i)hrther upgrading the professional and management skills of the
       internal audit cadre in accordance with the Second Economic and Financial Management Project
       (EFMP2) and the Financial Accountability Project (FAP); (ii)the preparation of an internal audit
       charter for submission to Parliament; and (iii)  preparation of a set of internal audit programs to
       enhance its quality.    In addition, audit committees will be established in each ministry in
       accordance with the requirementsof the forthcoming government financial regulations.
       A financial management support program for the decentralization process, providing additional
       support in accounting to districts that currently lack capacity, has been established. While the
       Office of the Auditor General (OAG) has caught up with the backlog of audits of districts and
       urban authorities' annual accounts, OAG, MoFPED, and MoLG are working on an approach for
       the audit of sub-county governments.
       The Government has finalized the regularization of material non-reconciled items referred to in
       the 1999 Report of the Auditor General on the public accounts, including the Consolidated
       Revenue Fund and bank accounts. Subsequently, the accounts and financial statements have
       reflected the regularization/reconciliation of all material brought forward items.
       Continue implementation of capacity buildingprogramsthrough EFMP2, LGDP2, and FAP.
       Resolve the issue of full independence for OAG through constitutional reform. It is expectedthat
       the Constitutional Review Commission will include in its final report appropriate proposals to
       secure both operational and legal independence for OAG. Deepening OAG's independence will
       in particular focus on human resource management, access to informationon public expenditure,
       and indemnity of OAG staff by introducing new legislation. Furthermore, OAG has appointed
       quality assurance managers to enhance quality of audit work.

          Strengthen the technical and administrative capacity o f PAC. PAC is taking steps to catch up
          with the report backlog going back to 1998/999.
50.       As the current financial management system does not provide adequate information on actual
public spending on front-line basic services, the Government has pioneered expenditure tracking surveys
to fill the information gap. Education, health, water and sanitation, and justice, laws and order sectors
have conducted these surveys, and are beingextended to other line ministries.
51.       Although the CFAA Report concluded that the central and local government financial
management systems represent high fiduciary risk, the major recommendations contained in the report
have been reflected in the PRSCI, PRSC2, and PRSC3 reform programs. In addition, the HIPC tracking
assessment carried out in Uganda in the fall 2001 points out a number o f weaknesses in financial
management at the local government level6 The reform program was expanded to address a number o f
them under PRSC2 and PRSC3. Also, the results o f the HIPC tracking update conducted in the fall 2002
have been reflected inthe reform program.
52.       The challenge facing the Government and its development partners is to implement these reforms.
In that regard, the assiduous monitoring o f the financial management reform will be critical.                        The
recruitment, training, and retention o f appropriately qualified and experienced staff at all levels by
offering competitive remuneration packages are also crucial to achieving an overall improvement in the
financial accountability environment.

                             D. Transparency,Participation,and Anti-Corruption

53.       At the Consultative Group (CG) meeting o f May 2001 good governance and corruption were
discussed, and both Minister o f Ethics and Integrity and the Head o f the Public Service recognized the
importance o f having core government functions working well if the Government is going to curb
corruption. These core functions correspond to key cross-cutting reforms described in the PRSC matrix:
overall public service reform, including pay reform and human resources management, financial
management, and procurement. CG confirmed the needfor the Government to improve the management
o f its core functions in addition to addressing corruption more directly through the adoption o f key pieces
o f legislation to promote transparency, prosecution o f corruption cases, and strengthening o f institutions
such as the Inspectorate o f Government (IG).
54.       Although public awareness programs, district integrity workshops and other events to create
awareness o f corruption are being conducted, progress in the area o f transparency and anti-corruption
continues to be modest. The key anticorruption laws have been enacted, namely the Leadership Code Act
2002 and IG 2002 Act. IG has been busy implementing and putting in place mechanisms to enforce the
Leadership Code. Much, however, still remains to be done, as the speed o f implementation continues to
be constrained by limited resources. Work on whistleblower protection and access to government
information has also started. However, DEIhas limited human resources that impairs its capacity to work
efficiently on several fronts. The anti-corruption laws (Magistrates Courts Act, Penal Code Act o f 1964,
Trial on Indictments Decree, Prevention o f Corruption Act o f 1970) have been reviewed and discussed.
Presently, DEIis working on a final report that proposes to consolidate the acts.




  The ranking of Uganda was slightly lowered from the first assessment. This does not, however, mean that financial
management in Uganda has deteriorated. The reason for a lowered rating is that the latest assessment, unlike the first one,
included local governments, which loweredUganda's overall rating. The performanceand functioning of systems is significantly
higher at the central government levelthan at the local one.




                                                             133

                                                                                                 Annex 5




55.     The first integrity survey was conducted in 1998. The second integrity survey, led by IG, has
been completed and the results disseminated. The survey results suggest that the level of corruption is
perceivedto have declined in the past couple of years. Inthe future, the Government plans to merge the
integritysurvey intothe national service delivery surveys. DEIis also developinga series of performance
indicatorsto monitor progress inthe fight against corruption.
56.     During the period of July-December 2000, IG had handled2,416 complaints with an additional
1,040 carried over from the previous six months and investigationtook place for 1,451 cases. A total of
502 were referred to other agencies for action, while the remaining cases were still being investigated.
Forty-seven cases were under prosecution with 8 finalized and 39 still at different stages of prosecution.
An average o f 576 cases are handled monthly. The IGG reports that during the six-month period
approximatelyUSh 1.7billionwas savedthroughits investigationof corruption. It is to be notedthat the
IGGreports (7 so far) havebeencirculated anddebatedinthe ParliamentaryCommittee.

                                    E. LegalandJudicialReform

57.     Uganda has continued to implement the justice, law and order (JLO) sector strategic plan
launchedinNovember 2001 to reformcriminalandcommercialjustice systems. The sector has adopteda
bi-annualreview mechanismto assess progressin implementation.
58.     The commercialjusticereformprogramfocuses on development and strengtheningo f institutions
that enable enforcement o f contracts and creation of mechanisms that ensure speedy, fair, and reliable
disputeresolution. The programfocuses onfour areas:
            The Commercial Court, includingthe Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution (CADER)
            and lower levelMagistratesCourts;
            Legalprofession;
            Commercial laws andregulations;
            Commercial or businessregistries dealingwith companiesand land.

59.     The fourth JLO sector review was conducted in December 2002, and the review confirmed that
prior undertakings had been satisfactorily completed. The Government has made significant progress
with the implementation of the commercialjustice reform program. The Commercial Court has been
established as a division of the High Court to adjudicate private sector commercial disputes and
ultimatelyenable enforce contracts. The privatesector is increasingly usingthe CommercialCourt: there
was a 35 percent increase in cases being registered in the six months prior to the December review, as
compared to the same period in the previous year. Case disposal rates have also increased and the
averagenumber of adjournments has fallen. The average lengtho ftime to dispose o f a case has fallenby
half, and takes currently 6.57 months. Nevertheless, the case backlog at the Commercial Court has been
increasing, owingto arise inregisteredcases andshortageofjudges.
60.     The commercialjustice reform is also aiming to increase client satisfaction with the commercial
justice system. The CommercialCourt User Committee provides a forum for discussionand exchangeof
information and views relating to matters pertainingto administration of commercial justice, and an
opportunity for users (mainly the private sector) to give feedback. While the 2001 commercialjustice
baseline survey indicated businesses' general satisfaction with commercial laws, weaknesses with
implementingandenforcing institutionswere notedto be constrainingprivatesector growth. Weaknesses
include high levels of corruption and lack of access to redress mechanisms, especially in the informal
sector. The reformof Magistrates Courts, establishment o f the Center for AlternativeDispute Resolution

    PEmh'RSP PILLAR111: DIRECTLY             INCREASING THE ABILITY OF THE POOR TO RAISETHEIR
                                                 INCOMES

61.     Much of Uganda's agricultural growth in the past years has resulted from an expansion of the
area of land devoted to agriculture. Output per unit of land has improved, but just enough to recover to
the productivity levels of 1970s, while labor productivity has decreased. The output increases of the past
fifteen years can be largely attributed to the decline in civil strife and improved incentives for farmers to
produce. These have stimulated improvements in allocative efficiency, and to some extent technical
efficiency, rather than technological change. While there still remains significant scope for further area
expansion, significant gains could also come from productivity improvements.


                     A. ImprovingTechnology Generation--Agricultural Research

62.     According to the Plan for Modernization of Agriculture (PMA), increasing agricultural
productivity through the generationand adoption of improved agricultural technologies is a priority. The
public sector supports generation of technologies with agricultural research through the National
Agricultural Research Organization (NARO). The most pressing issue facing NARO is to ensure that
researchprograms respondto farmers' needs.
63.     In line with international experience, PMA suggests that research and advisory services can be
made more effective through an institutional framework which provides for:

        0    greater relevance- research addressingwhat farmers want it to address;
        0    empowerment of rural people-to enable them to express their needs;
         0   greater responsiveness to client needs;
        0    a systematic interface betweenresearch, farmers and extension(advisory) service providers;
         0   involvement (leverage) with other actors - inparticular the university, NGOs, and the private
             sector; and
         0   accountability -mechanisms for identifying and correcting shortfalls inservice provision.

64.     To ensure better alignment of agricultural research activities with these six principles, particularly
improving the responsiveness and impact of agricultural research, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) coordinated a comprehensive institutional review of the national
agricultural researchsystem as a basis for the development of a new strategy. The review recommended
ways to: (i)promote demand-driven and farmer responsive research; (ii)decentralize the delivery and
funding of agricultural research and outreach services; (iii)promote private sector participation in the
delivery and financing of agricultural research services; (iv) introduce competitive mechanisms for
researchfinancing; and (v) enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of national institutional arrangements
supporting agricultural research.      A National Agricultural Research Policy has subsequently been
formulated reflecting these key recommendations. In subsequent years (and subsequent PRSCs), the
Government will put inplace the legal and institutional framework and begin implementation of the new
strategy, thereby introducing a stronger participatory element to research and realizing an increased
practical application of agricultural researchresults.

                                                                                                     Annex 5




                   B. ImprovingTechnologyUptake-Agricultural Advisory Services

65.      InUganda, the users of agricultural technology -millions ofpoor farmers -have beenunable to
demand effectively what they need from farm advisors or research scientists.            They have had little
capacity to identify and articulate their own needs, and they have had no financial resources or any other
leverage with which to influence or pay suppliers o f research and advisory services to address their needs.
66.      The new National Agricultural Advisory Services Program (NAADS), which is inthe first stages
o f implementation, is designed to establish a demand-driven program that will provide farmers with
access to the expertise o f agricultural professionals. With regard to the adoption o ftechnologies, NAADS
i s designed to address public sector responsibilities by providing technical services and financial
resources to farmers to helpthem to:
         identifythe kinds o fknowledge and technologies which are important to them on their farms;

     0   articulate their needs and priorities to agricultural professionals who might help them to address
         their problems;

     0   exert leverage (through their control o f program funding, through having a voice on decision-
         making boards, and through persuasion) to influence the kinds o f knowledge and technologies
         beingproduced and validated; and

     0   adopt technologies that fit their needs.
67.      NAADS has been designedaround the six guidingprinciples o f P M A as laid out above. NAADS
is empowering farmers to be effective demanders o f agricultural services by providing them with
financial resources and capacity building in the identification and articulation o f their needs. Funds and
responsibilities are allocated to local government in accordance with the Government's own provisions
for the decentralization o f resources and authority over program funds and activities. Under NAADS,
local government and farmers share the costs o f the program with proportional contributions which will
grow over time. While public funds from these various sources are used to finance the program, actual
provision o f the advisory services under NAADS is contracted out to private service providers. Under
NAADS, the interface between researchers, farm advisors, and farmers will be secured by placing funds
in the hands of farmers (groups) with which they will be able to pay for the advice and activities o f
agricultural professionals, from whichever source they deem appropriate. Activities and results o f the
NAADS program will be systematically monitored and evaluated; qualitatively by farmers and
quantitatively by NAADS staff.
68.      Under the NAADS program, service providers have been contracted in sixteen sub-counties. In
subsequent years (and subsequent PRSCs), NAADS will scale up implementation with the intention o f
contracting agricultural service providers in at least 19 districts by early 2005. These measures are
expected to improve the quality o f and access to agricultural advisory services.

                                              C. RuralFinance

69.      The Government regards development o f agriculture and the rural sector as essential to achieving
rapid economic growth and reducing poverty in the country. In preparing and approving PMA, the
Government has recognized the critical importance o f rural finance to increasing income from farming
and other rural activities while improving food security. The Government has stated that the mission in
rural finance is "to develop a system and institutionalarrangements that will ensure increased availability
o f market-based rural financial services inUganda."

                                                                                                    Annex 5




70.      PMA calls for establishing a conducive policy, legal and regulatory framework as the primary
thrust of Government. An important mechanism for stakeholder consultation in implementing this
approachis the Micro Finance Forum (MFF), chairedby MoFPED. To ensure coordination with PMA, a
joint subcommittee of MFF and PMA has been formed to oversee implementation of programs in rural
and micro finance.
71.      A key policy issue is the Government withdrawal from direct provision of credit, in light of
extremely poor performance of subsidized loans under Entandikwa and the general failure of various
directed credit programsto achieve sustainable loan and cost recovery rates. Despite politicalpressures to
revive such credit programs, the Government has so far responded favorably to proposals from MFF to
avoid direct Government credit programs and instead support a systematic approach to Expanding the
Outreach of Sustainable Microfinance in Uganda, including implementation of the Uganda Capacity
Building Framework (UCAP) to strengthenperformance inprivate micro and rural finance institutions.
72.      UCAP is intended to provide a common framework and guidelines for programs that provide
training and capacity-building support to Uganda's microfinance institutions (MFIs), in order to improve
their financial sustainability and increase outreach, especially into rural areas. It is complemented by a
proposed set of Donor Principles for Support to Uganda's Microfinance Sector. The rationale is to
encourage consistent, demand-driven approaches to capacity-building that aim to reduce the dependence
of MFIs on donor funding and strengthen their ability to mobilize their own funds from savings and
commercial sources.       UCAP is part of the program for Expanding the Outreach of Sustainable
Microfinance in Uganda, which facilitates coordination with community development programs and
attempts to provide information and build capabilities at the grassroots in areas that currently lack MFIs,
to create the conditions for extending rural finance. Among donor initiatives to support this process, the
IFAD Rural Financial Services Program has been submitted by the Government to Parliament for
approval.
73.      A positive step in reforming the legal and regulatory environment is the Micro-finance Deposit-
taking Institutions Bill, which has been passedby Parliament. This Bill will enable leading NGO MFIs to
become licensed to take and intermediate savings from the public and encourage new investment in
specializedMFIs. This will permit MFIs to reachwider and deeper by freeing them from dependence on
commercial bank branches and on donor subsidies and by enabling them to offer savings productsthat are
attractive to even poorer clients than those who are creditworthy. The Government has indicated its
intention to enact this law as a means of better integrating commercial microfinance for the poor with the
financial system, without unduly restricting NGOs, community-based organizations, and member-based
savings and credit associations that aim to serve the rural poor and other low-income groups. The Bank
of Uganda has been developing the regulations for application of the new law, in consultation with
microfinance practitioners, and leading MFIs have been making the necessary preparations to comply
with the criteria for licensing with assistance from donors.

                                    D. Agro-processing and Marketing

74.      The long-term competitiveness of Uganda's traditional and non-traditional agricultural exports is
influenced by governmentpolicies. The Governmenthas beeneffective inpromotingboth traditional and
non-traditional agricultural exports. It took both general macroeconomic measures and specific sector
measures to stimulate trade and investment and to increase Uganda's competitive advantages.                It
stimulated foreign investment by passing the Investment Code and by establishing and supporting the
Uganda Investment Authority. Nevertheless, a number of policy-related constraints affect exports.
Different government agencies interpret measures differently, licensing and duty drawback schemes are
time-consuming, the financial sector is still not healthy, export financing is expensive, the legal system is




                                                     137

                                                                                                       Annex 5




weak, and the physical infrastructure remains underdeveloped. Uganda has a bright future in its
agricultural exports, but its success is contingent to the country's political and macroeconomic stability
and mitigation of policy-related constraints. As most Ugandans live in rural areas and earn their living
from agriculture, increasing agricultural growth rates, diversifying agricultural production, and expanding
non-farm employment are essentialfor poverty reduction.
75,      Improving conditions for agro-processing and marketing: The private sector development
element focuses primarily on improving the competitiveness of agricultural crops and addresses issues
which could improve the agro-processing and marketing environment. Emphasis was initially given to
coffee due to its prominencewith the aim of identifying key constraints in its supply chain. Three private
sector analyses were undertaken: (i)a review of the legal and regulatory framework and its impact on
coffee sector competitiveness; (ii)a review of farm-level organizations with the objective of identifying
and characterizing farm level business models to overcome marketing and farm processing constraints;
and (iii)an analysis of key transaction costs to coffee marketing. The latter analysis has since been
extendedto severalother key export crops.
76.      Using these background analyses the Government has prepared a Marketing and Agro-processing
Strategy, providing a framework for addressingmarket access and marketing problems. As called for by
the strategy, a review of the Uganda Coffee Development Authority has been undertaken in an effort to
improve its relevance and effectiveness to the sector ad to clearly delineate public activities from those
which can be undertakenby the private sector. Inaddition, following Cabinet's approval of the principles
of the warehouse receipts system, a Warehouse Receipts Bill has been prepared for submission to
Cabinet. The benefit of such a system include reducing cheating on weights and standards, moderating
seasonal price variability, promoting instruments to mitigate risk and easing access to finance.
Implementation challenges remain and learning from other experiences in Africa and elsewhere will be
critical to ensure success ofthe system.

                             E. NaturalResourceManagement:Land Tenure

77.       With the enactment of the 1998 LandAct, Uganda has embarkedon a significant reform aimed at
solving a wide-range of land tenure issues, which will increase tenure security, promote on-farm
investments, and facilitate land market transactions. The Act provides mechanisms by which landholders
under mailo, freehold and customary tenure can upgrade their tenure. The Act also provides for the
resolution of long-standing issues, such as the historical impasse between landlords and tenants in mailo
regions, gradual formalization of customary rights by communities and individuals, and for a
decentralized system of land administration and conflict resolution.
78.      However, the Government recognizedthat the Act calls for the creation of a large number of new
entities which are financially and institutionally unsustainable. Consequently, implementation of the
Land Act proceeded very slowly after 1998. In 2001, the Government prepared a comprehensive
strategic action plan (the Land Sector Strategic Plan) which calls for a significant reduction inthe number
of land administration entities and prioritizes public investments over a 1O-year period (with detailed
costing for the first three years, inthe context ofthe Medium-Term Expenditure Framework).
79.      The PRSC reform program will support implementation of LSSP inthe following areas:

     0   Institutional capacity building for land administration, particularly at the district level (including
         amendments to the LandAct), inaphasedmanner;
     0   Launching of pilots (systematic demarcation, land adjudication, land adjustments) as a cost-
         effective mechanismto implement the LandAct;

                            F. NaturalResourceManagement:Environment

80.     Environmental Management in Uganda: The importance o f environmental management in
Uganda has beenwell recognized and attention has beenpaid to the issue since the early 1990's when the
Government embarked on the process o f developing the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in
1991. This was followed by the enactment o f the National Environmental Statute (1995) and the Local
Government Act (1997) which provide the framework, at both the national and local level, for sustainable
environmental development in Uganda. Since 1996 the World Bank has been financing a project to
support the implementation o f the NEAP and the associated environmental legislation.
81.     Leadership Role in Environmental Legislation and Regulation: InAfrica, Uganda is seen as a
leader in both the development and implementation o f strong environmental policies, legislation and a
rigorous environmental regulatory framework.            The Government has established the National
Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) as the central coordinating and regulatory body for
environmental management inUganda. A comprehensive regulatory framework has beenestablished and
further work is underway to buildthe capacity for enforcement and compliance at the district and national
level.
82.     Environment and Poverty Eradication: The importance o f sound environmental management is
highlighted in the Government's own strategy for economic transformation, which is spelled out in
PEAPPRSP. The Government has articulated three conditions as pre-requisite for economic growth to
eradicate poverty: (1) structural transformation (agricultural modernization, industrialization, institutional
reform and capacity development); (2) the poor must participate in economic growth by expanding
smallholder agriculture and employment in the industry and services sectors; (3) economic growth must
be sustainable - renewable natural resources must be conserved and not "mined" in the pursuit o f short-
term growth, judicious management o f land, forests, wetlands, rangelands, rivers, lakes and the
environment is essential for sustaining any gains in poverty eradication that are made possible by
pursuingthe above two conditions.
83.     Moving Towards Mainstreaming:            The enabling environmental legislation and government
commitment exist in Uganda for better environmental management. While this provides a strong basis to
work towards full integration o f environment across the board, this can only be achieved through a clearly
articulated and specific strategy for such an effort. NEMA is inthe process o f developing such a strategy
for mainstreaming environment. The strategy must include: high level political commitment including
government financial support for NEMA and other environment related activities; genuine country
ownership; and a comprehensive and integrated approach which addresses issues o f longer-term
environmental sustainability. Specific mainstreaming activities which are already under implementation
include the following:
         Capacity Building in Lead Agencies: There is a serious lack o f capacity inthe sectoral ministries
        and lead agencies to fulfill their sectoral mandate as required by the National Environment Statute
        (1995). To address this deficiency, a program o f capacity building has been developed which
         includes: sensitization and awareness raising in lead agencies in areas o f environmental policy
        and law, poverty-environment indicators, and tools for environmental management and planning;
         training in environmental management, including information collection, analysis and reporting,
         appropriate environmental economic and accounting tools; sectoral EM'S;strategic environment
        assessment; environmental audits, regulations and inspection; enforcement capacity in lead

                                                                                                    Annex 5




         agencies; economic instruments for environmental management; creating partnerships with lead
         agencies.
         ComprehensiveReview of Sectoral Policies: The objective is to assess the extent to which the
         sectoral policies adequately address environmental concerns. NEMA will provide guidance and
         assistance to sectoral ministriesand lead agencies to amend and improve the sectoral policies to
         incorporate the necessary environmental issues.
         Decentralization and Capacity Building of Local Governments and Communities:Capacity at the
         local government and community level for environmental management is also lacking.                A
         program o f capacity building is being implemented to support and enable local governments and
         communities to fulfill their roles in decentralized environmental management. Development o f
         district environment action plans and their integration into district development plans has
         commenced.      The programs aims to empower local communities to use natural resources
         prudently and sustainably intheir efforts to increase their incomes to alleviate poverty, while also
         appropriately addressing environmental degradation problems o f local concern.
84.      Forestry: In 2001, the Government put in place a National Forestry Policy that sets the vision
and guiding principles for development o f the forest sector. To operationalize this policy, the National
Forestry and Tree Planting Act has been enacted. The National Forest Plan has also been finalized and is
in its early stages of implementation. Key activities being implemented include establishment of the
Forestry Inspection Division (FID), a National Forestry Authority (NFA), and District Forestry Services
(DFS). Successful implementation o f the plan will, however, depend on effective integration o f forestry
issues into other government programs, such as P M A and LSSP. Strengthening capacity o f FID, NFA,
and DFS, and inter-sectoral linkages between forestry and other sectors will, therefore, be a priority inthe
medium term.

                                             G. DistrictRoads

85.      The Government's medium-termtransport sector policy aims at promoting efficient and effective
transport services as a means o f providing effective support to increased agricultural and industrial
production, trade, tourism, social and administrative services. This will ensure an efficient transport
sector and will play a critical role in the development o f an integrated and self-sustaining economy. It
will further enhance the Government's strategy for the eradication o f poverty and economic integration o f
the country.
86.      The Government intends to achieve this through the following road sub-sector policies:
             Continued improvement o fthe managerial and operational efficiency o fthe road
             administration;
             Encouragement and promotion o f active private sector participation;
             Involvement o f stakeholders at appropriate levels inthe formulation and management o f road
             projects and policies;
             Encouragement o f the use o f labor-based construction and maintenance methodologies,
             where appropriate; and
             Enhancement o f road safety measures.
87.      Through these policies, the Government will put in place a safe and efficient road network to
meetthe ever-increasingtraffic volumes and loading, and environmental, safety and social challenges.
88.      The Road Network and Mandated Institutions: The country's road network is categorized into
national, district, urban and community access roads. The national roads total 9,600 km, district roads




                                                    140

                                                                                                                          Annex 5




total 24,688 km, and urban roads total 2,800 km, while community access roads are estimated to be
30,000 km. District roads link communities and connect the countryside to major trading centers and the
national road network. Urban roads are all those roads o f varying types within the boundaries o f town
councils. Community access roads are the small link roads providing access to schools, villages, and
community centers and connect to district and national roads.
89.        The Ministry o f Works, Housing and Communications (MoWHC) is directly responsible for
national roads while the district and urban councils are responsible for district and urban roads
respectively. Community access roads are a responsibility o f communities (Local Council 111).
90.        Constraints: The planning o f the road works is constrained by lack o f systematic road inventory
and associated data. Traffic surveys, vehicle operating costs, and socio-economic data needto be updated
and integrated into a comprehensive Management InformationSystem o fthe MoWHC.
91.        Management o f the equipment o f the district units has posed challenges. Diversion of equipment
from sanctioned tasks to unprogrammed work and unofficial private ventures continues to be experienced.
The equipment is underutilized and poorly maintained due to lack o f spare parts, facilities, and staff. The
recently enacted Land Act 1999 also poses severe constraints to acquisition o f gravel deposits and land
for roadreserves.
92.        The Government would like the limited resources available be applied where the investment
guarantees the highest returns. For effective planning and programming, criteria for road prioritization, a
road classification system and associated design standards still need to be developed and widely
disseminated. Appropriate guidelines and manuals to assist the districts in classifying, designing and
prioritizing their road networks have not yet been adopted in order to ensure that all roads receive
appropriate attention.
93.        Action Plan on Institutional Strengthening, Funding, and Execution of Works: Given the
problems and constraints as identified and the strategies to overcome them, the Government will achieve
its objectives through a Plan o f Action that will comprise o f institutional strengthening; mobilization and
efficient utilization o f funds; human resource development; better modalities for execution o f physical
works; and effective planning and programming. Proposed institutional set up to plan and implement the
sector will include establishment o f Technical Implementation Units who will ensure efficient
progradproject implementation and capacity building o f the permanent structures at central Government
and local government level.               It is anticipated that development partners will fund these temporary
structures and their functions while the Government will fund activities o f sustainable nature.
94.        Rehabilitation and Maintenance of District Roads-Estimated                         Costs: The interventions to be
carried out on district roads will include full rehabilitation7, spot improvement, periodic (including repair
and installation o f culverts) maintenance, routine maintenance and emergency works. Some existing
bridges will be rehabilitated and new ones constructed. Rehabilitation, spot improvement and periodic
maintenance will improve roads to a good condition.




'Full   rehabilitation of the roads will cover roadsthat had not been rehabilitated over the last 15 years (since 1986). This activity
i s to be carried out in the first seven years of the program. A total network of 2595 km will receive full rehabilitation in the six
years.

                  PEAPPRSP PILLAR IV: DIRECTLY                    INCREASING THE QUALITY OF LIFE

                                         A. Improving Quality of Education

95.         In late 1996, the President ofUganda launched the UniversalPrimary Education (UPE) program,
providing free access to primary schools for up to four children per family: two boys and two girls.
Orphans were given free access. This had a massive impact on enrollment: children attending school
increased from 3.1 million in 1996 to 6.9 million in 2001 (5.9 million in Government-aided schools) and
the gross enrollment ratio increased from 75 percent to approximately 130 percent8over the same period.
In addition, analysis from the 1999/00 Household Survey indicates that UPE has eliminated the wealth
bias that characterized access to primary education, helped to establish gender equality by increasing
girls' access to primary education and reduced the incidence o f cost-related drop-outs from primary
schools. The net enrollment ratio for the poorest quintile is about 83 percent. National surveys indicate
that UPE is highly appreciated by parents and it remains Government's top priority. However, the quality
o f primary education remains a major area o f concern. In order to support UPE, public spending on
education has increased from 19 percent o f the discretionary recurrent budget in 1995/96 to over 31
percent in 2001/2002 and this share is maintained in the 2003/04-2005/06 MTEF. Primary education
spendingis about two-thirds ofthe total expenditureon education.
96.         Primary School Classrooms: The Ministry o f Education and Sports (MoES) established the
 School Facilities Development Program in 1999, and a national plan for expansion of school facilities
was developed, including targets o f 55:l by 2010 and 75:l by 2005 for the pupil-to-classroom ratio in
 Government-aided schools. One aim o f the program is to target the poorest communities through a
system of ranking applications to ensure that the neediest schools receive help first. The benefits of this
modality are speedy construction, high community involvement, an infusion o f money to local areas, and
the greater likelihood of regular maintenance in the future. Based on experience so far, however, the
available capacity (financial and other) is inadequate to meet the targets. In a bid to reduce pupil:
classroom ratio, the Government undertook an evaluation o f the classroom construction program, which
made recommendations for increased efficiency in the classroom construction program. Under PRSC1
and PRSC2, the Government has reduced the ratio to 98:l (from 121:l in 2000). Efforts to increase
efficiency in classroom construction continued and the ratio decreased further to 94:1by April 2003.


  Both net and gross enrolment rates are subject to the accuracy of the projections based on the last population census. This was
conducted in 1990 and there is reason to mistrust the projections: since 1999 calculations o f net enrolment using school data for
the numerator and the projections for the school-age population for the denominator have resulted in ratios exceeding 100

97.      Primary School Teachers: The enormous expansion in enrolment combined with limited
resourcesforcedallocationsof one teacherto every 80 pupils inthe firsttwo gradeso fprimaryschool and
one teacher to every 55 pupils inthe remainingfive grades. While these ratios are clearly inadequate,the
resources are not currently available for the budget to support the targeted ratio o f 48:l by 2003. In
addition, despite the inadequate establishment,the Governmenthas not managedto fill all the established
positions, and the gaps betweenthe establishment numbers and those in post are largest in ruralhemote
areas. In a bid to reduce pupil-teacher ratios, Government efforts have in the past concentrated on
implementingthe nationalrecruitmentdrive. A nationalcampaignwas launchedand 15,000 newteachers
were recruited by April 2001, includingretirees, secondary school graduates and new graduates from
teacher trainingcolleges, withthe aim of addingover 30,000 new teachers to the payrollby 2003. About
3,000 unqualifiedteachers were inducted, and are being trained and supported through the Teacher
Developmentand Management System(TDMS). A systemto closely monitorestablishedpositionsfilled
was put in place. Basedon this, an actionplan for increasingthe number o f teachers on the payroll, with
particularattention to the districtswith largest establishment gaps is being implementedto ensure that all
districtsachieve at least 95 percento ftheir establishedceilings.
98.      The Government has commenced implementation of Cabinet decisions aimed at attracting
primary school teachers to remote areas , which include utilization of 15 percent of the classroom
constructionbudget for teachers' housesandpayment of a monthly incentive allowance o f20 percento f a
monthly salary to those teaching inhard-to- reachareas. Currently, the pupil-teacherratiois 54:1.
99.      Despite agreement under PRSCl,the Governmenthas not fully implementedthe planto increase
cost efficiency and reduceclass size. This is likelyto have implicationsfor the quality o fprovisioninthe
short-term. Lower ratios may also be unsustainable in the medium-termas the Government attempts to
provide greater resources for post-primary and tertiary education. Given the higher than expected
increase inthe levelof enrollment, this ratio is projectedto remainthe same in2003 and 52:1 in 2004. A
tracking study on primary teachers' recruitment, deployment and payroll management has been
undertakenandareas that require improvementhavebeenidentified.
100.     Instructional Materials: The introduction of an expanded new curriculum, including eleven
subjects, invalidatedthe textbooks inclassrooms andthe current pupil-to-textbookratio is n/a for the new
subjects. New textbooks are being published for the new curriculum. The procurement arrangements
were reviewed and the new arrangements have resulted in an improvement in the quality o f learning
materials while, at the same, time reducing the unit cost by over two-thirds. Book orders for the new
curriculum are being placed. The pupi1:book ratio in P3-4 is currently 3:l for the core subjects and is
projectedto be 3:l also in P5-7 by April 2004. Non-textbookmaterials have beenprocuredfor P1-2 and
a baselinestudy undertakenagainstwhichthe impact o f these materialswill be measured.
101.     Post-primary education: The Government is determinedto support secondary education so that
the gains from UPE can be sustained. In2000, 515,687 students (about 15 percent ofthe age range) were
enrolled in secondary schools. Of these, about 23 percent were enrolled in private schools. There is a
parallel technical and vocational system that consists of three years of technical and farm schools, but
enrollment in these schools is negligible (about 8,000 in 2000). A 1995 study found that parents on
average pay USh 80,000 (about US$50) annually for one child's secondary education. Consequently,
secondary education provision is elitist in Uganda. Regional, gender, and income-basedinequities are
evident everywhere in the system. The top income quintile group is occupying 63 percent o f all
secondary places. Inadditionto participation, the inequityis manifest inthe type o f school attended, with
the rich attending elite boarding schools and the poor resorting to low quality, poorly resourced
community schools, when they can affordthem. In addition, there are concerns about the relevance and

quality o f secondary education delivered: secondary education tends to be theoretical with little practical
application o f knowledge and skills.
102.      The Government plans a massive expansion o f post-primary education, doubling the transition
rate. The Government has identified options for delivery o f post-primary education based on analytic
work supported by the Bank and other donors and extensive and extensive consultations. The results o f
these studies and a major stakeholder consultation exercise contributed to the strategic framework for post
primary education which was discussed and endorsed by the education sector review in October 2002.
The strategy focuses among other things on provision of greater opportunities for assessingpost primary
education especially for the underprivilegedand girls, improvement o f quality and relevance, scaling up
the sector response to HIV/AIDS, establishment of a qualifications framework, piloting the community
polytechnics concept, reform o f teacher education to include school-based practice and enforcement o f
minimumstandards, and construction and equipmentof laboratories.
103.      Tertiary Education: Government-supported tertiary education in Uganda comprises four
Government universities, ten National Teacher Colleges, colleges o f commerce and technology, and a
range o f agricultural, health and other training institutions. The Commission for Higher Education within
the MOES has responsibility for oversight of all tertiary institutions. (Until 1999, these other tertiary
institutions were managed by a range o f other ministries.) Access is very limited at two percent o f the age
range and skewed towards the rich. The Government has encouraged the establishment o f 11 private
universitiesand allowedthe Makerere university to enroll fee-paying students: in2000 Makerere enrolled
more than 20,000 students, o f which about 6,000 were supported by the Government: the remainder were
fee-paying students.
104.      The Government has undertaken to double the number o f sponsored students in Makerere from
2001 and has plans to establish two new universities, one in the North and one open university. In
addition, the Government has removed cost-sharing whereby tertiary institutions were allowed to charge a
fee to all students. From 2001, Government-sponsored students have not paid any fee, while private
students pay the full cost o f their education. There are no current plans to screen Government-sponsored
students for courses or for ability to pay.
105.      The Bank and other funding agencies have been assisting Government to develop a strategic plan
for the sub-sector through support for a series o f studies, including: (a) Management and Financing o f
Tertiary Education, (b) Macro Study o f Positioning Uganda Tertiary Education in an International
Context, (c) Micro Study o f Coverage, Equity, and Efficiency The results o f these studies, together with
the outcomes o f a stakeholder consultation shaped the draft strategic plan for tertiary education that was
presented to the ninth Education Sector Review in May 2003. A National Council for Higher Education
has also beenestablished to play an oversight role.
106.     Decentralized provision of education: Res onsibility for delivery o f primary and secondary
education has been decentralized to the district level. District Service Commissions are responsible for
                                                          4)
teacher recruitment while District Education Officers are responsible, in conjunction with communities,
for the delivery o f primary and secondary education.           MoES' role has shifted to become one o f
policymaking, investment management and quality assurance. About 72 percent o f all government
resources for education are providedthrough the districts (the bulk o f this through PAF). Schools receive
finances directly through a "conditional" grant transferred from central Government to districts but
earmarked for schools. The size o f the grant is determined by the number o f children in the first three
grades and the number o f children inthe next four grades. This devolution o f responsibility for primary
education to district level has a number o f consequences. Lack o f clarity over roles and responsibilities

  Currently, there are 56 DistrictsinUganda.

confuses management and accountability responsibilities. Capacity to plan and account for expenditure is
low, especially at the school level. A district capacity building program in the education sector is helping
to address these concerns.
107.     FinancialManagement: Financial tracking surveys carried out in2000 and 2001 showed that 90
percent o f the amount allocated by MoFPEDreachedthe schools as intended, up from 20 percent in 1995.
While the later studies noted significant improvements, there were also problems o f delays in the
allocations reaching schools and significant problems o f appropriate utilization and record-keeping at the
school level. Plans to improve the regular audits, which started in 1999, to fit within the Government
statutory requirements will continue, and will be complemented with regular financial tracking studies.
Based on the recommendations o f a study to determine the allocation formula for primary school
capitation grants, the allocation will now be more dynamic and determined on the basis o f enrolment,
gender, number of disabled, location on the ruralhrban axis and the cost o f living axis.                The
decentralization budgeting pilot, covering four districts, has the potential to consolidate ownership o f
education development strategy within districts and provide well performing districts with more
discretion on use o f conditional grants. The pilot has revealed strengths with decentralized budgeting,
which among others include: more realistic and lower unit costs for classroom construction; allowing
schools to focus on their individual priorities; and enabling districts to respond to local needs. The results
o f the pilot were discussed duringthe April 2002 Education Sector Review. The plan to expand the pilot
to cover seven additional districts in2003/04 was endorsed by the education sector review inMay 2003.
108.     Financing of Education: The Government is committed to supporting the education of its
citizens and is providing over 30 percent o f its discretionary recurrent budget for this purpose over the
next three years. In order to maintain the benefits o f UPE, the Government is committed to providing
two-thirds o f its resources for primary education. The remaining one-third is to be shared between post-
primary (19.6 percent in 2002/03), tertiary (10.2 percent in 2002/03) and other, including administration
o f education (3.7 percent in 2002/03)   .   However, the decision to double the number of Government-
sponsored students in Makerere will drive the share o f tertiary up to 15 percent o f budget within 3 years
and the costs o f supporting the two new universities can be expected to drive up costs even more beyond
2004/05.     In addition, the Government plans to expand secondary education, including establishing
community polytechnics and community secondary schools, will demand increased financing for this sub-
sector. Despite the Government's commitment to primary education, it is likely that there will be very
strong pressures on this allocation. Giventhese pressures, it will be vital for maintenance o f the quality
of primary education that experiments with cost efficient provision are undertaken. Actions, including
stakeholder workshops, to move this forward are underway, with implementation scheduled to start with
urban areas where class sizes are largest.
109.     Monitoring and Evaluation:        A system to measure pupils learning achievement-         National
Assessment o f Progress in Education-has       been developed and administered standardized tests in four
subjects to a representative sample o f children in 1996 and 1999. A repeat o f the above national
assessmenttests will be undertaken during2003, Further indications o f low quality are the highrepetition
(estimated to be about eight percent in P1 and 11 percent in P2) and dropout rates. A framework for
regular monitoring o f quality is being developed and indicators for monitoring learning achievement have
beenagreed. Targets for these indicators will be set duringthe October 2003 education sector review.
110.     The Government will also continue to monitor the share o f appropriate age range o f girls and
boys in P7 nationally and by district. A policy framework to assure equitable access has also been
agreed, and most activities in the policy and costed framework were incorporated in the planning and
budgeting cycle by October 2002.         To facilitate monitoring o f sector performance, the Education
Management Information System will increasingly incorporate private schools, capture an increasing

proportion of secondary schools and post-primary education and training institutions, as well as
complementary primary education centers. Data collection instruments were also reviewed to reduce
inconsistencies in interpretation of statistical data, simplify, and strengthen school demography capture.
Results o f these reviews have been incorporated in the 2003 education census. Measures for further
improvement to assure accuracy and reliability are beingpursued.
111.      The semiannual education sector reviews (ESRs) which involve all major stakeholders (external
financing agencies, districts, parliamentarians, NGOs and other partners to education) remain the main
forum for discussing sector issues, determining modes o f dealing with these issues, settingtargets for the
sector and monitoring sector progress towards meetingthese targets. The reviews also establish the basis
on which funding agencies release budget support to the sector. Accordingly, ESRs will be continue to
be the forum for presenting and discussing the specific PRSC indicators and associated targets. These
indicators and targets are jointly agreed and are monitoredat ESR. The indicators to be monitoredfor the
PRSC cover financial commitment, public expenditure management, quality enhancement, outcome and
process indicators. These indicators are described in further detail in the Annex: the precise targets for
each year are established at ESR o f the previous year. In addition to achieving these targets, satisfactory
progress o f the ESR process itself is a necessary condition for release o f PRSC funds to education.

112.      Despite economic growth and reduction in income poverty in the 1990s, health status o f
Ugandans has not achieved similar improvement as indicated by the UDHS data (Table 3). Infant, child
and maternal mortalities are still very high. The leading causes o f morbidity and mortality are attributed
to preventable, largely communicable diseases, with women and children bearing a disproportionate
amount o fthe burdeno f illhealth.

113.      Though there has been steady progress in reducing HIV prevalence, from 18 percent inthe early
1990s to 6.5 percent in 2002, the AIDS epidemic has had a devastating effect on health status and on the
overall social and economic development o f the country. The 2002 HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report June
2001, estimates that there are 1.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS, over 800,000 people have since
died from the epidemic and 1.1 million children have been orphaned. Earlier gains in improving key
health indicators have beenreversed. There has been a resurgence o f diseases such as tuberculosis and an
increase in opportunistic infections accompanying AIDS. Health services have been overwhelmed with
AIDS patients taking up to 70 percent o f hospital beds in some health facilities. The effects o f the

epidemic are far reaching: loss o f household heads and main income earners; young childrenforced out o f
school and into early labor; and depletion o f the human capital resultinginloss o f professional and skilled
workers. All this has had a negative impact on productivity.
114.     Despite efforts to improve health services, there are still large segments o f the population,
especially in the rural areas, with limited access to health care services. There are also marked variations
in access both within and between districts and regions. Furthermore, many people do not seek modern
health care services when they are ill. While there has been a major expansion o f the number o f health
facilities, many o f them are underutilized for a number o f reasons. Many facilities, especially those
closest to the communities, do not provide the full range o f essential primary health services, such as
maternity services and immunization.                For example, only 38 percent o f children have been fully
immunized before their first birthday". The quality o f services has been shown to be the main reason for
low utilization.'* One o f the key problems is the inadequate number o f trained health staff especially in
public health facilities. In 1999, only 33 percent o f established positions inpublic facilities were filled by
qualified staff, with 54 percent o f these concentrated in hospitals or the non-primary health care sub-
sector. The remaining posts were either vacant or as was the case in more than 60 percent o f peripheral
units, filled with untrained staff, mostly nursing aides.13 Effort has been made in past two years to
increase qualified staff in government and private no-for-profit health units. However, only 47 percent o f
established posts are staffed by qualified health workers,            In addition, most o f the staff are poorly
motivated due to delays in salary payments.
115.     Working conditions in many o f these facilities are inadequate, with little maintenance o f
buildings and shortage o f basic equipment. Non-availability o f drugs common to public health facilities
is often quoted as the single most important reason for low utilization o f health facilities. The public
health system has been characterized by weaknesses in the following: projection o f requirements for
drugs; procurement and logistics systems for receiving, storing drugs at the central level and delivering
them to district; controls and supervision at the point o f use; and, poor prescribing practices. Financial
management is another area that also hampers service delivery. Delays in flow o f funds from central
levels to health facilities caused delays in carrying out planned activities. Districts' capacity for financial
management is also weak. There have been problems in disbursing, accounting and auditing o f funds,
particularly for the primary health care conditional grant (the main channel for funds for district health
activities).
116.     Nongovernmental organizations, especially those that are faith-based private not-for profit health
(PNFP) facilities, play a critical role in health service provision in Uganda, where they provide more than
50 percent o f health services. Surveys repeatedly indicate that NGO services are considered to offer
better quality services than the public sector. For this reason, people have been willing to pay for NGO
services. In recognizing and supporting the important role that PNFP facilities have been playing in
health service provision, the Government has been providing subsidies to these units. Recently, the
subsidies have increased from 15 percent o ftheir recurrent budget in 1999/2000 to 25 percent in 2001/02.
117.     Health Sector Reform:. The National Health Policy (NHP) is the health sector's framework for
implementingPEAPPRSP goals. It provides the country's vision for addressing the health sector issues
outlined above. Specifically, NHP aims to develop an effective, efficient, responsive and accountable
national health care system that would lead to increased access, usage and satisfaction with the health
services. NHP is elaborated in the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP). HSSP outlines strategies for

addressing key policy and operational issues including the health care delivery system; the legal and
regulatory framework; the integrated support systems (human resources, quality assurance, information
management system, procurement and drugs, equipment, supplies and logistics, and health care
financing); the policy, planning and information management systems; and research and development.
HSSP provides an overall framework for costs and financing service provision. The plan covers the costs
o f deliveringthe minimumhealth care package; the referral hospitals and M o H headquarters; and health
councils and autonomous bodies.          Financing sources include the Government, donors, NGOs and
households. The current HSSP covers the five-year periodfrom 2000/01 to 2004/05.
118.     Implementing HSSP: The implementation o f HSSP started in 2000/01 under a sector-wide
approach (SWAP). SWAP as an instrument enables the Government to maintain leadership o f the sector;
rationalizes external investments to the sector, reduces transaction costs for the Government in dealing
with the donor community; increases predictability o f external resource flows over a medium-term
planning framework; and strengthens local service delivery systems. So far implementation shows that
coordination between the Government and development partners is strong and improving.

                 Join
Report and confirmed that the progress against undertakings agreed at the 7* JRM in October 2002 was
satisfactory. The JRM commended the efforts o f intersectoral collaboration in addressing the stagnating
Infant Mortality Rate and Maternal Mortality Ratio in Uganda and called for concerted effort to the
speedy reduction o f Maternal and Infant Mortality through more focussed action countrywide. There are
demonstrable improvements in sector outputs over the first two and a halfyears o f HSSP implementation.

120.     Key issues o f concernthat emerged included the continued under-funding to the health sector. At
this level offunding, the contributionofHSSPto PEAP and Millennium Development Goals (MDG)may
not be realized. Constraints were also observed management o f drugs, human resources and functionality
o f health centers. Aligning the other funding mechanisms such as Global Initiatives and projects to
address the sect or un-fundedpriorities is still a challenge.
121.     Delivery of the minimum health care package: Under HSSP, a package includes minimum
preventive and curative services that address key diseases that contribute to the disease burden was
defined.   The package consists o f selected cost-effective interventions that present the best value for
money, given the limited resources available.        It addresses twelve priority programs: (i)control of
communicable diseases including malaria, sexually transmitted diseases, HTV/AIDS, and tuberculosis; (ii)
integrated management of childhood illnesses; (iii)sexual and reproductive health and rights; (iv)
immunization; (v) environmental health; (vi) health education and promotion; (vii) school health; (viii)
epidemics and disaster preparedness and response; (ix) nutrition; (x) diseases targeted for eradication; (xi)
mental health; and, (xii) essential clinical care. The choice to strategically focus resources on selected
interventions in each o f the priority areas is in contrast with the past when resources were spread too

thinly across too many interventions resulting in very little impact. Emphasis is given to information,
education and communication (IEC) programs to improve personal health practices and promote health-
seeking behavior especially among the poor. The goal is to ensure the provision o f the minimumpackage
to all. The Government intends to continue increasing its support to the private not-for profit facilities
(PNFP) to increase the provision o f services under the minimumhealth care packages; and to strengthen
supervision o f the district and lower level facilities.
122.     Health infrastructure: The Government's strategy is to enhance utilization o f existing capacity
through rehabilitation and limiting construction o f new health facilities based on the population and
rational use o f resources. In the next two and half years government's priority will be to improve the
functionality o f health centers.
123.     Human resources: Actions to address the acute shortage o f human resources are underway and
include training o f all nursing assistants to enhance the quality o f health workers at the front line,
operationalization o f the in-service training strategy to coordinate and rationalize in service training
which is currently fragmented and on going recruitment o f qualified staff to achieve minimum staffing
norms in the facilities. Other priority actions include: pay reform for health workers; increasing skills o f
nurses through the introduction o f the comprehensive enrolled nurses training program; and reaching
agreement between M o H and MoES on management and support to health training schools, including
those o f NGOs or PNFP organizations. The 8* JRM reiterated the need to enhance measures to address
human resource for health problems.
124.     Drug and medical supplies: The Government's strategy is to enhance M o H procurement
capacity with the aim o f ensuringthat on average 80 percent o f health facilities have adequate stocks o f
needed drugs and vaccines. Inthis regard, the M o H has already undertakena number o f procurement and
logistics arrangements which include; appointment o f a contracts committee and establishment o f an
interim procurement unit; and development o f integrated annual procurement plans encompassing
procurements by the Government and donor/project funds. BeginningJanuary 2003 the essential drug kit
system based on a "push" mechanism was replaced by delivery system based on a "pull" mechanism.
Besides, a drug fund with district credit lines has been established to improve cash flow problem.
125.     Financing Health Care: The Government seeks to enhance and rationalize financing to the
sector. M o H recently completed a health care financing strategy that includes a strategy and action plan
for public financing o f health care services by the NGO sector. Under SWAP approach, donor funding is
increasingly being channeled through the Government budget. The implementation o f HSSP is financed
by funds from government and donors including the funds from PRSCs.                   This increasingly gives
government the flexibility neededto manage resources effectively.
126.     The annual total per capita expenditure on health is estimated at US$12. A significant proportion
of this is financed by donors (43%). At the household level, expenditures on health per household differ
significantly between the non-poor and the poor. For example, in 1995/96, the lowest income quartile
spent US$4.85 per capita, while the highestincome quartile spent US$15.37 per capita. The Government
abolished user fees inpublic health facilities inMarch 2001, which led a surge inthe use o f public health
services. However, its longterm impact on utilization and services provision is yet to be seen. Since user
fees financed a significant share o f activities at the facility level, their abolishment may have an adverse
impact on the quality o f health services. To mitigate some o f negative impact, the Government has
increased allocation o f resources to the health sector: the health share o f the total government budget
increased from 7.3 percent in 2000/2001 to 8.6 percent in 2001/2002. Under the implementation o f
HSSP, the Government and donors are closely monitoring the impact o f the abolishment o f user fees.
process and its execution.

127.    Special attention to HIWAIDS: Uganda's response to the epidemic has been characterized by
high level political commitment, openness and partnership between the Government, NGOs, and
communities, and has resultedin a decline in HIV prevalence from 18.5 percent in the early 1990s to 6.5
percent in 2002. However, despite the achievements, there is still need for a sustained effort to fight the
epidemic. The Government has adopted a multisectoral national strategic framework for HIV/AIDS
covering the period 2001-2006. HSSP outlines the health sector role o f providing (i)prevention services
(IEC; condom use; treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, voluntary counseling and testing, reducing
mother-to-child transmission); (ii)        care (treatment o f tuberculosis and opportunistic infections); and (iii)
technical guidance on home-based care and strengthening links between health facilities and the
communities for continuum o f care.

                     C. ImprovingAccess to and EquityinWater Supplyand Sanitation

128.    About 85 percent o f Uganda's population o f 24.3 million live in rural areas, and these are
currently served by about 45,000 water point sources and small rural pipedsystems. The Government has
devolved most responsibilities for the provision o f water and sanitation (WSS) services in rural areas to
the district level. The Directorate o f Water Development (DWD), which is a central authority under the
Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment (MoWLE) and responsible for rural WSS provision prior to
devolution, retains the responsibility for policy formulation, water resource development and regulation.
In urban WSS, 78 urban local authorities and district capitals (representing 11.5 percent of the total
population) are responsible for WSS operations, except in 15 large towns where an autonomous
parastatal-the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC)--provides the services.
129.    Historically, the sector is characterized by limited and unequal access to safe water and public
sanitation services in both urban and rural areas; poorly functioning decentralized sector planning and
management capacity; and ineffective utilization and non-sustainability o f services owing to poor
maintenance culture. Inrural WSS, over 30 percent o f systems were nonfunctional. Inurban WSS, there
was a high degree o f inefficiency in the operations, and lack o f an adequate regulatory framework and
incentives for commercial operations. In 1999, NWSC suffered from high unaccounted for water (45
percent), high staffing levels (24 staff per 1,000 connections) and high accounts receivable (8 months
sales). Development in the sector was fragmented and depended heavily on donor financing for capital
expenditures, while operation and maintenance expenditures inrural areas and small towns came mainly
from the central Government budget. Water supply coverage was estimated at about 52 percent for both
rural and urban water supply and about 50 percent for sanitation (mostly based on pit latrines). Sewerage
coverage o f around five percent was limitedto a few municipalities including Kampala.
130.    Sector-wide Approach to Planning (SWAP): In order to address the deteriorated situation and
the fragmented development o f the sector, the Government has moved to a programmatic support
framework through Sector-wide Approach to Planning (SWAP). PRSC forms a major vehicle for the
formulation and implementation o f SWAP. The WSS agreements and benchmarks in PRSC are geared
towards achieving this end.
131.    The SWAP framework for the WSS sector is consistent with the National Water Policy (1999).14
The development objectives are to increase access, reliability, affordability and sustainability o f the
provision o f WSS services. Sub-sector strategies have been formulated and are being implemented for
rural and rural growth centers, as well as for the urban and secondary urban centers covering piped
systems. In rural WSS, the underpinning approaches are (i)community-driven demand and extension
management, (ii)planning and management at the district level, (iii)facilitation by the central

Government, and (iv) private sector involvement. In urban WSS, the underpinning approaches are to (i)
achieve efficiency and commercialized operations through the participation o f the private sector in service
delivery, (ii)manage the public sector through professional personnel, and (iii)regulate using an
independent regulation system. In order to make this happen, coordination o f technical assistance,
especially to the district level WSS institutions and public sector asset managers will be very important.
To facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation o f SWAP, a sector-wide management
information system protocol will be needed.
132.     SWAP framework was fully endorsed by the Government and donors during the first annual
Government-donor review meetingo f the sector in September 2001. Further progress was achieved at the
second annual joint review held in September 2002. An annual technical joint technical review was
commenced in March 2003 and is expected to further solidify the coordinated approach and create a
continuous forum for the Government and donors to discuss and coordinate WSS issues.                    PRSC
benchmarks have been made consistent withjoint undertakings reached duringthese reviews.
133,     Rural WSS:     The strategy in this sub-sector centers around demand-driven planning where
communities will determine their requirements, and subsequently be responsible for sustainable operation
and maintenance o f systems. Management o f implementation (that is, promotion, sub-project planning
support, procurement and front-line accountability) will be carried out at the district level. Districts will
access funding on the basis o f agreed work plans through conditional grants available directly from the
budget allocation to the sector. Districts will utilize the private sector in upstream project activities (that
is, obtain consultants for design o f small-piped systems, drilling, spring protection, public latrine
construction, hand-pump and piping supply and installation, etc). While communities will be responsible
for the management o f WSS systems (through either water and sanitation committees for point sources or
water user associations for small, rural-piped schemes), they will engage the private sector for
maintenance and after-sales services to ensure continued system functionality.           District Water and
Sanitation Teams (DWSTs) have been formed within each district's establishment to facilitate these
activities. Many districts have demonstrated their ability to carry out basic planning and construction o f
WSS infrastructure-over      8,000 water points have been delivered under PRSC1-3, improving coverage
for about 1.7 million rural people. Under PRSC3 the safe water coverage further increased. Annual
PRSC targets set for construction o f water points have beenlargely met, demonstrating districts' ability to
carry out basic planning and construction. Rural safe water coverage has risen to about 55 percent.
134.     Much still needs to be done to develop local appraisal, implementation and operation capacities,
and local quality control and construction supervision capacities. Reorganization o f DWD to align its
structure with its new role as a supporter o f districts, was formally approved and has commenced under
PRSC3. D W D has created Technical Support Units (TSUs) that provide capacity building and technical
assistance support to districts. DWD will also provide monitoring and evaluation support as well as some
higher-levelappraisal support. DWD has developed standardized operational guidelines for accessing the
conditional grants to guide the training and capacity building o f personnel from the communities, sub-
counties and districts. D W D has also carried out an O&M and private sector participation study and
developing environmental screening templates.
135.     Urban WSS: Private Sector Participation forms the core o f the Government's Urban WSS
strategy. In the smaller towns with piped systems, the ownership o f assets will remain in the public
sector. However, management and fiscal autonomy will be achieved through the creation o f autonomous
WSS authorities to manage these systems. WSS authorities will be staffed by professional WSS system
managers and operated along a `miniutility' principle. They will be tasked with managing systems using
commercial and cost recovery principles, and will contract the operations o f the systems to private
operators, promoting efficient pricing, and technical and commercial operations through transparent and




                                                     151

                                                                                                   Annex 5




competitive contracting processes. This will be done through the use o f management contracts. Several
WSS authorities may package their systems to be privately operated to achieve enhanced efficiency and
economies o f scale where feasible and practical. The current conditional grant allocation has earmarked a
small amount o f financial resources for the use o f WSS authorities with old systems to jump start their
rehabilitation, and introduction o f commercial operation and cost recovery.
136.     The Government has commenced preparing a long-term management strategy for small towns.
As o f PRSC3, the Government had gazetted 56 urban WSS authorities. Currently about half o f these
have private operators on-site fully managing the systems. As investments for new towns are prepared,
M o W L E D W D will continue to gazette urban WSS authorities and initiate the procurement o f
management contractors for these towns. To ensure financially sustainable operations and the success o f
the private sector strategy, it is critical to cluster the towns into financially viable and geographically
sensible blocks.    DWD's TSUs and Local Authorities Unit plays a critical role in evaluating and
clustering o f towns. This is done in full consultation with the WSS authorities, although the clustering o f
towns in financially unviable ways is strongly discouraged. While clustering is critical, individual WSS
authorities will retain individual control o f their WSS systems as they will execute individual contracts
with the appointed management contractor.
137.     In larger and more viable towns-especially those already under NWSC-the            Government is
currently pursuing a lease arrangement for the operations o f WSS services where an asset holding
authority will replace NWSC to hold the asset in public hands and administer the lease contract. In the
meantime, the use o f a performance contract between the Government and NWSC has resulted in
extensive operational improvements.          Many operational and financial indicators o f NWSC are
approaching efficient levels comparedto other well-functioning utilities.
138.     Oversight and Monitoring: The Government (MoFPED and MoWLE) has established a Steering
Committee to coordinate and provide overall guidance to the WSS sector. The committee will guide the
creation o f other relevant task forces to spearhead the rural and urban WSS reform agenda including the
implementation arrangements for the sector strategic plan. M O W L E has carried out the first technical
audit (value for money) and a tracking study inNovember 2002 and March 2003, respectively, to provide
monitoring o f sector programs. MoWLE will establish a monitoring protocol that draws on the routine
returns from districts, the household, service delivery, and other surveys.

annual Poverty ReductionSupport Credit (PRSC3) for Uganda. This EA discussionbuilds upon
the previousEA for PRSC2, andconsideringthat PRSCsare sequential annualcredits, repeatsthe
previous impact and mitigation considerations, adding more details regarding resettlement and

summarizes impact and mitigation measures. Section I11 presents the key environmental,
resettlement, pesticide and other policy issues along with relevant mitigative measures and
monitoringneeds. Section IV discusses institution capacity building for issues o f environment
and involuntary resettlement in Uganda. Finally, Section V proposes indicative plans for
monitoringandsupervision.

                                  I.CREDITBACKGROUND

2.      PRSC3 Goals, Objectives and Structures. PRSC3 will support the implementation of
Uganda'spoverty reductionstrategy as spelledout inthe Poverty EradicationAction Plan(PEAP)
and summarized in the Uganda's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The overarching
goal of PEAP policies and resource allocations is to reduce the incidence of poverty in Uganda
(based on the headcount index) from 44 percent in 1997to 10 percent or less by the year 2017.
PEAP also sets forth the specific goals o f achieving universal access to primary education,
primary health care, safe drinking water, rural development, guaranteeing politicalfreedom and
human rights, and establishing an effective disaster relief system targeted at the poor.
Government's strategy for poverty eradicationis basedonfour pillars:

       I. Aframeworkforeconomicgrowthandtransformation;
       11.    Ensuringgoodgovernanceand security;
       111.   Directlyincreasingthe abilityofthe poorto raisetheir incomes;
       IV.    Directlyincreasingthe qualityof life ofthe poor.
PRSC3will continue supportinga set o freformsundereachpillar.

3.      PRSC3 Objective and Activities. The specific objective o f PRSC3 is to improve public
service delivery, given that poor public service performance is one o f the key constraints to
economic development andpoverty reduction. Inparticular, PRSC3 will continue supportingthe
reformprogram adoptedunder PRSCl and PRSC2, further developingit and deepeningthe rural
agenda, specifically the agro-processing and marketing component. The reform program
supports activities that raise the quality of life and incomes of the poor; specifically, improve
access to and quality of education, health, water and sanitation services, and improve rural
services. Since improvingthe delivery of these services requires a more broad-basedaction than
only addressingsector-specific constraints to their delivery, the reformprogram focuses heavily
on cross-cutting governance issues (such as public procurement, financial management, anti-
corruption, andmonitoringandevaluation) andpublicexpendituremanagement.

4.      Because of their significant focus on sectoral policies and institutions, PRSCl and
PRSC2 were classified for environmental purposes as a B, with the requirement that

environmental analysis (but no separate environmental assessment report) be incorporated in
credit documentation. PRSCl was approved by the Bank's Board in May 2001, PRSC2 in July
2002, and the ProgramDocumentswith all the annexes were disclosedto the public thereafter.

5.      PRSC3 will support activities inthe following areas:

11.03, on the Management o f Cultural Property in Bank-financed Projects, OP 4.04, Natural
Habitats, OP 4.36, Forestry, and O D 4.20, Indigenous People, may also be applicable to specific
interventions undertaken by the Government usingPRSC3 funding. In accordance with OP 4.01,
the credit was categorized as a B without a separate Environmental Assessment (EA), and is so
documented in the Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet. In accordance with the Bank's revised
disclosure policy, this environment and resettlement Annex has been disclosed through the World
Bank Headquarters Infoshop, and inUganda with the World Bank Kampala office InfoShop and
to NEMA for distribution to the Districts.

7.      Potential Environmental and Resettlement Impacts of PRSC3. Overall, the activities
supported by PRSC3 are not expected to result in major adverse, or irreversible, environmental
impacts. Biophysical environmental impacts, although thought to be modest given the nature o f
the activities, can be foreseen at this time only in a generic manner. The potential for land
acquisition, resettlement, and effects on cultural resources also cannot be ruled out, but such
effects are likely to be limited in extent given the de-emphasis on large-scale construction in the
PEAP approach and the nature o f IDA support to it. The environmental impacts o f activities in
agriculture, education, health and water and sanitation are expected to be sufficiently addressed
by appropriate Ugandan institutions and implementing agencies. Potential conflict over land use,
land tenure, and common property may arise in some o f these sectors. IDA currently has a strong
presence in the above sectors and will continue to work with counterparts to ensure that
appropriate mitigative measures are promoted and incorporated into credit activities. Table 1
shows the investment projects that complement PRSC3 in the areas o f environment, roads,
agriculture, health, and water and sanitation and their development objectives in Uganda. As
relevant, each o f these investment projects fully incorporates Bank safeguards issues,
management plans and the monitoring o f environmental and social performance indicators.

                           AND MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

SectoralImpactAnalysis

8.       Rural Development. Potential adverse impacts o f the activities under the Plan for the
Modernization of Agriculture (PMA) includeenvironmental and natural resourcedegradation due



                                               156

                                                                                                        Annex 6


to intensification o f small-holder agriculture; expansion o f large-scale agriculture (cash crops);
increased use o f agro-chemicals, and development o f rural roads to support agricultural
marketing. Such impacts needto be anticipated and managed appropriately. Several agencies are
responsible for environmental management in Uganda. Ministry o f Water, Lands, and
Environment (MOWLE) and Ministry o f Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF)
are responsible for management o f sustainable natural resources development. National Bureau
o f Standard (NBS), National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO),                         and National
Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) are responsible for mitigating impacts from agro-
chemicals (including pesticides) through improvement o f agricultural technology, research, and
training. The Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) is developing capacity to screen activities
and prepare environmental assessments and environmental management, and resettlement
frameworks and plans for its own projects, including district roads. The National Environmental
Management Authority (NEMA) coordinates intersectoral review o f environmental impact
assessments for projects that will significantly affect the environment, and reviews the work o f
the sectoral environmental units that it is helpingto launch.

9.       Education Sector. Construction o f school building and sanitary facilities is not expected
to cause significant adverse impacts. Most impacts are local and can be easily mitigated. The
Government o f Uganda mandates that measures o f the Public Health Act be applied to
construction o f school buildings and other public works. The Bank needs to ensure that the
Government's standard requirement for school construction meet the Bank's requirements and
policies.

10.      Health Sector. Concerns include construction activities as well as overall health care
waste (HCW) management. Environmental risks are associated with hazardous medical waste
materials, including possible infection from HIV/AIDS through used needles and blood waste;
building health clinics and hospitals; construction o f water supply and sanitation facilities.' The
Ministry o f Health (MoH) has identifiedthe Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) to address the
handling, storage and disposal o f health care waste (HCW) at all levels o f the national health care
delivery system. This includes development o f a management strategy, guidance, and human
resources development.2 Such measures address various sanitation and waste issues, including the
handling, storing and disposing hazardous medical wastes.

11.      Water and Sanitation Sector. In the water and sanitation sector, the focus of the PRSC
operation is to promote systematic reforms inthe sector in order to ensure sustained access to safe
drinking water and sanitation services and in particular, expand services to those who currently
do not have or cannot afford such services. Under PRSC1, strategies were implementedto initiate
nation-wide decentralized planning and management system that enhances community
participation in choosing water and sanitation services as well as increases commitment to
operation and maintenance o f the service. Through M oWLE, environmental checklists for both
design and operation o f systems have been developed and incorporated into the Planning and
Operational Guidelines for District WSS Conditional Grants. This includes a section covering
environmental screening criteria for subproject appraisal and environmental requirements for
contractors. It is also standard practice in Uganda for EIAs to be conducted for all investments
and development projects (including but not limited to donor-supported projects) using guidelines
developed at the sectoral level by the lead agency involved (MoWLE inthis case) and NEMA (in

this and other sectors).     These guidelines and the environmental screening checklists were
developed in Uganda to be directly compatible with World Bank environmental standards.
Measures for protection o f water sources will also be refined. The reorganized Directorate o f
Water Development (DWD) in MoWLE will engage trained staff and experienced consultants to
implement these measures under PRSC3 and carry out annual environmental audits to ensure
compliance by local governments. Expanded stakeholder consultation will also be provided
through further training o f staff.

Mitigation Measures

12.      Rural Development-Land Tenure. The process o f systematic land demarcation provides
an opportunity for any land tenantloccupant to go through a formalized process o f having land
"certified" and then if desired "titled".  In general, a land owner can come to agreement on a
settlement where the occupants can purchase the land, with money coming from the Land Fund.
N o resettlement cases are expected in the coming year, but as the implementation o f systematic
demarcation proceeds further, cases where resettlement is seen to be the way to resolve disputes
may arise. The Prime Minister'sOffice will continue the development o f national standards for
this and other type of involuntary resettlement. Like the Bank, the Government is committed to
ensuringthat processes o f involuntary land acquisition leave those affected no worse offthanthey
would otherwise have been. The Bank will continue to explore options to support the intended
updatingo f the background and policy work carried out in 1995, usingthe presence o f the Bank's
landtenure specialist who currently is based inthe Kampalacountry office.

13,      Rural Development-Agriculture. Potential adverse impacts associated with the P M A
implementation will be mitigated through the National Agriculture Advisory Services Project
(NAADS) that was approved in January 2001. A number o f mitigation practices were identified
in the NAADS EA. A Pest Management Plan, consistent with the World Bank safeguards, was
prepared as part o f the EA for NAADS, and it focuses on ensuring sustainable pest management
activities, minimizing health and environmental pesticide risks and strengthened capacity for I P M
and pesticide regulatory control. As part o f NAADS supervision, a pest management specialist
will undertake further evaluation o f the situation in the country including collecting information
on registration,, monitoring and enforcement; site visits to NAADS service providers and
identification o f agrochemicals o f concern and possible solutions for minimizing health risks and
environmental hazards.

14.      Health. A HCW management plan, consistent with World Bank guidelines, was endorsed
by the Health Sector Review in October 2002. The national HCW planning is covered by the
sector strategy.

15.      Water Supply and Sanitation. MoWLE has developed environmental screening checklists
for both design and operations, and they are being incorporated into the revised Planning and
Operation Guidelines for district WSS conditional grants. IDA will continue to review the
guidelines and the checklists. The checklists identify any potential environmental, land tenure,
and resettlement impacts o f proposed activities, and apply to borehole drilling for water supply,
expanding and improving the existing water supply, latrine, other sanitation facilities, and
wastewater treatment.

Public Disclosure

16.      Consultation and Disclosure. In accordance with the requirements o f the revised
disclosure policy, this annex will be disclosed to the public in-country and at the World Bank

which likewise requires public consultation and for environmental impact statement (EIS)
documentsofprojectswith potentialadverse impactsonthe environment.

InstitutionalCapacity Building

17.    Environmental Issues and Mitigation Measures. NEMA has the mandate to coordinate,
monitor and superviseall environmentalactivities. The framework for environmentalassessment
and regulation is based on the National Environment Statute of 1995.             The more recent
EnvironmentalImpact Assessment (EM) Regulations of 1998 define in detail the EIA process,
which requires, as appropriate, environmental impact assessments, environmental impact
statements, and/or environmental audits for all private and public development projects.
Basically, a system o f EIA and monitoringthat identifies adverse environmental impacts is in
place. On physicalculturalproperty, the Ugandan EIA system includes a stipulationto prevent
destruction of cultural heritage, historic sites, and archaeological resource^.^ NEMA undertakes
the EIA oversight function, but leaves implementation to the relevant line ministries and
departments. In addition, NEMA is developing E M capacity in sectoral ministries, line-
departments and at the districtlevelthrough anongoing investmentprojectfinancedby IDA.

18.    Impact Assessment Institutional Capacity Building. The Government's implementing
agencies have embarked on effortsto improve environmentalmanagement for sectors associated
with PRSC3. The Bank will work with its counterparts in the Government to create a viable
framework in identifying and tracking key issues. Through the IDA-supportedEnvironmental
Management Capacity BuildingProjects (EMCBP) Iand 11, IDA has been assisting NEMA to
enhance environment management in lead agencies, districts and communities, in addressing
environmentaldegradationproblemsandsustainableresource management.

Monitoringand Supervision

19.    Monitoring and Supervision. A monitoring plan to review the Government's EM
procedures and other relevant regulatory procedures for sectoral activities in the PRSC3 will be
developed. In the context of annual PRSC preparation, the Bank is undertaking supervision to
assure that the Bank's requirements on environment assessment and resettlement are being
compliedwith, includingappropriateinvolvemento f specialists.

    111. KEY ENVIRONMENT AND RESETTLEMENT ISSUESAND MITIGATION
                                                PLANS

20.    Key Environment and Resettlement Issues of PRSC3. There are direct and indirect
environmental and potential resettlement issues primarily linked to reforms under the
PEAPPRSPPillar I11(Increasingthe Ability o fthe Poor to Raisetheir Incomes)and IV (Directly
Increasingthe Qualityof Life) of PRSC3 While the types of activities in each sector are known,
                                             .
the specific locations and conditions of activities will only be known as the implementing
agenciesexecutetheir budgetplans.

RuralDevelopment-Degradation of Environmentand Natural Resources

21.    Environmental Degradation. PRSC3 addresses issues of environmental degradation by
integratingenvironmentalconcerns in all government programs, particularlyinmodernization of


 NEMA StatuteSupplement, section 50, May 19, 1995


                                                  159

                                                                                                     Annex 6


agriculture (Pillar 111). In Uganda, degradation o f the environment and natural resources (ENR)
sectors is estimated to range from 4 percent to 12 percent o f GDP.4 The agricultural sector alone
i s estimated to be responsible for 86 to 91 percent o f ENR degradation in monetary terms. This
takes the form o f deforestation, loss o f natural habitats, loss o f top soil, uncontrolled growth o f
water hyacinths, pollution o f water bodies, illegal logging, and bush land burning.

22.       Environmental Regulations.           The National Environmental Statute of 1995 (NEMA
Statute) and regulations passed under this statute are the principal safeguards to curb ENR
degradation in Uganda.' The Statute also mandated the National Environmental Management
Authority (NEMA) to coordinate, monitor, and supervise policies/programs on environmental
management. This is done primarily through the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
process. A large-scale agricultural project, such as development o f cash crops (coffee, tea, oil
palm, and sugar cane), which will affect the environment, is required to undertake an EIA. The
Statute also promotes conservation in ecologically sensitive areas, such as lakes, wetlands,
forests, and hillside areas. However, for high altitude crops, such as tea and horticultural crops,
farming the hill sides may be unavoidable. For the ecologically sensitive areas, the following
measures are recommended: use o f appropriate farming methods, curbing o f soil erosion, and
protection o f water catchments. The NEMA Statute prohibits activities that will reclaim and
drain the wetlands; and limits other human activities inthe wetlands. Inthe same manner, it also
prohibits activities that will lead to the destruction o f forest and hillsides areas6

23.       Soil and Water Conservation. On farms, soil and water conservation is a priority.
Agricultural development in Uganda is constrained by weathered soils whose fertility varies
across districts. There are thirteen districts scattered through the Eastern, Central and Western
regions. The districts with high population density--over 300 persons per sq. km-are               those with
good agricultural potential and high rainfall. Consequently, those are at risk o f soil erosion (e.g.,
in the Jinja district and around Lake Victoria). Currently, the traditional farming systems to
restore soil fertility and land productivity do not keep up with the rate o f soil degradation and
populationpressure on land.'

24.       Mitigation and Management of ENR impacts. Mitigation and management o f adverse
impacts on natural resources are mainly the responsibility o f NEMA, MoWLE, and MAAIF. The
research and extension advisory services agencies, NAROand NAADS, support those agencies in
managing adverse environmental impacts o f agricultural sector through research and training.
IDA has funded several capacity building initiatives in Uganda, including current investment
support to NARO and NAADS. The agencies are expected to play important roles with regard to
compliance with environmental, resettlement and other relevant policies inUganda.

RuralDevelopment--Useof Agro-chemicals'

25.       The Pharmacy and Drug Act was enacted in Uganda in 1970, but it was not until 1989
that an Agricultural Chemicals Statue came into effect. The manufacture, storage, distribution,
trade, importation and exportation o f pesticides are controlled by the Agricultural Chemicals

Statute (ACS) Number 8 o f 1989 and by the Statutory Instrument Supplement No. 23 o f the
ACDS Regulations o f 1993. This led to the creation o f the Agricultural Chemicals Board (ACB)
consisting o f 13 membersthat ensure agricultural chemicals are duly registered inthe country and
are used in a manner consistent with the rules made by the state. The Board appoints an
Agricultural Chemicals Technical Committee (ACTC) to advise the Board on technical matters
and both o fthese operations fall under the Ministry o f Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries
(MAAIF).

26.      Importation and distribution o f pesticides and other agricultural inputs used to be
conducted by the Government and its parastatals, but recent privatization initiatives, have seen
the Government remove itself from this role including removal o f subsidies for these products.
Aligned with this process was the removal o f import taxes on agricultural chemicals, which is
thought to have increased the availability o f pesticides to producers. USAID reports suggest that
the number o fpesticide shops and dealers inthe country has remained constant or increased since
this change, suggesting that consumption of pesticides is substantial or growing. This is hard to
quantify and other informed sources indicate that there is relatively low use o f pesticides
throughout the country by small subsistentfarmers.

27.      Registration o f agricultural chemicals, dealers, fumigators and premises is provided
annually in the Uganda Gazette, includingtrade name, common name and firm, and/or propriety.
Although there are good regulations in place, enforcement is variable. Unregisteredpesticides are
still being sold without ACB registration, such as malathion, diazinon, Rogor, and sulfur. There
are cases o f pesticides being repackaged and sold in smaller amounts without proper labels.
Although the regulation requires sales o f pesticides to be in separate buildings, it is rare to find
this followed. Lack of staffhinder enforcement, only one personhandles registrationapplications
and inspection o f pesticide premises for the whole country. The Public Service Commission has
still not approved the request for additional staff and district agricultural officers have been asked
to undertake some o fthese roles.

28.      Other constraints inthe area o f pesticideusage and management include:

         0   Inadequate monitoring, enforcement and policing mechanisms;
         0   Lack o f residue and analytical capacity for purity o f active ingredients, residue on
             foods and toxicological acceptability;
         0   Lack o f registration o f pesticides for specific use on specific crops;
         0   Lack o f adequate public information on registeredpesticides; and
         0   Limited number o fregistered pesticides.

29.      Specific details for the agriculture sector nationally are elusive. Several donors are
actively engaged with targeting specific changes and improvements regarding pesticide policy
and use.

30.      The current process o f providing farmer extension in the majority o f districts, since only
16 districts will be covered at the completion o fNAADS, is difficult to discern, since discussions
with the Commissioner o f Crop Protection, the Department o f Crop Protection in MAAIF and
national experts indicate that there is currently no national level information on application
quantities and changes in farmer practices as a result o f the extensive extension and
demonstration activities that cover a wide spectrum o f farming practices.

31.      Pesticide Management. Measures to mitigate potential adverse impacts o f pesticide use
will be taken through the ongoing National Agriculture Advisory Services Project (NAADS) that


                                                   161

                                                                                                          Annex 6


was approved in January 2001. The goal o f NAADS is to increase security o f rural livelihoods
with sustainable improvements in agricultural productivity and household incomes through
increasing commercialization o f farming.          The project aims to transform the existing public
extension service to a decentralized, largely farmer-owned and private sector advisory service. As
o f early 2003, NAADS was operational in 16 districts, with the process o f expanding its programs
to more districts slower than originally intended.g There is an expectation that the good practice
in crop productionwill eventually expand to most of the country. As a category B project, a EA
for NAADS was preparedinJuly 2000, and a Pest Management Plan in September 2000.

32.       Although agro-chemical use is relatively low in the country, NAADS is facilitating
intensification o f smallholder agricultural production systems, potentially increasing the use o f
fertilizers and other agrochemicals. Mitigation practices identifiedinthe NAADS EA include:
          Training o f input suppliers in precautionary measures required for the handling, labeling
          and application o f agrochemicals under field conditions. These measures will include
          advise on pesticide stock management procedures and record keepingpractices; pesticide
          storage, use o f protective equipment; use and cleaning o f application equipment; and
          emergency plans inresponse to spillage and/or contamination.

     0    Training o f farmers and service providers inuse and handling o f agrochemicals.

     0    Promotion o f reduced input production systems and avoidance o f the use o f pesticides
          whenever practicable by using alternative pest management methods, including best mix
          o f biological or cultural controls."

33.       The NAADS Executive is responsible for environmental monitoring and evaluation by
specifying in the contracts the obligations and environmental mitigation measures to be taken by
the contractor.      Each contractor will be responsible for ensuring that monitoring and record
keeping conform with environmental obligations by presenting written records for inspection to
the NAADS Executive and/or designated alternatives at local government level.

34.       Pest Management Plan. The Pest Management Plan prepared for NAADS focuses on
ensuring sustainable pest management activities, minimizing health and environmental pesticide
risks, and strengtheningcapacity for IntegratedPest Management (IPM) and pesticide regulatory
control. The plan summarizes the current status o f pesticide use inthe country, pest management
approaches for specific crops @e., cotton, vegetables, bananas), I P M experiences, and farmer
training in IPM.        It indicates that information on the use of pesticides is limited, farmer
application o f pesticides might lack proper dosage, mixing procedures are varied and observation
o f safety requirements questionable. However, the National Union o f Plantation and Agricultural
Workers has since then initiated training activities on safe handling o f pesticides.

35.       Pesticide registration came into effect in 1994 and to date 233 chemicals have been
registered following FA0 Code o f Conduct and PIC mechanisms are observed.                            Traders are
registered and licensed while large-scale importers must acquire a certification for handling and
transport and their personnel undergo training for safe pesticide handling. In addition, these
importers must have their facilities meet certain specifications and general safety requirements.
Commercial operators have to be certifiedto ensure safe chemical use.



  Indistricts not coveredby NAADS, donors andagricultural researchcenters are supportingagricultural extensionthat
includesIPM and other sustainable practices.
lo At the end of December 2002, 1,118 farmer groups were registeredand trained, translating to about 44,000 farmers.
At the endofthe project, NAADS is expectedto havereachedabout 400,000 farmers intotal.

36.     Statistics concerning pesticide poisoningare not available, the capacity for analysis of
insitu residues is limited, and there is no systematic monitoringfor residue levels. The capacity
to monitor pesticide use and storage and enforcement o f regulations is also limited. Researchon
IPM is ongoing as part of the strategy inthe agriculture sector to enhance farmer productivity. In
general, there is farmer awareness on holistic management that addresses soil and water
management as well as IPM. This consists of farmer pilot training and extension capacity
buildingincrop ecology.

39.     NAADS Policy and Strategy. The NAADS draft (October 2002) policy and strategy
framework for natural resources cover a wide array o f issues and challenges, including
agrochemical use andEIAs. Key challenges are listedinTable 2 below.

40.      Specific actions that are identified under advisory and information services dealing with
pesticides include:
         Service provider contracts: clauses in contracts which require adherence to NAADS
         principles and guidelines on what natural resources-specific clauses should be included in
         particular contracts (e.g., on use o f agrochemicals, requirements for EMS,environmental
         impacts o f certain enterprises, e.g., floriculture).
         Production of guidelines and criteria: production o f environmental guidelines, checklists
         etc. for service providers, ensuring that guidelines highlight the need to include natural
         resources-related issues and requirements, guidelines and checklists for including natural
         resource issues inplanningand outputs.

41.      PMA Sub-committee on Natural Resources.A PMA sub-committee on natural resource
management has recently been established to ensure that the vision for environmental
sustainability as outlined in the PMA is achieved.             Representatives from agencies and
organizations dealing with P M A issues will review the P M A implementation to ensure that
natural resource use and environmental issues have been adequately addressed. The three focal
areas o f this group are to (i)
                              monitor sustainable natural resource use & management inthe PMA,
(ii)provide technical oversight in environmental and natural resource issues in the
implementation o f P M A priority areas, and (iii)support natural resource sectors to become P M A
compliant. The committee has recently issued a proposal to monitor sustainable natural resource
use and management in the P M A in over a dozen thematic areas. The monitoring work o f this
Sub-committee is based on establishing measurable indicators, and efforts to strengthen the
various implementation frameworks. This sub-committee reports on progress to the P M A
Steering Committee.

42.      PMA Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. The overall PMA monitoring and
evaluation framework is designed to monitor inputs, outputs, and outcomes through performance,
beneficiary, and impact assessment o f the seven P M A components. The current framework does
not include indicators on pesticide use nor management, but includes an output indicator focusing
on   environmental guidelines for sectoral plans and programs that is related to pesticides.
However, a set o f environmental indicators related to integrated natural resource management and
agrochemical use has been further developed by environment and safeguard specialists, and the
plan is to integrate these into the overall P M A M&E framework. The indicators are designed to
provide qualitative information to verify World Bank pesticide safeguards are adhered to and will
also linkto the NAADS supervision activities.

43.       WorldBank Supervision,The NAADS project is still in its early stages o f implementation
and the World Bank Task Manager has reiterated her intention to ensure that the pesticide issues
as identified in the NAADS EA and PMP will be supervised. This will take the form o f using
pesticide specialists to verify, in the field, that proper measures are being undertaken and review
the chemical registrationprocess.

44.      During PRSC4 preparation, the Bank together with the Government will explore and
agree on ways to further strengthen pesticide management and explore incentives for IPM. The
work will focus on pesticide registration, selection, and the overall regulatory framework
governing pesticides. Specific actions that will be undertaken include:

    0    Gathering details concerning Government and donor activities on I P M and pesticide
         management policy, practices and programs throughout the country, focusing on specific
         agro-ecological zones, crop types, and farming practices;

     0    Collecting information on current status on pesticide registration, new registrations, and
          monitoring and enforcement plans;
          Conducting site visits to NAADS service providers to identify measures taken based on
          the NAADS EA and PestManagement Plan; and
          Identification o f agrochemicals o f concern, specific hazards to human health, and
          suggestions to address such problems.

Rural Development--Land Tenure

45.       The Land Act passed in 1998 provides for regularizing land tenure under mailo, freehold
and customary tenure regimes. The Land Sector Strategic Plan prioritizes implementation o f the
Act, and forms the basis for the National Land Policy, capacity building for land administration,
and implementation o f three pilots on land consolidation and land readjustment in Soroti,
Masaka, and Ntungamo. Pilots will provide an opportunity for any land tenant/occupant to go
through a formalized process o f having land "certified" and then if desired "titled".    In general,
land owners, tenants, and sub-tenants (who may or may not have a title-the          land registry has
degraded over the past 20 years) can come to agreement on a settlement where one or another
party can purchase the land rights o f the others. Discussions have continued for the past year on
mechanisms for the Land Fund to provide some o f these financial resources to assist in land
purchase, but the details are still to be worked out.

46.       Under the Land Policy, two kinds o f landadjudication processesmay be undertaken. The
first i s a process that addresses poverty by moving toward security o f tenure under modern
mechanisms that will allow land to be used as security for land improvement finance and other
purposes. It is based on a process for individuals to address matters pertaining to land occupancy
and ownership that is being gradually established at the district levels.         N o resettlement is
expected in the pilot areas, since occupants and tenants will acquire certificates through the
demarcation and adjudication process. If people have occupied land for an extended period, they
will not be requiredto move.

47.       Another process the Land Commission may choose to implement is sorting out historic
claims o f major land areas disputed by various ethnic groups, which may also include lands
administered by districts with residents belonging, by affiliation, to a chief or king. For example,
inKibale district, the Land Commission is currently sorting out land occupancy between several
ethnic/tribal groups, and the Land Fund is being used to provide payments for demarcation and
settlement o f tenants and occupants. Some resettlement may at later point take place in this
region since some people, if inappropriately occupying land, could be required to leave after
adjudication. The Bank will continue its dialogue with appropriate authorities to encourage the
use o f the Land Fundfor settling landtenure issues other than historic ethnic claims.

48.       A NationalPolicy on Resettlement was drafted in 1995, but not passedby the Cabinet or
the Parliament. Further work to bringit into effectiveness rests with the Prime Minister's office.
The Bank currently has no project inthe land sector addressing these matters, but the Government
has asked the Bank to engage in discussions on the resettlement policy. The Bank intends to
continue its discussions with the authorities to move the Resettlement Policy forward. The Bank
in the context of PRSC2 and PRSC3 preparation has communicated to the Ministry and Land
Commission that if individuals are required to move off currently occupied lands or resettle as
part o f the LSSP process, appropriate Resettlement Action Plans or Frameworks will have to be
completed.

RuralDevelopment--DistrictRoadWork

49.     District and Rural Roads. Agricultural marketing inUganda is constrained by the poor
quality of the road network. More than 90 percent of Uganda's road network consists of earth
and gravel roads and 25 percent of the rural roads inthe districts are impassableduring the rainy
season.12 During PRSC3, a program of district and community roads will be begun. This
program will runparallel to and be guided by the principles of outsourcing and the environmental
regulatory frameworks in the long-term Roads Program (APLs 1-4) currently under
implementation in Uganda. In parallel with this national program, the Ministry of Works,
Housing and Communication (MOWHC) has initiated a sectoral Environmental Liaison Unit in
charge of promoting, developing, and disseminating guidance in environmental issues, and the
training of transport staff in particular. This work is consistent with the national mandate that
lead agencies should build up their own environmental regulatory capabilities, to carry out the
work inenvironment that they needto do in liaison with NEMA. Inany case, the vast majority of
the work to be carried out in the PRSC will involve stabilizing and reconstruction of existing
minor roads at the community and district level, with no changes of alignments, widening, or hard
surfacing. Thus, no environmental or land acquisition issues will arise, except for minor drainage
and maintenance works. Appropriate environmental measures are already built in to the district
roads crews standardoperating procedures.

Education--SchoolBuildingConstruction

50.     School Building Construction. No significant environmental impact is expected from
school construction. Minor impacts are associated with physical activities such as construction of
class room, dormitories, latrine and other facilities. The activities are regulated by the
Government in the Public Health Act (sections 72 and 73). Standard requirements for classroom
construction include approved lists of materials, location of latrines with washing facilities and
safe drinking water. The Bank needs to ensure that the Government's standard requirement for
school construction meets the Bank's requirement and policies.

Health--Disposalof HealthCare Waste inHealthUnits,HealthCentersand Hospitals

5 1.    Health Care Waste. Uganda is committed in its policies to ensure that no harm comes to
people from the management of health care wastes (HCW) or from gaps in sanitary facilities at
health care institutions. To date, it is difficult to assess the general status of sanitation and
medical waste at health facilities inUganda because of limited data. Generally there is a need for
significant improvement in both areas. The following are the Ugandan problems in health care
wastes:

       0   Pharmaceutical waste includes drugs and chemicals that are outdated, contaminated,
           spilled or no longer required.

       0   Radioactive waste includes solids, liquids and gaseous radio nuclides generated from
           in vitro analysis of body tissues and fluids, in vivo body imaging and tumor
           localization andtherapeutic procedures.

       0   Anatomic or pathological waste consists of human and animal tissues, organs, body
           parts, fetuses, blood and body fluids.

       0   Sharps comprise needles, syringes, scalpels, blades, broken glass and other puncture
           inducing items.

Water Supply and Sanitation

54.       Water Sector Standards and Guidelines. Currently, all water supply and wastewater
projects will have to meet existing national environmental standards and water sector
 guideline^.'^ In addition, all larger village and urban potable water supply and distribution
systems and wastewater proposals(covering population clusters of above 5,000 people) submitted
to the DWD will undergo a prescribedEIA process that includesthe following information:

    0    Description ofthe project and identification of all phases;

    0    Description ofthe proposedsite and reasons for rejecting alternative sites;

    0    Environmental effects of the project, includingdirect, indirect, cumulative short-term and
         long-term effects and possible alternatives;

    0    Measuresproposedfor eliminating, minimizingor mitigating adverse impacts; and

    0    A monitoringandevaluation program.

55.       Water Supply Regulations. Regulations concerning water supply fall under the Water
Resources Regulations of 1998. They specify particular requirementsfor (i)               any water extraction
by motorized water pump that temporarily or permanently pumps water from a borehole or
waterway and (ii)     weir, dam, tank, or other work capable of diverting or impounding an inflow of
more than 400 cubic meters in any 24-hour period. Furthermore, both drilling and construction
permit requirements include submission of standard application forms.                    Since DWD is the
delegatedNEMA agency, all EM and technical requirementsare managed by DWD, specifically
in the Water Resources Division. Based on these standards, guidelines and current practices, the
EIAprocess inthe sector is characterizedby the features highlighted inTable 4.

56.      Protection of Water Sources, Drinking Water Standards and Sanitary Conditions. There
are several types of small-scale rural water supply schemes in the country: shallow wells,
boreholes, protected natural spring water points and borehole pump and distribution systems.
Most of the environmental considerations for water supply schemes involve avoiding water
contamination.      Measures should be taken to ensure initially good water quality.       During
operation of the system, measures need to be taken to prevent contamination from agricultural
activities, grazing animals, and human contamination. Borehole construction in alluvial areas
with intense sugar cane production is of potential concern because of concentrated pesticide
treatments.      Testing of the water supply should be performed regularly to detect any
contamination to the system, and this should be done in conjunction with periodic chlorine
treatment under certain circumstances. Also, proper training of technicians is critical to ensure
that adequate maintenance occurs for both the single source and network water systems. The
MOWLE has developedenvironmental screeningchecklists for both design and operations which
has been incorporated into the revised Planning and Operation Guidelines for District WSS
Conditional grants. IDA will review the guidelines and the checklists for compatibility with OP
4.01 during Appraisal of PRSC3. These checklists identify any potential environmental, land
tenure, and resettlement impacts of proposed activities. These checklists apply to borehole
drilling for water supply, expanding and improving the existing water supply, latrine, other
sanitation facilities, and wastewatertreatment.

57.      Water Distribution. The PRSC will be used mainly to extend focus on rural water supply
for the poor. DWD and other water delivery programs incorporate standard water quality
analysis to assess potential point water sources. Post-construction water quality monitoring is
also undertaken. Data collection and reporting proceduresare regularly undertaken, yet such data
is not fully utilized. For example, monthly water quality reports for one district showed high
levels of nitrates among numerous spring point sources, yet no one had determined possible
causes. Improved data analysis at the regional and national level as the delivery of potable water
i s expanded will become more important to identify potential environmental and human health
concerns. Other issues including access to drinking water and sanitation services as well as
resettlement requirements for the larger construction schemes will be summarized in a standard
report summary.

PublicDisclosure

58.      Disclosure. PRSC3 has been categorized as a B (without a'separate EA) under OP 4.01.
The requirementsof the Bank's revised disclosure policy for Category B projects apply for those
appraised after January 1, 2002.      The Bank's policy also requires public consultations and
disclosure for activities with potential adverse impacts on the environment in sectors supported
by PRSC that will occur in the future. The requirements include discussions of the project's
potential environmental impact with the project affected groups and local NGOs, and take their
views into ac~ount.'~Similarly, the Government mandates public consultation, stakeholder
involvement, and information disclosure of projects with potential adverse impacts on the
environment through the EIA process. Public consultation with local NGOs and affected people
has been the normal pattern within Bank assisted-projects in Uganda, and non-Bank projects
under NEMA-led EIA procedures, for severalyears. Some stakeholders feel that the consultation
could be improved by a better selection of NGOs, and by following through more proactively on
stakeholder feedback during project implementation.16

59.      Outreach in Water and Sanitation Programs.          Poor communities may have little
opportunityto learn about programs designedto helpthem. Inthe case of a water and sanitation
project, DWD uses mobilizers, staff trained in social work, to undertake community out-reach
programs and conduct community consultations. These staffalso engage insanitationand health
promotional programs. It is common practice now for DWD to assist in organizing water
committees that identify the type of water system they want and are willing to pay for and
procedures for operating and maintainingthe water supply facilities. In numerous cases, access
to water is controlledat public standpipes by an approved operator who is entitledto charge for
water and is also responsible for paying monthly-metered water bills. Restricting hours of
operation, reduction in the number o f faucets and social conflicts regularly occur. Practical
mechanisms to quickly identify such problems and engage in conflict resolutionare required to
ensurethat water is available.

     IV.     INSTITUTIONALCAPACITY BUILDINGFOR IMPACT ASSESSMENT

60.      NEMA'S Mandate. In Uganda, NEMA has the mandate to co-ordinate, monitor and
supervise all environmental activities.NEMA leads an oversight function on EIA but leaves its
implementation to the relevant line ministries and departments. In practice, NEMA is the focal
institutionand the EIA has become a primary tool for safeguardingthe environment from the
adverse impacts of development activities in Uganda. To further the effort, NEMA has
developed EIA guidelines (including public hearing guidelines), code of conduct for EIA
practitioners, regulations for appointing inspectors, and environmentaleasements.From January
1996 to September 2001, a total of 286 projects were subjected to EIA; 314 projects received
certificates; 9 environmental audits were conducted; 15 projects were stopped. Supported by
IDA-fundingthroughthe EMCBP credits, NEMA also buildsEIA capacity in sectoralministries,
departments,andat the districtlevels. NEMA also assists districtsto establishand strengthenthe
statutory management institutions and ensure adequate community inputs into district
environmental planning and management. Since 1996, 41 out of 56 districts have recruited
District Environment Officers (DEOs). Inaddition, NEMA has helpedto recruit 54 environment
inspectors. To enhance NEMA capacity, the Bank approved the Second Environmental
ManagementandCapacityBuildingProject(EMCBP-11)in February2001.

61,      NEMA 's Capacity in Relation to PRSC3. Currently, NEMA is, and has been, largely
donor-funded. This is a risky situation that creates uncertainty about the sustainability of its
programs. At the district level, similarly, resources and fundingto recruit personnel and to make
the DEOs operational are inadequate. This lack of capacity undermines full integration of
environmental concerns at local government and community levels. Several ways to improve
environmental management could be mainstreamed within the framework of PRSC3: (i)
improvingthe effectiveness o f the institutionalarrangements to address environmental concerns
across government programs; (ii)   integratingenvironmental risks and opportunities into districts
and municipal government development plans, and taking steps to implement the management
plans; (iii)implementing sectoral environmental policies (such as pest management, agricultural
chemicals, medical waste, forest conservation, etc.); and (iv) ensuringthat fundingfor NEMA is
reflectedmore in the government budget. At the district and community levels, planning and
decision-makingrequirethe appropriatemeasuresto conservewater, soil, and forests, to keepthe
human environment healthy; and to ensure that more intensive development in rural and urban
areas does not introduce unmanaged dangers of environmental degradation, displacement, or
tenure conflict. Key to supporting these efforts is continually improving human resources in
environmental management through institutional capacity building and training. NEMA, under
IDA-assistedproject, has beenbuildingcapacity withinthe sectoralministriedleadagencies.

                        V.      MONITORING AND SUPERVISION

62.     Environmental and Land AcquisitiodResettlement Monitoring Plan. Monitoringplans
are neededto ensure that adverse environmentalimpacts are addressedand any land acquisition
and resettlement are adequately implementedand sustained in each o f the key sectors which the
PRSC will support. The NEMA statute indicates that "the lead agencies should monitor
compliance and implementation of activities to ensure that the design criteria, mitigation
measures, and monitoring plans are implemented, the monitoringplan should also identify the
key indicators of environmental impacts." A simple and practicalarray of potentialmonitoring
indicators is providedbelow inTable 5.

63.     Relationship of Monitoring Plan to PRSC3 Monitoring.         The monitoring plan for
environment and landacquisitionhesettlementis incorporated into the overallPRSC3 monitoring
plan described in the Credit documentation and overseen by the Ministry of Finance, Planning
and Economic Development (MOFPED).             Consequently, MOFPED will be the ultimate
information focal point. The relevant sector will be responsible for submitting appropriate
information as described below to the PRSC Steering Committee and PRSC Technical
Committee. The PRSC SteeringCommittee will provide a report to IDA on the issues addressed
inthis Annex on an annualbasis. At this point intime, the progress inprovidingthis information
has been less than desirable, and further steps needto be taken to improve this reporting. This
report will be expandedas additionalsectorsare addedto the subsequentannualCredits.

64.     Subsequent PRSCs. In preparing subsequent PRSCs, IDA will include participationof
environmental and resettlement specialists.       These specialists will review progress in
implementing the Environmental MonitoringPlan (EMP). The specialists will coordinate with
other IDA staff in the relevant sectors to ensure that appropriate environmental assessment,
resettlement, and other relevant policy issues are addressed and any consequent management
plans are being implemented. Where additionalcapacity buildingis needed,the PRSC team will
work with the selectedsector agencies to develop such initiatives. The missions will reviewthe
performance of sectoral procedures and progress in increasing awareness o f and appropriate
measuresfor environmentaland other concernsas detailed inthis analysis.

                                                                    Washington, D.C. 2043 1USA



                         The Republic ofUganda: Fund Relations Note


The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review
o f Uganda's economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. As a result, Uganda will be able to draw up to SDR 2 million (about
US$2.8 million) under the arrangement immediately.

The Board also granted waivers for the nonobservance o f the performance criteria pertaining to
the accumulation o f new domestic arrears, the submission to cabinet o f a plan to reduce
government expenditures, and the submission to parliament o f a bill to repeal the National Social
Security Fund Statute.

Uganda's three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on September 13,2002 (see Press Release
No, 02/41) for SDR 13.5 million (about US$19 million). So far, Uganda has drawn SDR 1.5
million (about US$2.1 million).

The PRGF is the IMF's most concessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended that
PRGF-supported programs will in time be based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies
adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development partners and
articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intendedto ensure that PRGF-
supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic,
structural, and social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual
interest rate o f 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5 %-year grace period on
principal payments.

In commenting on the Board's discussion on Uganda, Shigemitsu Sugisaki, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chairman, stated:

"Uganda's continued pursuit o f macroeconomic stability and a comprehensive poverty reduction
strategy has resulted in low inflation and high rates o f economic growth and poverty reduction.
Improved revenue performance has contributed to substantial fiscal adjustment, and the health o f
the financial sector continuesto improve.

Inthe year ahead, the authorities aimto support economic growth and low inflation by containing
the fiscal deficit at around the presentlevel. Giventhe limitedavailability of budgetary resources
and in light o f higher defense spendingto face the security situation innorthernUganda, it will be
critical to meet the budget's revenue target and curb nonpriority spending while increasing
poverty-related expenditures. The effectiveness o f government spending could be enhanced by
strengthening expenditure management systems and streamlining expenditure on public
administration.

Monetary policy will continue to aim at keeping inflation low. A flexible exchange rate policy
will be maintained to help protect Uganda's international competitiveness and absorb potential
terms of trade shocks. Continued vigilant supervision will be necessary to maintain a healthy
financial sector. The recently-approved Financial Institutions Bill and Microfinance Deposit-
Taking Bill will be important in this regard. Reform of the pension system and a broadening of
the non-bank financial sector would help to mobilize substantial domestic resources for
investment.

Efforts to improve the infrastructure, expand financial intermediation, protect property rights and
enforce contracts, and enhance governance are important to improve the investment climate and
encourageprivate sector-led investmentand growth."
